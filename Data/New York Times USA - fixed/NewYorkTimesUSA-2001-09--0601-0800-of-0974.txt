HEADLINE: ASIA; 
Singapore's Line, Debt Free, Is in Relatively Good Shape

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Considered against the dire forecasts and drastic cutbacks announced by airlines in the United States and Europe, the outlook at Singapore Airlines is still relatively good -- which is to say it is merely dismal. 
 The company said today that it would trim back its flight schedule to some destinations to help cope with falling traffic and rising fuel costs, and that it would charge passengers the cost of a $1.25 "war surcharge" being imposed by insurers. No layoffs are planned, though it said it had not ruled them out. 
 In a highly competitive industry plagued with poor service, hostile unions and heavy debts, Singapore Airlines has been the envy of competitors for years. Passengers willingly pay more to be coddled by its sarong-clad flight attendants, stuffing the airline with enough cash to make it one of the world's largest airlines without it having to borrow a nickel. And the airline has a much better reputation for safety than its rivals. 
But after last week's terror attacks, all airlines in Southeast Asia are bracing for the bleakest period for aviation since the Persian Gulf war. The fear of airborne terrorism is discouraging travel, the threat of war is pushing up fuel prices, and this time, the threat of recession has spread across the globe, including Southeast Asia and its main source of travelers, Japan. 
"This is worse than the gulf war," said Jean-Louis Morisot, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs in Singapore. "Before, you had fuel prices rising and the beginning a recession and memories of Lockerbie, but Japan was still going strong. Now you've got all the worries about the global economy."
Singapore Airlines has its vulnerabilities. It counts on routes to North America for 24 percent of its revenue, and advance bookings on flights to New York and Chicago are off 10 percent. Its cargo business, which contributes another 20 percent of revenue, was already feeling the effects of Asia's slump in electronics exports before the disruptions following Sept. 11, and a decline in American consumer demand will amplify the damage, analysts say. 
The strategic challenge for Singapore Airlines has always been that it has no domestic market: the four million people who live here can drive across their tiny country in less than an hour. So it must turn to international routes, carrying people and goods between rivals' home turfs. Efforts to grow overseas have brought it up against unfamiliar problems.
Looking south, Singapore Airlines built up big stakes in Air New Zealand and its Australian unit, Ansett, and shared passengers with the two carriers. But Ansett went bankrupt last week, and Air New Zealand is in rocky financial shape. Political considerations bar Singapore Airlines, majority-owned by the Singapore government, from taking control of either carrier.
Singapore Airlines also owns 49 percent of Virgin Atlantic, the British carrier, which has experienced a steep falloff in traffic and said it would lay off 1,200 of its 9,000 employees as trans-Atlantic traffic dwindles. 
Still, cash-rich, debt-free Singapore Airlines is probably the Asian airline best able to weather tough times. Some analysts say a crisis in the industry will make it easier to persuade other governments to sell it stakes in their beleaguered carriers, overcoming nationalist sentiment that has blocked some deals.
A global slump in traffic will complicate Thailand's plans to sell 13 percent of Thai Airways to the public this year, after it ousted the carrier's board to end bickering that was delaying a restructuring. Thai Airways has been steadily losing international traffic to Singapore Airlines, and now gets only 5 percent of its revenue from routes to the United States; it said on Wednesday that it expected only a slight fall in revenue this year.
Other carriers in Southeast Asia enjoy a modicum of insulation now, because they cut back so sharply after the 1997-98 financial crisis in Asia. Garuda Indonesia, for example, long ago stopped flying to the United States. Philippine Airlines, which was nearly liquidated in 1998 and is still being rehabilitated financially, now concentrates on ferrying Filipino workers overseas or those crossing the Pacific home to visit relatives in the Philippines or the United States.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE TALIBAN; 
Afghans Coaxing bin Laden, But U.S. Rejects Clerics' Bid

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Afghanistan's senior Muslim clerics adjusted their course today, issuing an edict that said Osama bin Laden should be persuaded to leave the country.
 The White House quickly rejected the move, saying it did not "meet American requirements" that Afghanistan immediately hand over the prime suspect in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
 "This is about much more than one man being allowed to leave voluntarily, presumably from one safe haven to another," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. 
The decision by a grand council of nearly 1,000 clerics in Kabul, the Afghan capital, came after days of refusals by the Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, to surrender Mr. bin Laden or end the sanctuary the Taliban have given him and his armed force, Al Qaeda (pronounced al-KYE-dah). But it was not clear where Mullah Omar stood on the decree -- whether he had inspired it, whether he would accept it -- or whether Mr. bin Laden would comply. 
The decree served only to intensify speculation as to what the Taliban are up to, or even whether they have any plan to extricate themselves from the crisis.
In any case, the decree appeared to do nothing to deter the Bush administration from its readiness to use military force if necessary to capture or kill Mr. bin Laden.
The situation was further complicated tonight when Taliban officials at the Afghanistan Embassy here issued a statement quashing suggestions that the clerics' decree might open the way to the handover of Mr. bin Laden.
"We have no intention of surrendering Osama bin Laden to the United States," the statement said. "He is a free man and he can move to any place that he wishes, but we are not going to expel him." 
In the religious decree, or fatwa, issued earlier in the day, the Afghan Islamic clerics left little doubt that they were acting under the pressure of American military threats, and made their own threat, of a worldwide holy war, or jihad, against the United States in response to any American thrust into Afghanistan. 
The clerics said: "To avoid the current tumult, and also to allay future suspicions, the Supreme Council of the Islamic clergy recommends to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to persuade Osama bin Laden to leave Afghanistan whenever possible." To this, they added a conciliatory statement of condolence for the victims of the attacks in the United States. "The ulema," they said, using an Arabic term for Islamic clergy, "voice their sadness over American deaths and hope America does not attack Afghanistan."
This, too, was immediately followed by a harsh warning of retaliation. "If infidels invade an Islamic country and that country does not have the ability to defend itself, it becomes the binding obligation of all the world's Muslims to declare a holy war," the decree said. It also warned that any Muslim cooperation with the "infidels" -- an apparent reference to neighboring Pakistan, among other countries -- was punishable by death.
Protests in major cities in Pakistan continued today against the decision by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, to agree to United States demands for cooperation in the hunt for Mr. bin Laden. Islamic militant groups linked to Mr. bin Laden and some political parties have promised to do everything possible to disrupt any American military venture involving Pakistan. A general strike is planned for Friday. 
All week, reports from Kabul and Kandahar have indicated that the Taliban leaders were engaging in a cat-and-mouse game with the United States, with Mullah Omar saying Mr. bin Laden would never be handed over, then suggesting that he might be under certain conditions. The conditions changed from day to day. It appears clear that there are significant splits within the Taliban movement, although their exact nature is not easy to determine.
One new condition that appeared in the decree today was that President Bush apologize to the world's estimated one billion Muslims for using the word "crusade," derived from the Christian military campaigns that overran Muslims 1,000 years ago, to describe his plans to fight international terrorism. 
The United States has repeatedly refused to negotiate with the Taliban over Mr. bin Laden. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, speaking in Washington, said that "voluntarily, or involuntarily," Mr. bin Laden had to be brought to justice. "The sooner he is brought to justice, the better off the world will be, and the better off the Afghan people will be," he said.
The clerics' decree came less than 12 hours after President Bush ordered heavy bombers and other forces deployed to bases within striking range of Afghanistan.
Islamic specialists and experts on Afghanistan had various interpretations of the latest developments. One was that Mullah Omar, and the wider clergy, wanted to try to rid themselves of responsibility for Mr. bin Laden without explicitly breaking previous assertions that Islamic injunctions would not permit them to endanger their "guest." Perhaps, too, these experts suggested, the Taliban thought that by allowing Mr. bin Laden to slip out of their control, they could escape the full weight of American wrath.
Other views were less complex: that the Taliban leaders were confused, considering that their own harsh form of Islamic rule has eliminated television in the parts of Afghanistan they control, and restricted the state-controlled radio and newspapers to "Islamic" news.
Most simply, some experts felt that Mullah Omar and the clerics were simply playing for time, hoping that a growing tide of reluctance to join in or endorse American military action across the Muslim world might yet get them out of a corner.
Officials in Pakistan, which sent a high-ranking military delegation to Kandahar and Kabul earlier in the week to tell Mullah Omar to surrender Mr. bin Laden or face being toppled from power, said they had left officers behind in case the Taliban had a change of heart.
The Pakistan generals who led the delegation said they hoped realists in the Taliban government in Kabul might prevail over unworldly clerics in Kandahar, where Mullah Omar and other members of the Taliban's supreme council spent much of their time reading the Koran. 
One senior government official in Kabul, Education Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, said after the clerics' meeting that Mullah Omar would follow the "guidance" of the clerics and encourage Mr. bin Laden to leave, but implied that this would not be soon. "It will take time," he said. "You know that Osama bin Laden has a lot of opponents. It can't be that he goes out on the street and catches a taxi to go to another roundabout."
In Islamabad, a Taliban official at the Afghan Embassy said Mr. bin Laden was ready to give himself up, if the United States provided evidence of his involvement in the attacks in the United States. 
Suhail Shaheen, the deputy ambassador, said of Mr. bin Laden: "He said, 'I am not involved in this terrorist action. I am a guest in Afghanistan. But if they have evidence, I am ready for a trial.' " The diplomat added, "We are telling the Americans, if he has violated his commitment, please prove it."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INVESTIGATION; 
Authorities Seek Man In Organizing Of Attacks

BYLINE:  By JAMES RISEN and DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Law enforcement officials are searching for an older man who they suspect may have played an organizing role in the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, senior officials said today.
 The officials offered few details to describe the man but said witnesses in at least two states reported seeing a man with salt-and-pepper hair visit hijacking suspects in the months before the attacks. 
 Investigators are trying to find out whether this man, whose identity is not known, helped coordinate the hijackings of four airplanes on Sept. 11. 
While the clues are sparse, investigators are pursuing this line of inquiry because it follows a pattern seen in previous attacks by Osama bin Laden in which a senior operative arrived on the scene to give instructions to suicide bombers. Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi exile, has been identified as a prime suspect in last week's attacks. 
Officials also said today that the attacks that had caused untold billions of dollars in economic losses cost the plotters as little as $200,000, according to preliminary estimates by law enforcement financial analysts. The money appears to have paid for flight training for some of the 19 hijackers, as well as their housing, air travel, rental cars and other living expenses and also the expenses of possible accomplices. Though a small amount of money, it is larger than amounts believed to have been spent on previous attacks linked to Mr. bin Laden. 
Investigators are comparing the contours of the Sept. 11 hijackings to other operations suspected of being conducted by Mr. bin Laden and are finding similarities and differences. The arrival of a senior leader who directed the final arrangements in the attacks, for example, was seen in both the 1998 bombing of two United States embassies in East Africa and the unsuccessful millennium plots last year. 
In addition to poring over evidence gathered in previous terrorist incidents believed to have been conducted by Al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden's group, officials are searching for clues in major operations that may have been carried out by other terror groups in the last decade. 
Investigators say, for instance, that their $200,000 cost estimate for the operation compares with what officials estimate was $20,000 to $40,000 spent on the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. The 1993 attack was carried out by a group led by Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, and investigators have never found direct evidence of Mr. bin Laden's involvement. But the cost comparison shows the relative scale of the two World Trade Center attacks.
The higher cost of the Sept. 11 attacks means the plotters have left behind a more easily traced financial trail than have suspects in previous incidents. Investigators say they have records from bank accounts, credit and debit cards, hotels and rental car agencies. Investigators expect problems when they try to track those records overseas, particularly into the Middle East. 
Investigators also say they are struck by differences in the professional skills and backgrounds of the Sept. 11 attackers, compared with suspects in earlier incidents. The rank-and-file operatives who carried out the suicide attacks were somewhat older and better educated than earlier Middle East terrorists. Some may have been more Westernized.
A senior government official said today that investigators have found that at least some of the hijackers had visited Las Vegas, where they gambled and attended shows. 
Investigators are also studying possible parallels between the hijackings and an unsuccessful 1995 plot led by Mr. Yousef to blow up commercial United States planes over the Pacific. The hijackers in the 1995 plot carefully analyzed commercial air routes before targeting certain flights for attack, investigators said. The 19 men who carried out the Sept. 11 hijackings, officials said, appeared to have done the same.
A senior government official said investigators were reviewing airline records to see if any hijackers or accomplices flew on the same flights earlier. They are also looking at records of other flights to see if any suspects scouted them, as well.
Investigators say they are still uncertain about the identities of all of the hijackers and believe some may have used false or stolen documentation to enter the United States. The F.B.I. has interviewed neighbors and girlfriends as well as managers of flight-training schools who knew the hijackers, but so far investigators have not found any who say they had any prior knowledge of the plot. 
Investigators say they are also beginning to learn more about how the hijackers operated on the flights on the day of the attacks. The aircraft appear to have reached cruising altitude and were on automatic pilot before the hijackings. 
But investigators say they assume that the hijackers had some flying skills. They have made that assessment in part because navigational skills were required to find the correct headings for the hijackers' targets after the planes had already reached high altitudes. High altitudes make it difficult to calculate a plane's position using visual landmarks on the ground. The hijackers then had to fly the planes in the right direction and into their targets. 
Investigators said the plane that hit the Pentagon first flew west to east over the Pentagon at 5,000 feet, then made a tight right turn, circled back, and crashed into the building. 
Officials say they have been struck by the security that clearly surrounded the operation, which helped prevent intelligence and law enforcement officials from detecting the plot. The F.B.I. has not yet found computer records or other documents left by the hijackers that help explain the plot. They say there are few phone or other communications records showing that the four known hijacking groups communicated with each other. 
The so-called black box recovered from the site of the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 in Pennsylvania reflects the best hope to retrieve information from any of the four flights. Attorney General John Ashcroft and the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, visited the site, in Stony Creek Township, Pa., today. Mr. Mueller said the F.B.I. and the National Transportation Safety Board were transcribing conversations contained on the flight recorder. Investigators now believe that some passengers on that flight fought the hijackers, leading to its crash in a rural area. 
"We recovered the flight data recorder here as well as the voice recorder, and we and the N.T.S.B. are in the process of transcribing and, in certain cases, translating the dialogue, what little dialogue there is on that voice recorder," Mr. Mueller said, suggesting that foreign voices are heard. Mr. Mueller added that he and Mr. Ashcroft believed that the passengers "were absolute heroes, and their actions during this flight were heroic."

B8) Chart: "The Investigation So Far"As the ruling party in Afghanistan urged Osama bin Laden to leave the country, the investigation in the United States yielded the arrest of one of his suspected associates. But it also took a frustrating turn, as the F.B.I. director acknowledged that some of the hijackers might have been using false identities. The Chief Suspect The exact whereabouts of Mr. bin Laden, whom President Bush and other officials have named as the leading suspect in the terrorist attacks, remain unknown. YESTERDAY -- The Taliban urged Mr. bin Laden to leave Afghanistan voluntarily. But Washington dismissed that as insufficient, saying it did not "meet American requirements" that he be handed over immediately. Other Suspects Investigators have named 19 suspected hijackers, some of whom took pilot-training courses in Florida and other states, and have arrested or detained dozens of people suspected of having information about the plot. YESTERDAY -- The F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, acknowledged doubts about the names on the list of hijackers after Saudi officials complained of at least two cases of mistaken identity. Saudi newspapers have reported that some on the list are alive. The F.B.I. said that Nabil al-Marabh, 34, was arrested on Wednesday night at a convenience store in Burbank, Ill. Officials said he once worked for a Boston taxi service where another driver was a bin Laden associate who listed Mr. al-Marabh as an emergency contact. Agents who raided a house in Detroit on Monday in search of Mr. al-Marabh took three men into custody there after finding drawings of an airport. They have been charged with having false immigration papers. Investigators are also following leads in New Jersey. A car dealership in Wayne rented cars to two of the suspects last summer. On a rental application, one of the suspects, Hani Hanjour, who was believed to have been the pilot on the American Airlines jet that crashed into the World Trade Center, said he lived in New York City. Following the Money Despite a six-year investigation into Mr. bin Laden's financial support system, investigators have acknowledged that they failed to penetrate it. YESTERDAY -- Officials estimated that the hijacking plot cost about $200,000. Investigators say they have records from bank accounts and credit and debit cards used by the hijackers, as well as receipts from hotels and rental car agencies, but officials are not sure they can follow the trail overseas.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Is New York City Big Enough for Giuliani and a New Mayor?

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
SUPPOSE one of the mayoral candidates looked into the cameras this weekend and announced:
 "If elected, I will not govern. Not during the first year. This is no time to be changing leaders. The term-limits law may prevent Rudy Giuliani from being reelected, but it doesn't prevent me from letting Rudy be the unofficial mayor during the first year of rebuilding New York City. I promise to delegate all authority to him during 2002. I will not even move into City Hall. I'll wait until January of 2003 to replace Rudy in the mayor's office." 
 It's quite possible that any candidate who said that would be elected the next mayor. So might a candidate who selflessly proposed another stratagem: "If you elect me as mayor and Mr. Giuliani -- through a write-in campaign -- as public advocate, I'll resign right after I'm sworn in, making him my legal successor."
Some have argued that it would be a mistake to give terrorists the satisfaction of interfering in our election process, but it seems unlikely that guerrillas in the mountains of Afghanistan take much interest in our term-limits law. To the extent that they cared about New York politics, they probably wouldn't be satisfied to see a tough law-and-order leader remain in power, especially if he enabled the city to rebuild more quickly.
You might even see Rudy Redux as a blow against terrorism: the one inadvertent gift that the hijackers gave New York. Even before their attack, much of the city was dismayed at the potential successors for Mr. Giuliani. Now these guys look scarier than ever.
Mr. Giuliani, meanwhile, is being hailed as the city's savior. But just because he performed magnificently during the city's worst moments doesn't mean that he's essential for rebuilding the city. New Yorkers' sudden affection for Mr. Giuliani is not entirely rational. 
You could call it post-traumatic infatuation syndrome, a condition that Mr. Giuliani himself can recognize from his study of opera. The textbook case is in "Lucia di Lammermoor," the Donizetti opera set in 17th-century Scotland. 
Lucia, grief-stricken by her mother's recent death, is walking to her mother's grave when a bull charges her. She's rescued by Edgardo, with whom she promptly falls in love. Lucia overlooks his flaws, the chief one being that his family and hers are sworn enemies. The results of her infatuation are not pretty. By the end of the opera, Lucia, Edgardo and a bystander are all dead.
MR. GIULIANI'S flaws are some of the same qualities that make him so attractive in a crisis: confidence, authority, intransigence. A control freak can seem essential when things are out of control, but he can get irritating when life returns to normal.
Mr. Giuliani's model, Fiorello La Guardia, was also convinced that he could run anything better than anyone else, and his arrogance became more destructive the longer he was in office. First elected in 1933, he was hailed as the city's savior during an economic crisis, and then he gradually became more willful and blind to his own mistakes. There were no term limits in his days, enabling him to serve three terms, and the last one gets the lowest marks from historians. 
Mr. Giuliani has shown some of the same tendencies during his mayoralty, and the current adulation is likely to make him even more sure of himself. He would also have more authority than ever, thanks to the new powers being given to speed the rebuilding. That could be a dangerous combination.
Still, no matter how much you fear a newly empowered Giuliani, you have to compare him with the alternatives: conventional clubhouse politicians suddenly asked to deal with an unprecedented situation. They seemed timid and outdated even before the attack. The business executives now contemplating an exodus from New York cannot be reassured by the Democrats who were promising to raise taxes even before the expense of rebuilding downtown. 
Mr. Giuliani would help keep businesses in town, and he might keep down the costs of rebuilding since he's not beholden to the traditional political establishment. With his zeal for fighting, he might take on some of the special interests anxious to turn the downtown reconstruction into the biggest pork-barrel project in the city's history. 
The next mayor could appoint Mr. Giuliani simply to direct the reconstruction of downtown. There's no one better suited to manage the project or battle the city's bureaucratic obstacles, and there's no one whose presence would be so reassuring to the public.
But what politician would be brave enough to share power with him? New York is not big enough for two mayors. When Mr. Giuliani is involved, it's barely big enough for one.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: TEHRAN; 
Iran Softens Tone Against the United States

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Iran is not normally given to sympathizing with the United States, but last week's terror attacks have drawn rare public condolences and a pledge to join an international effort to root out terrorism.
 Both the reformist camp around President Mohammad Khatami and the more conservative clerics behind the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have softened their tone toward the United States while warning against Western overreaction. 
 Last week, for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution, there were no chants of "death to America" at weekly Friday prayers around the country, which are controlled by the conservatives.
In a telephone conversation today with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain -- the second in two days, and just before Mr. Blair traveled to the United States -- President Khatami stressed that regional concerns and realities must be understood. 
"A tragedy must not be answered with another tragedy and innocent people in Afghanistan, or any other place, must not be attacked or hurt," Iranian news media quoted Mr. Khatami as telling Mr. Blair. According to Iranian news media, the British prime minister wrote to Mr. Khatami earlier this week seeking Iran's cooperation in preventing a clash between the West and the Muslim world. 
 The United States has sent Iran a message responding to what officials viewed as Tehran's "positive statements" since last week's attacks, American officials quoted by Reuters news agency said. 
The United States and Iran severed relations in 1979 when Iranians took American diplomats hostage in their embassy in Tehran. Britain resumed full diplomatic ties in 1998.
On Tuesday, Ayatollah Khamenei, in his first public remarks on last week's attacks, markedly failed to brand the United States an enemy.
"Islam condemns the massacre of defenseless people, whether Muslim or Christian or others, anywhere and by any means," he said, adding pointedly: "And so Iran condemns any attack on Afghanistan that may lead to another human tragedy."
Despite the bitter enmity Iran's Islamic rulers feel for the Taliban mullahs who rule Afghanistan, there is no question of volunteering territory or facilities to the United States for an attack, said Hamidreza Assefi, spokesman of the foreign ministry.
"We are worried about and are against a military strike," Mr. Assefi said. "It will cause instability in the region, and more refugees come toward our borders."
Iran almost went to war with Afghanistan three years ago after the Taliban killed 10 Iranian diplomats and a journalist when fighters seized the Iranian consulate in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif. Iran sent extra troops to the border but did not invade and is still waiting for the Taliban to meet its demands to hand over those suspected of killing the Iranians.
Now, increasing numbers of refugees pouring out of Afghanistan, which is parched by drought and has experienced 22 years of war, have strained the economy of a country which already faces high unemployment and the restiveness of an overwhelmingly young population. 
Iran has 1.4 million Afghan refugees, most of them in the far east of the country, and announced last Friday -- three days after the terror attacks on the United States and talk of retaliation against the Taliban who harbor Osama bin Laden -- that it was sealing its 560-mile border. Particularly in southern areas, however, that border is hard to control.
On Tuesday, more than than 3,000 mostly young people held a candlelight vigil in Tehran for the victims of the terror attacks, closely watched by security forces.
One reformist member of Parliament, Ahmad Borghani, even went to the United States interest section at the Swiss Embassy on Tuesday with a wreath of white flowers to sign the memorial book in sympathy with the family's of the victims. 
"This tragedy has brought the two countries closer," he said. "But the United States must not expect Iran to cooperate in a military attack -- considering our past relations."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: AVIATION; 
U.S. Identified Some Elements Of Hijack Plot In Advance

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said today that his department knew elements of the threat to aviation before last week's terrorist attacks but could not have pieced them together to avert the plot. 
 In his first appearance before Congress since hijackers seized four jetliners and used them to kill more than 5,000 people, Mr. Mineta did not elaborate on what officials knew in advance, but he said that no one under his jurisdiction was at fault. 
 Members of the House and Senate agreed and warmly praised Mr. Minetta, who had served in the House from California for 21 years. They did not press him to elaborate and seemed more prone to blame the intelligence agencies for any responsibility the government must bear. 
And they seemed most interested in getting the flying public back in the air, urging Mr. Mineta and his deputy, Jane Garvey, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, to reopen Ronald Reagan National Airport, across the Potomac from Washington, the only major airport in the country still closed. 
Mr. Mineta said that since the attack, officials had studied "whether or not there was a matrix we could build," but that in hindsight, he did not see how they could have discovered the hijackings before they occurred. Ms. Garvey said the whole security system was geared for explosives, not knives. 
The attack, she said, had "changed the way we think, and challenged every assumption," because before that day, no one had successfully seized a commercial jet as a weapon. (The closest anyone came was a disgruntled FedEx employee riding in a FedEx cargo plane's cockpit who attacked the pilots with a hammer in 1994 and intended to crash the plane, but was thwarted.)
Despite extensive testimony from the Transportation Department's inspector general and a specialist from the General Accounting Office about a long history of failings in security -- all of them documented over the years in reports to Congress -- lawmakers said the nation was vulnerable because of lapses by intelligence agencies, whose representatives were not at the hearing.
"We could not expect an $8-an-hour security screener to foil an attack that a multibillion-dollar intelligence system could not prevent," said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. 
Mr. Mineta and Ms. Garvey testified before the Senate Commerce Committee and then in an unusual joint meeting of the House and Senate Transportation Appropriations Committees.
Each panel seemed most interested in returning aviation to normal levels of patronage. The number of commercial planes flying is nearly 80 percent of normal, but passenger loads are off by more than half.
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said, "We are not going to get back on our feet unless people get back on the planes."
Mr. Mineta said he and Ms. Garvey were considering a "whistle-stop tour" by plane, holding news conferences at the airports to urge people to return to the skies. 
When the two officials came under pressure to reopen Ronald Reagan National Airport, Mr. Mineta said that decision was not in his hands. 
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina and chairman of the Commerce Committee, noted that the airport's closing was a particular problem for US Airways, which has a hub there and was in economic trouble before the hijackings. He then said, "While I'm palavering and dillying, I'm putting them out of business." 
Mr. Mineta answered, "It's in the hands of the National Security Council and the Secret Service."
Senator Hollings retorted: "If it's in the Secret Service's hands, it'll never get open." 
Mr. Mineta said those agencies wanted planes to approach the airport only from the south, and leave in that direction, too, so they would not fly over the Pentagon. That would mean the airport could operate only when there was hardly any wind, he said.
Another point of debate was over whether the federal government should take over operation of the 700 passenger screening checkpoints around the country. Mr. Mineta said that would require 28,000 people and an annual budget of around $1.8 billion; he said that the government would have to assure that a better job was done, but he said that the White House had not concluded that the government should do it.
Members of Congress also called for improvements in cockpit doors and other safety measures on planes, but got disappointing responses from expert witnesses. Capt. Duane Woerth, president of the Air Line Pilots Association and a member of a task force on cockpit security appointed by Mr. Mineta, was asked about arming cockpit crews and replied, "We can't be Sky King and Wyatt Earp at the same time."
"If we're already to the point that the bad guy is on the airplane, we've failed most of the systems to that point," Mr. Woerth said, calling for armed air marshals instead.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE AIRLINES; 
Rescue Plan Advances; House to Act Today

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
The House expects to move ahead on Friday with a financial relief package for the nation's airlines that would give them $5 billion in cash and $10 billion in loan guarantees, Congressional leaders said tonight.
 President Bush also plans to direct $3 billion of the $40 billion that Congress appropriated last week for emergency efforts to bolster security in airports and on planes. The money would help airlines secure their plane cockpits and pay for marshals to ride along with passengers. 
 Lawmakers in the House were working with the White House and Senate leaders to complete the aid package, and early Friday they agreed on a package, The Associated Press reported. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, who negotiated over the details, said the Bush administration was satisfied with the outcome. 
The lawmakers had said they hoped to provide American Airlines and United Airlines protection from liability for damages and deaths on the ground during last week's terrorist attacks. The legislation is also expected to quickly compensate victims -- in part, perhaps, with additional government money, House leadership aides said.
The administration has questioned the need for the loan guarantees favored by House leaders. Late tonight, the White House sent Congress a proposal that would give the airlines $5 billion in cash and significant protection from liability. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said at a hearing that the administration wanted to carefully aim support for business in the wake of the terrorist attacks.
The prospect of thousands of lawsuits brought by relatives of those who died on the ground in the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon has panicked insurers and frightened off lenders, airline executives say. Connecting carriers that took passengers to Logan airport in Boston, Newark International Airport and Dulles International Airport -- the three places from which the hijacked planes took off -- could also be liable, lawmakers said.
"There is a need to have really functioning lines of credit," said Representative Dick Armey, the majority leader, making the case for loan guarantees. "It reduces the sense of risk and uncertainty for those people who provide capital."
Since the attacks, airlines and the Boeing Company, the leading aircraft builder, have announced layoffs of almost 100,000, and industry officials have said that at least three carriers might face bankruptcy if the help was not forthcoming. 
In addition to deep cuts in flight schedules, airlines are reducing amenities to cut costs. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, and TWA, announced today that it would eliminate meal service for passengers on most domestic flights beginning Nov. 1. The only exceptions will be for passengers on nonstop transcontinental flights and first-class passengers on flights longer than two hours.
The industry's frailty has made investors increasingly jittery, with some airline stocks shedding as much as 65 percent of their value this week. Recognizing the vital role air transportation plays in the economy, lawmakers say they want to help airlines stay afloat, without turning the assistance into a bailout that goes beyond the scope of last week's disaster.
Liability is an especially thorny question for the airlines, because New York has liberal blame-laying laws that they want the federal government to pre-empt.
"New York State has a much more broad interpretation of contingent liability than anyplace else," said Representative Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican who is spearheading the legislation.
The White House proposal would have the government pay any costs imposed on the airlines that exceed their insurance coverage, an idea that was hotly debated here. No one seemed to know how high those costs could mount. Democrats want to give the relatives of victims a choice between suing or receiving a government check. 
The White House also proposed extending to domestic flights, for 180 days, an existing government program that insures international flights during wartime. Private insurers have moved to raise the industry's insurance premiums by $1 billion. Other ideas under discussion include barring punitive damages in court, consolidating all the cases and funneling them to federal court in New York and limiting lawyer fees to 10 percent of the amount recovered.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ECONOMY; 
Greenspan Hits Cautious Note On Relief Steps

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Saying it is "far more important to be right than quick," Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, urged Congress today to wait a week or two before deciding whether to bolster the economy through further tax cuts and additional government spending.
 Testifying alongside the Fed chairman before the Senate Banking Committee, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill delivered a similar "go slow" message, suggesting that the Bush administration would not be sympathetic to pleas for help from industries other than airlines. 
 In his first public statement on Capitol Hill since the terrorist attacks last week, Mr. Greenspan said Congress and the Bush administration should take some time to assess how much damage the economy had sustained and how long it would last. 
With Congress poised to allocate all or most of the budget surplus for the next year or two to the fight against terrorism, to reconstruction and relief programs, and to an economic stimulus, Mr. Greenspan also warned against abandoning fiscal discipline. Pumping money into the economy in an effort to ignite a turnaround and help specific industries, he said, could backfire by putting upward pressure on interest rates and darken the economy's long-term prospects.
"We know that there is a combination of infrastructure problems and technical and physical breakdowns that have occurred," Mr. Greenspan said. "Until we can see what the economy looks like without them, appropriate policy measures, in my judgment, are premature."
But members of the committee made clear that they are under pressure from constituents to provide some economic help to deal with the effects of the attacks, including announcements of large-scale layoffs. In addition to the airline industry, they said, insurers, small businesses, the auto industry and even taxi services are suffering.
Mr. O'Neill expressed sympathy with businesses that are being squeezed and workers who are losing jobs, and he said the administration would move quickly to provide financial help to the airlines. But he indicated that the administration would resist pressure to start writing checks to every industry that found itself in trouble.
Instead, he said, the best approach was to get the airline industry stabilized, a step that he said would help many other sectors of the economy. If necessary, he said, the government could address consumer, investor and business confidence through some type of a broadly aimed fiscal stimulus plan.
The government, he said, should "make sure we're not treating secondary or tertiary consequences, but we're fixing the hole in the system that will make everything else work."
Responding to concern from Democrats that the administration and Republicans in Congress might use the crisis to push through politically controversial proposals like a cut in the capital gains tax, Mr. O'Neill said the White House would resist adopting "off-the-shelf political things that have been paraded around."
Mr. O'Neill said that when it came to tax cuts, he had not decided on any particular approach and that the administration was looking at all options. 
But he said that consumers seemed to be in good shape and that the underlying economic challenge was one of helping to increase the market valuation of companies by helping them increase their free cash flows -- money that does not have to go to debt repayment, operating expenses or taxes.
The solution, he said, might be "to reduce the pressure that companies have from paying taxes," an apparent reference to his longstanding call for reducing or eliminating corporate income taxes.
Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said at the hearing that his agency would propose making it easier for small businesses to raise money in the markets by streamlining paperwork requirements. 
Rushing in the days after the terrorist attacks, Congress pushed through a $40 billion emergency spending package and began considering additional proposals to bolster the economy. Among them were cutting the capital gains tax, cutting taxes in a way that would benefit low-income people who did not qualify for this summer's rebate checks, expanding the unemployment insurance program and spending heavily on reconstruction programs.
But with Mr. Greenspan cautioning against moving too quickly, Congress and the administration have put the issue on hold for a week or two, despite the falling stock market and the rising toll of layoffs.
"I think the better judgment is to not move right now, to give it a few weeks to get better information on exactly what is happening," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic minority leader in the House. "I don't know what it will include. There's no way to do that today."
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said the United States should press ahead with a new round of talks on dropping trade barriers around the world, a step that he said "would not only significantly enhance world economic growth but also answer terrorism with a firm reaffirmation of our commitment to open and free societies."
The economy all but stalled during the spring, and economists have been marking down their forecasts for the second half of the year in the wake of the attacks. A survey released today by Blue Chip Economic Indicators found that most economists believe that the nation has entered a recession, which is generally defined as two consecutive quarters in which total economic output declines.
But both Mr. Greenspan and Mr. O'Neill struck an upbeat tone today.
Mr. Greenspan said that before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the economy had been showing signs of emerging from its yearlong slowdown. The attacks, he said, would no doubt "have significant effects on the U.S. economy over the short term."
But the Fed chairman said the economy had become "increasingly resilient to shocks," in part because of deregulation and advances in technology. In the long run, he said, the prospects remained undiminished for faster growth in productivity -- the critical component in determining the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth.
One risk to the outlook, Mr. Greenspan said, would be if long-term interest rates shot up in response to concern among bond market investors that the government would not be able to pay down the national debt.
Among other things, he said, the economy has benefited this year from the ability of homeowners to refinance their mortgages at lower rates, allowing them in many cases to take equity out of their homes in cash to use for other purposes. In that way, he said, low mortgage rates have helped offset the squeeze on household finances from falling stock prices.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Most Important Speech 

 BODY:
President Bush summoned a shaken but determined nation last night to wage a global struggle against terrorism. In a firm and forceful address, Mr. Bush rose to the challenge of making what may be the most critical speech of his life. Urging the American people to be both brave and patient, the president rallied Congress, the nation and its allies abroad to what promises to be a long and painful fight against a ruthless enemy.
 Ever since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the world has been waiting for Mr. Bush to make a formal declaration that defined the battle he expects to fight. The president did that with a tone that was both wise and inclusive. Pointing out that citizens of 80 other countries had died with the American victims of the World Trade Center assault, Mr. Bush emphasized that neither Muslims nor Islamic nations were the enemy, and underlined his respect for their religion. He also noted that America respects the people of Afghanistan. 
 But Mr. Bush's demands of Afghanistan's Taliban government were expansive. The Taliban must not only turn over Osama bin Laden, he said, but must shut down all terrorist training camps and allow American inspections to make sure they have been closed. These demands are almost certainly not going to be met, and the president vowed that the "hour is coming when America will act." 
There were few details about what sort of actions Mr. Bush had in mind. The reluctance to lay out a plan was understandable. The administration has only begun to grapple with the complexities of a campaign to defeat terrorism, and there is disagreement among Mr. Bush's advisers over how quickly and against whom to move.
His most specific announcement was the designation of Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania to oversee what has become known as homeland defense -- the beefing up of security for American transportation and other infrastructure against future terrorist attacks. The president also promised to ensure air safety, keep the foundering airline corporations solvent and improve the nation's intelligence capabilities. Although he vowed to strengthen the economy, the lack of emphasis on that issue may have reflected a desire to go slow on any sweeping economic stimulus package.
After paying tribute to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki, Mr. Bush vowed that the nation would "rebuild New York City." It was a heartening moment for New Yorkers, for whom Mr. Bush's speech was a wrenching reminder of the pain and loss of the last 10 days.
Presidents in moments of national peril always confidently predict triumph, and Mr. Bush promised that all the terrorist organizations would be "found, stopped and defeated." But the country, while determined, is also understandably wary and realistic about achieving a victory over an enemy that is so diffuse and difficult to locate. As Mr. Bush noted, this war will not resemble the quick and easy triumph of the gulf war or the virtually casualty-free American combat operations in the Balkans. The country learned in Vietnam about the limits of a superpower's ability to wage war against guerrilla troops in distant lands.
But Mr. Bush accomplished everything he needed to do last night. He was as strong and forthright as the nation could have wished, while also maintaining a calm that must have reassured other nations that the United States will be prudent as well as brave. The next test of his leadership will be when pledges of action are translated into what President John F. Kennedy once called "a long twilight struggle" against a dangerous, unremitting foe.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE TALLY; 
Giuliani Reports Sharp Increase in the Number of Those Listed as Missing

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The number of people listed as missing in the World Trade Center attack rose starkly yesterday, with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announcing a total of 6,333 from 5,422 and citing the number of injured, both from the attacks and the rescue efforts this week, as 6,291.
 The mayor said the sharp increase in missing people was largely because of the delayed reporting of more than 60 nations, particularly Britain, whose citizens account for at least 250 of those missing. A prayer service was held yesterday at St. Thomas Episcopal Church on Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street for British citizens, and was attended by the British prime minister, Tony Blair. "The bonds between our two countries, so strong for so long, are even stronger today," he said. 
 The mayor also led a large delegation of United States senators to view the site where terrorists wreaked havoc on Lower Manhattan.
The tour by legislators was one in a series encouraged by Mayor Giuliani, who along with the governor and senators from New York State, are eager to impress upon lawmakers that a recovery effort will be costly and that the attack was focused on the nation as a whole, which therefore ought to help pay for its cleanup.
"The mayor said it so well," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader. "It is one thing to see it on television, to hear about it on the radio and watch it as we have from day to day. It's another thing altogether to be here, to experience the loss."
Senator Daschle was joined by 39 other senators and their staff members, who came with the mayor by boat from Midtown to the North Cove Marina, and made their way down Liberty Street to what is known as ground zero.
The first thing that hit them, inevitably, was the smell. Then, there was the creeping smoke that still emanated from the site and curled toward the Hudson River. The group of lawmakers, many in pink rain ponchos and hard hats, approached the fallen buildings in silence, which was broken only by the sounds of heavy equipment groaning under the weight of steel and glass. A giant crane gingerly removed metal beams from the scene, lest there were bodies beneath them.
The facade of the south tower stood at an angle toward the sky, like a giant broken picket fence rising from the ground. The side of 90 West Street looks as though it were roasted over a direct flame. In a heap of steaming rubble, someone stuck a tiny American flag, which waved in a cloud of gray debris.
After their brief tour, the senators went back to the mayor's command center for a news conference in which they reiterated their support for the $20 billion that the lawmakers and the president have already promised New York to clean up.
"I want to thank Mayor Giuliani for the suggestion that we have a delegation of senators come here," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican minority leader. "We are here to commit to the people of New York City and New York, regardless of the region of the country that we come from -- and the entire country is represented here by this delegation -- that we will stand with you." 
The site visit was the fifth official one held personally by the mayor, who has also made many other visits with his staff. Several members of Congress and President Bush have come to the site, and President Jacques Chirac of France has viewed the area by air. These pilgrimages present a logistical nightmare: extra security must be added, many V.I.P.'s bring more staff members than they are officially allowed and work inevitably slows as workers wander over to shake legislators' hands or listen to their remarks.
Last night, the mayor and Gov. George E. Pataki left for Washington to brief the president on the situation in the state.
Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik said yesterday that he was watching for emotional strains on his department, and that police commanders had been told to watch for psychological and emotional issues facing their units and to make counselors available. 
"In this circumstance, just to get them to get off the line is an issue," Mr. Kerik said. "They stand out there for 12 hours on duty, and when it's time to go off duty they want to stand out there on the volunteer line." Responding to rumors that Sept. 22 has been suggested as a day of terror, he said there had been no specific threat relating to another terrorist attack on New York.
Also yesterday, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said the city would move $800 million in pension funds from bonds into equity index funds, to help support the national and local economy. Roughly $500 million comes from one fund, the New York City Employees' Retirement System.
In a speech at the Foreign Policy Association at the Pierre Hotel, former President Bill Clinton warned that the United States should act swiftly to root out terrorism and improve security, while continuing to help the world's poorest nations. "We must continue to demonstrate to the world's poor, in all the developing nations, that America is not their enemy," he said.
Mr. Giuliani also firmed up plans for the prayer service on Sunday, which will take place at 2:30 p.m. at Yankee Stadium. The service will be broadcast live via satellite to screens in the ball parks in Coney Island and Staten Island. The mayor announced today that the service would also be broadcast in a ball park in Newark. Tickets will be free, with priority going to victims' family members. 
After touring the World Trade Center site, New Jersey's two United States senators took 24 of their colleagues across the river to Liberty State Park to remind them how brutally the losses extended to the other side of the Hudson. State officials said that 434 New Jerseyans had been reported missing as of 9 yesterday morning, but that they believed as many as 2,000 or more of the missing would turn out to have been New Jersey residents.
"We were two states with one economy and, in many ways, one set of lives," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, who conducted the briefing along with Senator Jon S. Corzine, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco and the mayors of Jersey City, Newark, Bayonne and Elizabeth. "There is not a community in northern New Jersey that has not lost somebody. Everybody has been impacted."

HEADLINE: Militant Islam Unsettles Indonesia And Its Region 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Southeast Asia knows what havoc militant Islam can create. With mass kidnappings in the Philippines, "holy warriors" in Indonesia and armed cells in Malaysia, governments have learned they can never relax. 
 With the terrorist attacks in the United States, some Western diplomats are expressing heightened fears that these groups may be cooperating and may be receiving increased support from militants in the Middle East. 
 None of the Southeast Asian nations seem to be at risk of a militant Islamic takeover any time soon. But the economic slump of the past four years and the ensuing political instability have created fertile ground for recruitment, infiltration and indoctrination by outside groups. 
"There is a small group of trained jihad warriors that have moved in and out of these areas," said Carlyle Thayer, a Honolulu-based expert on Asian security. "Whether they are masterminding command and control is still being debated."
The extent and nature of any terror network is hard to assess. But there is a spreading fear that an American retaliation for the attacks last week in New York and Washington would ignite a stepped-up and possibly coordinated activity aimed at American interests in Asia. 
In Indonesia, experts and diplomats say, there is reported involvement by Osama bin Laden, who has been blamed by the United States for last week's terror. An American diplomat said this week that Mr. bin Laden was tied to a serious security threat that caused the embassy in Jakarta to close for several days last fall. The embassy remains on alert. 
Last week, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines said "some traces of relationship" exist between Islamic separatist fighters in the southern Philippines and the perpetrators of the attacks in the United States. 
The countries most concerned are Indonesia, a nation with 210 million people; the Philippines, with an intractable separatist insurgency in its partly Muslim southern islands, and Malaysia, where radical Muslim groups are taking advantage of a time of political flux. 
Worries also exist in Thailand, which has a small but persistent separatist movement on its southern border with Malaysia, and in Singapore where ethnic Chinese make up the main part of the population of the city-state, which is surrounded by Muslim neighbors. 
Some experts said there is little question that these separate movements have been in contact with each other and that several are being tutored by Middle Eastern groups. Several leaders in the insurgencies share a background as fighters in Afghanistan, these experts said. 
Most worrisome to diplomats and security experts is Indonesia, where poverty has spawned widespread discontent, new political openness has given latitude to extremist groups and disarray in the security forces has weakened law enforcement. 
In the oil-rich province of Aceh, warring separatists seek to create a strict Islamic state. In the Moluccas, a radical Islamic army called Laskar Jihad has recruited openly and joined in a Moslem-Christian war that has taken thousands of lives in the past three years.
"The head of that organization, I think he's Yemeni, fought in Afghanistan and was trained in Yemen by an offshoot of the bin Laden group," a Western diplomat said. "He has knowingly brought in hundreds of foreign mujahedeen, hundreds of them, to the Moluccas." 
Harold Crouch, an expert on the Indonesian military with the International Crisis Group, questioned reports like this, asking why no Arabs had been found among the dead in the Moluccas. 
Other hints of outside involvement in Indonesia include a mysterious bombing that wounded the Philippine ambassador at his residence in Jakarta last August may have been carried out by terrorists from Malaysia or the Philippines, said one expert.
Among several other unexplained bombings last year is a grenade attack, also in August, on the Malaysian Embassy that caused no injuries. 
Last December, a series of bombings in both the Philippines and Indonesia took several lives and could have been related, the expert said.
In the Philippines a centuries-old Muslim separatist war on the southern island of Mindanao has flared in the past two years.
The government is now engaged in peace talks with the main separatist group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. But a splinter group called Abu Sayyaf has committed a series of kidnappings, including those of dozens of foreigners, and continues to evade military offensives. 
In a recent raid, two Indonesian passports were found in an abandoned Abu Sayyaf camp. But the extent of cooperation between these and other groups remains unknown.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED; 
President Bush's Address on Terrorism Before a Joint Meeting of Congress

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's address to Congress last night, as recorded by The New York Times:
 Mr. Speaker, Mr. President pro tem, members of Congress and fellow Americans: 
 In the normal course of events, presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already been delivered by the American people. 
We have seen it in the courage of passengers who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground. Passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer. And would you please help me welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight. 
We have seen the state of our union in the endurance of rescuers working past exhaustion. We've seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers in English, Hebrew and Arabic. We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own. 
My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of our union, and it is strong. 
Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. 
I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats joined together on the steps of this Capitol singing "God Bless America." And you did more than sing. You acted by delivering $40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our military. 
Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle and Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship, for your leadership and for your service to our country. 
And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its outpouring of support. America will never forget the sounds of our national anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris and at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo. We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America. 
Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own: dozens of Pakistanis, more than 130 Israelis, more than 250 citizens of India, men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and Japan, and hundreds of British citizens.
America has no truer friend than Great Britain. 
Once again we are joined together in a great cause. I'm so honored the British prime minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity with America. Thank you for coming, friend.
On Sept. 11, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country. Americans have known wars. But for the past 136 years they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known the casualties of war. But not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning. Americans have known surprise attacks. But never before on thousands of civilians. All of this was brought upon us in a single day. And night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack.
Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking, "Who attacked our country?"
The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as Al Qaeda. They are some of the murderers indicted for bombing American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for bombing the U.S.S. Cole. 
Al Qaeda is to terror what the Mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making money; its goal is remaking the world and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere.
The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics. A fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teaching of Islam. The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans and make no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children. This group and its leader, a person named Osama bin Laden, are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. 
There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries. They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction. The leadership of Al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country. 
In Afghanistan we see Al Qaeda's vision for the world. Afghanistan's people have been brutalized. Many are starving and many have fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can be jailed for owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough. 
The United States respects the people of Afghanistan. After all, we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid. But we condemn the Taliban regime. It is not only repressing its own people; it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and abetting murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder. 
And tonight the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban:
*Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of Al Qaeda who hide in your land. 
*Release all foreign nationals, including American citizens, you have unjustly imprisoned. 
*Protect foreign journalists, diplomats and aid workers in your country.
*Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and hand over every terrorist and every person in their support structure to appropriate authorities. 
*Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps so we can make sure they are no longer operating.
These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists or they will share in their fate.
I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world. We respect your faith. It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans and by millions more in countries that America counts as friends. Its teachings are good and peaceful. And those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying in effect to hijack Islam itself.
The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends. It is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.
Our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.
Americans are asking, "Why do they hate us?"
They hate what they see right here in this chamber, a democratically elected government. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedoms, our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other. They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East. They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa. 
These terrorists kill not merely to end lives but to disrupt and end a way of life. With every atrocity they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our friends. They stand against us because we stand in their way. We're not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before. They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions, by abandoning every value except the will to power, they follow in the path of fascism, Nazism and totalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way to where it ends: in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies.
Americans are asking, "How will we fight and win this war?"
We will direct every resource at our command -- every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence and every necessary weapon of war -- to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network. 
Now, this war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with the decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion. It will not look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat. 
Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. 
Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen. It may include dramatic strikes visible on TV and covert operations, secret even in success. 
We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place until there is no refuge or no rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. 
Every nation in every region now has a decision to make. Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists. 
From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime. 
Our nation has been put on notice: We're not immune from attack. 
We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans. Today dozens of federal departments and agencies as well as state and local governments have responsibilities affecting homeland security. These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level.
So tonight I announce the creation of a cabinet-level position reporting directly to me, the Office of Homeland Security. 
And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort to strengthen American security, a military veteran, an effective governor, a true patriot, a trusted friend: Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge. 
He will lead, oversee and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and respond to any attacks that may come. 
These measures are essential. The only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it and destroy it where it grows. 
Many will be involved in this effort, from F.B.I. agents to intelligence operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks and all have our prayers. 
And tonight a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a message for our military: be ready. I've called the armed forces to alert and there is a reason. The hour is coming when America will act and you will make us proud. 
This is not, however, just America's fight. And what is at stake is not just America's freedom. This is the world's fight, this is civilization's fight, this is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom. 
We ask every nation to join us. We will ask and we will need the help of police forces, intelligence service and banking systems around the world. 
The United States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded with sympathy and with support. Nations from Latin America to Asia to Africa to Europe to the Islamic world. 
Perhaps the NATO charter reflects best the attitude of the world: an attack on one is an attack on all. 
The civilized world is rallying to America's side. They understand that if this terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens, may be next. Terror unanswered can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments. And you know what? We're not going to allow it. 
Americans are asking, "What is expected of us?" 
I ask you to live your lives and hug your children. I know many citizens have fears tonight and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat. I ask you to uphold the values of America and remember why so many have come here. 
We're in a fight for our principles and our first responsibility is to live by them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith. 
I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source of information -- libertyunites.org -- to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The thousands of F.B.I. agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation. And I ask you to give it. I ask for your patience with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security. And for your patience in what will be a long struggle. 
I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy. Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch its source. America is successful because of the hard work and creativity and enterprise of our people. These were the true strengths of our economy before Sept. 11 and they are our strengths today.
And finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those in uniform and for our great country. Prayer has comforted us in sorrow and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead.
Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress I thank you, their representatives, for what you have already done and for what we will do together.
Tonight we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights and take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying with direct assistance during this emergency. We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home. We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act and to find them before they strike. We will come together to take active steps to strengthen America's economy and put our people back to work.
Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers: Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress and these two leaders to show the world that we will rebuild New York City. 
After all that has just passed, all the lives taken and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them, it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear. Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead and dangers to face. 
But this country will define our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror. This will be an age of liberty here and across the world. 
Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief and anger, we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war. The advance of human freedom, the great achievement of our time and the great hope of every time, now depends on us. 
Our nation, this generation, will lift the dark threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage. We will not tire. We will not falter and we will not fail. 
It is my hope that in the months and years ahead life will return almost to normal. We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good. 
Even grief recedes with time and grace. 
But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened, will remember the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.
And I will carry this: it is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end.
I will not forget the wound to our country and those who inflicted it. I will not yield. I will not rest. I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people.
The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war. And we know that God is not neutral between them.
Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice, assured of the rightness of our cause and confident of the victories to come. In all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom and may he watch over the United States of America. Thank you.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE REACTION; 
Many Listeners Are Reassured By Tough Talk

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Many Americans still shaken by last week's attacks applauded President Bush's call last night for a new spirit of perseverance and unity in the face of terrorism, saying they supported a long, sustained campaign against shadowy terrorist forces around the world.
 In interviews during and after the president's televised address to the nation and to a joint meeting of Congress, scores of Americans said they were reassured by Mr. Bush's pledge to hunt down and root out terrorist cells and to punish nations that harbor them, even though it might take months or years. 
 "He's delivered the message that everyone needs to hear," Bruce Marks, 34, a lawyer, said after watching the speech with a cheering crowd of 150 people at Tobacco Road, a blues bar in downtown Miami. "He's spoken directly to the terrorists and reassured Muslims worldwide that we won't tolerate the extremists." 
Many Americans acknowledged that they had been frightened by the terrorist attacks and left with a profound sense of vulnerability, and they praised Mr. Bush for what they called a strong and effective speech that eased their fears and gave direction to the nation. Some even called it inspirational.
Others, however, said the speech lacked what they had expected -- solid information about the terrorists, about what they had done and about what the United States planned to do about it.
"I wish that the terrorists had been described a little more as not just people who hate us, and that he had elaborated a little more on the conditions that led to them hating us and what we anticipate doing to keep people from being terrorists," said Annabel Conrad, 36, an education consultant in Memphis. "It was pretty superficial."
And a few expressed downright dissatisfaction.
"I felt at several junctures that he was exhibiting a lot of the arrogance that I think has gotten the United States in a lot of trouble in the past," Christian King, 60, of Dennisport, Mass., said. "We seem to have this sense that we are tougher, stronger, smarter, bigger than anyone else in the world. It is not a good way to act."
Most of those interviewed approved of Mr. Bush's performance, but said they were no clearer on the issues than before his speech.
"I thought President Bush seemed to be in command, in control," said Nat Drake, a Seattle accountant who watched the speech at a hotel lounge. "He struck just the right tone. Very grave."
But Laurie Zencey, a merchandiser from St. Louis, said enlightenment was lacking: "I know terrorism is the enemy. I understand that. Everyone understands that. But exactly how do we go and root that out? It's not like fighting Japan or Germany or World War II. I'm not sure he showed us the road map for how exactly we should fight and how we'll beat the enemy."
Many said they were aware that swift retribution against those responsible for the attacks probably was not possible, and that military strikes against terrorist bases or nations that harbor them might have to be surgical rather than overwhelming.
On a day when American forces were on the move -- ships and planes heading for the Persian Gulf and reservists to stateside posts -- some Americans said they opposed indiscriminate bombing of Afghanistan for harboring Osama bin Laden, the Islamic extremist widely suspected of being behind the attacks, and insisted that the targets be limited to proven terrorists, and that the proof be made public.
Nine days after the attacks in New York and at the Pentagon left nearly 6,000 people dead or missing, and deeply wounded an already fragile economy, many Americans spoke of Mr. Bush's speech as a missed opportunity, although some said they were encouraged by his vow to join Congress in an economic stimulus package.
"I would have liked to have heard more about the economy in his speech," Marie Somers, 52, a Web development manager in South Orange, N.J., said. "There are a lot of people who are close to retirement who are watching their portfolios go down the tubes. There were a lot of very important financial analysts lost in the attacks and who knows where the country is headed economically from this."
Carl Kelly, 66, an accountant in Memphis, agreed that the speech short-changed the economic aspects of the disaster.
"I think he should emphasize more that the economy is strong and the country will remain strong," Mr. Kelly said. "I think he should have said more about how the state of the union is strong and the economic strength of our country, not only tonight but during these past days, that we've taken a hit and we're going to come back strong. I was looking for that. I want that reassurance."
Many of those interviewed called Mr. Bush's address a careful balancing act -- an effort to prepare the nation for a military effort that could last months, but without raising unrealistic expectations about delivering quick results or crushing blows.
But most Americans said they were favorably impressed, at times even emotionally moved, by Mr. Bush. 
In Longmont, Colo., a dozen customers at Riley's restaurant listened intently to the speech, applauding occasionally amid a small forest of American flags stuck in empty beer pitchers.
"Bush is like his dad, he has a big heart," said Cyndi Morris, a painter and artist. "I believe God has sent us an ark in Bush. We're all going to get through this together, side by side. I feel a lot better after hearing him. I think he knows how to pull us together."
Dottie Everett, a Democrat who grew up in Boston, said her opinion of Mr. Bush had changed during the course of the speech. "I think he did a great job of presenting his case to the people," said Ms. Everett, who admitted she was apprehensive about a protracted, open-ended war. "Honestly, before this speech I didn't think he was that literate. But he did a wonderful job tonight."
In a show of bipartisan unity, Democrats in Congress bypassed an opportunity to offer a televised response to Mr. Bush's address. "We want enemies and the whole world and all of our citizens to know that America speaks tonight with one voice," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said.
A few Americans found fault with what they called the president's overly simplistic characterization of the struggle to come -- presenting it as a battle between good and evil, between the forces of freedom and the forces of fear. 
Still, many found much to commend. "He was very inspirational," said David Britt, 20, of Crystal City, Mo., who watched the speech with 60 members of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity at the University of Missouri in Columbia. "I think everybody is scared by what happened. I think President Bush made everybody feel better."
Merle Gross, 59, a manufacturer of women's clothing, said in Chicago that she agreed with much of what Mr. Bush said but called him a "flawed communicator" who had missed a crucial opportunity. 
"He just doesn't have the passion," she said. "He's just not convincing. I couldn't buy a car from him. The default expression on his face is such an unfortunate one. I hope that I'm not a typical American in my response."
In Santa Monica, Calif., a bastion of liberal politics, even people who had voted for Al Gore said they had found encouragement in the president's speech. Ed Gomez, a bartender at the Broadway Bar and Grill, said he especially liked Mr. Bush's reference to the importance of showing respect for Islam and Arabs.
And Howard Smith, a computer executive from Malibu who was at the bar, said: "This is his best speech because he's talking from his gut. I think he was pretty much right on with the specifics. He's laid out 'Here's what we're going for, here's what we're going to do.' "
At another bar in Rye, N.Y., Lynn Bygott, 33, of Fairfield, Conn., joined in praising Mr. Bush, saying, "I'm very proud to be an American." 
Another patron, Jack Briganti, 40, an accountant from Rye, found the speech admirable. "The look in his eye was very serious," he said, referring to Mr. Bush. "There is a small percentage of America, maybe 20 percent, that does not want us to attack. I, for one, don't want to see innocent people killed."
"But to get our point across, there has to be some bloodshed," Ms. Bygott said.
"Yes, there has to be some," Mr. Briganti said.
Nearby, Jason Morey, 29, a chef, said: "I'm speechless. I thought it was the best thing I've ever heard. It terrified me. It's our generation's turn to stand up for what our country is about. I'm afraid this will be a lot longer and a lot bigger than people think. But it absolutely has to be done."

HEADLINE: Disney Shares Drop 8% On Sale of a Big Block 

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Shares of the Walt Disney Company fell more than 8 percent yesterday as Goldman, Sachs & Company sold 135 million shares, amounting to almost 6.5 percent of the company, at below-market prices.
 Goldman bought the shares from Sid Richardson Bass and Lee Marshall Bass, the Texas investors, to meet a margin call, according to a spokesman for the Basses. 
 Brokerage firms and investment banks often require investors to sell shares to help make up for the value of securities the investor has bought with borrowed money. 
After acquring the shares, Goldman sold them for $15 each. Disney said it bought 50 million of the shares. The buyers of the other 85 million shares were institutional investors, according to Goldman. As of last month, Disney had almost 2.1 billion shares outstanding.
On Monday, Disney sold $1 billion in bonds. It was not clear yesterday whether Disney sold the bonds with knowledge that Goldman would soon be trying to sell a huge block of the company's shares.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Disney's shares dropped as low as $15.50 before closing at $16.98, down $1.52. The closing price was the lowest in more than six years.
Disney's stock, like shares of many media companies, has languished this year as the economic climate cooled and as the advertising market retreated from the heights it achieved during the dot-com boom. Disney properties like the ABC television network depend on advertising.
And like the shares of many media companies, Disney's stock has fallen sharply this week as advertisers have retreated further after the terrorist attacks.
Disney is also affected by the decisions of thousands of tourists to cancel their travel plans. Disney runs resorts including Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure in Anaheim and Walt Disney World in Florida. The Walt Disney World resort includes the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney-MGM Studios and Disney's Animal Kingdom park.
On Sept. 10, the day before the attacks, Disney's shares closed at $23.58. Since then, their price has fallen 28 percent.

HEADLINE: Merrill Lynch Names Leader For Brokers 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch said yesterday that it had named James P. Gorman, a former consultant at McKinsey & Company who moved to the firm in 1999, as head of its brokerage unit. 
 Mr. Gorman's promotion was expected. 
 For more than a year he served as E. Stanley O'Neal's top lieutenant, managing the firm's 15,000 brokers. In July, Mr. O'Neal was named president and chief operating officer. 
"James Gorman has been the No. 2 executive in the U.S. private client business, leading our nationwide advisory force," said David H. Komansky, the company's chief executive, and Mr. O'Neal in a joint statement. "He will continue to provide energetic and visionary leadership in his expanded role." 
With the economy sagging and financial markets shedding billions of dollars in market value since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, Mr. Gorman faces significant challenges as he assumes his new position. 
"The most immediate challenge is this horrible environment," said Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "The things you need to do are so immediate that at this point you are reacting to what is happening. At this point, he will be practicing damage control." 
Mr. Gorman, a native of Melbourne, Australia, said that his goal in the near term was "to provide continued stability and calmness in the wake of last week's tragedy." 
Mr. Gorman is no stranger to Merrill's retail operations, even though he has never sold stock and has been on the firm's payroll for only a little more than two years. 
Before joining the firm, Mr. Gorman spent a decade at McKinsey. His primary client during that period was Merrill Lynch. He said yesterday that 60 percent of his time had been spent advising the firm's retail operations. 
"I have never sold a share of stock," he said, "but I have probably been in more retail offices than almost anyone in the industry." 
Mr. Gorman is not the first executive without a brokerage background to head Merrill's retail operations. Mr. O'Neal was an investment banker at Merrill before he moved to the retail side. 
Mr. Gorman joined Merrill Lynch in July 1999 as executive vice president and chief marketing officer. Since May 2000, when he was tapped to manage the firm's brokers, he and Mr. O'Neal have led a shift toward focusing on wealthy investors. Mr. Gorman was also deeply involved in developing a new pay structure for brokers, which is expected to be introduced in October. 
Mr. Gorman is a graduate of the University of Melbourne, where he earned bachelor's and law degrees, and Columbia University, where he received an M.B.A. He will continue to serve as an executive vice president and a member of Merrill Lynch's executive management committee. 
Merrill's stock price, which has been in a downdraft for much of the year and has been hit hard since the market reopened after the terrorist attacks, fell again yesterday. Its shares closed at $36.01, down $2.49.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MILITARY CONTRACTORS; 
Beneficiaries of the Military Buildup Await Their Orders

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Early last week, Frank C. Lanza, the chief executive of L-3 Communications, an aerospace and communications company in New York, received a not-too-surprising telephone call from military officials.
 "They asked us, 'Can you do the following things, and how long will it take you to do it,' " Mr. Lanza said. "They are in the planning process. And they need to know about our ability to deliver certain products." 
 That planning process is about war: the Pentagon is preparing a shopping list for the global struggle against terrorism promised by President Bush. As a result, scores of military contractors, from giants like Lockheed Martin to smaller companies like L-3, could be among the corporate beneficiaries of the devastating attacks of Sept. 11. 
Even as those assaults have sent the stock market plummeting and caused havoc for much of American business, prospects for the military-industrial complex are looking stronger than they have in years.
Overnight, political opposition in Congress to huge increases in Pentagon spending has vanished, along with concerns about dipping into surplus Social Security funds. Consequently, what had seemed to the industry like a disappointingly small military budget just two weeks ago is now climbing toward unanticipated heights, providing a lift for military contractors and a quick Keynesian stimulus for the economy.
Beyond the buildup for war, winners and losers in the race for Pentagon money will also be determined by the outcome of Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's efforts to transform the military. His goals have included improving intelligence, expanding long-strike capabilities and making the forces lighter, faster and more high-tech. 
But the process has faced stiff resistance from some commanders and lawmakers who fear Mr. Rumsfeld wants to starve programs for modernizing conventional ships, planes and howitzers to nurture untried products, like space planes or remotely piloted submarines.
"The services are going to want to try to use some money to address their modernization needs," said Jacques S. Gansler, an under secretary of defense in the Clinton administration who now teaches public policy at the University of Maryland. "And that's where you get a conundrum over whether to buy a new tank, or equipment you'd like to have for 21st-century warfare against terrorists. You'll have a battle between those two options."
The budget numbers tell the story. Three days after the attack, Congress overwhelmingly approved $40 billion in emergency funds, with $10 billion to $15 billion for the armed services. In the next few weeks, Congress is also expected to approve, with little dissent, a $33 billion increase in the Pentagon budget, raising it to $329 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
And before final votes on the 2002 spending plan are even cast, the Pentagon is expected to ask for an additional $15 billion to $25 billion. There is bipartisan support for that, too.
"Capitol Hill is prepared to do whatever the Pentagon wants," said Gordon Adams, a budget official in the Clinton administration who is now director of security policy studies at the Elliot School of International Security Studies at George Washington University.
Much of the initial wave of money will go toward rebuilding the smoldering hole left in the Pentagon by the hijacked airliner, paying for heightened security at military installations worldwide and preparing for retaliatory strikes. That will mean buying new bullets, cruise missiles, boots, reconnaissance equipment and spare parts.
But many analysts and military officials say they expect there to be a significant amount of money left over after those basic needs are met. The service chiefs and senior lawmakers will probably want to spend those funds on favored weapons programs, like Boeing's F-18 E and F fighters, United Defense's Crusader artillery system, and Northrop Grumman and General Dynamic's DD-21 stealth destroyer. It will not matter if those systems are not clearly useful in the war on terrorism, the analysts say.
"There is a heightened sense of danger out there," said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer with the Lexington Institute, a military policy organization based in Arlington, Va.
"There are increased resources," he added. "There is muted partisanship. And those three factors combine to improve the prospects of many defense programs, even those that don't appear immediately relevant to the current operations."
Whether that buying spree lasts will depend on the nature and duration of the military operation Mr. Bush orders. A ground war could help builders of armored equipment, like General Dynamics. A war fought mainly from the air could benefit Lockheed or Boeing. And a totally different kind of battle, where rooting out an elusive enemy will require intelligence and surveillance skills more than sheer firepower, could help companies like Northrop, maker of the Global Hawk, an unmanned reconnaissance aircraft.
Yet the influx of money soon to flow from Capitol Hill seems certain to trickle down to a wide array of military contractors, big and small.
"A rising tide does lift all boats," said John Williams, a spokesman for the National Defense Industrial Association, a trade group representing 900 military contractors.
There will be new purchases of explosion-proof windows and doors for the Pentagon and other military buildings. Spare parts and maintenance contracts will grow as more ships, planes and helicopters undergo the relentless wear-and-tear of overseas deployment. 
Munitions makers can also count on new orders for items like cruise missiles and other kinds of precision-guided weapons. 
Companies like Alliant Techsystems, a munitions maker in Minneapolis, and Boeing, which makes highly accurate gravity bombs and cruise missiles, would be candidates for new orders. And there has been talk among military planners of speeding up a Raytheon contract to refurbish older Tomahawk missiles with Global Positioning Systems for greater accuracy.
That $414 million program to upgrade 644 missiles was started as an emergency contract after the Air Force ran short of Tomahawks during the bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1998 -- an embarrassment the Pentagon wants to avoid repeating.
"The prospects for smart weapons really look favorable," said William J. Frost, vice president for administration for the EDO Corporation, a New York-based company that makes targeting, radar jamming and sonar equipment.
But some Pentagon planners are talking about speeding up production of much bigger items as well, should the struggle be as protracted as Mr. Bush has predicted.
For instance, Mr. Rumsfeld has urged the services to increase the number of reconnaissance planes available for hunting down Osama Bin Laden's terrorist network.
One option would be to accelerate an existing Boeing program for equipping six C-9's with sophisticated surveillance equipment. Boeing has delivered the first four planes at an average cost of $54 million each. Now, the Navy has asked the company if it could expand production. Deena Weiss, a Boeing spokeswoman, said that would not be a problem. 
Some analysts and Navy officials also say that a prolonged battle overseas could require buying more carrier-based aircraft. Boeing is scheduled to deliver 39 of the F-18 E and F fighters in 2002.
"As ever, carriers are useful for a full spectrum of conflict," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.
The Pentagon is also planning to seek money to speed up a program, led by General Dynamics, to replace the 24 nuclear-tipped missiles on aging Trident submarines with 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles.
If Mr. Rumsfeld has his way in transforming the military, the biggest winners will be companies that build intelligence-gathering equipment, wireless communications systems, precision-guided weapons and missile-defense components. 
"At least on the face of it, you would think that the people who are strongly focused on surveillance and precision weapons would do relatively better," said Wolfgang Demisch, managing director with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Securities. 
Indeed, he added, "you could be looking at a significant reduction in available funds for ordinary military affairs and purchases." 
L-3, created out of a division of Loral after that company was purchased by Lockheed Martin, is cited by some analysts as the kind of high-technology company that stands to gain from Mr. Rumsfeld's new vision. It produces equipment that provides security for wireless communications and components for aircraft and airport security systems. The company also makes products that help intelligence officers scan, filter and analyze huge quantities of voice and electronic data.
Mr. Lanza said he was convinced that the impending mobilization, combined with Mr. Rumsfeld's plans, would hasten a realignment of Pentagon budget priorities away from cold war weapons toward the new technology his company produces. 
"Sept. 11 is going to change the landscape for this industry," he said.
National missile defense is another high priority of the Bush administration that seems to have gained political momentum from the terrorist attack, analysts say. 
"There is a clear linkage between terrorism and missile defense," said David E. Baker, a retired Air Force general who is now managing director for the Schwab Washington Research Group. "If these terrorists could get a hold of a missile and put some bad stuff into that nose cone and launch it on Manhattan, they would."
Before Sept. 11, Democrats on Capitol Hill were hoping to trim back President Bush's $8.3 billion first-year missile shield program and place tight restrictions on testing and development. But that opposition has softened, with many Democrats saying they have lost the stomach for a partisan fight -- even as they privately argue that a missile shield could not have prevented the attacks.
Contractors on the program include TRW, which builds satellites; Raytheon, which builds "antimissile kill" vehicles; Lockheed, which makes missiles and communications equipment; and Boeing, which in addition to building booster rockets is the lead contractor on the program. 
Indeed, for Boeing, military business in general has been a silver lining in an otherwise bleak fall. 
Last week, the company's stock price fell sharply in tandem with the airline industry's, and it announced plans for as many as 30,000 layoffs. But its military business, which accounts for about a quarter of its revenue, remains healthy.
"Boeing has taken a thrashing," Mr. Baker said. "But their military sector is pounding away like a Ferrari on all cylinders."
Many military contractors have been hesitant to talk publicly about their improved economic prospects. "This is such a gruesome way to make money," a lobbyist said.
But some companies have been openly lobbying for new business. Indeed, several executives have called the Pentagon directly in the last week to say they were prepared to ramp up production. One was Continental Electronics, a communication equipment company with annual revenue of $26 million. 
"We believe that our radio transmitters would be desperately needed in places like Pakistan," said John Uvodich, the company's president. "We are just trying to let people in Washington know that we are here to assist."

But shares in other military contractors, like Boeing and United Technologies, fell sharply because of fears that losses on their commercial airliner business would swamp any benefits from a Pentagon buildup.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMICS; 
Already, Grim Statistics for New York Consumer Sales

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON and JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Tidel Robinson had been thinking for weeks about buying a new DVD player, and now there was one on sale for just $99, down from $150, at the Electronics Outlet in Brooklyn's Fulton Mall.
 But Mr. Robinson, a plumber, had been laid off on Wednesday. Whether it was the World Trade Center collapse or just the weakening economy, he didn't know, but business was slow. "I've got my rent to pay, the bill for my baby at the day care center," Mr. Robinson said. He left the store empty-handed. 
 And so it goes in stores all over the metropolitan area. People are slowly returning to shops to buy what they must: groceries, school supplies, new sneakers for the children. But the big-ticket items -- cars, jewelry, huge-screen televisions -- are moving slowly, if at all.
"We're doing necessary things like fixing watches," said James Yune, who with his wife, Susan, owns Rye Jewelers in Westchester. But his customers, he said, "are not making major purchases."
The direct consequences of the trade center disaster are bad enough, but the drop in consumer sales may prove drastic as well. Economists are forecasting citywide retailing losses of as much as $15 billion, according to Marc Goloven, an economist at J. P. Morgan. "There is significant concern that many small retailers, especially in Lower Manhattan, will be unable to survive," he said.
The problems ripple out from ground zero. Joe Lopane, the manager of Mayer Volkswagen in Larchmont, said that two prospective buyers had changed their minds.
"One was someone who survived the catastrophe, but he worked near the World Trade Center, and no longer has a place to work and he couldn't really be thinking of a car," Mr. Lopane said. He added that the other buyer had requested a transfer back to Tennessee because "he no longer wants to work in New York City."
Mr. Lopane said he really could have used the sales: the dealership sold only nine cars last Saturday, a day when it usually moves 15.
Across the country, consumers who were already shaken by the weakening economy and the plunging stock market seem shell-shocked at the destruction of the trade center and worried about war. As they did while awaiting the onset of the Persian Gulf War, consumers are keeping their wallets closed.
The National Retail Federation, a trade group, forecasts that sales during the quarter ending in December will rise only 2.2 percent, compared with last year; a 4 percent rise had been predicted earlier.
While it is too soon for hard-and-fast figures or accurate predictions, economists agree with anecdotal evidence suggesting that the declines are most severe in and around New York. That fact has not been lost on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who on his weekly radio program yesterday urged New Yorkers and out-of-towners to fill up the city's empty stores, even if it means buying their Christmas presents early.
Some of what is going on has to do with Wall Street, which was in trouble long before the events of Sept. 11. Most of Wall Street's businesses, including those selling stock for companies that were merging, ground to a halt this year, and the stock market has fallen so far that it is where it was about this time in 1998.
Firms have started to shed employees (the Wall Street head count fell by 1,600 in August alone, according to the New York City comptroller's office). And most analysts expected the layoffs to accelerate unless the market rebounded or the economy picked up steam this month. Neither has happened.
That helps explain why New York consumers' confidence -- their faith in the future and willingness to spend -- has fallen far more sharply than that of the nation as a whole, according to the Siena Research Institute near Albany, which surveys New Yorkers in conjunction with the University of Michigan.
And that was in August; the September figures are certain to be worse, said Douglas Lonnstrom, the director of the institute. "We had a reeling economy, and this tragedy on top of it can't be good," he said. "I think it will be quite a while before we see improvement."
Not every store was empty this week. At CVS in the Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J., workers continued to buy "junk food and soft drinks," the assistant manager, Miguel Hernandez, said.
Which is only to be expected, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. Stores that sell the basics at low prices, like Wal-Mart, should do pretty well in the foreseeable future, he said. As for those that sell luxury items: "They're doomed. They're toast."
To be sure, the trade center disaster has prompted some people to splurge. Like Barbara Summers and her husband, Maurice, who last week were at a Potamkin car dealership in Manhattan signing the papers to buy a $35,000 gold Cadillac Escalade they had longed for.
"If you have the money, why not spend it?" asked Mrs. Summers, who fled her office in Lower Manhattan through smoke and ashes after the twin towers were hit by the two airliners. "You might not be able to spend it next month."
George Rios wishes there were more people like Mrs. Summers. A salesman at Potamkin, he works on commission, and the week of Sept. 11 he did not make one sale. "It hurts," he said. "I can't pay my bills."
For the most part, even people who have been spending have been doing so rather reluctantly. Rita Smith of Rye Brook was willing to buy sneakers for her 6-year-old, but she was not planning to make her usual pilgrimage to the Neiman Marcus in White Plains to pick up some fall clothes for herself. She does intend to buy bottled water and other survival items to keep at home.
The drop in sales is hard on clerks, who make some or all of their money from commissions. Three salespeople raced to help a visitor at the Bernini menswear store in the Garden State Plaza this week. Sales have fallen by about 60 percent since Sept. 11, said the manager, Aiden Swedan.
But, she said, she understood why her usual customers -- businessmen looking for suits -- were not shopping. "You don t want to buy," she said, "when people around you are busy crying."

HEADLINE: H.M.O.'s Plan to Drop Medicare, Calling Fees Too Low 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Health maintenance organizations serving at least 475,000 elderly and disabled people will pull out of Medicare next year, the trade association for the industry announced today.
 The H.M.O.'s said federal payments were too low to cover their costs. 
 In a separate development, the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees announced that its premiums would soar 13.3 percent next year, the largest increase since the late 1980's.
The federal employee program is the largest employer-sponsored health plan in the United States. It is considered an accurate reflection of what is happening throughout the private health insurance market. 
"Employers all across the nation are looking at the prospect of double-digit premium increases in 2002," said William E. Flynn III, associate director of the federal Office of Personnel Management, who supervises the program for nine million federal workers, retirees and dependents.
The federal employee program is often described as a model for government and private health plans. But still, Mr. Flynn said, the average premium -- $5,880 next year, for subscribers and the federal government together -- will be 50 percent higher than it was in 1998.
The changes in Medicare and the federal employee program all point to a resurgence of health care inflation.
Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, which represents H.M.O.'s, said, "With health care inflation running at 12 percent and Medicare reimbursement capped at an increase of 2 percent, you have a mathematical formula that does not work."
The H.M.O. decisions raise questions about the future of President Bush's policy to revamp Medicare by giving private health plans a much larger role.
In June, Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the Medicare program, said the administration wanted to double the number of Medicare beneficiaries in H.M.O.'s by 2005. In a brief interview today, Mr. Scully said he had no immediate comment on the latest withdrawals.
Today's announcements follow three years of turmoil in the insurance market for Medicare patients. Since January 1999, H.M.O.'s have dropped more than 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries. About 5.6 million people, or 14 percent of the 40 million beneficiaries, are now in H.M.O.'s.
People dropped from private health plans can return to Medicare's original fee-for-service program or can try to enroll in other managed care plans, if any are available in the area where they live. But the traditional Medicare program does not cover outpatient prescription drugs, as many H.M.O.'s do.
PacifiCare, the biggest Medicare H.M.O., said it was dropping 64,200 of its 1.1 million Medicare beneficiaries in California, Texas, Arizona and several other states. ConnectiCare said it was pulling out of two counties in Connecticut, Hartford and New Haven, where it serves 24,700 Medicare patients. 
Aetna said it was dropping 38 percent of its 277,000 Medicare beneficiaries, including many in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But it said it would remain in New York City, Philadelphia and some parts of New Jersey, including Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Camden Counties. Medicare payments are higher in some urban areas than in many rural and suburban counties.
Deborah R. Hoyt, a spokeswoman for ConnectiCare, said: "Seniors love our program, and we would have loved to continue offering it. But we can't afford the financial losses anymore."
Several H.M.O.'s remaining in Medicare said they would cut benefits or increase premiums and co-payments charged to Medicare beneficiaries next year.
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, which serves 37,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Massachusetts, said it would soon begin charging a monthly premium of $60, which is a $25 increase over the current amount of $35.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, which runs an H.M.O. for 40,000 Medicare beneficiaries, said its premiums would rise by amounts ranging from $25 to $40 a month. The premiums now range from $110 to $135, depending on where a person lives.
Two House Republicans influential on health care policy, Bill Thomas of California and Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, said they would push legislation to encourage H.M.O.'s to enter or stay in Medicare. "Low reimbursements" are a major problem, said Mr. Thomas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
But Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the panel's health subcommittee, said numerous studies had found that Medicare was already paying H.M.O.'s more than it would spend for the same patients if they were in the traditional fee-for-service program.
"How much will it take to keep H.M.O.'s in Medicare?" Mr. Stark asked in an interview. "We've already given them huge payment increases."
Diane Archer, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer group based in New York City, asked, "How can we justify spending more and more government money on health plans that are serving fewer older and disabled Americans in fewer places?"
Beneficiaries will soon receive detailed information comparing the costs, benefits and other features of health plans available to them in 2002. Medicare officials originally said it would be impossible to mail out such data, but they agreed to do so last week, after a federal district judge ruled that they were in "blatant violation" of federal law.

HEADLINE: Europeans Pledge To Spur Economies 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: LIEGE, Belgium, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
European Union finance ministers are standing by a commitment to balance their budgets in coming years while doing what they can to stimulate the economy.
 "The tragic events in the U.S. have increased the uncertainties and downside risks for global growth," said the ministers and the European Central Bank president, Wim Duisenberg, in a statement released at a meeting here. 
 The prospect of a long slowdown and higher military and security costs are putting added strain on the European governments' budgets. France, Germany and Italy say they will not meet this year's deficit goals.
Growth in the dozen countries that share the euro slowed to its weakest pace in four years in the second quarter. European airlines and insurers have warned that the attacks on the United States will also hurt their earnings.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: HOLLYWOOD; 
Tension and Caution Arise In Entertainment Industry

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The line of cars stretched beneath the ornate archway and down the sloping entranceway to the Paramount Pictures lot this afternoon. Studio guards were being more scrupulous than usual about checking those trying to get into the compound.
 At the Warner Brothers lot, up and over the Hollywood sign in Burbank, three gates were closed and the lines into the few remaining access points were long and slow-moving. Studio tours were canceled, and shows scheduled to be taped in coming days before a studio audience will perform to dark, empty seats. 
 At the 20th Century Fox lot just southwest of Beverly Hills, barricades were put into place this morning, forcing motorists to slow down and carve a serpentine path toward the main guard gates. Studio officials warned workers to expect delays getting into work and to plan on staying on the lot through the day. 
The cause of all of this tension was a warning that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had passed along to studio executives on Thursday of an uncorroborated threat that a Hollywood studio might be the target of a bombing attack in retaliation for any strikes by the United States against Afghanistan. 
Bureau officials met with studio executives in Beverly Hills and outlined the threat and what steps might be taken. This was all being done "in an abundance of caution," a statement from the bureau said.
The precautions caused delays, "but everyone seems fine with it," said Jeffrey Godsick, Fox's executive vice president for publicity and promotions. "The feeling is, it's more inconvenient but, you know, it's a good inconvenience."
The waves of apprehension that had first centered on the nation's air transport system are, 10 days after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, beginning to move into other arenas of public life, including the entertainment industry, which produces the movies and music that many terrorists organizations see as decadent cultural imperialism. The fears are also felt in cultural venues where large groups of people might provide tempting targets.
"The noise level is very high," said Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif.
At Lincoln Center in New York, security officials said that all bags were being checked and that guards were posted at each garage entrance. It is the same at the Art Institute of Chicago, where under a new policy all bags, purses and parcels are being searched at every entrance. 
"We felt it was important for us to do," said Eileen Harakal, a spokeswoman for the museum. 
In Orlando, Fla., guards were checking bags and purses at Walt Disney World's four theme parks, and more uniformed guards and plainclothes officers were inside. "We have stepped up security because of the circumstances," a spokeswoman, Leslie Goodman, said. 
Visitors' bags are being searched at nearby Sea World, too. "If we provide a good level of security, it makes our guests feel safe," said a Sea World spokesman, Nick Gollattscheck.
Shelley Mansholt, assistant vice president for public relations for the MGM-Mirage chain of Las Vegas resorts, said the company had posted extra guards at loading docks. Unattended bags from group travelers now must go through special checks. And everyone at the upcoming Janet Jackson show at the MGM Grand's Garden Arena, or any other shows at the site, will have to pass through metal detectors.
But officials at other entertainment venues -- including many cinema chains and live theaters -- said they were continuing with business as usual for now.
"We really aren't doing anything differently," said Claude Binder, general manager of the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago. "The most we can seat is 700, if both theaters are full, and that doesn't necessarily present itself as a threat."
Proper caution is probably wise, Mr. Jenkins, the terrorism expert, said, and without knowing the source of the threat to the movie studios, he said there seemed little reason to believe the terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks were now going to engage in a campaign of bomb threats.
"Most terrorists, and certainly the ones we are confronting today, are not interested in giving warning," he said. "They are interested in killing people."
Most bomb threats, except in countries with large indigenous terrorist movements, tend to come from adolescent pranksters or disgruntled employees, Mr. Jenkins said. 
Such threats, though, almost always increase after major terrorist incidents because "they are an inspiration to a certain category of lunatic," he said.
As news moved through Hollywood on Thursday about the F.B.I. warning, anxiety spread around the offices, soundstages, screening rooms, commissaries and nightspots where the entertainment industry works and gathers. 
"It's like people who had been really tense under the surface now had something to focus their anxiety on," one studio marketing executive said.
Mr. Jenkins said random terror lost its effect very quickly because "there is nothing that anyone can do, so life assumes a curious normality."
He noted that during the London Blitz people continued to go to the movies. 
"Theater went on," Mr. Jenkins said. "Even in the darkest hours of full-scale, ongoing war, people lived their lives, and entertainment was not merely something that people enjoyed. It becomes important. It becomes something they need."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Share Prices Plunge 14% for the Week, Second Worst Ever

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
America's stock markets fell again yesterday, ending one of the worst weeks in their history, as many investors moved their money out of stocks and into less risky assets in the face of a deepening economic slump.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average posted a 14.3 percent loss, its largest since the Great Depression. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which includes the largest publicly traded American companies, ended Friday just above its low of Aug. 31, 1998, the last time fears of a worldwide recession overwhelmed Wall Street. 
 Both military and economic worries are driving the sell-off, analysts say. President Bush's speech to the nation on Thursday night raised fears that the United States might face a long and difficult conflict, further undercutting corporate and consumer confidence. Page C1. 
The economy, which was sputtering before Sept. 11, has almost certainly entered a recession, possibly a deep one, many economists say. Corporate profits are plunging, and hundreds of thousands of employees in airlines and the travel and tourism industry stand to lose their jobs.
In addition, traders and institutional investors, especially those who work in Lower Manhattan, may be more tired and frightened than other Americans, since the securities industry was one of the chief targets of last week's attack, said Abby Joseph Cohen, chief United States investment strategist for Goldman, Sachs.
"This was an attack on the United States and the business community and the financial markets, and many of us who work down here are feeling it," said Ms. Cohen, whose offices are only a few blocks from the former site of the World Trade Center. "There's a weariness."
The Dow Jones industrial average closed yesterday down 140.40 points, or 1.7 percent, at 8,235.81. The S.& P. 500 fell 18.74 points, or 1.9 percent, to 965.80, and the Nasdaq composite index skidded 47.74 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,423.19.
For the week, the Dow dropped 1,379.70 points, or 14.3 percent; the S.& P. 500 gave up 126.74 points, or 11.6 percent; and the Nasdaq composite index fell 272.19 points, or 16.1 percent.
The loss for the Dow eclipsed its plunge in October 1987, when the index lost 13.2 percent in one week. But that week included Black Monday in which the Dow lost 22.6 percent.
"There are two consequences to what's happened," said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs. "There's a big blow to corporate profits."
In addition, the possibility of a deepening recession and a lengthy military conflict has led investors to sell stocks, in which they can lose their entire investments, and buy bonds and money market accounts, which keep their principal safe, he said. In effect, investors are demanding a bigger premium for the uncertain returns of stocks than for the protections of bonds and other guaranteed investments.
As a result, the prices of short-term Treasury notes, considered among the safest financial assets, have soared since Sept. 11. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, has fallen to 2.86 percent from 3.5 percent before the attack. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has fallen to 4.69 percent from 4.84 percent before the attack. Swiss francs, considered a haven in uncertain times, have also risen against the dollar and the euro.
A premium for safer investments makes sense, given the possibility of a severe recession, Mr. Dudley said. He urged the government to step in quickly with new spending to help the economy recover from last week's shock. On Thursday, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Congress should wait before authorizing more spending.
"If the government doesn't step in, you're probably talking about a long and deep recession," Mr. Dudley said.
Yesterday's action was tumultuous, although the trading systems at the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market held up under the strain. Under pressure from the expiration of many options contracts, stocks plunged in the morning. They recovered quickly when General Electric, the world's biggest company by market value, said that it would meet its profit goals for 2001 and 2002 despite the economic slowdown.
After falling below 8,100, a loss of almost 300 points, at 10 a.m., the Dow industrials soared over the next half-hour into positive territory. But the averages could not hold their gains as selling pressure mounted. The Dow quickly lost almost 200 points and stayed between 8,150 and 8,250 for most of the rest of the day.
While individual investors bought stocks yesterday, their purchases were overwhelmed by sales from institutional investors, according to data from Bloomberg Financial Markets. Big mutual funds may have been selling shares to prepare for possible redemptions by their shareholders, said Michael Strauss, senior economist at Commonfund, which manages $30 billion.
All three indexes are now far below the peaks they set early last year during the heady days of the Internet bubble. The Dow is down 30 percent from its high of 11,722.98, set Jan. 14, 2000; the S.& P. 500 has given back 37 percent from its high of 1,527.46, set March 24, 2000. The Nasdaq has fallen 72 percent from its high of 5,048.62, on March 10, 2000. No major stock index in the United States has dropped as much as the Nasdaq since the Depression.
Now stocks may be close to a bottom, Mr. Strauss said. "As bad as things are right now, we may end up producing a better economy a year from now," with the help of increased government spending and lower interest rates, he said.
In addition, some institutional investors will need to buy stocks early in October to "rebalance" their portfolios, he said. Many institutions try to keep a fixed percentage of their assets in stocks, bonds and cash. For example, a common split might be 60 percent of a portfolio in stocks, 35 percent in bonds and 5 percent in cash. If stock prices fall, stocks will become a smaller percentage of the portfolio. To keep the portfolio in line with its target, an institution will need to sell some bonds and buy stocks.
Most big investors do this rebalancing at the beginning of each quarter. Since the fourth quarter begins Oct. 1, stocks may get a lift then, Mr. Strauss said.
In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that it would continue to allow companies great freedom to buy back their own shares through next Friday. That move could help prop up prices, although it did not seem to do so this week.
Other professional investors said they believed that the sell-off might be almost over, at least in the short run. Tobias Levkovich, senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said that stocks fell almost 15 percent in the five months from the invasion of Kuwait to the beginning of the gulf war.
"We've done that in a week," he said. "We're near the bottom."
Michael Clark, head stock trader at Credit Suisse First Boston, said the market and its participants ended the week strained to the maximum but relatively upbeat. Credit Suisse First Boston handled four times its normal trading volume yesterday, he said. 
He said he was encouraged that American markets had such an orderly opening, after what he called a meltdown in Europe, and were able to rally at midday.
He added that he would not soon forget how Wall Street had pulled together to get the markets open and keep them running all week. "There was a camaraderie that seldom exists in this place where they tell you that your only friend is your dog."

Dow Posts Its Worst Loss Since the Great Depression

 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average posted a 14.3 percent loss, its largest since the Depression. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 140.40 points yesterday, to 8,235.81. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which includes the largest publicly traded companies, ended yesterday just above its low of Aug. 31, 1998, the last time fears of a worldwide recession overwhelmed Wall Street. The S.& P. fell 18.74 points, to 965.80, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 47.74 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,423.19. Page A1. 

Congress Approves Airline Bailout
Congress passed a $15 billion package to bail out the country's ailing airlines and provide relief to aviation insurers. It also agreed to set up an open-ended federal fund to compensate victims of last week's terrorist attacks. The plan was approved by the Senate, 96-1, and by the House, 356-54, late last night. A1.

Congress provided government-backed liability coverage for the airlines, averting a looming halt to flights provoked by a big cutback in war-related passenger jet insurance following the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. The decision came after governments in Britain, Germany and other European countries provided similar breathing room. C5.

G.M. in Deal for Control of Daewoo
General Motors announced an agreement to take a controlling interest in the company that will emerge from the bankrupt Daewoo Motors for $400 million. The new company will include two plants in South Korea and two more overseas and is expected to eventually have $5 billion in annual revenue. C2.

Morgan Stanley's Profit Falls Again
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company said its profit fell 43 percent to $705 million and revenue was down 16 percent at $5.27 billion in its third quarter as a prolonged stock slump cut trading commissions and investment banking fees, and extended the Wall Street firm's slide to four consecutive quarters. C3.

Northwest Air Will Cut 10,000 Jobs
Northwest Airlines plans to eliminate 10,000 jobs, raising the number of job cuts at the nation's largest airlines to more than 70,000. Northwest's chief executive, Richard H. Anderson, said the airline had no choice because it cut the number of flights. An official of the flight attendants union accused the airline of trying to create pressure for a bailout package. C5.

G.E. on Track for Profit Growth
General Electric is on track to deliver double-digit earnings growth this year, despite a looming recession and pressure on its insurance and aerospace businesses after last week's terrorist attacks. C2.

Microsoft Delays Release of Xbox
Microsoft, following the pattern that has been set by rivals making new game systems, postponed the North American release of its Xbox to Nov. 15 from Nov. 8. C15.

Japan Discloses Plan for Bad Loans
The Japanese government unveiled its long-awaited program to clean up bad loans, hoping to mollify foreign and domestic critics before Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi flies to Washington on Monday to meet President Bush. In the new plan, the government promised to set up a fund to buy the bad loans, which are estimated at $368 billion, from the banks, but financing plans were sketchy. C2.

More HMO's to Pull Out of Medicare
Health maintenance organizations serving at least 475,000 elderly and disabled people will pull out of Medicare next year because federal payments are too low to cover costs. A8.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: MARKET PLACE; 
Confidence, in the Economy and the U.S., Is the Long-Term Issue

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
As the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst week since the Great Depression, attention inevitably gravitated toward those who were selling stocks, and why they were doing so. But the far more important issue in the long run will be whether this crisis damages confidence in the American economy and in America itself.
 The biggest sale of the week was a $2 billion block of stock in Walt Disney. That sale was made for the same reason that uncounted other sales were made even though many Americans felt that it was their patriotic duty to support the stock market in the face of terrorism: The seller needed the money, and had no choice. 
 The sale was made by members of the Bass family of Texas, a family that has been viewed as one of the richest in the world. They had borrowed too much money to make investments that had lost value, and they faced margin calls like any other overextended investor.
Other sales no doubt have been made, and will be made in the future, by investors who have lost their jobs and simply need to sell securities to generate cash to live. None of that selling, painful as it may be for the sellers and perhaps for the stock market, reflects a real change in investor sentiment.
The shock of the attacks has almost certainly slowed the economy, and will create a recession if one is not already under way. But easing by the Federal Reserve and spending on reconstruction and defense by the government will stimulate the economy, and the recession will end at some point. Stocks typically begin to rise several months before the end of a recession, and that gives reason to hope that the worst of the stock market fall is behind us.
But after those factors have faded, the more important long-term question for the stock market will remain: Will fundamental attitudes about investments and about the American economy be changed by this disaster and what follows?
"A lot of people have learned over the last 10 or 15 years that the stock market always bounces back," said Stanley Shopkorn, formerly head of equity trading for Salomon Brothers and later a hedge fund manager. He recalled that there was no such confidence back in the mid-1970's, when Wall Street suffered its worst bear market since the Depression.
That was also the last time that all the major economies of the world -- the United States, Europe and Japan -- were in recession at the same time. Japan is in recession now, the United States probably is, and European economies have been slowing and could enter a recession soon.
Then, Mr. Shopkorn recalled, stocks traded for 5 to 10 times estimated annual earnings, valuations that are far below even the depressed valuations of the current bear market. Investors who had flocked to stocks in the late 1960's had become completely disillusioned.
The mid-1970's were also the last time that the future of the United States seemed bleak to many people. Then the entire Western world had been thrown into recession by a surge in oil prices, inflation was rising and many believed that the economic future belonged to the oil producers. Few if any people believed that the American stock market was sure to be an excellent long-term investment. 
In recent years, investors around the world have come to believe that the American economy is the most dynamic in the world and therefore a place they have to invest. It is widely accepted that stocks are virtually sure to go up, at least in the long run.
The really important issue is whether what happens in coming months and years will make people think that America is losing its preeminence and is becoming a relatively risky place to invest. A prolonged, bloody and inconclusive war against terrorism probably would bring lower stock market values even if the economy is growing again. Investors could come to have less confidence in the future of the American economy, and that confidence plays an important role in determining how much money is invested in stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended this week down 14.3 percent. Some of that decline was inevitable, given that world markets had fallen about 5 to 15 percent after the attacks while the American market was closed. But it also reflected both forced sales and sales from people worried that the war being proclaimed in Washington would not be a success. A country that felt invulnerable now wonders if, where, and when the next attack will come.
There have been few comparably bad weeks in the past. Even in the 1987 crash, when the Dow fell 22.7 percent on one day, by the end of the week it had recovered to be off just 13.2 percent for the week.
This is just the third fall of more than 14 percent since the Dow took its present form during World War I. The worst, a decline of 15.5 percent, came in the week ended July 21, 1933. Then the economy was mired in the Great Depression, and a speculative recovery in the market was collapsing. Almost as bad was the week ended May 17, 1940, when the index dropped 14.2 percent. The news then was that the French army was collapsing.
One thing common to both times was a sense that the future of America and the world seemed dim. World economies had collapsed by 1933, and attempts at recovery had failed. In 1940 Adolf Hitler's Germany was triumphant, and it was far from clear that he would ever be stopped.
Those worries proved to be wrong, although in each case it took years to become clear. If the American stock market is to return to the optimism it was demonstrating less than two years ago, it will be necessary for investors to conclude that fears about the long-term success of America are as unfounded now as they were in 1933 and 1940.

Britain Reinstates, Again, Direct Rule in North Ireland
Britain suspended Northern Ireland's three-year-old government and reinstated direct rule from London for the second time in two months, in an effort to forestall yet another crisis over the fulfillment of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord. The decision puts the province's Parliament on hold indefinitely. The first suspension, in August, lasted only one day. A6

Spending for Missile Defense
Senate Democrats backed down on missile defense, agreeing without dissent to restore $1.3 billion in spending authority for developing and testing antimissile systems that they had planned to cut from the Pentagon authorization bill. A3

Mideast Cease-Fire Holds
The cease-fire in Israel clung to life, despite scattered reports of violence and even though Prime Minister Ariel Sharon once again called Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, a terrorist. Despite this characterization, Mr. Sharon said he would allow a meeting between Mr. Arafat and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres if the Palestinians delivered 48 hours without violence. A Sharon aide said a meeting might be held on Sunday. A3

Taiwan Party Ousts Leader
The Nationalist Party of Taiwan expelled Lee Teng-hui, its former chairman and the island's first elected president, after he endorsed a rival party and made increasingly harsh assertions that the current Nationalist leaders were selling out to Beijing. A5

Mad Cow Disease in Japan
A test has shown that a Japanese cow slaughtered in August carried mad cow disease, the Ministry of Agriculture said, confirming the first known case in Asia of the illness, which earlier ravaged Europe's cattle industry. (AP)

Senior Pentagon Analyst Is Accused of Spying
Federal authorities charged the Pentagon's top intelligence analyst for Cuba with spying for the Cuban government. The analyst, Ana Belen Montes of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's intelligence arm, was accused of providing Havana with highly classified information, including American assessments of Cuban military readiness. Ms. Montes entered no plea when she appeared before a federal magistrate in Washington. A7

H.M.O.'s to Quit Medicare
Health maintenance organizations serving at least 475,000 elderly and disabled people will pull out of Medicare next year, the trade association for the industry announced. The H.M.O.'s said federal payments were too low to cover their costs. In addition, the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees announced that its premiums would soar 13.3 percent next year. A8

Ruling on Nursing Home Layoffs
One of the nation's largest nursing home chains illegally laid off at least 350 employees after a 1996 strike in Pennsylvania, the National Labor Relations Board has ruled. The board said the layoffs at 15 nursing homes operated by the company, Beverly Enterprises of Fort Smith, Ark., stemmed from a "corporate-level union animus." (AP)

Settlement in Murder Case
The assets of a millionaire who paid to have his former wife killed will be given to her six children and other relatives, a district judge in Austin, Tex., has ruled.

No Delay in Election, Governor Declares
Gov. George E. Pataki said that the primary election would be held as scheduled on Tuesday, saying, "This is a country of laws" and that terrorism should not be allowed to disrupt the city's elections any further. But he added that if he were a New York City resident, he would write in the name of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is barred by term limits from seeking re-election. His comments seemed likely to encourage the effort to seek a suspension of the term-limits law. A10

State Response Faulted
The Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, Bret D. Schundler, is criticizing New Jersey's response to the World Trade Center attacks and has released his own plan to improve the state's defenses against terrorism. He says the State Police and the National Guard reacted too slowly to the attacks. A9

Stocks Plummet Again
America's stock markets fell again yesterday, ending one of the worst weeks in their history, as fears of a deepening recession led many investors to move their money out of stocks and into less risky assets. The Standard & Poor's 500 index, which includes the largest publicly traded American companies, ended Friday just above its low of Aug. 31, 1998, the last time fears of a worldwide recession overwhelmed Wall Street. For the week, the Dow dropped 1,379.70 points, or 14.3 percent, its largest drop since the Great Depression; the S.& P. 500 gave up 126.74 points, or 11.6 percent; and the Nasdaq composite index fell 272.19 points, or 16.1 percent.

 BODY:
 The governor of the Bank of Canada, David A. Dodge, left, said economic growth in the third quarter would probably be "close to zero or slightly negative" because of disruptions from the attacks on the United States, Canada's largest trading partner. The events of last week would also affect the fourth quarter and "obviously bring with them further economic uncertainty with respect to the timing and extent of a rebound," Mr. Dodge said after a speech that he was scheduled to deliver was canceled because of air travel problems brought on by the attack.

HEADLINE: Afghans Can Be Our Allies 

BYLINE:  By Barnett R. Rubin; Barnett R. Rubin is director of studies at the Center on International Cooperation at New York University.

 BODY:
As the United States plans an attack against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime that continues to shelter him, we need to recognize that destroying Afghanistan will accomplish nothing. The Soviets, the Islamic militants we once armed, and the Taliban and their Pakistani backers have already done so. About a third of the capital, Kabul, is as ruined as the World Trade Center.
 Ordinary Afghans have already suffered for years from wartime devastation. Increasing the suffering could fuel more terrorism. A successful American operation against terrorism based in Afghanistan would have to help people there establish a legitimate government and rebuild their country. 
 Despite the Taliban decision yesterday not to hand over Mr. bin Laden, the suggestion the day before by the Afghan clerics that he leave the country voluntarily may reveal dissension within the leadership.
After all, Afghans did not join that movement in order to wage war on the United States in defense of foreign terrorists. Rather, they were hoping to address the chaos in their country through the imposition of strict Islamic law. Over time, elements of the Taliban developed close ties to non-Afghan militants, but not all want to destroy Afghanistan on their behalf. A month after the Soviet collapse ended aid to Afghanistan's Communist government, its top military commanders mutinied. Some Taliban commanders may similarly now have their fingers to the wind.
The Taliban's chief sponsor, Pakistan, terrified by the consequences to itself of a possible American attack on Afghanistan, should be using all its resources to induce the Taliban leadership to deliver the wanted men. And we must ensure that our own need to respond to last week's horror does not lead us to take actions that stir up Afghan nationalism that will only bolster the Taliban leadership and the foreign extremists to whom it has given safe harbor.
The United States and its allies must also work with two other focal points of Afghan politics: the United Front, the armed resistance led by Ahmed Shah Massoud until his recent assassination, and exiles working with the former king, Zahir Shah, now in Rome, who are trying to convene a loya jirga, or a traditional Afghan assembly. Together, these two forces combine leaders of all the country's ethnic groups. And individuals within them are trying to work together on Afghanistan's political future.
The United Front's forces are in areas dominated by ethnic minorities, but some now involved with Zahir Shah, including former mujahedeen, might also be able to raise troops, including recruits from the predominant Pashtun ethnic group in whose territory Mr. bin Laden's followers are largely based.
This would require international support. The United States should ask Pakistan to guarantee full freedom of action to Afghan leaders who appear capable of establishing a stable government that will meet minimal international standards. In return, these Afghans should acknowledge Pakistan's concerns by, for instance, settling the two countries' longstanding border dispute. The United States could also accede to Pakistani requests for economic aid and debt relief in exchange for agreeing to these and other conditions, like those relating to American military access.
Simply overthrowing an objectionable government, as the Communists were overthrown in 1992, is not enough. The result then was the anarchy that gave rise to the Taliban and created opportunities for foreign terrorists. This time, the United States and other countries must push for a more stable outcome by planning now for the reconstruction of an Afghanistan governed by legitimate authorities, possibly with the assistance of the United Nations. This would give Afghans a stake they now lack in the global community. It would also allow the new government to secure the country and win the cooperation of local people in rooting out terrorists.
This will take time, but President Bush has said that he intends to win this war against terrorists and those who harbor them, not engage in halfway measures. To do this, he will need Afghan leaders with a sure knowledge of the country and popular support. Historically, those who have invaded Afghanistan have met ignominious ends. Mr. bin Laden and his allies may hope that they can draw the United States into the same trap that devoured the Soviet Union. If we lash out militarily without a political plan for Afghanistan, they could achieve this. But we can frustrate their hopes if we recognize that the Afghan people can be our firmest allies in this fight.

HEADLINE: 43% Decline in Morgan Stanley Earnings 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company reported a 43 percent decline in third-quarter earnings yesterday as a prolonged stock slump cut trading commissions and investment banking fees, and extended the Wall Street firm's slide to four consecutive quarters.
 The firm, which was the largest single tenant in the World Trade Center, said its short-term business outlook turned "decisively negative" after the terror attacks last week. 
 While nearly all of the firm's 3,700 employees at the twin towers escaped without harm, revenue from trading and investment banking activity are likely to slow further, the chief financial officer, Stephen Crawford, said in a conference call. 
"It's been an enormous emotional crunch at a difficult time," Mr. Crawford said. Investors have taken a wait-and-see attitude with their portfolios, but "it's unlikely that they will pick up until there's more clarity on the economic front."
For the quarter ended Aug. 31, Morgan Stanley earned $705 million, or 62 cents a share, down from $1.25 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier.
Excluding a charge of $30 million for paying down debt, earnings were $735 million, or 65 cents a share, in the latest quarter.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had forecast earnings of 64 cents a share. Morgan Stanley's stock rose $2.46, to $40.08 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Revenue fell 16 percent, to $5.27 billion from $6.31 billion.
The firm expects the trade tower disaster to cost in the range of $150 million, much of which will be covered by insurance, Mr. Crawford said. Many of the affected employees have been relocated, but sales to individual investors have already fallen 20 percent since the attacks.
Even before the attacks, major Wall Street firms were in a profit slide because of an extended slump in trading activity and in mergers and acquisitions.
Revenue in Morgan Stanley's individual investor division slid 20 percent, to $1.1 billion, as trading activity by individuals remained "sharply below last year's levels," the firm said.
Advisory fees from investment banking slipped 30 percent because of a "sharp decrease" in global merger activity that began last year, and underwriting revenue fell 34 percent as issues of new stock tumbled.

PERSON: Neil D. Levin 

HEADLINE: Neil Levin, Executive Director Of Bistate Port Authority, 46 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
Neil D. Levin, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the landlord for the World Trade Center complex as well as the operator of the New York City area's three major airports, port facilities, bridges and tunnels, died on Sept. 11 in the collapse of the twin towers.
 He was 46 and lived in Manhattan. 
 Mr. Levin was appointed to the Port Authority leadership in March by Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Acting Gov. Donald DiFrancesco of New Jersey, who jointly oversee the Port Authority. Previously, Mr. Pataki had named Mr. Levin to the top jobs in the state banking and insurance departments. 
Mr. Levin's office was on the 68th floor of 1 World Trade Center, which was the first tower to be hit by a hijacked airplane and the second to collapse. Mr. Levin's exact location at the time of his death is not known.
Mr. Levin, who grew up in Atlantic Beach, N.Y., received a bachelor's degree in economics from Lafayette College and a master's in business administration from the C. W. Post Center of Long Island University's Graduate School of Business.
After getting a law degree at Hofstra University, Mr. Levin went to work as counsel to the securities subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee, headed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. While there, Mr. Levin helped to draft the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984, which came in reaction to the trading scandals that shook Wall Street in the early 1980's.
Mr. D'Amato and Claudia Cohen, the entertainment reporter who was then his girlfriend, arranged a blind date for Mr. Levin and Christine Ann Ferer, a contributing style correspondent for NBC. They were married in May 1996. In addition to his wife, Mr. Levin is survived by his mother, Gloria, of Atlantic Beach, N.Y.; a brother, Stanley, of Westchester County; and his wife's two daughters from a previous marriage.
In seven years as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of New York, Mr. Levin helped oversee the bank's transition from a regulator of financial institutions to a profit-seeking business. The New York office of the bank board offers financing to housing and community development lenders in New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
In 1985, Mr. Levin joined Goldman Sachs & Company; he was promoted to vice president two years later. He assisted federal agencies with investment banking and was an adviser to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal home loan programs. 
In 1994, Mr. Pataki, whose election campaign was supported by Mr. D'Amato, appointed Mr. Levin the state's superintendent of banks. In that position, he had oversight of 4,500 banks, thrifts and other financial institutions within New York State. He also helped oversee the initial stages of the state's inquiry into the actions of Swiss banks during World War II. In 1997, Mr. Pataki appointed Mr. Levin superintendent of the State Insurance Department and head of the Commission on the Recovery of Holocaust Victims' Assets.

HEADLINE: Kuwait Emir in London Hospital For 'Limited' Brain Hemorrhage 

BYLINE:  Agence France-Presse

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, was flown to London today for medical treatment after suffering a brain hemorrhage, state television reported.
 Sheik Jaber, 73, had suffered a "limited" brain hemorrhage, state television said, but was "stable" and was being flown to London to complete his medical treatment. 
The report said that the emir was fully conscious and that his condition did not require intensive care. 
 King Fahd of Saudi Arabia sent a separate hospital plane to accompany the emir's flight to London, the kingdom's official SPA news agency reported.
According to the Constitution, the crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, becomes head of the small, oil-rich state if the emir becomes incapacitated.
Sheik Jaber was hospitalized earlier today and slipped into a semicomatose state, but later regained consciousness, a Kuwaiti political source said.
Sheik Jaber became emir in 1977. He has ruled during Kuwait's worst modern crises -- first an economic crash, then the invasion by Iraq in 1990 -- but even those events could not overshadow his popularity.
The interim leader, Sheik Saad, 71, has headed successive governments since 1978, but has also suffered health problems recently and underwent colon surgery in early 1997.
Since then he has been delegating extensive authority to Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the first deputy prime minister and foreign minister. 
Sheik Sabah, who is the emir's brother, is third in the ruling hierarchy and has effectively been running the emirate's day-to-day affairs, particularly since February, when the current cabinet was formed.
The emir's government strongly condemned the attacks last week on the United States, and subsequently put the armed forces on alert. It is linked by a defense pact to the United States, which has around 4,500 troops stationed in the emirate.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Japan Will Set Up Fund to Purchase Bad Loans From Banks

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The Japanese government unveiled its long-awaited bad-loan cleanup program today, in a campaign intended to mollify foreign and domestic critics before Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi flies to Washington on Monday to meet President Bush. 
 The official tally of nonperforming loans on the hands of Japanese banks is now put at $368 billion, but many analysts say the true figure is much higher. 
 In the new plan, the government promised to set up a fund to buy those loans from the banks, but gave only a few sketchy details about how the fund would be financed. With an International Monetary Fund auditing team expected to arrive here this fall, the government also promised to monitor bank-loan portfolios more strictly. 
"We wanted to send a message that we are taking aggressive steps in dealing with bad loans," Heizo Takenaka, Japan's economy minister, said today.
Investors seemed unimpressed. The benchmark Nikkei 225-stock index fell 2.3 percent, to close at 9,554.99. Shares of two of Japan's largest banks, Mizuho Holdings and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, fell nearly 5 percent today, a day after Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook on the long-term ratings of seven major Japanese banks to negative from stable.
"The market needs a stronger message," said Yoshinubu Yamada, a bank analyst for Merrill Lynch Japan, in an interview this evening. "That's why the market went down. The market seems to expect some form of public support."
Hakuo Yanagisawa, the country's chief financial regulator, reiterated the Koizumi government's stance against using tax money to solve the loan problem. "If we use public money to cover losses, it will be tantamount to injecting public funds into banks."
Mistrust of Japan's banks extends from the International Monetary Fund to the corner noodle shop owner in Tokyo. With new rules limiting deposit insurance to $75,000, due to take effect in March, about half of the 4,300 households included in a recent government survey said they had shifted their deposit to a bank they regarded as more creditworthy.
For banks, Japan's falling stock market amounts to more than a vote of no confidence. Another regulatory change will force them to list their stockholdings on their books at whatever they are worth next Friday, when the first half of Japan's fiscal year ends. Since the fiscal year began on April 1, stocks have fallen by about one-third, deeply eroding the banks' capital in a way they can no longer gloss over. Analysts estimate that the banks face booking about $40 billion in losses under the new rule, much of it from "old economy" investments dating back to the 1960's and 1970's.
"I think there is an awareness that the time is over for talk, and the time is now for action," Horst Kohler, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said on Thursday.
In the short term, action is expected to lead to higher unemployment, as Japan struggles with its fourth recession in a decade. Today, Kobe Steel announced that it would lay off 25 percent of its 14,000 workers over the next 18 months. On Thursday, Mitsubishi Electric doubled its expected job cutbacks to 2,000 workers, and Minolta said it would shut a factory and lay off 2,500 workers, most of them in Japan.
More jobs will undoubtedly be eliminated when the government privatizes six public corporations and the operations of Japan's three largest airports, under a plan announced today. Decisions on whether to sell or shut down seven more government-owned companies, including four construction companies, will be made by the end of the year, the government said.
Referring to the privatizations, regulatory changes and plans to clean up bad loans, Jason Rogers of Barclays Capital Japan said, "These measures do show a genuine intent to confront the problem seriously, but we have to see the actual implementation of it before we get too excited."
After a decade of dragging out the death throes of companies that would be deemed terminal elsewhere, skepticism has become deeply rooted among foreign financial observers here.
Two weeks ago, in the 25th-anniversary edition of The Asian Wall Street Journal, editors took their hand at writing the news for the year 2026. The Japan item started: "In a resolution passed by the Diet in Tokyo on a voice vote, legislators agreed that the recession that began some 35 years ago had become a 'problem.' "

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE AIRLINES; 
Toll Mounts As Northwest Plans to Cut 10,000 Jobs

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines said yesterday that it would eliminate 10,000 jobs, pushing to more than 70,000 the number of job cuts the nation's largest airlines have announced since the terrorist attacks last week. 
 The Northwest Airlines Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest carrier, disclosed the 19 percent reduction in its 53,000-member work force as Continental, American and several other airlines began sending out layoff notices just days after announcing large-scale cutbacks. 
 Many airlines have reduced their daily flight schedules by about 20 percent as their passenger loads dropped sharply after the terrorist hijackings. 
"This is a very painful decision," said Richard H. Anderson, the chief executive of Northwest. "However, the current operating environment dictates that we reduce our flying schedule significantly."
Delta Air Lines said yesterday that it would also announce job reductions soon. Delta has already said that it was reducing its flight schedule by 15 to 20 percent, indicating it might eliminate 12,000 to 16,000 of its 80,000 workers.
Taken with the announced layoffs, Delta's would bring the total number within the industry close to 100,000.
The large number of layoffs has stunned many airline employees and angered many union leaders.
Pat Friend, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, called the layoffs unnecessary and accused the airlines of trying to create political pressure on Congress to approve a multibillion-dollar bailout package for the industry.
Saying the layoffs were worsening the crisis caused by the terrorist attacks, Ms. Friend said: "The tactics of these airlines are un-American. Their greed and antipathy toward workers are needlessly going to hurt thousands more working families."
Union officials at Northwest said they hoped to minimize the number of layoffs by urging many workers to take voluntary furloughs during which they would receive unemployment insurance and continued health insurance.
In recent days, both American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, and United Airlines have said they would eliminate 20,000 positions each, while Continental said it would cut 12,000 jobs and US Airways, 11,000. Smaller airlines have also said they will layoff workers.
Continental plans to close its flight attendant base in Los Angeles and its 950-employee reservations center in Denver.
Officials at several other airlines said they did not know which cities and regions would be hit hardest by the job reductions, depending in part on which workers take voluntary furloughs and on the geographical distribution of the companies' seniority lists.
Under union contracts at many airlines, the most junior employees are to be laid off first.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMY; 
Corporations Ask Bush to Move Fast on Offering Stimulus Package

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The nation's largest corporations urged President Bush today to act immediately to help the faltering economy, putting pressure on the White House to rethink its plan to wait several weeks before deciding on the need for additional tax cuts and government spending.
 In a letter delivered to the White House, the Business Roundtable, which represents 150 multinational corporations in most major industries, said the terrorist attacks last week threatened what was already a weak economy and that the federal government should respond quickly with a stimulus package. 
 "We believe that the economic stimulus should be broad based, have an immediate impact, stimulate demand and spur both consumer and business spending alike," said the letter, which was signed by the group's chairman, John T. Dillon, the chief executive of the International Paper Company.
"This action should be taken as quickly as possible; quick and decisive action will send a positive signal to both the markets here and abroad," the letter said. 
The group drafted the letter after an hour-and-a-half conference call on Thursday among executives from nearly every part of the economy, like oil and gas, consumer products, railroads, financial services and automobiles. The call took place after it became clear over the last few days that both the administration and Congress had decided, partly at the behest of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to hold off for a week or two before trying to assess whether the economy needed more help.
Asked about the pressure from the business group for fast action, Kenneth W. Dam, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in an interview that while there had obviously been a shock to the economy, it was by no means clear that emergency action on a stimulus package was necessary.
"Is this an economic problem or a reconstruction problem?" Mr. Dam said. "It's important not to rush to judgment on that."
But other business groups also signaled to the White House today that the economy was in an increasingly perilous state and that it should not delay in acting to reverse the decline in economic activity and confidence.
Among them was the National Association of Manufacturers, which sent the White House a letter proposing a detailed plan of tax cuts for individuals and corporations.
"There's no question but that the overwhelming majority of the business community feels that prompt action is necessary, in part to provide additional stimulus to the economy, but, in addition, to strengthen business and consumer confidence," said Jerry Jasinowski, the manufacturing group's president.
Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that it was too early to know how much damage the economy had sustained in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and that it was therefore premature to settle on a policy response. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said at the hearing that the administration had the same view.
But with airlines and other companies laying off tens of thousands of workers and with nearly every industry feeling some aftershock from the attacks, there is growing political pressure on Congress and the White House to take some action.
A survey of its members by the National Association for Business Economics concluded that the economy was now in recession. The survey, released today, said the economists projected growth of 0.2 percent in the current quarter -- 1.2 percentage points lower than in their previous estimate -- followed by a decline in growth of 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter, 2.8 percentage points below their previous projection.
The economists cited "a drop in consumer confidence following the terrorist attacks that will prompt a consumption slowdown."
A survey released today by the Conference Board, a business research group, found that nearly half of Americans thought that the economy was headed toward a recession.
In its letter to Mr. Bush, the Business Roundtable said it was concerned "that the events of last week will further threaten what was already a slowing economy and significantly dampen consumer confidence."
The letter also noted that the weakness in the American economy could feed into, and be worsened by, a global slowdown in economic activity. "A stimulus package quickly implemented would help to shore up the global economy," the letter said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DISCOURSE; 
Will Real Life Supplant Desire For Reality TV?

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

 BODY:
It seemed this week as if the World Trade Center disaster, like a plague of Egypt, had stripped off layers of the city's narcissism and venality, leaving grief-stricken, fearful residents cleansed of the era's more frivolous preoccupations.
 Friends e-mailed one another a poem by W. H. Auden that begins: 
PUB-DATE: September 1, 1939
I sit in one of the dives
On Fifty-second Street
Uncertain and afraid 
As the clever hopes expire
Of a low dishonest decade:
Waves of anger and fear
Circulate over the bright
And darkened lands of the earth,
Obsessing our private lives;
The unmentionable odour of death
Offends the September night.
Change seemed inevitable and in some ways even right. 
But was it lasting? For those fortunate enough not to have lost a relative, friend or home in history's worst terrorist attack, a new debate seeped into the city's discourse: are the devotees of surface pleasures merely stunned or forever chastened?
Many asserted that a society obsessed with celebrity and all that glistens would move past its fixation on tabloid articles about Lizzie Grubman and Ben Affleck's doings. There would be no need to manufacture peril with familiar reality shows like "Survivor" and "Fear Factor." The world, and its real dangers, would suffice. David Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on Vietnam, observed on "Charlie Rose" that the binge and self-absorption of contemporary America had reached its limit. Quoting John F. Kennedy, he warned that the country was in for "a long, twilight struggle."
Tom Brokaw, the NBC anchorman whose best-selling book about World War II, "The Greatest Generation," helped spur a nostalgia boom for more heroic times, noted that people who yearn for what he described as "a more authentic experience" should be careful what they wish for. "We are not going to put 18 million men into uniforms or stop making cars to produce tanks," he said. "But there is no question that we have been making whoopee in this country, and that is coming to an end."
Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair, pronounced the age of cynicism over. 
Christopher Buckley, a novelist and magazine editor, said: "It feels like a unique point in history, a cultural circuit breaker. This has had a great detrivializing effect: are we really going to keep talking about what Julia Roberts wore last night on yet another TV awards show?" 
Yet there were signs that the cult of celebrity would not die without a fight. Television has not changed, just adapted. Last night, most networks set aside their regular schedules to simulcast a star-studded benefit for victims of the terrorists called "America: A Tribute to Heroes" that cast Julia Roberts, Tom Cruise and George Clooney in an Academy Awards-style extravaganza refitted to match the mood of a nation in mourning.
"I see that show as my best defense when people say we are not interested in all that celebrity stuff anymore," said Jonathan Wald, executive producer of "Today," on NBC. "Anybody who says they know what the world is going to be like in six months is lying or deluded. I don't think you can say now that we won't ever again care what J-Lo is doing." 
As the nation grieves and the stock market plunges, conspicuous consumption seems tasteless and even reckless. Yet certain reflexes linger. An e-mail message that originated in Los Angeles and quickly found its way to Manhattan proposed a shop-athon to support the victims and the economy. It began: "On Sept. 20-23, in addition to your normal spending, buy one additional item, use one additional service and donate $20 to your favorite charity. I can hear the laughter now ('You want us to help America by shopping?')."
Urging recipients to buy boats, computers or even just a newspaper subscription, the letter explained, "While New York prepares to mourn the World Trade Center victims on Sept. 23, let's give the survivors jobs and a brighter, secure future." 
Fashion Week closed down for a week after the attack, reopening with subdued shows that featured flags and red, white and blue ribbons. But after 10 days of struggling for an "appropriate" mode of expression, many in the industry reverted to fashion world tropes. 
"Designers are always impacted by their environment; how could they not think of this moment as they pick fabrics for next season?" Marylou Luther, editor of the International Fashion Syndicate, told The Associated Press. "If I were a designer, I would be working with NASA and perfecting clothes impervious to anthrax. I'd try to design clothes to solve the problems of our troubled world." 
The character of the "greatest generation" was formed over a decade that spanned the Great Depression and World War II. Can their children change their mores in just 10 days? 
Michael Kinsley, the editor of Slate, suggested that the more apocalyptic harbingers were proof that baby boom narcissism survived intact. "For most of us it's at worst too early to say whether everyday life will be permanently and dramatically altered," Mr. Kinsley wrote in an essay this week. "And there's something self-indulgent about assuming so, just as there was something self-indulgent about the hunger for 'change' in what we now regard as the pre-Sept. 11 Eden."
Human nature certainly did not change overnight.
As in any disaster, a few rats wriggled for position between the victims, volunteers and heroes. Some people looted the ruins of the World Trade Center. Wealthier opportunists raised Manhattan rents. Fearing a public revulsion, the Real Estate Board of New York sent a memo to its members on Sept. 14 reminding owners to "make deals based on market decisions as they were immediately preceding Sept. 11." 
Historians, perhaps understandably, preferred not to rush to judgment. 
"I am skeptical that this is a great rupture in the fabric of history," said Alan Brinkley, a professor of American history at Columbia University. "I think we have been overstating the long-term impact. A lot depends on what the international repercussions are. But a year from now, some things may be different, but we will not be in a different world. Right now, the terrorist attack was so traumatic it is hard to imagine that anything could be the same again. But bad economic times, which were coming anyway, will affect the character of our culture more than the disaster." 
Not everyone found solace in thinking that at least the worst excesses of the age were eliminated. 
"I think it's especially funny that the editors of Vanity Fair have become the new imams, spouting moral seriousness and declaring that all frivolity must come to an end," said Mark Horowitz, an editor at New York magazine. "If tourism, real estate and finance in New York collapse, then people will really be earnest and serious. If we lose our frivolity, that really is a victory for terrorists."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE APPOINTEE -- Man in the News; 
Rising Star in Crucial Job -- Tom Ridge

BYLINE:  By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Hours after United Airlines Flight 93 went down in southwestern Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, killing all 44 people aboard, Gov. Tom Ridge was at the crash site.
 Mr. Ridge, a Vietnam veteran, said there were no words to describe what he had seen, and asked Pennsylvanians for their prayers. Though he was visibly shaken, his voice was calm, his manner reassuring. 
 Returning to the area on Monday for a memorial service for the victims, he told family members that their loved ones had died heroes, and that their reported attempts to overpower their hijackers should inspire Americans to "be empowered, not helpless, in the face of evil."
Four days later, he is living out his words. Mr. Ridge, 56, was in Washington on Thursday when President Bush, in his address to a joint meeting of Congress, named him to a new cabinet-level post: director of the Office of Homeland Security, where he will coordinate the efforts of more than 40 federal agencies to prevent terrorist activities.
Back in Philadelphia, one of the most Democratic cities in the nation, fans at a Flyers hockey game watched Mr. Bush's speech on huge TV screens and erupted in cheers for the Republican governor.
Tom Ridge's moment has arrived. Last year, Mr. Ridge, a rising star in the Republican Party, was said to be Mr. Bush's choice of running mate, a selection that some people said was dropped because of Mr. Ridge's moderate position on abortion.
Now, instead of serving out his term until January 2003 and returning to private life, he will resign on Oct. 5 and head to Washington.
"This is the culmination of 22 years of friendship," said Al Neri, editor of the Pennsylvania Report, a political newsletter. "Bush is looking for someone he trusts. He's been looking for a high spot to put Tom Ridge in.
"He couldn't put him on the vice president ticket because of his position on abortion. He didn't give him secretary of defense because there was commotion from Cheney and Falwell. This time, the atmosphere was correct." 
Mr. Ridge's press secretary said the governor would not speak to reporters today. 
Republicans and Democrats alike heaped praise on Mr. Ridge. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, a longtime friend of Mr. Ridge, called him "one of the most admirable men I've ever known."
Senator McCain and others said Mr. Ridge's experience as a successful governor of a large state, former prosecutor and Army veteran -- as well as his close relationship to the president -- made him well-suited for a difficult job.
"Tom has great personal skills," said Ed Rendell, a former Democratic national chairman who as mayor of Philadelphia worked with Mr. Ridge. "This position will intrude on the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the Justice Department. You're going to have to get all these agencies on the same page, without turf wars. Tom can get everyone pulling on the same oar."
Still, he said, the new post is fraught with hazard for Mr. Ridge.
"These groups don't have a history of working together all that well," Mr. Rendell noted. "You turn away 28 threats out of 30 from terrorist groups, and if two get through, you're going to get blamed for it."
The governor took the job, he said, "because of his personal relationship with the president and because Tom Ridge is a true patriot."
Mr. Ridge, the son of a meat salesman, grew up in a housing project in Erie, and went to Harvard University on a scholarship. After a year at Dickinson Law School, he was an Army staff sergeant in Vietnam, where he won the Bronze Star. He finished law school, returned to Erie and practiced law. He and his wife, Michele, have a daughter and son: Lesley, 15, and Tommy, 14.
Mr. Ridge's friendship with the Bushes dates to 1980, when he was an assistant district attorney in Erie County and became involved in the presidential campaign of the elder George Bush. It was then he met the younger Mr. Bush. Two years later, when Mr. Ridge ran for the House, a race he was expected to lose in heavily Democratic Erie County, then-Vice President Bush campaigned for him. Mr. Ridge won by 729 votes.
In 1993, Mr. Ridge ran for governor. Campaigning on a tough-on-crime platform, he won a closely contested, three-way race. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1998.
As governor, Mr. Ridge has cut taxes and cut regulations in an effort to help create a pro-business climate. He has tried to replace the state's faded industrial base with high-technology jobs, meeting with moderate success, Mr. Neri said.
Following Gov. John Engler in Michigan, and Gov. Tommy G. Thompson in Wisconsin, Mr. Ridge revised Pennsylvania welfare laws. He has also tried to reform public education, with efforts like teacher accountability and what critics call "back-door vouchers" -- tax credits to businesses that donate money for private-school scholarships.
"He's had two things most governors have never had -- hundreds of millions of surpluses every year, which he's inherited, and a good economy," said Terry Madonna, a political scientist at Millersville University in Lancaster. "He's been able to spend money, expand programs, raise no taxes, cut no programs, lay off no employees."
Mr. Ridge has also enjoyed seven years of Republican control of both houses of the State Legislature.
"He's never had to negotiate with the Democrats," Mr. Madonna said. "Where are the blood-and-guts decisions? He hasn't had to make those. That doesn't mean he can't make them."
At the time of the attacks, the governor was in Erie. Returning to Harrisburg, the state capital, Mr. Ridge entered a meeting of state officials already underway at the emergency operations center.
"There was confusion and anxiety," recalled Martin Horn, Pennsylvania's secretary of administration. "He walked into the room and imposed order on chaos."
"He set priorities," Mr. Horn added. "The priorities were to deal with the plane crash, to get search and rescue personnel to the scene, to provide immediate rescue to anyone who might have survived, and to assist the feds.
"He was insistent that the facts be reported," Mr. Horn said. "He said, 'We have to be strong, we have to be reasonable, we have to not create panic.' "

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE BAILOUT; 
AN AIRLINE BAILOUT

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ with STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Congress overwhelmingly passed a $15 billion package today to bail out the ailing airlines and agreed to set up an open-ended federal fund to compensate victims of last week's terrorist attacks. The plan passed by a vote of 96 to 1 in the Senate and by 356 to 54 in the House.
 The plan now goes to President Bush, who strongly supports the bailout. 
 Sponsors described the legislation, which also provides relief to aviation insurers, as crucial to the health of the nation's transportation system. 
"If we hadn't passed this package today, by Wednesday of next week, because of insurance questions and liability questions, a number of airlines would have had a number of their airplanes firmly on the ground," said Representative Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican who helped write the legislation. "And they would have never gone up again." 
In establishing a victim compensation fund, the legislation sets no limits on the amount of money a victim can receive in economic damages and pain and suffering. Lawmakers said today that they had no idea how much the provision could ultimately cost, but with the death toll presumed to be in the thousands insurance experts said claims could easily rise to $18 billion. 
The fund is intended to protect the airlines from liability for damages and deaths on the ground, something airline executives and their lobbyists said was crucial to their financial well-being. It also tries to address the needs of victims. Victims and their families will have a choice of suing United Airlines and American Airlines, whose planes were hijacked, but they could avoid years of litigation by instead seeking compensation from the fund. No punitive damages would be paid from the fund. Lawsuits would be consolidated in Manhattan federal court.
Under the bill, an official appointed by the attorney general would handle the victims' cases and determine awards. If those figures exceeded benefits collected from other sources, including life insurance policies and relief funds, the government would pay the difference.
The government would later try to recoup some of its costs from the airlines' insurers, though it is unclear how much pressure the government would put on the insurers. Each of the two airplanes that crashed into the World Trade Center in New York carried $1.5 billion in liability insurance. The airlines, and their insurers, would still be fully liable for claims by survivors of the passengers aboard the hijacked jets. 
The president of the Association of American Trial Lawyers, Leo V. Boil, said the group, with 60,000 members, would provide free legal services to victims who go before the special master, a step likely to ease some lawmakers' concerns about lawyers profiting from the tragedy.
James P. Kreindler, a lawyer in the New York firm of Kreindler & Kreindler, which has been retained by some survivors, said the legislation gives wide latitude to both the Justice Department and the special master to devise a fair compensation plan. "This will be as good as the people who are appointed," he said.
Besides giving airlines cover on the liability issue, the bill also offers them $5 billion in cash for their immediate losses and $10 billion in loan guarantees to help persuade the capital markets to lend them money -- the money is not allocated over any specific time period.
A four-member board would be charged with overseeing the distribution of the loan guarantees. The board would be led by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, or his representative, and would include Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta and the comptroller general.
The government would be permitted to share in a carrier's future profits through warrants, stocks or stock options.
With aviation insurers demanding big premium increases to continue providing liability coverage -- without which planes might be grounded -- the bill allows the federal government to reimburse air carriers for their higher insurance costs. It also shifts to the government responsibility for insuring carriers against terrorism for 180 days.
During the afternoon, senior executives from the insurance industry met with President Bush to warn him that they may need more government assistance if there are further attacks.
"The federal government has to backstop the impact on the industry arising out of terrorist activities," Maurice Greenberg, the chairman of American International Group, told reporters after the meeting. A.I.G. is a major aviation insurer and owns a leading aircraft leasing company.
Beyond the action today on Capitol Hill, President Bush said he planned to steer $3 billion of the $40 billion that Congress earlier provided in emergency funds after the terror attacks to increase airline security, including placing federal marshals on airplanes. 
The House and Senate are expected to act next week on legislation to deal with aviation security, which is also critical in persuading Americans to fly again. Many airlines are flying at about 30 percent capacity.
Neither Republicans nor Democrats were satisfied with the consensus bill, but Congressional leaders agreed that legislation needed to move quickly to offset airline losses.
Organized labor officials said the bill favored industry over workers and called it unconscionable that not a dime of the $15 billion would help laid-off employees. Many Democrats agreed and sought assurances that workers would not be forgotten in the weeks to come.
"Members of Congress appear poised to stiff airline industry workers in the bailout bill -- even as they award protections to airline executives for their golden parachutes," said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. 
The bill says that airline executives who make more than $300,000 may not make more money this year and next than they did last year. Plus, their severance pay cannot be larger than two years of salary.
Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader from South Dakota, and the House Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, said the House and the Senate would address concerns about displaced workers, perhaps as early as next week.
Some Republicans, meanwhile, expressed concern that the victim relief fund could cost the government untold sums, arguing that the liability issue should have been dealt with at a later date.
But, with Congress committed to working in a bipartisan way, most lawmakers were willing to set aside their differences and move forward with the bill.
"It's a mixed bag," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, who sought to include money for Amtrak and displaced workers in the package. "So if it's a mixed bag why am I up here supporting this bill? Because I think we're in a new era where everyone has to give a little bit. We are unified. We must keep that unity."
Some lawmakers from both parties called the bill too generous to the airline industry, saying it extends aid beyond their immediate and future losses and fails to take into account their precarious financial positions before the attacks.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 25, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about Congressional passage of a package to bail out the airlines and an agreement to set up a federal fund for victims misspelled the surname of the president of the Association of American Trial Lawyers, which offered free legal services to victims. He is Leo V. Boyle, not Boil.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Picking Up the Tab"The House and Senate are voting on a bill to help the airline industry recover from the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Provisions of the legislation include: $5 billion in cash and $10 billion in loan guarantees for the airlines. The $10 billion in loan guarantees will be distributed by a panel including Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and two Cabinet secretaries. A special government compensation fund for victims or survivors of the attacks. The fund will be overseen by an appointee of the Justice Department. Applicants could file claims to the fund in lieu of seeking compensation from the airlines in court. Airlines' liability for the attacks will be limited to their insurance coverage. The government will assume all liabilities beyond that, as well as liability for any other attack in the next 180 days. In addition, $3 billion from the recently passed $40 billion emergency spending package will be used to help airlines meet stricter security standards instituted after the attacks. (pg. C5)

'To Thine Own Self Be True'

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
"I ask you to uphold the values of America," President Bush said to Congress and the nation. That will be a fair test of his policy for dealing with terrorism as the policy unfolds: Does it uphold the values of America?
 Our government's actions both external and internal should be judged by that standard. Will any military action we take be measured and precise, in keeping with a concern for innocent civilians, or will anger and frustration lead to broader, less discriminating attacks? In attempting to root out terrorists within our borders, will we have a decent respect for privacy and due process of law? 
 Not only humanity and our fealty to law call for attention to those concerns. We have urgent reasons of self-interest to make sure that our struggle against terrorism sticks to American values.
Take the external first. The great danger here is that military attacks of too sweeping a character -- by the heavy U.S. bombers already sent to the Middle East, for example -- would play into the hands of the terrorists and their presumed leader, Osama bin Laden.
A noted military scholar, Sir Michael Howard, former Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, made the point compellingly in The Times of London a week ago. Tracing examples of terrorism over the last 130 years, he said one of the terrorists' principal aims has always been "to provoke . . . savage acts of suppression" that win sympathy for their cause.
Sir Michael said President Bush must be under heavy pressure "to respond in kind, and reply to terror with terror. . . . But were he to do so, he would only multiply the number of the enemies of the United States throughout the world. . . . The strategy of provocation would have won, and Mr. Bush would be playing out the script written for him by the terrorists themselves."
The New York Times reported the other day, in an important story by Patrick E. Tyler and Elaine Sciolino, that the Bush administration was divided on how sweeping the military response to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington should be. Secretary of State Colin Powell was for a measured response, probably targeting Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan. A faction led by Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz wanted to attack Iraq as well.
An attack on Iraq would be intended to remove Saddam Hussein from power. (Right-wing voices on television have been urging just that, blaming President Bill Clinton for the fact that Saddam is still there. But of course it was the first President Bush who failed to remove Saddam at the end of the gulf war.) 
When George H. W. Bush decided not to move against Saddam, the gulf war coalition had 500,000 ground troops on the scene. The idea of undertaking such an effort now seems to me close to lunacy -- not only on military grounds but because it would arouse an Islamic backlash menacing to the governments of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan. 
In his speech to Congress President Bush did not lay out the scope of planned retaliation. He made forcefully clear that there would be military action, as there must be. But he also, wisely, spoke of financial and other steps against the terrorists. And he eschewed his earlier gun smoke rhetoric.
On internal issues, too, the president left the hard questions unanswered. He said law enforcement must have "the additional tools it needs to track down terror." But what tools? Proposals by Attorney General John Ashcroft for greater government powers of surveillance and detention have raised alarms among both liberals and conservatives. If Congress acts without real consideration and care, it could undermine the very quality of freedom under law that most of the world admires.
Americans, we passionately believe, are a humane people. We showed that in restoring wounded economies abroad after World War II, even those of our enemies, Germany and Japan. In due course I think we must make an effort of similar scale to relieve the poverty and misery that are seedbeds for terror in the Middle East.
But right now we need to make sure that we do not forget ourselves in our immediate response to the terrorists' criminal assault. President Bush used three words repeatedly in his speech: "freedom," "patience," "justice." They are the right words.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: COOPERATION; 
U.S. Sanctions On Islamabad Will Be Lifted

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The Bush administration moved today to reward Pakistan, its new partner in the war on terrorism, while European allies signaled their support by endorsing an American military response to the attacks on New York and Washington. 
 The administration told Congress today that it would soon waive economic sanctions against Pakistan and India that were imposed after they tested nuclear weapons in 1998. 
 Officials said the action was a reward for Pakistan's willingness to provide intelligence and logistical support for an American military response to the attacks.
The sanctions, which bar economic and military assistance to Pakistan and India, could be waived as soon as next week, a senior administration official said. 
The administration announced its decision as countries around the world rallied to President Bush's appeal to join the United States in the fight against terrorism.
At a special meeting of the 15-nation European Union in Brussels, leaders endorsed "an American riposte" to the attacks and approved proposals for Europe-wide arrest warrants and stronger laws against money laundering.
Suspects linked to the attacks were detained in Britain, and Germany issued arrest warrants for two others. Page B4. 
The European Union leaders issued a declaration saying: "An American riposte is legitimate. According to their respective means, the member states of the Union are ready to commit themselves to such action." 
Belgium's prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, said European states were now prepared to join military actions "against states harboring or supporting terrorists."
Such military action became more likely -- and perhaps more imminent -- after the Taliban, the militant Islamic rulers of Afghanistan, today rejected any possibility of delivering the prime suspect, Osama bin Laden, a Saudi fugitive with bases in Afghanistan. 
The administration also gained support from China today. Mr. Bush met with China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, who "reiterated his determination to fight terrorism," said Sean McCormack, a White House spokesman. Mr. Tang told Secretary of State Colin L. Powell earlier in the day that China would share intelligence on terrorist groups.
Next week Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan are to meet with President Bush at the White House. 
Before the terrorist attacks last week, the administration was enthusiastically planning to waive sanctions against India. But it was hesitant about lightening the penalties against Pakistan. That hesitancy changed after the Pakistani leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, yielded to Washington's demands to allow his country to become a base for attacks against the prime terrorist suspect, Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban government in Afghanistan. 
In another show of support, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who had opposed the waiving of the sanctions against Pakistan, changed his mind after Pakistan said it would support the antiterrorist campaign. 
Pakistani officials have indicated that they had no problem with sanctions being waived against its archenemy India. Before the terrorist attacks, Pakistan was concerned that the administration might move to lift sanctions against India. 
The administration was also discussing a large American aid package for Pakistan, a senior official said. "We're looking at a big number," the official said. "How much in cash and how much in debt relief is still being debated." The Office of Management and Budget had yet to make decisions on the size of the financial aid, the official said. 
On the sanctions issue, the under secretary of state for political affairs, Marc Grossman, informed congressional leaders that the administration wanted to exercise its right to waive the trade curbs. He found little opposition to the idea, which had been common knowledge for some days.
Indeed, a senior administration official said many members feared that General Musharraf's regime would collapse because of the opposition by radical Islamic leaders to the new alliance with the United States. 
At the moment General Musharraf seems to have his people's support. Pro-Taliban rallies have been routine and mostly mild. But whether that support would last if American bombs hit Afghanistan, a Muslim neighbor, remains to be seen. "There was a widespread feeling on the Hill that if Pakistan supports us, we should support them," the official said. 
The sentiment contrasts sharply to attitudes during the Clinton administration when the State Department vigorously opposed waiving sanctions against either Pakistan or India because they both possessed nuclear weapons. 
The crucial measure to be waived is known as the Glenn amendment, named after former Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, who pushed the law through after the tit-for-tat nuclear tests by India and then Pakistan in 1998. The amendment limits the ability of the United States to provide assistance. 
United States military assistance to Pakistan was already barred under a 1990 amendment proposed by former Senator Larry Pressler, Republican of North Dakota, in an attempt to stop Pakistan acquiring nuclear know-how. An earlier 1978 sanction, named after Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri, was also aimed at preventing the ability of Pakistan to develop nuclear weapons. Both these earlier sanctions would be waived as well, an administration official said.
The quick moves to waive the sanctions coincided with plans announced this week by the International Monetary Fund to go ahead with a sizable loan for Pakistan. 
Successive governments in Pakistan, plagued by corruption, have had trouble meeting economic and financial goals set by the I.M.F. But the managing director of the agency, Horst Kohler, said this week that under a new finance minister, Pakistan had started to perform better. 
In Brussels, the mood among European leaders was resolute. The leaders backed proposals ranging from tougher law enforcement to more stringent financial laws, measures they had rebuffed or dithered about in the past. If the proposals are adopted, judges in Europe would be able to issue arrest and search warrants enforceable across the continent. Extradition procedures would be eliminated. 
All 15 nations of the European Union would adopt the same definition of "terrorist crimes" and assign them higher priorities. The proposal envisions a Europe-wide agreement on prison sentences, with life sentences the maximum. The death penalty is outlawed in the 15 countries. 
If the proposals all pass, a prosecutor in Italy, for example, could swear out a warrant for a British citizen and hand it over to the British police, ordering them to make the arrest and immediately bring the suspect before an Italian judge.
Currently, the Italian prosecutor would have to explain his case to a British prosecutor, confirm that British and Italian law match closely enough to make the act a crime in both countries, wait for a British prosecutor to get a warrant from a British court and make the arrest, and then file an extradition request. 
The changes will be incorporated in a detailed bill to be presented to a conference of European Union justice and home affairs ministers scheduled for Dec. 6. If the proposal passes then, all 15 member countries would try to bring their laws into line.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: VOICES OF OPPOSITION; 
In Europe, Some Critics Say the Attacks Stemmed From American Failings

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The killing of thousands in the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last week has prompted great unity of purpose in the United States, cemented by shared outrage. President Bush has called on the world to unite against barbarism.
 While Europeans have expressed enormous sympathy and solidarity, often in emotional ways, they have also been divided in their responses. A debate has begun over whether the inconsistencies of American foreign policy, and the sheer weight of American dominance in the world, mean that resentment of the United States -- even, in extreme cases, hatred -- are inevitable. 
 There was no rejoicing or support in Europe for the killing of so many Americans. Many Europeans wept and the continent fell silent for a moment last week in remembrance of the dead.
But it has also become clear that some Europeans feel that ordinary Americans have largely floated on a tide of prosperity, triumphalism and indifference to the world since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Their view is that the United States has now been confronted with a sobering reality, and that it must try to understand. For those critics, Americans are now facing unsurprising retaliation from an important part of the Islamic world that considers America to have declared war on its faith.
The arguments are sometimes simple -- America should expect war in return for bombing Iraq regularly. Some Europeans also contend that many Americans have a blinding confidence in their own goodness and so do not see that the acts of the United States are regarded in many quarters as driven by the domineering pursuit of national self-interest.
European writers and intellectuals have pointed to a catalog of actions that include the bombing -- in reprisal for the terrorist bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998 -- of one of Sudan's two pharmaceutical factories on the challenged grounds that it was linked to Osama bin Laden, aid to Israel to buy weapons used against Palestinians, or even the American refusal to intervene to stop the mass killings in Rwanda.
Matthew Parris, a former Conservative Party member of the British Parliament, wrote in The Times of London, "The bigger they come, the harder they fall."
Disgusted by calls for quick revenge, Mr. Parris wrote: "Do they think a terrorist is like a pin in a bowling alley: one down, nine to go? Do they want to give Osama bin Laden his own Bloody Sunday? Do they not know that when you kill one bin Laden you sow 20 more? Playing the world's policeman is not the answer to that catastrophe in New York. Playing the world's policeman is what led to it."
Dario Fo, the Italian playwright and satirist who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1997, said bluntly in a widely circulated e-mail: "The great speculators wallow in an economy that every year kills tens of millions of people with poverty -- so what is 20,000 dead in New York? Regardless of who carried out the massacre, this violence is the legitimate daughter of the culture of violence, hunger and inhumane exploitation."
There have been other voices that pointed to Mr. bin Laden's various enemies: not just the United States but also the autocratic Islamic governments that Washington supports, like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kuwait.
The Observer newspaper wrote: "America needs to recognize that, all too often, it poses as a champion of democracy while supporting regimes, such as that in Saudi Arabia, which have no proper respect for democracy."
Tariq Ali, a leftist British commentator, wrote that America was now about to wage war on Afghanistan, a country ruled by a religious movement, the Taliban, only as a result of Washington's proxy war against the Soviets.
Mr. bin Laden himself joined in that proxy battle, and became a hero partly because of that war.
"The underlying maxim is, 'we will punish the crimes of our enemies and reward the crimes of our friends,' " Mr. Ali said.
In an editorial, Le Monde wrote that America is also unreliable in the sense of appearing inconstant in its choice of allies. The United States, it noted, refused to help Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of anti-Taliban forces who died last weekend from injuries suffered in an assassination attempt. Yet it considers Saudi Arabia an ally, although that "is where the financial support of the Islamic radicals comes from."
Even in Germany, one of Europe's most pro-American countries, there was concern that NATO allies had somehow handed Washington a blank check. Die Zeit commented that, "The defender against terror must not act like a furious giant," adding: "The fear of U.S. hegemony is as deep-seated as the anti-American sentiment that bubbled up predictably after Bush came to power."
Anti-Americanism is almost a reflex reaction among some left-of-center French intellectuals, and there has been a predictable outpouring.
To the cry that "we are all Americans now," Marie-Jose Mondzain, director of the prestigious French National Center for Scientific Research, writing in Le Monde, retorted: "I don't feel at all American, but to the contrary feel redoubled in me all the reasons to condemn a world that sings along with a catastrophic president, who defends the death penalty and who has only disdain for the Middle East."
Such anti-Americanism is rare in Germany. But the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, 73, called the attack on the World Trade Center "the greatest work of art imaginable for the whole cosmos," impressive for the imagination of the act and the precision of its execution.
His commentary was regarded with horror by a nation that has reached out to Americans with sympathy and support, and Mr. Stockhausen apologized, saying that his allegorical remarks had been misunderstood.

TRANSFORMATION OF A PRESIDENCY -- Aides say President Bush believes he has come face to face with his life's mission, the defeat of terrorism. A1

THE COUNTRY'S MOOD

NEW RECRUITS -- Talk of war concerns potential military recruits, but not enough to scare them away. A1

ETHNIC BACKLASH -- Although the country's national political and business leadership is working to avoid a backlash against Arab-Americans, attacks and harassment of brown-skinned people have left several prominent Arab-Americans shaking their heads in disgust. B1

HEADLINE: Americans Don't Understand That Their Heritage Is Itself a Threat 

BYLINE:  By Caleb Carr; Caleb Carr, a novelist and historian, is a contributing editor of "MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History."

 BODY:
We have heard a great deal of talk to the effect that the world will never be the same after the attacks of Sept. 11, that we are living in a new reality, and in one sense this is true. But this is not the first great and violent historical turning point that the United States has faced. In other words, to put it as Lewis Carroll's Mad Hatter might have, we have been in this new world before. 
 America experienced just such a prolonged moment during our own Civil War, when not only armies but also civilians were slaughtered in horrifying numbers because of a long-brewing clash between a dying, slavery-based agrarian society and a vigorous, newly industrial modern state. We weathered another during the days and years following Pearl Harbor, when the majority of Americans had no idea if or where Japanese planes might strike again and were later forced (as we have lately been) to reckon with enemies who were willing to engage in suicidal attacks to achieve their purpose. 
 Yet perhaps the most immediately pertinent of such precedents is offered by a much earlier conflict. In 1814, the United States was engaged in a bitter war, on land and at sea, with the greatest power in the world, the empire from which we had originally rebelled: Great Britain. 
Many analysts of the War of 1812 have tried to explain it as an economic or political conflict of limited importance. But it would have been hard to convince the American civilians who suffered what amounted to terrorist attacks by ruthless British raiding forces between 1812 and 1814 that the conflict was either limited or explicable. The British assaults were astoundingly savage: women and children were mutilated and murdered along with civilian men and soldiers in a deliberate attempt to break the American people's will to fight. These efforts reached their culmination in the last days of August 1814, when a squadron of British ships loaded with soldiers and sailors sailed into Chesapeake Bay and up the Patuxent River with a terrifying objective: to burn the city of Washington to the ground. 
The British force succeeded in this goal. By the night of Aug. 24, the White House, the Capitol, the Library of Congress and many other buildings emblematic of both the newborn capital city and the infant country itself were engulfed in flames. The government had been evacuated at the last minute, its officers (including President James Madison) scattering across the countryside. British action against remaining American soldiers and civilians continued to be, in many cases, merciless. 
The questions asked by Americans in the aftermath of this momentous event were some of the same that I have heard all over our city and country in recent days: Why here? Why this?
The War of 1812 had little to do with specific political grievances or economic rivalries. It was prosecuted by the British because of a deep anxiety over the spread of American democratic republicanism. Having seen the bloody anarchy that had overtaken France during its revolution and having watched the United States peacefully and dramatically multiply its territory through the Louisiana Purchase, the British Empire -- a stratified society still largely controlled by its aristocracy and constitutional monarchy -- had grown deeply fearful that the spread of American-style democratic rebellion would mean not only economic competition abroad but also uprisings at home. In short, the British gratuitously destroyed important structures in Washington (and killed many innocent people) because those buildings were obnoxious symbols of American values whose spread and propagation the London government feared would spell the disempowerment of their own. 
The British were right to fear as much, for in time it was indeed the rise of the United States that set the example for populations in colonies around the world to seize their own destinies and put an end to the imperial, socially regimented system on which British power depended. True, in the 20th century the United States and Britain would become allies in order to face the the common enemies of imperial Germany and, later, Nazi and Japanese totalitarianism. Nevertheless, it was the spread of American values that put an end to the colonialism and imperialism that were the practical and spiritual lifeblood of the British Empire. 
Similarly, it is the spread of American values -- individualistic, democratic, materialistic and, yes, in many ways crass and exploitative American values -- that terrorist groups and the traditionalist, socially repressive societies that support them now fear. This fear has driven them to emulate the British forces of 1814 by damaging and destroying a group of structures that are among the most familiar symbols of contemporary American power. 
Thus the why. But why here? Washington is perhaps understandable, but why New York?
The engine that runs the juggernaut that is expansionist American democratic capitalism (which is the force that opens the way for American cultural predominance) is housed, chiefly, in a comparatively few high-profile buildings at the southern tip of Manhattan Island. Americans look (or in the case of the World Trade Center, looked) on these buildings as some of the most distinctive symbols of all that our city and nation can achieve and have achieved.
Our enemies in this war, by contrast, looked at them and saw -- still see -- the death of their own values, their own ways of life, their effective autonomy. Such perception breeds both malice and fear. Inside those buildings, the people behind this attack believe, is where the end of the societies they come from and the values that they live by was and is being planned (whether consciously or not), and there is where the erosion must be stopped. The terrorist obsession with the World Trade Center was, in this light, not irrational. In fact it was, viewed in the context of a war of cultures, entirely understandable. 
That context must now be fully realized by our side in this conflict. We must all match the sudden comprehension and bravery of the hijacked passengers aboard United Airlines Flight 93, who, realizing that their plane was going to be used as a flying weapon of mass destruction, immediately rose to challenge their captors, thus sacrificing their own lives to prevent a fourth crash that could have killed thousands more Americans.
The people of this country, it has often been truly said, have a very bad sense of their own heritage, and New Yorkers tend to be among the worst offenders in this area. We have been known to pull down historic structures with remarkably little concern, to crumble and pave over our past in order to make way for what we hope will be an even more profitable future. But there are moments when we must overcome this blind tendency and look to our history for both inspiration and solace. We know in our collective memory the nature of this struggle; that understanding must now move from our subconscious to the very forefront of our minds so that we can accept the full dimensions of the conflict that will very soon engulf the lives of not only New Yorkers and Washingtonians but all Americans. 
Yes, this is war, and in all likelihood it will be a vicious and sustained one. What our enemies want is nothing short of an end to our predominance, and they will not forsake terrorism until either they attain that result or we make such behavior prohibitively, horrifyingly expensive. And this worst assault on the United States in its history happened in New York City because it symbolizes all that those same enemies loathe and fear most: diversity, licentiousness, avarice and freedom. Now, as we go about the process of adjusting ourselves to this new world of terrible conflict, we can and must take heart from that one seemingly paradoxical historical observation: both as New Yorkers and as Americans, we have been in this new world before.

I was in Chicago, preparing a speech about uncertainty as an inherent part of business, when the need arose, obviously, to get back to the East Coast, to get home. 
 Mass transport had stopped, and the car-rental companies were booked. In another time, I might have put out a thumb, but all I could think of was to connect with other travelers, so I jogged to the Hilton nearby. A quartet of young to middle-aged businessmen were camped in the lobby. My luck that they had rented a van and were bound for New York, and doubly so that they were of a mind to share it. 
 Because I wanted to feel a part, I bought water and Snickers bars for the gang, but I needn't have; on Tuesday, you could connect with anyone. My companions were part of what is called the global economy; they worked for a company with a German parent that sold, I gathered, digitally enhanced machines all over America. Until a few hours before, each of them had been wining and dining clients at pricey restaurants. 
Now we were eating up highway in states I had seen before only from the air. We talked about the attack, of course, and we murmured into our cell phones. In Toledo, we stopped for gas; I looked at the other drivers in line, and they nodded as if to say, "I'm here for the same reason you are." 
As we rolled by the unrelenting scenery, we heard the same news, transmitted through distinct geographic filters: school closings in Chicago, people giving blood in Dayton. Commentators spoke of Pearl Harbor, but the country seemed too vast to believe it would all shut down or be shunted, ultimately, off its course. The farms in Indiana looked like giant combines; on the pastures in Ohio, the cattle grazed as ever.
The sky darkened, and somebody joked about finding a strip joint. But we were beyond that. The men were calling their wives, and nobody ingested anything stronger than Maalox and Camels. The oldest of the salesmen was frantically trying to learn about a colleague in the World Trade Center. The youngest was telling his wife to keep his kids away from the television. One by one, we lost our batteries, our technological connection. 
Inevitably, the men talked about themselves a little. I gathered that they liked their lives, their work. The oldest had been involved in bailing people out in Vietnam. They didn't want, any of them, to go back to that America of turmoil. 
We stopped for the night at a Holiday Inn in eastern Ohio. We went into a bar for dinner, and even with the televisions showing the awful footage, some locals were carousing with what struck us as too much gaiety. My companions had the grace to remember that perhaps we in the East hadn't paid enough mind to the tragedy in Oklahoma City; perhaps, I thought, that was one reason the president seemed slow to connect to this one. 
We hit the road early Wednesday and didn't stop until lunch at a Denny's, in the eastern part of Pennsylvania now. We ran into a caravan of businesswomen driving westward to Michigan -- our opposites, so to speak -- and it seemed that the entire country had reverted to a pretechnological form of travel. I sensed that they would be ready, if need be, to forsake even automobiles, but not the unceasing motion and energy of our wonderfully restless country.

HEADLINE: Traveling Like a Magnate 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER; ADAM CLYMER is the Washington correspondent of The Times.

 BODY:
THE other passengers had departed for a predinner nap, so sitting alone, sipping a cold, dry martini and staring at the unfolding Canadian Rockies, I could easily imagine being one of the people for whom this railway car was built 75 years ago -- a railroad magnate.
 For the Mount Stephen was more than the sort of premium observation car that Americans flocked to when they rode the Trans-Canada Limited to escape Prohibition on a trip to or from the West Coast. Paneled in Russian walnut and complete with a dining area and kitchen, it was built for daytime use by a director of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the line that tied Eastern Canada to British Columbia in 1885. Now it serves as the last of five cars of the Royal Canadian Pacific luxury vintage car excursion, the only passenger service Canadian Pacific now operates. 
 This was the Golden/Crowsnest Excursion, traveling 633 miles at a leisurely pace over three days and three nights, starting in Calgary, going north and west as far as Golden, British Columbia, south to Elko British Columbia, east to Lethbridge, Alberta, and then north to Calgary. 
The cars have been meticulously restored, and in the case of our sleeping car, the N. R. Krump, rebuilt. Dominating our walnut-paneled room were two 24-by-36-inch windows and views of the mountains. There were two single beds, fitted together in an L-shape, and for my wife, Ann, and me, a remarkable sufficiency of closet and drawer space in a 9-by-10-foot room. 
Though all quarters were about the same size, some had double beds and one upper and lower berths. All the rooms had good reading lights, but during the day, at least, we ignored our books to look out the windows. The private bathrooms, which have showers, all date to the rebuilding. 
But neither the cars nor a series of dramatic off-train excursions are the story; the Rockies are. Ann and I would stare at them for hours, either from our room or from the observation car.
We saw them clearly just before passing Banff on the first day of our trip, in late June. They were stony above the tree line, with patches of summer snow, and a bit more jagged than the geologically older mountains south of the border. There was no single peak that stood out -- only the sense that for hours we traveled in the midst of mountains whose elemental grandeur outshone the luxuries on board.
The train stopped that first night on a siding at Invermere, British Columbia, overlooking Windermere Lake in the Columbia River Valley. The 16 passengers (22 is capacity) collected in the Mount Stephen for cocktails and the chef Pierre Meloche's hors d'oeuvres, including a delicious smoked oyster concoction.
Dinner started with a zucchini and basil cream soup and continued through a very tender loin of venison with apricots and port wine sauce and a rich Canadian merlot, inspiring table talk. We talked less about who we were (mostly Americans in our 60's, with a Canadian couple and an Australian railway executive who had just retired and his wife) than about the scenery and the day, which had begun with bagpipers playing "Scotland the Brave" as we were piped (and poured, with a good champagne) aboard in downtown Calgary.
After traversing the Bow River Valley, past Banff and Lake Louise, and climbing the Rockies, we had crossed the Continental Divide and stopped at Field for a midafternoon nature walk around Emerald Lake in Yoho National Park (Yoho is a Cree word for "awesome"). We saw no wild animals, but Bruce Bembridge, a naturalist from the Chateau Lake Louise, had a sharp eye for wildflowers. He also took out his telescope to show us the site of the Burgess Shale paleontological dig of 1909, five miles away -- a remarkable pre-Cambrian find whose reinterpretation has altered thinking about evolution. 
After another 35 miles, the train turned south at Golden, leaving the Canadian Pacific's main line for a coal route that took us down the valley of the Columbia, long before it reaches the United States. Here, it was a vast wetland where Bruce pointed out ospreys and a red-tailed hawk.
The trip is expensive -- $4,995 a person (the price does not fluctuate with the exchange rate) -- but it is really all-inclusive, with no tipping and no extra charges for excursions, wine at lunch or dinner, or other drinks. The nights before and after the rail trip are spent at Calgary's spacious, comfortable Palliser Hotel, with dinner and breakfast included. 
The Canadian Pacific, which dropped out of the passenger business in 1970, started these excursions last year, and runs them from May to October. The trip we took is the most popular. There are also specialty tours, a biking-hiking combination and golf and fly-fishing trips.
The off-train excursions, five in all, each offered something beyond what a tourist could do on his own. My own favorite came the second morning, when we got off the train at Fort Steele and took a brief bus ride (a bus followed the train to take us on these excursions) to the Canadian Museum of Rail Travel in Cranbrook, British Columbia. Garry Anderson, the museum director, gave us a private tour through vintage passenger cars, many older than the ones on our train. The Curzon, an observation car with a lounge, a buffet and five staterooms, each paneled in a different fine wood veneer, was built in 1907, he said.
At the time, the Canadian Pacific was competing with United States lines like the Great Northern and Northern Pacific. Running between St. Paul and Spokane, even carrying United States mail, the Canadian Pacific's Soo-Spokane Train Deluxe, which included the Curzon, began on Soo Line tracks controlled by the Canadian Pacific, then on C.P. tracks across the Saskatchewan and Alberta prairies, and back into the United States on a line controlled by the Union Pacific. That train ceased operation in 1913 in a recession, but the Curzon was used on other runs. 
In 1919, Canadian Pacific created the Trans-Canada Limited, "the premier train in Canada, a deluxe hotel on wheels," as Mr. Anderson put it. The museum has a complete set of the Limited's seven cars. The most striking is the dining car, the Argyle, its tables set with Canadian Pacific china from different makers, including Minton and Limoges. The expensive restoration is not yet complete; the car has only 24 of the original 36 walnut and blue calfskin chairs. "We're looking," Mr. Anderson said.
The Trans-Canada Limited was canceled after 1930, but in its day it was the fastest transcontinental run, going from Montreal to Vancouver in 85 hours.
The bus took us 10 miles from the museum to a less meticulous, livelier restoration, the Fort Steele Heritage Town. First a gold rush town, then a Royal Canadian Mounted Police post, Fort Steele hoped to be a major railroad stop, but nearby Cranbrook won out around 1900 and Fort Steele withered away. 
A team of Clydesdales took us to restored buildings, including a working blacksmith shop where we pitched in to help the professionals. At lunch -- a simple beef stew followed by pie a la mode that made a break from the elegance -- we were the guests of Wynne Royer-Towers, an actress in period costume playing Mrs. Phugh, who pretended to take us for railway workers who could somehow influence the choice of where the region's Canadian Pacific hub would be situated. 
After Fort Steele, the train ran along the Elk River, where quite a few anglers were pursuing trout. We stopped on a siding with views across the dark gray waters of Lake Crowsnest and back up the track toward the rocky peak of Crowsnest Mountain. 
Cocktails that evening were served at trainside, and a duo played light airs on the violin and guitar as we relaxed in the twilight. Was I the only one in that opulent railroad baron setting who heard something ironic in one selection -- "Union Maid"? 
They played again, from a classical repertory, in the Mount Stephen after our dinner of roast corn-wild rice cakes with whiskey and sage-cured salmon, a wild mushroom and fresh herb cream soup, rack of veal with red bell pepper sauce, and a chocolate cake with fresh berries and orange sauce. It was all accompanied by a 1997 Casa Lapostolle chardonnay from Chile and a 1998 Louis Jadot Burgundy from Volnay. 
At breakfast the third morning, now back in Alberta, we found ourselves passing through a vast rockslide. It had a grim history. In 1903, 82 million tons of limestone slid off the face of Turtle Mountain, burying part of the town of Frank and killing 70 people. The rail line was reopened in three weeks, but the mountain remains unstable even now; a smaller slide occurred last spring, and the railroad monitors the area. 
We were now out of the Rockies, and our first stop that day was a site where Blackfoot Indians used to stampede buffalo off a cliff. It had been going on for 6,000 years before settlers and hunters began shooting the buffalo in the late 19th century. 
Angie Provost, whose Blackfoot name is Deer Woman, told us how warriors followed the buffalo for three or four days before driving them into a blazing sunrise and onto the rocks below, where a harvest of 30 animals provided meat, robes and sinews for bows that would last a band of 200 through the winter. The site, with an informative visitors center, is known as Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump -- a colorful name whose derivation has various explanations. 
The final stop, late that afternoon, was Spruce Meadows, a spiffy, expansive international show-jumping center at Okotoks, once isolated prairie but now a bedroom suburb of Calgary. Four riders training there put on a special jumping exhibition, and we were shown the barns and invited to enter a contest to name some foals. 
There, as at all the other stops except the nature walk, wheelchairs were provided (and pushed) for two of our group who needed them. The train's corridors were not wide enough for chairs, but my wife, recovering from a broken ankle, and another passenger managed with walkers aboard. 
If passengers want to imagine themselves in the heyday of these grand railroad cars, being a railroad director is not the only option. The office, a small room with a writing table and books in the Mount Stephen, is known as "Winston's cubby," because Winston Churchill retired there to smoke cigars in 1943, when as prime minister, he used the car for a trip from Quebec to Washington and back. 
Princess (now Queen) Elizabeth used the Mount Stephen to travel across Canada in 1951. Her parents, King George VI and Queen Mary, took the adjoining car, the Royal Wentworth, which has two twin rooms, a small dining area and a lounge, for a trip across Canada in 1939.
On the last morning's 28-mile run into Calgary, I got to live another fantasy, riding up front in diesel locomotive 1400 with the engineer, Larry Maskowitz, and the conductor, Richard Burris, not handling the throttle or the brakes, but blowing the whistle as we approached grade crossings. Two longs, a short, and a long.

Through the Rockies in luxury
 The Golden/Crowsnest Excursion is the most popular of four vintage rail tours offered by Royal Canadian Pacific. Others are golf, fly-fishing and bike and hike trips. The excursions run from May to October.
The Golden/Crowsnest is $4,995 (U.S.) a person (it does not fluctuate with the exchange rate), including all meals, wine and drinks, and overnight stays before and after the rail trip at the Palliser Hotel in Calgary, with breakfast and dinner. The train sleeps up to 22, with nine rooms for double occupancy. The N. R. Krump, the sleeping car (there are rooms on other cars), has two single rooms, and four with twin beds. All the cars are air-conditioned.
The dining dress code is business casual for breakfast and lunch, and jackets and tie at dinner.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 23 about a rail tour of the Canadian Rockies misspelled the name of the train's vintage sleeping car and misstated the name of Queen Elizabeth's mother, who once used another car, the Royal Wentworth. The sleeping car is the N. R. Crump, as the picture caption said, not Krump. The Queen Mother is also named Elizabeth, not Mary.

 BODY:
THE events of last week, as unbearable as they were to witness, were ameliorated by the almost total absence of popular culture from the nation's airwaves. Award ceremonies and concerts were canceled. No blockbuster movies opened. No new television shows premiered. It was a temporary respite from the cultural din. Hyperbolic and aggressive selling was not only muted but also seemed, when one stumbled upon it, to belong to an already distant past made irrelevant by the tragedy of Sept. 11. Within this chaos, there was a deep if momentary silence that encouraged us to re-examine ourselves as a people and a culture. 
 What changes could and should occur? The nihilism and violence that are often found in our music and film should be recognized as the cynical entertainment that they are when contrasted with the reality of Sept. 11. The firefighters and police who worked 24-hour shifts were real-life heroes, completely alien to the popular culture's idea of heroism. Artists should feel comfortable with this non-show-biz reality, and let it be reflected in their work. The marketplace can accommodate these truths without losing money. Our notions of profit and value could be adjusted to allow for a greater degree of artistic questioning without an implication that such actions would automatically have adverse economic consequences. Artists could hold themselves to a higher standard of honesty. Corporate America should allow more voices to reach our ears. We are saturated with music and videos that have no relationship to anything but the bottom line. We should encourage the compassion and generosity that flowed reflexively to victims' families and communities in the last week to permeate our everyday lives. 
 It's too soon to predict the ways that the arts will change, but change is inevitable, catastrophe or not. We should recognize that seismic events impact on the creative process and that artistic and spiritual rebirth can follow a shattering experience.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
At Home In Gritty England

BYLINE:  By PETER KOBEL; Peter Kobel is the managing editor of Premiere magazine.

 BODY:
AFTER two American films -- the underrated western "The Hi-Lo Country" and the charming romantic comedy "High Fidelity" -- the British director Stephen Frears returned to Britain for his most recent work, "Liam," which opened on Friday in New York. Like his first feature, "Gumshoe," which he made 30 years ago, "Liam" is set in Liverpool. But it's not as if he's returned to his roots. "Liam" follows the travails of a working-class Catholic family in the depressed 1930's; Mr. Frears was born far from the River Mersey, in Leicester, to an upper-middle-class Jewish family. But he is returning to a kind of filmmaking at which he excels -- small-budget movies (he likes to call them his "hooligan films") with good scripts and fine actors.
 This 60-year-old director couldn't be less like a hooligan, of course. Even though he wore a T-shirt and khakis for an interview in August, he was the epitome of an English gentleman: intellectually curious, self-effacing and unfailingly polite. When this writer ran out of notebook paper during lunch in SoHo, Mr. Frears began to rise, offering to go look for more. 
 Such instinctive empathy has helped him to create a widely varied body of work, whose characters range from street punks to aristocrats, from cowboys to criminals. Mr. Frears, alternately described as "a writer's director" or "an actor's director," offers at once a refuge for writers who hope to see their vision translated to the screen intact and an opportunity for actors to discover their characters. He is a sort of anti-auteur, and his collegial style, his openness to the experience of his collaborators, has afforded him the chance to imaginatively enter different worlds.
While Mr. Frears has worked in Hollywood with decidedly mixed results, much of his best work has been on small films like "My Beautiful Laundrette," "The Snapper" and "The Grifters." Quirky, funny or dark -- sometimes all at once -- they were made without the compromises demanded by big budgets. "The Snapper," a 1993 movie based on Roddy Doyle's novel in which a single girl gets pregnant but refuses to name the father, was budgeted at less than $2 million. "The Grifters" cost $4 million. "What we're good at," Mr. Frears said, making the British film industry sound a little like England during the Blitz, "is living in the cracks and surviving."
The same could be said of the characters in "Liam." Against a backdrop of Liverpool's cobbled streets and smoky pubs, the 7-year-old title character (Anthony Borrows) observes his family's slow, sad descent into poverty after his dad (Ian Hart) loses his job as a dockworker. Liam, who has a stammer, attends Catholic school, which more closely resembles a religious boot camp than an educational institution. His older brother and sister work -- he at the docks, she for the wealthy Jewish family that owns the docks. The father's helplessness makes him increasingly bitter and spurs him to join the fascist Blackshirts in a horrifyingly botched firebombing.
Firebombings and poverty: hardly the stuff of recent British hits like "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "Bridget Jones's Diary." Those high-gloss takes on upper-crust or professional-class Britons, where everyone's teeth are fixed and even the most eccentric characters -- like the wacky Welshman in "Notting Hill" (Rhys Ifans) -- have been sanitized for international consumption, have pushed the British film industry into the international mainstream. Such movies, which prove that not all British filmmakers are living in the cracks, provoke a mixed reaction from Mr. Frears.
"I'm not a tremendous admirer of British film," he said. "People like Tim Bevan" -- whose Working Title film company produced those glossy hits -- "shock me. And he's a friend of mine. They've learned how to make films for export. Nobody ever knew how to do that. But it's not the view of Britain that I have."
When it comes to his native land, Mr. Frears, who describes himself and the director Ken Loach ("My Name Is Joe") as "heroic idiots," takes a much darker view -- if only because Mr. Frears's interests and vision encompass the contradictions and complexity of English society, warts, bad teeth and all.
"He's made stories about all classes," said Hanif Kureishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette," the tale of a gay romance between a white street punk (Daniel Day-Lewis) and a Pakistani (Gordon Warneke). "They're about black people, about Asian people, working-class people, upper-class people, about French people. The diversity in his material is extraordinary and very unusual." 
Mr. Kureishi, who meets Mr. Frears every Friday at a Notting Hill coffee shop to talk politics, sports and occasionally movies, said the vivid characters in "The Snapper" were a case in point.
"The girls are loud, they're tasteless, they're vulgar, they smoke, they drink, they have sex with anyone, but Stephen makes a film about that with real love," Mr. Kureishi said. "He loves their pleasure. He's not judgmental. His films are moral, but he's not a moralistic man. He likes anarchy, he likes pleasure."
"To me, his films are uniquely modern," said Martin Scorsese, who produced "The Grifters," referring to the early Frears movies like "Laundrette" and "Prick Up Your Ears," which is about the playwright Joe Orton, who was murdered by his lover at the height of his fame. What makes the films feel contemporary, he said, is the powerful way they reveal previously ignored parts of English society.
"I found them fascinating because it was a new view of England and a new England expressing itself on film, but also reinventing itself on film," said Mr. Scorsese, who also produced "The Hi-Lo Country." "I've always thought of his films, directly, as whether I've liked the people, whether I want to spend time with them. I didn't notice there was camera. I didn't notice that there was filmmaking. I just noticed that it was cinema about human beings and emotion."
Those who have worked closely with Mr. Frears say that the same respectful approach infuses his work ethic. Jimmy McGovern, the screenwriter for "Liam," said Mr. Frears had put him immediately at ease at their first meeting. "He said to me: 'I'm a middle-class Jew and this is a working-class Catholic film. I don't know anything about the world of this film, so I'll be guided by you.' " Mr. McGovern based his screenplay on Joseph McKeown's book "The Back Crack Boy" and his own memories of childhood.
But Mr. McGovern, speaking by phone from Liverpool, readily admitted that Mr. Frears had known more than he had let on. "I had originally written a scene in which Liam sees a prostitute at work and feels guilty about it," he recalled, his voice thick with a Liverpudlian accent. "Stephen said it isn't quite working. He was a wee bit vague -- he wouldn't impose anything. If there's a problem, the writer has to come up with a solution, which forces you back into your own psyche. I then came up with having Liam see his mother naked, which was a wonderful change."
Mr. Frears's long-leash approach works as well with actors. Mr. Hart ("Wonderland"), another Liverpudlian, agreed that Mr. Frears had allowed him a great deal of latitude. "He gives you enough freedom, he allows you the first go," said the actor, who was in New York recently for a run in Harold Pinter's "Homecoming." "He says: 'What do you think? I don't know anything about this. The reason I cast you is because you know more about it than I do.' He knows what he's talking about entirely, but you get the impression that you're doing it all yourself. He's a wily old fox."
Mr. Frears would no doubt deny any duplicity. "Well, I find that actors do know far more about it than I do," he said. "They're rather intelligent and have good instincts. So my preferred method is to conduct an intelligent conversation with them." As for writers, "All I can tell them is do it better," he said. "I can't come up with alternatives. If I could, I'd be a writer."
Mr. Frears began his career in the theater, where his consideration for writers -- and actors -- was instilled. The son of a doctor, he attended boarding schools and studied law at Cambridge. "That's what children of that class did," he said, noting that he had little interest in law. "I wasn't rebellious, just antisocial. Rebellion was too straightforward. I just sulked until I was 25."
HIS fascination with actors had begun at a theater in Nottingham when he was just a lad. "The actors seemed like the most colorful and exciting people I'd ever seen," he said. "I wanted to go and live like them. I was like a child at the circus."
After dutifully obtaining his law degree, he went to work at the Royal Court Theater in London. There, he met the director Karel Reisz, who asked him to be an assistant director on the offbeat 1966 film comedy "Morgan!" He also worked as an assistant director for Lindsay Anderson's movie "If," which starred Malcolm MacDowell as a boarding school rebel who foments a violent uprising. Mr. Frears said nostalgically, "I learned from the best." 
During the 70's, Mr. Frears worked mostly for the BBC, again for the best. At the time, directors like Ken Loach and Mike Leigh were making television dramas, and Mr. Frears directed several films for the small screen from scripts by Tom Stoppard, David Hare and Alan Bennett. "There was an underlying social seriousness with a connection to real life," Mr. Frears said.
In 1984, he returned to film with "The Hit," a gangster story set in Spain starring John Hurt and Terence Stamp. The next year came "My Beautiful Laundrette," shot in 16 millimeter for television and released to theaters, where it became an international art-house success. "We were just making a little movie," Mr. Frears said while walking through SoHo in New York. "We didn't know that it was going to change British film." The movie's portrait of London, seen through working-class immigrant neighborhoods, is dramatically different from the rarefied one in Merchant Ivory films.
In 1988 Mr. Frears released his most widely acclaimed film, "Dangerous Liaisons," which won three Academy Awards, for best adapted screenplay, art design and costumes. (Incredibly, this opulent period film cost only $10 million to make.) Mr. Frears was reluctant to pick favorites, but he admitted that this film, adapted by Christopher Hampton from his play, which he based on the Choderlos de Laclos novel about the sexual machinations of 18th-century French aristocrats (played by Glenn Close and John Malkovich), was among his favorites. "It's a sort of incredible film," Mr. Frears said. "When I watch it, I can't believe I directed it."
Mr. Frears, who described himself as "enormously self-critical," usually doesn't enjoy viewing his films. "It's too painful," he said. "Bits of your body have gone into them. You just remember the pain. You see them and think, 'I can't do it any more.' Either it's full of mistakes or it's wonderful. It's a disaster either way."
"Dangerous Liaisons" was Mr. Frears's first American film, but his luck with other Hollywood ventures has been spotty, perhaps because his directorial style is so foreign to a culture in which films can have multiple screenwriters and script doctors and actors are pieces of a jigsaw puzzle with smooth rounded edges. His 1996 misfire, "Mary Reilly," is a case in point. A reimagining of the "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" story from the viewpoint of Jekyll's housemaid, the film starred John Malkovich as the changeable Jekyll. But it was the casting of Julia Roberts in the title role that helped doom the project, heightening, or lowering, expectations but raising the budget to $40 million.
" 'Mary Reilly,' " Mr. Frears sighed, "was a tiny little story about a housemaid that got inflated into a big film. I stopped it three months before it started filming because the script wasn't right. But then I couldn't stop it a second time."
Though some of his films haven't flourished there, Mr. Frears said he loves Hollywood. "I've had such a wonderful time there," he said. "It's an exciting, hierarchical 18th-century economy, alive with sex and ambition."
Those extremes are also what have made him appreciate the niche he's carved for himself back home. "I've grown used to my modest station in life," he said. Such diffidence is typical, say those who know him well. Mr. McGovern recalled: "We went all down Merseyside scouting for locations, and at the end of that day, we ended up in a bar and it was just myself and Stephen. He says to me, 'Yesterday I buried my brother.' And he is the last survivor of his family. But he had kept that to himself all day. He's very English."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Hoping to Fill the Need for Office Space

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
WITH 15 million square feet of office space in lower Manhattan lost on Sept. 11 and another 10 million square feet at least temporarily unusable, companies displaced by the attack on the World Trade Center are turning to suburbs like Westchester, where vacancy rates have been rising.
 Westchester has about five million square feet of office space available, county officials said. 
 For Westchester, and White Plains in particular, the relocation of Manhattan companies could mean that buildings still vacant from the recession a decade ago -- when many large corporations like I.B.M. downsized -- could be filled once again, said Salvatore J. Carrera, director of the county's Office of Economic Development and Real Estate. This also could provide the impetus for Westchester to start building again, he said. 
Among the companies looking in Westchester, brokers said, are law firms, investment banks and insurance companies. 
"There is an intense scramble to find new homes," said Kenneth Krasnow, regional managing director in Connecticut and Westchester for Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate services firm. He said companies are casting about for space in several areas, including Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, northern New Jersey and Fairfield and Westchester Counties.
Westchester has two big advantages: easy access by mass transit and available commercial real estate, he said.
Due to the slowing economy, the office vacancy rate countywide was up slightly to 13.1 percent in July from 12.8 percent the year before, according to Insignia/ESG, a commercial brokerage in Stamford. In the central business district of White Plains, the slowdown has been felt more acutely, with the vacancy rate in July at 18.9 percent, up from 16.9 percent the year before.
Companies seeking new space want it to be functional immediately, said Carl Austin, president of Austin Corporate Properties in Rye Brook. He said that his office has been inundated with calls and that sublets -- what he called "plug-in space" as opposed to raw space -- would be the first to go.
"The requirements are for immediate occupancy," he said. "Not only should the space be built out and ready to go, but there should be furniture in place. Companies displaced by the events of Sept. 11 want to put a key in the door and get their businesses up and running as quickly as possible."
In White Plains, Salvatore Campofranco, managing director of Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, said, "We may see the first tenants within a couple of weeks." Reckson is a real estate investment trust based in Melville, N.Y., that owns several buildings in Westchester.
Mr. Campofranco said displaced companies are asking about backup generators, dual fiber optics and electrical capabilities.
"There's a new level of awareness about emergencies," he said. "Habits are being changed because people are in a disaster recovery mode."
Mr. Carerra said his office is encouraging landlords and brokers to offer below-market rates to companies that need temporary quarters. In response, Mr. Austin said the displaced companies are receiving offers "to park themselves free of charge and figure out the economics later."
In general, rents in Westchester are significantly lower than those in Manhattan, with the average asking rent per square foot of $26.27 countywide and $27.16 in White Plains's central business district. In Manhattan the average asking rent is from $45 to $100 per square foot. 
In downtown White Plains, a number of spaces are ready for occupancy. The largest is Westchester One, an 850,000-square-foot building at 44 South Broadway.
"There is 450,000 square feet still available in the building, and most of that is ready to go," said Mr. Krasnow, whose firm is marketing space in Westchester One, the 30-year-old black glass structure that currently houses Oxford Health and I.B.M. Prodigy, the online company, was a tenant from 1997 until last year, when it was bought by Southwestern Bell and moved to Texas.
Another building, 445 Hamilton Avenue, which is owned and partially occupied by MetLife, the nation's largest insurer, would require work before it is ready for occupany, brokers say, but it has 260,000 square feet available.
Christopher B. O'Callaghan, a partner in McCarthy O'Callaghan Company, a commercial real estate company in White Plains that is marketing the MetLife building, said that in large part, how quickly offices can be ready depends on how fast phone lines can be installed.
"They can rent furniture and buy computers and supplies right away," he said, "but in order to be connected to the rest of the world they need phone service."
Another major block of space in White Plains -- 500,000 square feet in four connected buildings -- is available just outside the downtown area at 333 Westchester Avenue in the former Kraft General Foods Building. It is owned by Cohen Brothers Realty.
Charles S. Cohen, president of the company, said he could "accommodate tenants right away." Rents, he said, would be less than $30 a square foot. 
Another large block of space is Texaco's 725,000-square-foot headquarters in Harrison, which the company has decided to sell as a result of its merger with Chevron. The building on 107 acres is being marketed by Insignia/ESG, which would not discuss prices.
The building has been Texaco's world headquarters since its construction in 1977. Although designed for a single user, the four-story building could be reconfigured for a variety of tenants. That space is fully occupied now, and because the merger has yet to be completed, the Texaco building will not be available until the first of the year, said Steven P. Bardsley, managing director for Insignia/ESG.
For offices outside of White Plains's central business district, shuttle buses could be deployed to transport workers from train stations, Mr. Campofranco said. Reckson, for example, has space at its Tarrytown Corporate Center and at the Reckson Summit in Valhalla.
The Louis Dreyfus Property Group has about 6,000 square feet in Valhalla at Sutton Place South, said David J. Friedman, northeast regional vice president of the French-owned real estate company.
Another building being considered by displaced companies is 900 King Street, a former I.B.M. building in Rye Brook that has been empty since the early 1990's. Owned by Brickman Associates of Manhattan, the three-story, 201,460-square-foot structure on a 17-acre campus is being marketed at $27 a square foot. Except for its lobby, 900 King Street is mostly raw space, and it will take some time to prepare it for a tenant.
The Mount Pleasant Executive Center on Rockwood Road, a 383,000-square-foot building that was a former I.B.M. Latin American headquarters, is available for immediate occupancy.
In Yonkers, Michael Tarpey, a spokesman for Qwest Communications, said his company has 435,000 square feet of data storage space available for lease. In response to the slow economy of recent months, the Denver-based supplier of telecommunications services had stopped construction on a distribution center that it had planned to fill with more than $100 million worth of computers and other equipment for a Web hosting center.
The remaining commercial office spaces in Westchester are smaller. 
"In a perfect world, we'd want the space to be all in one location," Mr. Krasnow said. "Unfortunately, that's not the reality of the current market."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Orange, Conn.; 
Family-Oriented Town With Farm Roots

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
EARLIER this month the Orange Country Fair, the two-day event that Orange residents say goes to their roots and defines their town, was held at the fairgrounds on Orange Center Road. The population of mostly business and professional people delights in harking back to the community's centuries-old farming tradition and once a year gives it its due.
 Cows and sheep and goats were judged; the doodlebugs (low-slung vehicles built from old car or truck parts) and tractors, horses and oxen pulled punishing weight loads; entertainers sang; snakes scared spectators in "the Largest Reptile Exhibit in the East;" and there were pony rides, prize-winning fruits, vegetables and flowers, and mountains of barbecued chicken. 
 Orange is clearly family-oriented. The town is 90 percent residential and very green, and it has what is regarded as one of the best school systems in the state and the hottest big box shopping strip in the region on Route 1. The town green is among the prettiest in Connecticut, and the 16-acre Little League complex has eight fields for girls' and boys' leagues, including this year's state champion Babe Ruth League. 
Of the few farms that remain, the 80-acre Ewen farm, family owned since 1820, grows succulent vegetables, fruit and old-fashioned flowers like amaranthus, cleome and celosia, sold at the roadside farm stand run by Jim Zeoli. 
Fieldview Dairy Farm, owned by the Hine family since 1639, is recovering from a disastrous fire but still grows 28 acres of corn and lots of hay and hopes to get its milk, butter, cheese and cream business back on track "as soon as we financially can," Walter Hine said.
Low dry stone walls that line many roads stand as reminders of the cultivated fields that dominated the land and economy until World War II. Now they provide frontage for well-maintained homes and a smattering of new construction.
ON Coram Lane, for example, next to the Great River Golf Club, the first of 17 homes on one-acre lots are to be built for an opening in about nine months. Classic colonials of 3,700 to 4,500 square feet with three, four or five bedrooms, three and a half baths and three-car garages will be priced from the high $500,000's to the high $600,000's. The development is called the Estates at Great River.
Toll Brothers has applied for permission to build 26 luxury homes at Ridge Road and Meeting House Lane. If approved by the town's boards and commissions, the houses will measure more than 3,000 square feet on one acre lots with city water, less than a mile from the Merritt Parkway. The project had a preliminary hearing last week.
With population growth at a minimal 3.1 percent over the past 10 years, Orange has developed an entrenched resistance to residential development. Only commercial or industrial construction that might ease the residential property tax burden is greeted with enthusiasm.
There are no grand estates nor million dollar homes in town -- at least not yet. Of nearly 5,000 existing dwellings in town, "less than 40 are on the market," said Frank J. D'Ostillio Jr., president of William Orange Realty. "We are very short of inventory." Prices range from the $200,000's for smaller older homes to the $700,000's for new construction.
Styles form an architectural record of the town's history, including antique salt boxes, early colonials, farmhouses, Victorians and ranches, and, he said: "We are getting our share of McMansions. Houses generally have gotten bigger -- 2,800 to 3,200 square feet." Minimum lot size is 40,000 square feet in the 65 percent of the town that is on the municipal water system, and 60,000 square feet with a well. Only the commercial and industrial areas have sewers.
"We've always been able to offer affordable homes in Orange," said Rita Palermo, sales agent with Arnold Peck Property World in Milford. "But it's a seller's market, and prices went up this year by 10 to 15 percent." She is showing a three-bedroom, two-bath raised ranch built in the 1970's available for $279,900 on almost three-quarters of an acre, and a five-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath bilevel house on one acre with a main level in-law apartment and inground pool for $359,900.
Many people who live in Orange still bear the surnames of 17th and 18th century settlers, and people who move there often do so because they know someone who lives there, or they grew up there, moved away and came back.
Three families who bought homes between May and July of this year are indicative of such connections. The Dedomenicos, lately of Hamden, knew the town because Keri Dedomenico grew up there and her husband, Fred, has a grandmother who lives there.
Donna and Paul Westlake are from Australia, transferred by his company. "His boss lives here," Mrs. Westlake said. Struggling to adapt to an alien lifestyle, they were pleasantly surprised to find homes in Orange larger and cheaper than in Sydney.
Wendy Price's family lives in Shelton, near enough for her father and her husband, Daniel, a New Haven cardiologist, to play golf at one of several local courses, which are privately run but, compared with many courses in the area, are neither expensive nor exclusive. Grassy Hill Country Club charges $250 a year for a preferred weekend tee time; on a daily basis the fees are $43 on weekdays, $53 on weekends, with a cart. Lunch and dinner are served on the premises. Orange Hill Country Club has a similar system and fees.
While the Prices looked for a house in surrounding towns, Mrs. Price said, "we like Orange -- it has that country feel, and prices are so much lower than the Boston suburbs we came from that we doubled our square footage. They paid $569,900 for their brand new 3,550 square foot house. A bonus was the reduction of Dr. Price's commuting time to work from an hour to 15 minutes. 
Top priorities for the first selectman, Mitchell Goldblatt, the first Democrat ever to hold the office, are control of growth and an in-town Metro-North railroad station. "New subdivisions are being proposed," he said. "That would mean the loss of more open space and wildlife. Consequently, we will be holding public hearings on increasing the minimum lot size to reduce the number of lots in a subdivision and minimize pressure on schools and services." In the past six years the town has bought more than 400 acres for conservation.
A train station, he said, "would be a great help to the region." Orange, in New Haven County, is midway between Milford and New Haven, the longest stretch without a station on the Metro-North New Haven line. The Connecticut Department of Transportation is considering a station in either Orange or West Haven, but claims it has no money at present. Meanwhile, a succession of environmental, parking and traffic studies and assessments of land costs and eminent domain possibilities are under way.
Orange was named in 1822 for William, prince of the royal Dutch House of Orange, who helped the colonists secure a charter in 1689.
Orange has an ecumenical smorgasbord of houses of worship, including the Church of the Holy Infant, Roman Catholic; Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses; Saint Barbara Greek Orthodox Church; Zion Lutheran Church; Temple Emanuel, a Reform synagogue; Congregation Or Shalom, a Conservative synagogue; and Orange Congregational Church, which has overlooked the green since 1810 and is currently undergoing a $1 million restoration.
Entertainment opportunities include the 10-screen Showcase Cinema and the Orange Community Players, a 27-year-old group, which has about 100 dedicated members who produce three full-scale productions a year. Residents also have access in New Haven, only 15 minutes away, to the Long Wharf, Shubert and Yale Repertory Theaters; the Symphony Orchestra; museums; and art galleries.
Andrea Schiffrin, a past president of the Community Players, is trying to establish a performing arts center in town. Such a facility would also benefit the New England School of Ballet, which, lacking a local auditorium, will give its 10th "Nutcracker" this Christmas at the Parsons Government Center in Milford. 
A multitude of mostly free recreational programs take place at the High Plains Community Center, where an eight-lane indoor pool and fitness center are located, along with 63 acres of fairgrounds, nature and jogging trails, soccer fields, tennis and basketball courts, children's summer camp, July 4th fireworks, the annual four-day Firemen's Carnival in August and summer concerts at the gazebo. 
ALONG Route 1, among dozens of stores including Home Depot, Lowe's, Circuit City, Best Buy Electronics and Burlington Coat Factory are some of the more than 30 restaurants in town.
Orange takes unabashed pride in its schools. A large sign at the Peck Place Elementary School, one of three schools for Grades 1 through 6, continues to proclaim its 1998 Blue Ribbon Award for Excellence from the United States Department of Education. The Mary L. Tracy Preschool for ages 3 and 4 won in 1997. Racebrook School and Turkey Hill School did not choose to apply for the award, which was given to seven schools in Connecticut in 1998. 
"We focus on family," said Nicholas Tirozzi, principal at Peck Place School, "nurturing children individually according to their needs. We have an experienced staff -- 92 percent of our teachers hold advanced degrees and 30 percent are mentors for new teachers who go through two-year internships before they can become tenured in Connecticut." Spanish is taught from kindergarten through sixth grade, a strong music program includes choral singing at 7:30 a.m. in Grades 3 through 6. Each classroom has four computers, and children have access to a lab with 22 computers connected to the Internet. The ratio of teachers to students is about 1 to 20.
Upper-level students attend the regional Amity Junior and Senior High School in Woodbridge, serving Orange, Woodbridge and Bethany. According to Dr. Rolfe Wenner, the superintendent, of this year's 326 graduates at the high school, "95 percent go on to higher education, usually four-year institutions. Students are accepted every year in the National Merit Program and enroll in most Ivy League colleges and universities." 
The latest College Board scores of 511 in verbal and 557 in math are higher than state and national mean scores, but Dr. Wenner regards them as "only one indicator." Some students participate in oceanographic studies aboard vessels in New Haven harbor or fine arts at the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven or internships at Yale in media, medical, financial and other disciplines. The state, school and parents share the cost. "Fine arts," Dr. Wenner said, "runs the gamut of photography, art, music, theater, and we place a heavy emphasis on independent thinking and developing technology skills." French and Spanish are in the curriculum; Latin, he said with some surprise, "is so popular at the high school that we are offering it in junior high."

As the town grew and the library became a town department, the 9,500-square-foot space became obsolete. By the 1990's the Friends of the Library began applying for state and federal funds to build a new library. In 1992 the organization was astonished to receive a $1 million bequest from Marjorie Case, a resident who apparently had no heirs. As the story goes, in drawing up her will she recalled the kindness of a librarian who brought books for her to read at home during an illness. With the addition of other bequests and government grants, the new 23,500-square-foot $4 million Case Memorial Library, designed by the architectural firm of Moser, Pilan & Nelson, opened on Orange Center Road in May 1999.

HEADLINE: Office Space: Concern and Tact Included 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
FOLLOWING the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, American Express mourned for the 12 employees who are still listed as missing.
 The company also scrambled to accommodate customers by opening its offices on the weekends, providing emergency funds and travel services, and waiving late payment fees because of postal delays. 
 Amid all of this, American Express quietly began a search for space to replace its headquarters after the trade center was destroyed on Sept. 11, and within three days had signed a lease for 175,000 square feet in downtown Stamford. The deal was reached with the Landis Group, which represents the partners who own the building at 400 Atlantic Street.
Molly Faust, an American Express spokeswoman, said, "I'm sure they had an opportunity to get into a bidding war, but they did not." 
Real-estate experts say that the deal is only a harbinger of what will likely be a frenetic search for space in any office market close to New York, which in Connecticut would include offices from Greenwich to Westport. "For a market our size, this could have a very dramatic impact in a very short period of time," said Dean J. Shapiro of Insignia/ESG Inc. in Stamford.
Usually a company looking to expand or establish an office in a new location has plenty of time to look around, gauge the market and secure the best deal.
"These companies are all going to be looking for space available for immediate occupancy and a dial tone," Mr. Shapiro said. 
Throughout Connecticut, business groups, municipalities and state agencies have rushed to help some of the companies that were displaced after the trade center attack.
"Whatever New York needs, we're hoping to provide," said James F. Abromaitis, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, who established a Business Action Team immediately after the terrorist attacks to coordinate efforts. "What we're trying to do is get an inventory of what space is available so if there are companies looking for temporary space, we know what's there to accommodate them."
Mr. Abromaitis said that his department and real-estate executives were stressing that their intentions are to aid New York companies on a temporary basis, not to lure them to the state permanently.
"It's not in any way an attempt to take advantage of the situation," Mr. Abromaitis said. "Hopefully we'll see those companies rebuild in New York and get back to business the way they should be. We need those companies to get themselves back on their feet, and certainly getting back to lower Manhattan would be their first choice. But we're going to try to do something in the interim."
But some real-estate executives said the lease arrangements could end up being long-term. Most landlords do not want anything less than a five- or 10-year lease. Then again, it could take that long for the Manhattan office space to be fully rebuilt.
"You could argue that they're all coming up here temporarily, but their employees could fall in love with the quality of life," Mr. Shapiro said. "On the other hand, I've lived in New York and I know the lure of the city, and he who bets against New York is a fool. New York has always been remarkably resilient."
Ed Tonnessen, executive vice president of the Albert Ashforth Company, also noted that trying to lure companies away from New York City would be detrimental over the long term to the suburbs, because the suburbs by nature rely heavily on a strong metropolitan area.
"A healthy New York City is vital to Westchester and Fairfield counties," Mr. Tonnessen said. "The suburbs exist as a result of New York. It might be a love-hate relationship, but there is a strong tie, so long-term I would not like to see anyone capitalize on this disaster and think that was great for the region."
Mr. Tonnessen said he received about a dozen telephone calls from brokers seeking space for displaced companies. He said he expected several announcements concerning moves by large corporations to Fairfield County within days.
Connecticut is scrutinizing the industry to make sure there are no attempts to raise lease rates unfairly. Oley Carpp, who heads the Business Action Team, said: "Anecdotally, we've heard a number of brokers in Fairfield County say that what the price was yesterday, that's what the price will be today."
Mr. Carpp said he had received numerous calls from commercial real-estate brokers telling him what their clients are going to need, or what they have available. He estimated that there is about 5 million square feet of space available in the lower Fairfield market area, in blocks from as small as 800 square feet to as large as 200,000 square feet.
The vacant office space in southwestern Connecticut amounts to less than half of the space that was demolished in Manhattan. But many companies have already begun to relocate to the New Jersey shore, which is closer, so experts expect there will be enough space to meet the demand.
"It's tough to put a number on how much we might be talking about, but it's not inconceivable that as much as a half-million square feet of office space could be absorbed in lower Fairfield County because of this attack," Mr. Tonnessen said. "But I must concede it's a sort of morbid way of doing business."
Fairfield County has long had one of the strongest office markets in the country, though there has been a softening in recent months from a vacancy rate that hit a low of 4 percent last year. 
A report issued last month by Newmark & Company Real Estate, a national firm, put the vacancy rate at 11.63 percent. The looser market has not yet had an impact on prices, however, Newmark said. The report put average rents at a record high of $29.06 per square foot, up from $27.76 last year, and sublet space at $31.57 per square foot.
Gino R. Partenza, owner of GRP Realty Inc. in Stamford, said that he had seen some interest, though mainly the inquiries seemed to be surveys by New York-based brokers to determine what was available.
"We've gotten probably six or seven e-mails from brokers asking us what we have or what we know about," Mr. Partenza said.
Most businesses, however, seem to be trying to make the transition as easy as possible, thus little attention has been given to properties at the eastern end of Fairfield County. But there was considerable interest in an 11,000-square-foot space Mr. Partenza represents in Ridgefield, which is furnished and fully wired for phones and computers.
"Most of them are just looking for space where they can move right in," Mr. Partenza said. "It won't be exactly what they want in most cases, but when there's an urgent need, you learn how to adapt."
Mr. Partenza said he had not heard of any company that had raised its rates as a result of increased demand, even though under most any other circumstances that would happen almost immediately.
"Nobody wants to be seen as trying to take advantage of this horrible situation," Mr. Partenza said. "I can tell you that personally I wouldn't be associated with anyone who's trying to gouge."
Many southwestern Connecticut real-estate brokers, however, have reported very light activity since Sept. 11. Richard F. Gretsch Jr., who owns a commercial real-estate company in Stamford, said he received one call about a 27,000-square-foot building he represents in Wilton.
"I've spoken to a couple of other brokers whose phones aren't exactly ringing off the hook, either," Mr. Gretsch said. "I think it might be a little early. A lot of these companies have been dealing with personal issues up until now, and they'll be turning their attention to space issues when they can."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/McKim, Mead & White; 
A Skeptic's View of a Renowned Architectural Firm

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
MOSETTE BRODERICK has spent much of her professional life studying McKim, Mead & White for her book "When Architecture Could Fashion a Nation," to be published next year by Alfred A. Knopf. Mrs. Broderick, who teaches architectural history and is director of the urban design and architecture studies program at New York University, has gone through letters, bill books, clipping books, local sources and building records trying to better understand America's most famous architectural firm, the designers of the old Pennsylvania Station, the Municipal Building and much of the Columbia University campus. 
 And she says that the three partners were indeed remarkable men, and brilliant -- at attracting talented employees who actually designed much of the work traditionally ascribed to the hands of the partners. 
 "Charles McKim had little engineering or drawing skills," she said. "Stanford White was moody and impetuous, placed in an architect's office at age 16 by his parents just to get him out of the house. William Mead was aimless, and got in some sort of trouble at Amherst." 
But, she said, McKim and White "were out every night" after the firm's start in 1879 making contacts with "the first generation of American millionaires who set their eyes on a European sense of grandeur." The firm soon forsook the more humble shingle style it used for its early country houses and adopted the Renaissance style as its emblem, to match the internationalist aspirations of its clients.
What the principals did well, Mrs. Broderick said, was hire exceptionally skilled designers. McKim, she said, would call out individual details from architectural books to his draftsmen, who developed the actual design; Mead was the business manager; and White, as his wild nightlife gradually took over, would make hurried sketches in his hideaway in Madison Square Garden. 
"His draftsmen would come in in the morning," she said, "find him asleep, pick up rolls of sketches from his feet and try to incorporate them into the actual design."
The first important designer the partners hired was Joseph Morrill Wells, who left Peabody & Stearns in Boston to come to New York and designed important buildings for the firm -- among them the Century Association building on West 43rd Street near Fifth Avenue, which was completed in 1891 after his death, and much of the second Madison Square Garden, completed in 1892 -- until his death from tuberculosis in 1890.
"By that time, the firm was on a trajectory," she said. "They became a training ground for younger designers: Carrere & Hastings, York & Sawyer, Henry Bacon. Bacon did many jobs for White that White never even saw." After Wells's death, William Mitchell Kendall moved into his place, carrying out the design of buildings like the Harvard Club on West 44th Street and the University Club at 54th and Fifth. But Mrs. Broderick said that the most original work of the firm was behind it.
"They became, almost, parodies of themselves," she said. "Kendall was a mean, small-minded man who took precedent as his only cue; they began repeating themselves in the 1890's, and you can spot the details on their later buildings lifted directly from their earlier ones." Mrs. Broderick said, for example that the interiors of the Metropolitan Club reuse details for the Villard Houses.
By the early part of the 20th century, she said, the firm was coasting. "White was dying of kidney failure," she said, "in debt for far more than he could ever repay, $600,000, and became a salaried employee to save the firm from liability. But he just couldn't reduce his style of living." To support himself, she said, White began reselling antique furniture and mantelpieces, seemingly bought for a client but actually from his own collection, at inflated prices. 
White was murdered in 1906, McKim died in 1909 and Mead died in 1928. "From the 1910's until the 1950's McKim, Mead & White got these vast sinecures," Mrs. Broderick said -- "schools, university buildings like Harvard and M.I.T., public buildings, none of them very good. But they had put a spin on the way America perceived itself, putting it on a par with Europe."
But the firm remained the stopping place of choice for young architects, even if only for a short time. Wallace Harrison, who later designed the United Nations building, was one of the firm's hundred-odd draftsmen in the 1910's. "But the architects to go to for creativity in the 1920's were people like Harvey Wiley Corbett or Bertram Goodhue, although none of them were successful in establishing a really large office," she said. McKim, Mead & White was closed in 1961 by the late Walker Cain, who established a successor firm.
Leland Roth, the Marion Dean Ross Professor of Architectural History at the University of Oregon, has written several books on McKim, Mead & White and sees things differently. "There was still important work in the 1900-10 decade, like the Bank of Montreal and Penn Station," he said, "but after that the designs did lose a lot of their force." He has a more sanguine view of the original partners' design influence: "Over time, their hands-on involvement did diminish, but they each had their own personal assistant that they had worked with for years."
Mrs. Broderick grew up in Oyster Bay, on Long Island, and did not pay much attention to architecture until the 1970's, when she studied architectural history at Finch College on East 77th Street. 
"THE librarian, Mark Piel, took me over to the Womrath's bookstore and said, 'Give her anything she wants, and charge it to Finch,' " she said. "I got a feeling of the unlimited possibilities, that I could study anything."
On a walking tour, a professor stopped at 78th and Madison and pointed out two town houses designed by McKim, Mead & White -- the reserved, red-brick Rollins house, on the southwest corner, and the suave, orange brick Fish house on the northwest corner. 
After getting a master of arts degree in art history from Columbia, she got a job working with the architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock, and was then commissioned to write a history of McKim, Mead & White's Villard Houses, at 50th and Madison. The book, "The Villard Houses: Life Story of a Landmark," was published by Viking Press in 1980 and written with William Shopsin. 
She had studied British architectural history -- "I didn't know a thing about American buildings," she said -- but the book project started her on a closer examination of the renowned firm. She was not interested in the traditional approach to their buildings -- understanding their historic precedents. "I don't care what a building is based on," she said. "That's boring." 
Mrs. Broderick said she feels that "When Architecture Could Fashion a Nation" will, for her, exhaust the McKim, Mead & White vein. She says her next book will be a block-by-block examination of Fifth Avenue, taking the reader inside each major house with photographs and written accounts. 
Despite the partners' remove from actual design of the buildings, Mrs. Broderick still sees them as tremendously influential. In addition to putting America on an artistic plane with Europe, the firm acted "as the interpreters of architecture, painting, decorative arts and antiquities." "But they reduced their own commitment to design," she said, "entrusting it to others. They became delegators, not designers."
Moreover, the United States has a marked advantage when it comes to demography. Japan's persistent economic problem is that consumers want to save more than businesses want to invest. One important reason for that, many analysts agree, is the combination of a low birth rate and a refusal to allow large-scale immigration. An aging population tends to save a lot in preparation for retirement, and it's hard to get businesses to invest all those savings when they know that the working-age population will be shrinking for decades to come. We have problems with an aging population here, too. But they are nowhere near as severe, and our working-age population is still growing steadily.
In one way, however, our situation is actually worse than Japan's. For the past decade, Japan has been an island of depression in a sea of prosperity, its economy stagnating even as other major economies -- ours in particular -- boomed. That was, you might say, quite an achievement. Our current problems, on the other hand, are shared by much of the world -- not least by Japan itself. 
In fact, Japan, which remains, despite all its problems, the world's second-largest economy and one of our biggest trading partners, has lately seemed to be on the verge of even deeper trouble: its slow-motion depression seems to be going into fast forward.
In the second quarter of 2001, Japan's economy shrank at an annual rate of more than 3 percent. Indeed, almost all observers believe that Japan was in a severe recession even before the terrorists struck. Aggravating the problem is accelerating deflation: the best measure of Japanese prices, the G.D.P. deflator, has been falling at an annual rate of 2 percent. Deflation adds to the economy's problems, because it gives people an incentive to hoard cash instead of spending.
If you think about this a bit, the story gets even worse. After all, prices are falling because the economy is depressed; now we've just learned that the economy is depressed because prices are falling. That sets the stage for the return of another monster we haven't seen since the 1930's, a "deflationary spiral," in which falling prices and a slumping economy feed on each other, plunging the economy into the abyss. It's pretty scary stuff, not just for Japan but for the rest of us. If Japan slides into the abyss, that will have a direct adverse effect on our economy dwarfing anything the terrorists did. 
Yet lately we seem to be living in a world full of dark clouds with potential silver linings -- and this one is no exception. The upside to Japan's troubles is that they leave us forewarned and to some extent forearmed. Think of it this way: without Japan's dismal example, economic officials in the United States might blithely dismiss the risks in our current situation, cheerfully proclaiming that prosperity is just around the corner. That, after all, is what Japanese officials did in the early stages of their slump. They didn't know that what did happen, could happen. We do. 
And Japan's woes have not only made us aware that depression-type economic problems can occur in the modern world, they have also led to a much better understanding about how to fight them. Without the example of Japan, economic thinking in the 1990's might have been entirely focused on the problems of prosperity. Questions like the causes of slumps and the options for dealing with them would have been a musty field, attracting the attention of only a few economic historians. Instead these questions have been a subject of intense debate, attracting the attention of some of the world's leading economists. (Full disclosure: I've been working on the Japan problem for several years. But the economists I actually have in mind are people like Lars E.O. Svensson, the Swedish macroeconomist, who has produced the most fully worked-out proposal for Japanese recovery.) And this debate has offered some fresh approaches to the problem. 
Not long ago, the two lines of defense against slump that I described earlier -- interest-rate cuts and deficit spending -- were pretty much it as far as economists were concerned. They seemed to be enough: interest cuts had ended every postwar recession, and deficit spending on a grand scale -- that is, World War II -- had ended the Great Depression. On the other hand, if they should turn out not to be enough, economists had few ideas about what might come next.
Now, however, it is widely understood that even if both conventional lines of defense fail, there is still a lot that you can do -- as long as you are willing to abandon conventional notions of prudence. For example, normal practice forbids central banks to invest in anything other than short-term government debt, for fear that decisions about what to invest in will become politicized. And since the short-term interest rate in Japan is already zero, there is nothing more that the Bank of Japan can do within the limits of normal practice. But given the economy's grave state, why not go beyond those limits?
For example, why not buy long-term government debt, which does not yet have a zero interest rate and therefore offers some additional traction? Or the Bank of Japan could print yen and use them to buy dollars; this would push the yen down, making Japanese exports more competitive on world markets.
Some economists have also suggested that an economy in Japan's situation can bootstrap itself back to prosperity through "inflation targeting." This means announcing publicly that you intend to push the economy into a state of persistent mild inflation, say at 2.5 percent per year, and that you will do whatever is necessary to achieve that end. If the announcement is credible, potential borrowers will be more likely to take a chance, believing that they will be able to repay their loans more easily, and consumers will have second thoughts about hoarding cash.
Such radical ideas were branded as irresponsible when they first came out but have since become respectable, almost mainstream. And that means that if the worst comes to pass, if the United States economy starts to show signs of the Japan syndrome, we won't be at a loss for ideas about what to do. Admittedly, it would be nice if Japan had actually tried any of these proposals and reassuring if they had been tried and worked. Alas, despite growing support within Japan, they have not been tried. The reason, I think, is fear -- fear of the unknown, fear of trying anything that might fail.
Fear of the unknown was presumably behind a bizarre recent outburst from Japan's finance minister. Earlier this year Junichiro Koizumi, a maverick and reformer who is intensely disliked by political insiders, was nonetheless chosen as prime minister by the ruling party in response to public pressure. Koizumi has promised that he will fix the economy. Koizumi is pushing "structural reform" -- measures like forcing banks to own up to their bad loans -- that will be good for Japan in the long run but will actually depress the economy in the near future. 
But there was hope that he would also press for unconventional monetary actions -- and some of his advisers have expressed support for such policies. They have been undercut, however, by the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, who declared that this would "cause runaway inflation and send the economy spinning out of control." This at a time when the economy is already spinning out of control and is threatened with runaway deflation. Perhaps Shiokawa is still traumatized by the wartime inflation of his youth.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan, which directly controls monetary policy, has refused to do anything unconventional; incredibly, it refused to make any major changes in policy even after the terrorist attacks. This refusal, I believe, is rooted in a pettier kind of fear. After all, if the Bank of Japan were to engage in unconventional monetary policy, it might fail. It would be very embarrassing. It's far safer to declare that your institution has done all it can and that it's up to somebody else to find a way to make the economy recover.
Let's hope that in a similar situation, our policy makers would be bolder and more responsible.

The Nightmare Scenario
Let me be clear: I don't think that the United States is at any imminent risk of following Japan into deep slump. What I do fear is that a combination of factors -- the legacy of our bubble economy, the trouble in Japan and maybe the psychological impact of the terrorist action -- will drag us into a prolonged period of stagnation.
Here's my nightmare: America's recovery from its current slump, whenever it comes, is tentative and short-lived, because the business investment that drove our boom in the 1990's remains stagnant. Eventually the housing bubble bursts and we have another slump; then we have another weak recovery, this time driven by deficit spending, but that, too, fades out. Eventually we look around and realize that it's 2009, and the economy still hasn't fully recovered from the slowdown that began at the end of the previous decade. 
And we also realize that while the government's subsequent attempts to sustain the economy, mainly through tax cuts and subsidies to energy companies, have arguably staved off depression -- the unemployment rate has risen, but only to 8 percent -- they have also devastated the environment and left a huge government debt. The fiscal 2010 budget deficit is projected at $800 billion, and nobody has any idea how we will manage in a couple of years, when millions of baby boomers start collecting their Social Security checks.
Is this outlined situation an actual forecast? No, it's only a possibility. And the terrorist attack doesn't make it any more likely -- if anything, the fiscal response to terror should help give the economy a boost now, when there is a good chance of heading off the chance that we will slip into a Japanese-style trap. 
And even if this possible outcome starts to look a more likely one, we should not give up hope. For although Japan may have failed to come to grips with its long stagnation, that failure was not preordained. Many of us think that if Tokyo would show a bit more courage and imagination it could still turn its economy around. And if the worst happens and we find ourselves in a similar situation, so can we.
A truly worst-case scenario would be if the United States not only fell into a Japanese-style economic trap but also exhibited a Japanese-style unwillingness to do whatever it takes to get out of that trap. But I think, or at least hope, that our economic leaders would be bolder and more imaginative. The Fed, in particular, is a smarter institution than the Bank of Japan, with a lot more talent on hand, and historically has shown a willingness to take responsibility for the economy rather than interpret its job narrowly. 
So should we be worried about the world economy in the aftermath of the terrorist attack? Yes, we should -- but not because of the attack. In fact, I've been worried about the world economy for several years, ever since I realized that depression-style economic problems could happen in the modern world, and even here in America.
It has become a cliche to say that everything is different now. What worries me is the prospect that some things may be the same -- the same as they were here in the 1930's, the same as they have been in Japan for the last 10 years.
What would make things really different, in a good way, would be effective leadership that recognizes the gravity of the situation, does not fail to act for fear of political repercussions or, worse yet, try to exploit the crisis for political ends -- leadership that is prepared to try unorthodox remedies if conventional solutions fail. Do we have that kind of leadership? We may find out.

Let's Make a Deal: Bartering Gains a Bigger Role

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
SEVEN times in the last three years, Dennis and Caroline Fritzsche have gotten away for luxurious vacations at the Franklyn D. Resort on Jamaica's north coast, and they are planning another this fall.
 The couple -- he owns and operates a children's party center in Valley Stream called the Looney Bin, and she works at home, raising their three children -- eagerly anticipate their Caribbean holidays, where for two carefree weeks chefs cook their meals, a nanny watches their children, and they are free to swim, lounge on the beach and otherwise enjoy themselves. 
 They get all this without paying cash. The resort accepts barter credits, which Mr. Fritzsche has in abundance, thanks to the many Looney Bin customers who ask to do business in trade rather than in cash. When Mr. Fritzsche wants to buy something for his business or home, he checks first to see who accepts barter credits. It turns out that thousands do on Long Island alone. 
Mr. Fritzsche (pronounced FRIT-she) is able to swap not only for the hotel stay but also for a limousine to take the family to the airport and for their airline tickets. 
Like many people who barter, Mr. Fritzsche tends to draw a distinction between cash and barter. An important barter principle is that whether cash or trade, the same price prevails, and barter credits, usually administered by barter companies, represent the cash value of the goods or services. Yet cash somehow seems more valuable, and the resort's barter policy accounts for his decision to stay there. "I would never in my wildest imagination spend my cash to stay there," he said, in a tone of voice that suggested the very idea was ludicrous. "I don't make that kind of money."
It's a two-way street. Mr. Fritzsche said that barter transactions help fill empty periods in the Looney Bin's schedule and promote his business: "People call me to book a party and say, 'My kid had a great time at the Goldstein party.' The Goldstein party was barter. So I know how I got their booking." 
In Plainview, Ken Frost, the president of B&C Office Furniture, said that many of his transactions were a combination of barter and cash. "All barter isn't a good idea," Mr. Frost said. "But if you work it properly and don't get in too deep, barter can be a good thing."
Lois Dale, the president of Barter Advantage, which has offices in Manhattan and Southampton, estimates that barter accounts for $16 billion in transactions each year worldwide. Krista Vardabash, the executive director of the International Reciprocal Trade Association in Rochester, said that as many as a third of all global transactions could be defined as barter. "Even frequent-flyer miles can be considered barter, if you want to define it that way," she said.
Barter companies make money in two ways: by charging a fee to join barter networks, which they build and administer, and by charging a percentage of the cash value of each deal, typically 5 to 16 percent.
Although bartering may be one of those activities that many people do but few will discuss publicly, it will probably grow in acceptance and visibility as long as the economy remains sluggish.
"Barter comes out shining at times such as these," Ms. Dale said. "Cash is tight, and people don't necessarily have the money to buy items like advertising, brochure production and other services. They're more open to barter, whereas in stronger times they'll insist on cash."
One problem with bartering is that it limits the pool of suppliers. And since credits have no value outside the barter network, credits not spent are credits wasted. 
"When you start to barter, you get customers coming through your door who normally wouldn't be coming through," said Marge Sasso, a vice president of the National Commerce Exchange in Jericho, a barter company that says it has 3,500 Long Island members. "But they're not paying cash. So it's easy to feel that you're giving something away for free, especially when you start to get inundated."
Companies most inclined to swap are those with perishable inventories. The category includes computer-related businesses and other high-tech companies whose products grow obsolete quickly, as well as service providers like broadcasters and hotels whose inventories lose value if not sold by a certain time. Barter allows such companies to sell their inventory without resorting to drastic discounts.
"We trade air time for everything from restaurant meals and limousine travel to air time on other radio stations," said Dave Widmer, the general manager of the Long Island broadcasting group includes WKJY-FM (KJOY) and three other FM stations. Mr. Widmer said that bartering allowed radio stations to salvage last-minute revenue from time slots whose value would otherwise evaporate. 
Of course, if a last-minute advertiser appears offering to pay with dollars, all bets are off. "We don't want cash customers to become barter customers," he said.
Michael V. Hollander, the president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau and a former general manager of the Long Island Marriott in Uniondale, said: "Maybe 10 percent of room nights on Long Island are barter deals. Much of it is in the form of swapping room nights for event sponsorship. The hotel gives some room nights and in return gets a banner placed in a stadium or arena as a sponsor. Or they give room nights in exchange for rental cars."
While purveyors of perishables have bartered from time immemorial, as have buyers who are momentarily (or chronically) short of cash, in more recent years bartering has emerged from its casbah origins to court mainstream acceptance. Eighteen years ago Congress passed legislation that established barter as the equivalent of cash for tax purposes. A new generation of barter company executives, many with Wall Street backgrounds, began to replace their older, sometimes rough-hewn predecessors. The increased legitimacy brought in more small business owners, traditionally the mainstay of barter, into the networks.
Many practitioners, sensitive to bartering's gray-market legacy, still hesitate to reveal their involvement. "I always use the term 'trade' rather than 'barter,' " said Ken Bove, the president of Dougherty, Clifford & Wadsworth, a media placement company in Huntington that does about $8 million a year in barter transactions. 
Still, many businesses need convincing. At the Huntington Chamber of Commerce, where the National Commerce Exchange initiated a program last year for chamber members, response so far "has been disappointing," said Ms. Sasso, the exchange's vice president. 
The answer may be time, and greater exposure. "People are less close-minded when you explain to them how it works," said Mr. Bove, the media trader. "Many companies won't even consider it. I think the old stigma may be lessened, but it is not entirely gone."

HEADLINE: A Shaken State In Mourning 

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI; Kenneth Best, Darice Bailer, Nancy Doniger, Jane Gordon, Elizabeth Maker, Stacey Stowe, Christine Woodside and Joe Wojtas all contributed to this article.

 BODY:
HENRY AND TENSY VEGA of New Milford waited by the phone, helpless, knowing that their son, Richard, who worked a few blocks from the World Trade Center, was heading there that day, of all days, for a meeting in one of the towers. But what time was the meeting? He had never told them. Didn't he say it was on the 104th floor, near where the plane hit? So they waited for word in agony.
 The family of Robert J. Gerlich of Monroe also waited. He worked on the 94th floor of the north tower, just down from where American Airlines Flight 11 went in. After Thursday, with still no word, they found themselves referring to him in the past tense. 
 The Church of St. Michael the Archangel in Greenwich lost 11 members in the attacks. Our Lady of Fatima Church in Wilton lost five, four of them employees of Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond trading firm that lost so many of its employees. When the Wilton church held a memorial service that Friday, so many people attended that when communion was served, the church ran out. 
For better or worse, Connecticut is wedded to New York. Its economic might has sculpted so many of our towns and is responsible for much of the wealth that others constantly jab us about. Without New York, who would we be? Probably a lot more New England than many of us would want. New York is such a part of this state that when those planes hit the World Trade Center, it was impossible not to immediately realize that many of our neighbors were inside.
There are more than 60 people from the state either missing or dead, some of whom were on the hijacked planes. A mother and daughter from New London were on United Airlines Flight 175, which hit the south tower, on their way to California, where the mom was going to meet a friend. The friend was on Flight 11, which hit the north tower. Inside that tower was the mom's brother. Such relationships and coincidences were at work all day.

A Change of Schedule
Barbara Vandehei of Ivoryton is a flight attendant for American Airlines based out of Boston. Because she liked to work nonstop, cross-country routes, Flight 11 was a regular part of her schedule. But not on that Tuesday. With school starting for her children, she signed up for shorter flights during September so she could teach at church and volunteer at school. On Tuesday, she was in her daughter, Monica's, third-grade class.
She first heard about the attacks when her mother called. Then she heard from another American employee.
"My girlfriend from Boston called and said, 'Thank God,' and I said, "Don't tell me who was on that flight, because I'm volunteering at school today."
Later, her husband, James, picked her up at school.
"They had more details and he wanted to be with me," she said. "I walked out and that's when I lost it. He said that somebody had called that I needed to call back. A friend of ours was on it." That was Karen Martin, a flight attendant.
Ms. Vandehei and her husband got home at about 2 p.m. to find 32 messages on the answering machine -- all sorts of friends, family members and people she hadn't talked to in years, all calling to see if she was all right.
"I said I wanted to cry, before the kids got home," she said. "So I just sat there and cried. We decided we would pick them up from school so everyone could see I was O.K."
She added, "They were the worst two days of my life." She did her best to stay calm around her two young children and answer their questions, though she didn't want to be dishonest. So when they asked if she was afraid to go back to work, "I said, 'Yes, uh-huh.' I said, 'I'm not going back to work.' And my daughter said, 'But Mommy, you love your job.' "
She was due back to work that Thursday, but her flights had been canceled so she was able to delay her decision. Later that day, her father stopped by and thought she was home because she had called in sick.
"He told me if everyone calls in sick, then America is grounded, and then they win," she said. "We can't live in fear."
It was then that Ms. Vandehei decided she wasn't quitting and that if her next flight was canceled she would offer to take another one. Ms. Vandehei said she realized she wanted to keep working. She said that every day she works, she asks herself, "How many people can I help today?"
She went back to work last Tuesday.

A Matter of Time
Richard Vega, the son of Henry and Tensy Vega of New Milford and an underwriter for the American International Insurance Group just a few blocks away from the trade center, had an appointment with the Aon Corporation on the 104th floor of the south tower on Tuesday, but his parents weren't sure of what time, his father said. 
"It really was a kind of torture for us," said his father. "There was nothing we could do. We couldn't go there. We couldn't get through on the phone. All we could do was sit there and wait. It was the longest wait of our lives. I tried to keep it together, tried to think real positively that Rich was O.K., but my wife was really desperate."
The call finally came around 11:30 that morning, after Richard had made his way through the debris and stood in a long line to use a payphone at a midtown diner.
"You wouldn't believe the relief," Mr. Vega said, who found out his son's appointment had been scheduled for noon.
As it turns out, Richard was in his office when the first tower was struck.
"Everyone went outside and watched in total horror," he said from his office last Tuesday, his first day back since the attacks. "I almost threw up when I saw the people jumping out of the windows. When the towers went down it was complete mayhem. Everyone was running and screaming."
The Vega's other son, Henry, was at work in midtown at PricewaterhouseCoopers when the attacks occurred. He had an appointment at the World Trade Center for the next day, as he did every Wednesday.
"My oldest son missed it by a day and my youngest son missed it by a couple of hours," Mr. Vega remarked. "All I can say is thank God."

In Town for a Trade Show
Like Mr. Vega, Amy Toyen, 24, a native of Avon who lived outside of Boston, didn't work in the trade center, either, but had come to New York to demonstrate a software product of her company, Thomson Financial, at a trade show. She was on the 106th floor of the north tower. Engaged, she had recently picked out her wedding dress with her mother.
Her parents, Dorine and Marty, an executive with an engineering company in Essex and member of the Avon School Board, spent the days after the attack in a grueling nightmare of telephone calls and e-mails, a spot on the evening news with Amy's photo and finally, combing New York City hospitals for their daughter. There was never any news.
What there was were strangers who sent huge bouquets of flowers to their house, boys and girls from Renbrook School in West Hartford who traced their hands and wrote "right from the heart as only children can," said Mrs. Toyen, who has taught at the school for 16 years. There were also Amy's friends, young women who posted her picture throughout New York, on a Web site and who made call after call, desperate for any news of Amy.
"The good thing to come out of this is how many people want to help," Mrs. Toyen said, describing countless relatives, friends and strangers who offered assistance. "People we don't even know and people who knew her and loved her. They just want to do something.
"The only saving grace is she had a good life," her mother said in a voice hoarse with grief. "She had absolutely no regrets -- except it was so short. It should have been a lot longer."

'Don't Worry, I'm O.K.'
In Sherman, Larae Lang had just returned from a morning walk around 9:20 a.m. and the phone was ringing as she walked in the door. It was a friend calling to ask if her husband, Richard, was okay. 
"I said 'Why, what's up?' and she told me and I nearly froze. I went to call him, but I saw the answering machine was blinking, and it was a message from him saying 'The World Trade Center is burning, but don't worry, I'm O.K.' "
But that was at 9:15, before the towers collapsed. "I sat there with some friends, watching it all unfold on TV, in an absolute panic. All I could think was how close Rich's building is to the World Trade Center. It didn't look good."
Mr. Lang works for the New York Mercantile Exchange, whose offices used to be in the World Trade Center until the 1993 terrorist bombing of the building inspired the company to relocate just across the street.
Finally, the wife of one of Mr. Lang's co-workers was able to call around 12:30 to let her know her husband was heading north and was out of danger.
"I was on the trading floor when the first building was hit," Mr. Lang said. "I'm trained in C.P.R. and I'm part of an emergency response team, so I went immediately to get my gear."
"People were in the coffee room looking out at the north tower with binoculars. People were hanging out the window above the flame line, and saw what we thought was furniture flying out of the windows. Then all of a sudden the second plane hit the south tower, and huge chunks of wall and flames went flying everywhere. We evacuated and when we looked up again we realized it was people jumping out of the windows."
Mr. Lang tried to remain focused on helping people amid the mayhem and guiding people with a bullhorn toward an evacuation route.
"I kept thinking about my wife and our three kids," he said, choked up. "It was terrifying."

A Trip to California
On the morning of Sept. 11, Ruth McCourt of New London and her 4-year-old daughter, Juliana, boarded Flight 175 from Boston to Los Angeles. Ms. McCourt, 45, was planning to visit a friend in California and take her daughter to Disneyland.
Aboard Flight 11, also bound for Los Angeles from Boston, was Paige Farley Hackel of Newton, Mass., one of Ms. McCourt's closest friends. The three were planning to meet in California. Ms. Hackel's plane hit the north tower of the trade center, followed a few minutes later by Ms. McCourt's plane, which struck the south tower.
Inside the north tower was Ms. McCourt's brother Ronald Clifford, a New Jersey businessman who was in the lobby of the Marriott Hotel for a meeting. As he left the building, Mr. Clifford helped carry a badly burned woman to safety. He did not know that his sister, niece and Ms. Hackel were in those planes until he reached his home that night and talked to his family and Ms. McCourt's husband, David.
On Sept. 15 more than 500 people filled St. Matthias Catholic church in East Lyme for a memorial service for Ruth and Juliana McCourt.
"She believed the opposite of the people who killed her," Rabbi Carl Astor of New London said at the service. "Ruth taught Juliana how to love other people and how to create beauty so this should be our response. There will be a time for justice. This is the time for love." 

'The Whole Building Shook'
He's not in good shape; he's not sleeping, he's not eating, and he's constantly breaking down in tears," said Axel Hansen of his 39-year-old son, Glen.
Glen Hansen was working at his family's international freight company, the Hansen Shipping Agency, right across West Street from the World Trade Center on the morning of Sept. 11 and was caught up in the disaster.
"I'm having an extremely hard time dealing with it," he said from his home in Kent last Sunday. "I am truly a wreck."
Mr. Hansen said he was looking through files in an office, which looks out at the face of the World Trade Center, "when all of a sudden, kaboom, the whole building shook. I looked out the window and saw these fireballs, and I immediately thought our roof was on fire. I ran out of the office, hit the fire alarm, went down to the lobby and people are screaming and crying. I ran outside and looked up and said, "Oh my God, they blew up the World Trade Center. We're under attack."
Then, the second tower was hit. "I ran back in, screaming to everyone in the office, 'Get out of here!' "
Mr. Hansen and his colleagues watched in horror as the buildings crumbled and dozens of people jumped to escape the flames.
"There were bodies, debris, smoke everywhere," he said, struggling to hold back his sobs. "We started to head north as this cloud, this plume of smoke was coming like a locomotive behind us. The smell and the taste of that stuff was sick, like death."
Mr. Hansen was eventually able to walk 110 blocks north and then hitchhike to the Mount Vernon train station, making it home by around 4:30 p.m. He is seeking help from therapists and psychiatrists at New Milford Hospital and is finding some solace in prayer.
"I have gotten a total of nine hours' sleep since I woke up Tuesday morning," he said Sunday. "I'm a trained paratrooper and rescue diver, so I always thought I was a lot tougher than this. But, I'll tell you, I'm falling apart. All these things keep triggering these attacks of total terror: a plane flying overhead; the thunder storm we had the other night. Even the sound of an acorn falling on a tin roof made me jump through my skin."

He Went Back in to Help
Nearly a week after the attacks, Susan Gardner of Darien was still struggling to find a way to tell her two little boys that their father isn't coming home.
"She is going to grief counseling, and her therapist advised her not to tell them until she is ready," said Ms. Gardner's father, Kenneth Hecken of the town of Washington. "She is devastated, she's in extreme pain, but she's putting up a good front for the kids because she has no choice."
Christopher Gardner, 36, a senior executive at the Aon Corporation on the 104th floor of the trade center, has been missing since the attacks.
"We talked to one woman who saw him as they were trying to get out, but they parted ways on the 78th floor," Mr. Hecken said. "We got one or two unconfirmed reports that he got out of the building, but then went back in to help people. That's the kind of guy he was."
Mr. Hecken said his son-in-law was a joy in all of their lives. "I can tell you he was a real gem. I have never met a more wonderful person in all my life. He loved to sail, he was passionate about sailing. He was even more passionate about his wife and his children," Christopher, 3, and Alexander, 2.
Mr. Hecken said his wife, Audrey, was at the Gardner's house when the planes hit.
"She was babysitting for the grandchildren while Susan was at work" at Marsh & McLennan in midtown Manhattan. "Somebody called me, and I immediately turned on the TV and called Susan at her office. Unfortunately, she could see the whole thing from her office. She saw the collapse of the two towers and she just fell apart." 
Ms. Hecken runs Elysian Fields, a day spa in the center of New Preston, with her other daughter, Melissa Curtin of South Norwalk. The spa was dark and empty early last week, a sign on the door saying there's been a tragic death in the family.
"This has changed all of our lives forever," Mr. Hecken said. "All we can do is pray and hope that God can save the world." 

Hoping for a Miracle
Friends began filing the Darien home of Edward Francis Maloney III, who everyone knew as Teddy, as soon as word spread that he had been at work at Canton Fitzgerald on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center Tuesday. They stayed for days.
Mr. Maloney, 32, was outgoing, to the point where he typically asked the names of every person he met, from waiters and waitresses to store clerks. Neighbors on his former street in Darien proclaimed him unofficial mayor of the street, said a childhood friend, Trask Pfeifle. 
Mr. Maloney lived for his family, including his parents, Edward Jr., and Sally Maloney, and siblings. He was a devoted athlete, pursuing football, hockey and lacrosse in prep school, lacrosse in college, fishing, waterskiing and hockey.
"Everybody loved him," Mr. Pfeifle said. "We all know that out of these huge tragedies, miracles pop up. We're hoping for one of those."

Up Early and Out the Door
When Joshua Piver's friends used to visit him in New York City, he would often take him to the top of the World Trade Center, five floors above his office. 
The 23-year-old Piver, who grew up in Stonington, was in that office when the first jet crashed into the north tower. He has been missing since. 
Josh's sister Erika, 26, traveled to New York with some friends to bring a photo and description of him to the center set up to identify the missing. Mr. Piver's family soon found out he was not on a list of his company's employees who had escaped the building. They also called phone lines set up to find the missing and posted information about him on Internet sites and with the Red Cross.
Many of those friends that he taken to the trade center traveled home to Stonington on Sept. 14 to comfort Mr. Piver's mother, Susan, and attend a candlelight prayer service for all the victims at a local church. A few nights later about 30 of Mr. Piver's friends, many of whom live and work in New York City, gathered at a local home.
"He's the most easy-going, fun-loving guy." said Leah Dann. "Everyone got along with him. I've never known him to argue with anyone, even raise his voice. He's just the best. This has been a big nightmare."
A 1996 graduate of Stonington High School where he played soccer, Mr. Piver worked summers at a local boatyard. He graduated from the University of Vermont with a degree in economics in the spring of 2000. A few months later he went to work for Tradespark Inc., an energy company. It is part of Cantor Fitzgerald, the trade center firm that lost almost 700 of its 1,000 employees in the attack.
Mr. Piver lived with three friends and on the night before the attack they had celebrated signing a lease for a new apartment in Brooklyn.
On the morning of the attack Mr. Piver as usual was the first one awake and out of the apartment. A roommate, Dave Leeming, who had worked for the same company as Mr. Piver but had recently been transferred across the Hudson River to work on a project, said he last heard his friend in the shower before work. 
A few hours later as he and Mr. Piver's other friends heard about the attack on the north tower, they immediately began calling his office and cell phone. They only reached his voice mail.

'Very Private and Simple'
My dad was a really cool guy," said Matthew Gerlich, 19, of Monroe during an interview on Monday. "He was very private and simple, with no frills. But he had a really good sense of humor and loved sports."
Robert J. Gerlich, 56, an accountant who worked on the 94th floor of the north tower for the Guy Carpenter Company, a division of the Marsh McLennan insurance company, is among the thousands of missing people. He had returned to work Sept. 5, following hip replacement surgery.
Matthew said the family, his mother, Rochelle, and brother, Daniel, 22, remained hopeful his father would be found alive until Thursday when they realized no one had made it from floors 94 to 96. After Thursday, they began referring to Mr. Gerlich in the past tense. That was the last time they could bear to watch the TV coverage of the attack.
"The only thing we're grateful for is that he probably went out quickly," Matthew said.

A Family Trip
Right before Labor Day, Stephen Cherry of Stamford took his wife Mary Ellen and four children to Nantucket. The family was in the midst of building a new house, and Ms. Cherry told her husband that it was a bad time, that too much was going on in their lives. He insisted. For his birthday present, he said.
"I want my family," he told her, "to have this memory."
Today, Ms. Cherry is stunned at her husband's prescience. "He said to me, 'I need to do this,' " she remembered. "It was almost as though he knew something was going to happen."
Perhaps even more prescient, Mr. Cherry, a partner at Cantor Fitzgerald, called his wife at 8:42, a few minutes before the first plane hit. It was an atypical phone call. Mr. Cherry normally called her in the afternoon after the market had closed. "I'm hanging on to the fact," Ms. Cherry said, "that we said our 'I love yous.' "
Mr. Cherry would have been 42 this Tuesday. Most weekends he could be found playing golf with some of his four children, Jeremy, 14 and Peter, 13, Brett, 6, and Colton, 11 months.
"What I want people to know is how important his family was, how much he loved me and the kids," Ms. Cherry said. "Kind was an understatement for him. He always told the children, 'Treat people as you want to be treated.' And his family and all of his friends know that Steve was probably helping people at Cantor Tuesday before he would get out himself. I want people to know how special he was."

Dealing With Hijackers
Donald F. Greene of Greenwich was an engineer who worked for the Safe Flight Instrument Corporation, a White Plains company founded by his father, Leonard Greene, an inventor of aircraft safety instruments.
He was flying to Lake Tahoe, Calif. on Flight 93 to join his four brothers for a long-anticipated hiking vacation when the plane was hijacked. Although family and friends have no evidence, they are certain he was one of the passengers who fought the hijackers.
"Beyond a shadow of a doubt," Claudette Greene, his wife, said. "Anyone who knew him had the same feeling. We just know that, that day, he rose above."
The couple met at an arts fund-raiser with an aircraft theme. The event had come up short one plane, and Mr. Greene, who had not planned to attend, flew in one of his company's planes to fill the gap.
"He ended up at my table, Ms. Greene said. "He was wearing a tuxedo, I was all dressed up. Three years later we were married. It was like a Cinderella story."

'I'll See You Later'
On Sept. 8, one day after John and Margaret Iskyan celebrated their 16th anniversary, Ms. Iskyan walked into the old town hall in Wilton to shouts of "Surprise!"
Her husband had managed to pull off a 40th birthday party without her knowledge, keeping it quiet since he began the planning in May. 
A bond broker in government securities for Cantor Fitzgerald, Mr. Iskyan, 41, was known for both his thoughtfulness and his methodical nature.
"He planned everything he ever did well," said Bob Keeling, who is married to Ms. Iskyan's sister, Linda. "He was a very serious man, yet he had a great sense of humor."
The family often skied together in Vermont, where Mr. Iskyan had attended St. Michael's College and where he had met his wife. "Margaret often said if John could ski 365 days a year, he would," Mr. Keeling said. 
Mr. Iskyan was on the board of directors of the Wilton Lacrosse Association, and coached the lacrosse team on which his son, Peter, 12, played. The couple also have a daughter, Carolynn, 9. 
The day of the disaster, Mr. Iskyan was on the phone with a close friend from Wilton. "We're evacuating," he said. "I'll see you later." The friend wished him good luck. 
The family received a call early Friday that Mr. Iskyan's body had been located. "Margaret feels blessed that John has been found and we can have a service," Mr. Keeling said, a ceremony that was held last week. "And she is very concerned about those people who have not been found."

A Faint Message
The Saturday before the terrorist attack, Susan Wohlforth of Greenwich, her husband, Martin, and their 16-year-old daughter, Chloe, attended the 5 p.m. mass at the Church of St. Michael the Archangel on North Street in Greenwich, a mass they attended each week. The next Saturday, Susan and Chloe Wohlforth sat in the pew alone. Mr. Wohlforth, whom family and friends knew as "Buff," is among the missing and presumed dead. In all, St. Michael's lost 11 parishioners.
A managing director and bond trader for Sandler O'Neill & Partners on the 104th floor of the south tower, Mr. Wohlforth, 47, called his wife after the first plane hit the north tower to tell her he was fine.
"I think everybody should get out of there," Mrs. Wohlforth advised.
Calmed, she headed to the offices of the Junior League of Greenwich, of which she is president. After the plane hit the south tower, her husband called the offices before she arrived.
A secretary received a faint message. "This is Buff Wohlforth," he said, and asked for his wife. The connection then was severed.
"He was your all-American clean-cut good kid, handsome and witty, smart and kind," said Nancy Seaman, a childhood friend whose brother was friendly with Mr. Wohlforth. "I remember when my brother was sick with leukemia, Buffy would ride his bike over all the time to visit."
His greatest passion, say friends and relatives, was for his family.
"He was the best father, the best husband, and I couldn't be here right now except I believe he is with me," said Ms. Wohlforth, standing outside St. Michael's after mass let out. "I want people to know he was a great man -- not the only great man lost in this tragedy, but a great man nonetheless."

From a Distance, A New Closeness

BYLINE:  By DEBRA GALANT

 BODY:
IT reminded me, I realized later, of "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," the painting by Georges Seurat.
 The weather was perfect. People were strolling, talking in small groups, walking with children, even picnicking under a tree. And as in the painting, most of the people were looking in one direction. 
 The similarity ended there. The people I saw weren't looking at the Seine, but at the starkly altered skyline of Lower Manhattan. It was not Sunday afternoon, but Wednesday afternoon.
It was the day after.
The place was the Eagle Rock Reservation in West Orange, a park whose restaurant, the Highlawn Pavilion, is famous for its "heart-stopping views of Manhattan," or so says an old restaurant review.
People were gawking, having come to witness with their own eyes what they had seen on television or in the newspaper. Praying. Taking photographs. Paying homage. Being with other people. Taking it in.
Many had parked at a nearby bowling alley or diner or at the Kmart, since so many people had had the same idea that the police had stopped cars from entering the park.
Emer Pool, binoculars hanging from her neck, crossed herself.
"It's like a wake, being here," she said.
Next to her, her husband, Barry carried their baby in a Snugli. He had been maybe 100 yards from the World Trade Center when the second plane hit.
Though heart-stopping and wakelike, the scene was also a celebration. Wife, husband, baby. Alive, together, safe. A day in the park.
Joe Lacerenza of Mendham, an electrical contractor working near the reservation, came "just to take a look at the scene like everybody else." He had been at a seminar at the Marriott in East Hanover a day earlier, the day the world changed forever.
"You know that it happened," he said, "but you just have to come see for yourself that they're not standing there anymore."
Pam Wood, of Bloomfield, who came with friends, wanted the opposite.
"I don't want it to be real," she said. "I was hoping to come up and see something different."
Next to me, a man who preferred not to identify himself spoke with terse bitterness. An employee of Prudential, he said had at least five friends in the securities business who had not been accounted for.
He speculated on how disastrous it would be for the stock market and the local economy. "My quote is, 'I thought the stock market crashes in October,' " he said with a tight, grim smile.
Below us, 15 miles to the east, Midtown appeared bright and clear. There, in almost total clarity, stood the Empire State Building, a beacon from an earlier era. To the right, downtown was cloaked in a haze, an inexhaustible cloud of rising smoke.
Like everybody, I have been hearing the stories, each like a dot in the Seurat painting: the people who were late to work and never made it to the World Trade Center; someone with leukemia who had taken the day off because he was sick.
"Can you imagine?" one person asked. "Being lucky to have leukemia?"
My Poland Spring delivery man had left his route right after the first plane slammed the World Trade Center and took water close to the rescue scene.
At a Red Cross center not far from Eagle Rock Reservation, Gil Cisneros of Montclair, who was waiting to give blood, told of a phone conversation he had had with a friend on the 97th floor of the south tower just minutes after the first plane and just before the other one.
His friend told him she had been advised to stay where she was, and was nervously calculating what to do.
She is still unaccounted for.
Children, as we know, see things differently. In a week that is indelibly etched in the nation's consciousness, my 9-year-old son was distressed by the fact that Yankees games were canceled.
"Are we ever going to be allowed to be happy?" he asked.
Millions of stories. Everyone has one. And then there are the thousands we will never know. But everyone was somewhere when their heart stopped. Each of us, in that moment of shock, felt the distance between ourselves and the people we love, and calculated our chances of reunion. 
Some of us were lucky. The calculus worked out. We may walk around in shock, but we can still do it in a lovely park, even with those we love the most.
Georges Seurat changed the way we see the world. He anticipated pixels and television, and the discovery of the atom. Ultimately, his painting was about the fact that there is no substance. Just light, air, the present moment.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Four Parcels Ready for Development; 
New Focus on Queens West Office Sites

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The Queens West Development Corporation has a site: four large parcels of waterfront property across the East River from the United Nations. And the site has a pre-approved project: nearly 2.5 million square feet of commercial and retail space. And the project has a designated developer: LCOR, the builders of 101 Hudson Street in Jersey City. And the developer has an architect: Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, designers of the Ernst & Young headquarters being built at 5 Times Square. 
 What they had been waiting for was a tenant. 
 "I don't think they're going to have to wait any longer," Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said last week, as companies scrambling for space after the Sept. 11 attack began to turn their attention from immediate to longer-range needs.
Mr. Gargano said the commercial development of Queens West -- which was once expected to start sometime before the end of 2004 -- could begin by the new year. "We can get that site ready for people to move in within 18 to 20 months," he said.
To accommodate the most ambitious possible project, Mr. Gargano said, a fifth large development parcel immediately to the south of the LCOR site, originally intended for residential use, may be folded into the development, which would bring the potential total to 3.5 million square feet.
Also possible, he said, though less likely, would be to raise the established building height limits for Queens West to 700 feet from 400 feet. That could conceivably bring the commercial development potential to a total of 5 million square feet.
(Mr. Gargano's agency is the parent of the Queens West corporation, which includes representatives of the city, the borough president and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.)
Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens said she favored altering the master plan for Queens West however necessary to encourage rapid development: increasing density, expanding the commercial core, even raising the height limits, so long as it passed muster with the Federal Aviation Administration. "We should do whatever it takes to keep our economic base," Mrs. Shulman said.
The architects are "gearing up for this monumental effort," said Kurt M. Eichler, executive vice president of LCOR. He noted that the buildings could have trading floors up to 80,000 square feet and said if there were a way to increase density on the site, "it makes all the sense in the world."
The LCOR parcels take up 13.5 acres in the southern half of the 74-acre Queens West site, which is two blocks from the No. 7 subway line. To the north are the existing Citylights apartment tower, and residential sites controlled by AvalonBay Communities and the Rockrose Development Corporation (where the giant Pepsi-Cola sign stands).
"The icing on the cake is that you have a tremendous 24-hour environment that can be developed," Mr. Eichler said. DAVID W. DUNLAP

HEADLINE: In the Suburbs, Displaced Companies Are Gobbling Up Space 

BYLINE:  Elsa Brenner, Eleanor Charles, Antoinette Martin and Carole Paquette contributed to this article.

 BODY:
WITH a discomfiting mix of emotions, commercial real estate brokers in the suburban ring around the city have been repeatedly reaching for their insistent phones in recent days.
 In the days since the terrorist attack, brokers say, representatives of displaced companies have been constantly calling, seeking the choicest space available as close as possible to the local train station. In some cases, deals have been based on little more than a handshake, followed soon by the arrival of the first reverse commuters. 
 Reluctant to take advantage of the demand, some landlords are being flexible in their rents, the brokers say. At the same time, with expectations of a longer-term tight market, rental deals that had lingered in the talking stage have rapidly closed, and construction schedules have been expedited.

Connecticut
"I guess half a million square feet will be leased in Stamford by dislocated New York companies," said Ed Tonnessen, executive vice president at the Albert B. Ashforth agency in Stamford. "And they are throwing a wide net over Fairfield, Westchester and New Jersey, with a premium on speed."
Most of what is available in Fairfield is sublease space in Stamford, where companies expecting to expand took more space than they needed. The second-quarter vacancy rate this year was 13.68 percent. "And the rate was growing" until the terrorist attack, said Joseph McGee, a vice president at Connecticut's Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association.
Rents last year ranged from $25.91 to $34.68 per square foot. This year, before Sept. 11, they rose to between $27.84 and $40.19. Now, brokers agree, they are negotiable. Figures supplied by Insignia/ESG indicate that 2.1 million square feet is available in Stamford out of 5.5 million square feet for all of Fairfield County.
American Express was the first company to sign a major agreement, capturing the largest space in the city -- 175,000 square feet at 400 Atlantic Street. Scott Landis, head of the Landis Group, which bought the 500,000-square-foot building in December, would not disclose the lease terms. "We had 52 calls," he said. "There was no bidding war, no raising of prices -- just a handshake." American Express employees began moving in on Monday.
Deals are being made quietly, according to brokers, with people moving in almost secretly.
Zurich Reinsurance, whose Chase Manhattan Plaza and Cortlandt Street locations in New York are temporarily closed, took 6,000 additional feet at its 40,000-square-foot offices at Canterbury Green in Stamford, which the company says is now serving as its principal operating office. 
Last Friday Connecticut's Department of Economic and Community Development set up a team at the governor's office in Bridgeport. "We have done an inventory of available space," said Oley Carpt, director of the operation, "and we are receiving calls from brokers adding to the list on a daily basis." New York companies seeking information can call (203) 336-8700. ELEANOR CHARLES

WITH a discomfiting mix of emotions, commercial real estate brokers in the suburban ring around the city have been repeatedly reaching for their insistent phones in recent days.
 In the days since the terrorist attack, brokers say, representatives of displaced companies have been constantly calling, seeking the choicest space available as close as possible to the local train station. In some cases, deals have been based on little more than a handshake, followed soon by the arrival of the first reverse commuters. 
 Reluctant to take advantage of the demand, some landlords are being flexible in their rents, the brokers say. At the same time, with expectations of a longer-term tight market, rental deals that had lingered in the talking stage have rapidly closed, and construction schedules have been expedited.

Westchester
In Westchester, as elsewhere, brokers' phones keep ringing. "It's constant," said Christopher O'Callaghan, a partner in McCarthy-O'Callaghan in White Plains. "There's a tremendous amount of activity."
At the county's Office of Economic Development and Real Estate, the director, Salvatore Carrera, said about five million square feet was available. Mr. Carrera, whose office is cooperating with the New York City Office of Economic Development and the Empire State Development Corporation, said he was encouraging landlords and brokers to offer below-market rates to firms needing temporary quarters.
There are two commercial buildings available in the county that could accommodate large companies. Cohen Brothers Realty has 500,000 square feet available in four buildings at 333 Westchester Avenue in White Plains. Charles Cohen, the president, said rents would be below $30 per square foot. The building was occupied by General Foods, which moved into it 44 years ago. The complex, at North Street and Westchester Avenue, has been empty since 1997.
The other large contiguous space is Texaco's 725,000-square-foot headquarters in Harrison. The company has decided to put the building up for sale because of its pending merger with Chevron. The glass-and-travertine-marble building sits on 107 acres. The property is being marketed by Insignia/ESG, which would not discuss prices. The building has been used as Texaco's world headquarters since its construction in 1977.
That space is fully occupied now, and because the merger is not yet completed, the Texaco headquarters will not be available until the first of the year, said Steven Bardsley of Insignia/ESG. Over all, the county had a vacancy rate of 13.1 percent at midyear. The county's average asking annual rent per square foot is $26.27. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Finding Hope in the Timeless Tale of 'Romeo and Juliet'

BYLINE:  By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
WHAT part can theater play when life is in upheaval? At a time of grieving, do people feel comfortable about being entertained?
 Go to a show, political leaders tell us. Business as usual, economic advisors say. It is the entertainer's business, as the song goes, to "make 'em laugh." People have turned to entertainment when there is a national crisis, said Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theaters and Producers. 
 Still, last week Broadway theaters reported an 80 percent decline in ticket sales since the attacks, and one new musical, "Assassins," has been canceled. 
Even the McCarter Theater in Princeton, which is more concerned with taste than tourism, dropped "The Vienna Notes," by Richard Nelson, a play about a hostage crisis scheduled to open next month. "It would be insensitive of us to present the play at this moment in our history," said Emily Mann, the McCarter's artistic director.
The current production at the McCarter, which opened on Sept. 14, is indisputably a tragedy, but it could have been divinely chosen for the moment, for it fulfills the highest purpose of theater -- to enlighten and to purge, to create order out of chaos.
The play is about the human impulse to hate, and as much about the need to love. Ultimately, each audience member must reflect upon which force wins.
The play was written in 1595. It is called "Romeo and Juliet." Though you may have seen it before, after seeing Ms. Mann's new staging, you may not be so sure. At least you will see it anew. And that is the difference between timely and timeless.
"Classics give us comfort through perspective," said Bonnie J. Monte, artistic director of the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival in Madison, where a new production of "Tartuffe" by Moliere, directed by Paul Mullins, opened on Sept. 15.
"I'm a great champion of the classics," she added. "Rarely do I stray. They are a better road map to the future. New stuff is too immediate."
This season, there is less new stuff anyway, compared with recent repertories of New Jersey's professional theaters. Revivals are a safer bet than new productions, and safety may be the way to go, given that three theaters -- Crossroads in New Brunswick, American Stage in Teaneck and Luna Stage in Montclair -- will be dark all season, and one -- Forum in Metuchen -- is still juggling schedules and postponing plays, and does not appear to have a full lineup.
Meanwhile, many of the revivals are so familiar they might be called retreads. So unless those productions are revelatory, classical plays may prove more sustaining than ever in a disquieting time. 
The McCarter's production of Moliere's "Don Juan," which begins performances on April 30, is to restore material censored in the 17th century. Stephen Wadsworth, the McCarter's recurring gift to local theater, is both adapter and director. And Ibsen's "Peer Gynt" ought to be a new test of resources for the resourceful Two River Theater Company in Manasquan.
"Tartuffe" is the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's first Moliere in the 11 years of Ms. Monte's tenure.
"At first, people think 'Tartuffe' is a trivial confection, and it is a miraculous comedy," Ms. Monte said, pointing to Moliere's satiric thrusts at hypocrisy, piety and false morality, and their relevance to recent conservative political views.
But for centuries, Moliere's classic has resonated with sadness, profundity, closeness to tragedy, and, in the words of Stendhal, "the probing of the depths of the human heart."
Moliere is no stranger to McCarter audiences, but Shakespeare was a first try for Ms. Mann. Classics endure because they represent and fulfill "a higher level," Ms. Mann said, referring to human truths, mythic status and satisfaction of the soul, terms that may sound lofty, if only because they are rarely encountered. That is why they are called classics.
Besides, she continued, "they're real, alive and never dated. And they have legs." 
Ms. Mann said the story of star-crossed lovers, "crushed under the weight of hatred is eerily appropriate to what's happening now." She added: "I am moving more and more toward the classics. There's a burning need to do them. After last week's horror, the whole cast dug deeper into the rivers of grief and the levels of beauty in this play."
The coming together of two feuding families in the final moments of "Romeo," after the sacrifice of their children -- Juliet was 14 -- to an inexplicable hatred, offers a ray of hope. That was an impression, often expressed, among young people, ages 10 to 17, at the first of five performances for students from local schools at the McCarter last Tuesday morning.
"You've got to believe that in light of what happened in New York," said Luke Palder, a 14-year-old ninth grader at Hopewell Valley Central High School. "The play makes you notice how petty all the fighting is."
"You know the families will drop it, and that wakes us up to the error of our own ways," he continued. "So you could adapt this to any time period."
Katie Kirnam, a 13-year-old ninth grader at Stuart Country Day School in Princeton, said "You realize how much more powerful love is."
"Ironically, two families hate each other, and it's love that brings them together," she said. "It's funny and it's sad."
Taj Pannell, 12, in the seventh grade at the same school, said: "The rivalry never ends. I want to say, stop it, stop the fighting, if it keeps happening the children will die."
Even the pace of Ms. Mann's staging, breath-stopping in both swiftness and sensuality, is true to the time line of a story that takes place in three or four days. The director rearranged passages and cut 1,000 lines. Though Lady Capulet and Lady Montague reach out and connect at the end, while their husbands do not, the lines of reconciliation that customarily close the play, perhaps on a note of false sentiment and contrived affirmation, are here not spoken.
Not that hope is dashed. But its possibility is more thoughtful and realistic. "A scourge on both your houses" are the last words in Ms. Mann's version, reinforcing Juliet's first thoughts ("My only love sprung from my only hate") and Romeo's early references to hope in misery and "love's heavy burden."
Brawls and swordplay are unstinting. The rush of rapture overtakes Romeo, played by an impetuously ardent Jeffrey Carlson, all "quivering love," and Juliet, played by Sarah Drew, petulant, giddy, incorrigibly girlish, willful and completely enchanting in a never-to-be-forgotten balcony scene.
Ms. Drew's exploration of a teenager's heart and her awakening to desire are defining, and from now on, indelible, aspects of Juliet. In embraces that astonish, these lovers embody passion and purity.
The cast plays in splendid harmony. Delicately touched by Donald Holder's lighting, the production is at once spare and sumptuous. After Tuesday's performance, expected titters from the teenagers in the audience during scenes of purposeful physicality alternated with stunned silences and gasps of recognition, as in a scene between Juliet and her mother. Later, Ms. Mann and the cast held a discussion with the students and teachers, who that day represented 11 schools.
Stephen Rowe, who gives a psychologically knowing performance as Capulet, Juliet's father, talked about his own daughter. 
"As parents, we do our best, but sometimes we're not listening to our kids," he said.
Karla Kling, a seventh-grade teacher at Stuart Country Day in Princeton, asked cast members to comment on the broader implications of the play, considering the violence in society today.
Ms. Mann replied that Shakespeare does not say why these families are "out to kill each other." "And it doesn't matter," she added.
She was talking about hate, and about love. Everybody listened and heard. What a morning.

Time For theBoomers To Dig In

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears on the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THINGS did not look good. The stock market was down to three-year lows. Many companies were reporting weak earnings and eliminating executive bonuses and hundreds of thousands of jobs. The unemployment rate had climbed to 4.9 percent and consumer spending had slowed.
 That's what the economy looked like before the world stood still on Sept. 11, not that many people can now remember that far back. I can. A friend of mine who had worked for her company for about 10 years was laid off when her company decided to outsource her job. Another friend, thrilled about a job that paid almost two-thirds more than her previous one, lost it when her company let several people go. As if that wasn't bad enough, after she hurriedly scheduled a doctor's appointment before her health insurance ran out, she was told that she had skin cancer. (She is receiving treatment, and has even found another job, but she had to settle for less than her previous salary.) 
 I wasn't hearing those kinds of stories a year ago, and now they may become worse. Previously, conversations were about our wealth and early retirement. My generation was like Snoopy dancing in joy on top of his dog house, head thrown back, not a care in the world. All of that now seems so long ago. The party appears over.
"It certainly feels like it is," said Michael Van Kleeck, a certified financial planner in Beverly Hills, Calif. "All the news is bad, unlike the beginning of 2000 when everything was rosy."
There is no telling how serious the long-term effects of the terrorist attacks will be on our spending and investing habits. Even before the attacks, baby boomers were becoming gloomier. A closer look at the Conference Board's consumer confidence index for August shows that while the index fell to 114.3, from 116.3 in July, the index for people under 35 and those 55 and over actually rose. It's the boomers who became more depressed. Households headed by 35- to 54-year-olds, a category that comprises mostly boomers, fell to 112.3 from 117.8 in July. 
Mr. Van Kleeck said the market decline had already led several of his clients to delay their retirement plans. Last week, though, he saw some signs of hope.
"I've had a few clients say they want to buy stocks to support the cause, but I tell them you never want to do emotional buying and selling," he said. "But it was nice to hear that."
James P. Gerhardt, 58, and his wife, Charlene, 55, of Valencia, Calif., had planned to retire in a few years. But Mr. Gerhardt, a computer programmer, was laid off twice in a year. They had sold a second home, avoided vacations, even cut back on playing golf. Mr. Gerhardt said his investment portfolio was worth about $300,000 in 1999 and rose to about $500,000 at one point last year. This year, he had given most of those gains back. In the days after the attacks, as the markets were closed, he debated what to do with his investments.
"After the disaster, knowing the market was going to take a hit, I was going to move into cash," he said. "But I reconsidered. I made a decision to ride it out and hope for the best."
PAUL ALLEN, 40, of Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., was laid off in early July and found another job by mid-August. But the layoff had been a shock.
"You know, everything is green and green and you're making more money than your parents," said Mr. Allen, a software salesman who works from his home. "You think you can work anywhere as long as you want. I didn't think I would be on the cut list. You never think it's going to be you."
But it has created an opportunity. Last weekend, he received a rollover check from his last company's 401(k) retirement savings account; he plans to put it back into the stock market as soon as the check clears. As the market fell before the attacks, he wondered where the bottom would be. Now, he said, he thinks the market has found it.
"What are you going to do, give up?" he said. "Put all your money into bonds? I want to retire, too."
So here we are, many of us looking over a precipice that wasn't there two weeks ago. As boomers, we have acquired the reputation of being a bit spoiled, a bit too cocky, so I would guess that our critics are watching to see how we now handle ourselves. Our parents dealt with the Great Depression and World War II with dignity and resolve. Now it's our chance to shine.
I'm confident that we will. We were taught by that generation, and if you gouge our surface, I believe you will find their ideals and strength underneath. We are much like our parents, and, because of their example, maybe even better.

World Trade Center Benefit Concert

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters

 BODY:
The Citizens Redevelopment Corporation, a nonprofit economic development group in Asbury Park, and the city's most famous club, the Stone Pony, will sponsor a concert on Sept. 28 to benefit the families of fire, first aid and police officers who lost their lives in the World Trade Center attack. Proceeds will go to the Twin Towers fund set up by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York. 
 Highway Nine, formerly Sam Hill, a pop-rock band based in Asbury Park, will headline the show, which is scheduled to run from 6 to 9 p.m. The group, whose first album is due out in February, will play an acoustic set; local artists will be invited to join them on stage, said Eileen Chapman, a Stone Pony spokeswoman. 
 Admission is $20; tickets can be bought at the door. Anyone bringing a bottle of water, which will be taken to the rescue site in lower Manhattan, will receive a free drink. Karen DeMasters

Priorities In the Wake Of a Shattered Taboo

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
THE terrorist attacks that crippled commerce were unquestionably a defining moment in American history. Out of the horror are likely to come many changes, most of them painful, but a few beneficial. Years of resistance to government spending probably dissolved on Sept. 11. That is beneficial.
 Government spending has always played an essential role in market systems. It is necessary not only in moments of crisis -- like the present one, to rebuild Lower Manhattan or to save the airlines from a calamity beyond their control -- but also in more normal times, to carry out tasks that the private sector shuns. There is no profit in financing the armed forces or airport security or in raising unemployment benefits. 
The list is long and choices have to be made. Now that terrorism has suddenly given federal spending a higher priority than preserving the budget surplus, we have chosen to splurge initially on the military, on airport security, on saving the airlines, on helping New York. These are all worthy choices. But should we stop there?
Definitely not. Neither should we be indiscriminate. Quality, not quantity, is the goal, and there are guidelines. Respectable economic theory holds that government spending, properly directed, lifts the private sector and makes it more useful and profitable. Since the early 1970's, our rhetoric and many of our policies have ignored this synergy. Instead, we have pitted the government and the private sector against each other, with government portrayed as wasteful and inept and the private sector as the efficient source of prosperity and well-being. 
The stock market bubble, now burst, and excessive and profitless business investments, now weighing on the economy, testify that the private sector can go haywire. The enormously damaging terrorist attacks, coming on top of a sinking economy, may convince the public that a successful, enduring market economy requires that government and the private sector march arm in arm. 
"This is a big moment in American history, and the definition of a big moment is that things change, including attitudes toward public spending," said William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard.
So some voice should be given to the few experts who have been quietly trying to figure out the most effective government spending. M. Ishaq Nadiri, a New York University economist, is a leader in this research. He would have the federal government spend billions to equip the nation's public schools with computers and Internet connections, thus augmenting human capital. If the installations were extended to state and local government offices, he says, there would be a gain in efficiency. And the flow of revenue would be a lifesaver today for computer manufacturers, software companies and other technology suppliers.
"You will have a fresh foundation for the future growth of these industries, as well as a modernized and more productive public sector," Mr. Nadiri said.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is pushing for an improvement in unemployment insurance, which now gives workers who lose their jobs roughly one-third of their old pay for a maximum of 26 weeks. Unemployment pay is increasingly important in a nation that has accepted layoffs as standard corporate practice. Adjusted for inflation, the benefits today are less than they were in the 1960's, and fewer workers are eligible. "The federal government is about to give billions of dollars to the airlines," said Thomas Palley, assistant director for public policy at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Surely some of that money should go to the laid-off workers."
MY own favorite for public spending is child care. There are parallels here to airport security. The terrorist attacks have brought people to the realization that airport security cannot be adequate when the security machinery is operated by poorly trained, diffident workers earning only $6 or $7 an hour. The airlines, which are responsible for security, make no profit from it, and turn over the work to subcontractors who profit only by shaving labor quality below acceptable standards.
High-quality child care is similarly profitless. Most families can afford only the low-cost variety. And yet the payoff from quality airport security and quality child care suggests that government money would be well spent -- improving the private sector -- if the subsidies permitted wages of $15 or even $20 an hour, attracting skilled people who took pride in their work.
That is my priority. More important are the priorities that would emerge from public debate. The terrorist attacks, for all their horror, shattered the taboo on government spending. Let us hope that this is a defining moment, as Mr. Kristol suggests, and that the taboo stays gone.

Susan Corinne Blinkhorn and Richard August Gallun Jr., were married in the Adirondacks yesterday. The Rev. Milton Dudley, a Congregational minister, officiated at the Ausable Club in St. Huberts, N.Y.
 The bride, 35, will continue to use her name professionally. She is a freelance writer based in Chicago, specializing in food and travel stories. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin. 
 Her father, Thomas A. Blinkhorn of Washington, retired as a senior manager of the Europe and Central Asia regions for the World Bank. He is now a senior adviser to the bank. Her mother, Lois C. Blinkhorn of Milwaukee, retired as the book editor of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
The bridegroom, 37, is the president and chief executive of bSwift, an online company in Chicago that works with employee benefits. He graduated from Williams College and Harvard Business School. He is a son of Katherine Paulsen of Milwaukee and Mr. Gallun Sr. of Aspen, Colo. His father is the senior vice president for mergers and acquisitions at Fiserv Inc. in Milwaukee.
Ms. Blinkhorn and Mr. Gallun met in November 1998 at a party in New York given by mutual friends.
"I was immediately struck by his rare combination of New York savvy and Midwestern nicety," said Ms. Blinkhorn, who like Mr. Gallun was then a Wisconsinite living in Manhattan. 
But at the end of the evening there was no exchange of numbers. Intrigued by him, Ms. Blinkhorn did a little research and found out the reason: Mr. Gallun had a girlfriend. She also learned that he had accepted a job offer in Chicago.
"I wrote Rich off as another good one who got away," Ms. Blinkhorn remembered.
Then, in May 1999, Mr. Gallun called her to ask a favor. His mother and stepfather, Norman Paulsen, were visiting New York from Milwaukee. Would she accompany him in taking them for a night on the town?
"I was suspicious of being a last-minute date replacement," said Ms. Blinkhorn, who did not know that Mr. Gallun and his girlfriend had by then broken up. "Still, dinner at the Gramercy Tavern and Bobby Short at the Carlyle, that was my kind of favor."
She met Mr. Gallun's party at the restaurant. But Mr. Gallun, who was to arrive straight from the airport, didn't appear for 45 minutes. When he joined the party, he saw that everybody was having a fine time.
"The fact that my mother and her husband were coming to town gave me reason to take the initiative and explore my interest in Susan," he said. "Besides," he added, "I thought they'd make me look good."
As it turned out, Mr. Gallun did not need them to pave the way for him. "At the end of the evening, I still didn't know if it had been an actual date," Ms. Blinkhorn recalled. "But I did know that this was the man I wanted to marry."

HEADLINE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE; 
The Comfort of Sturgeon

BYLINE:  By Alex Witchel

 BODY:
IN the last two weeks, certainly, dinner parties have not been anyone's priority. They still aren't. But on Thursday night, when Jews across the country break the fast that signals the end of Yom Kippur, families and friends will gather to eat the bagels and smoked fish that customarily mark the occasion. And at 550 of those homes across America, one man will be the caterer: Gary Greengrass of Barney Greengrass in New York.
 This year, what Mr. Greengrass is sending by Federal Express overnight delivery are not just meals, but comfort -- proof that New York is still here and that the food so many people grew up with, food that means family and home and safety, will be on their tables as it always has been. 
 "It's a tradition that people latch onto," Mr. Greengrass said. "We're part of peoples' lives for whom it wouldn't be Yom Kippur without this food. So we're able to touch a lot of lives in a positive way and be there to make a better occasion, a nicer time." 
While many New York restaurants have been half-empty since Sept. 11, only two customers canceled their break-fast orders, Mr. Greengrass said. Because Yom Kippur is a High Holy Day, it will be observed no matter what. "People out of town are sad," he said, "but they've still ordered. This year it seems to have even more meaning to them to have family and friends around them than it has in the past."
In recent years, as American culture became increasingly celebration-happy in a buoyant economy, Yom Kippur, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, has turned, for many, from an intimate family gathering to a more expansive, open-house event. The idea is to kick off the Jewish New Year in style. Mr. Greengrass says his average orders in New York alone are for parties of 20 to 50 people.
But the World Trade Center attack has changed the face of some holiday plans. Barry C. Kleiman of El Cerrito, Calif., expected to have 60 people to his home this year, including his parents, who live in Philadelphia. He now expects 8 to 20. "Everybody here is melancholy," he said. "We can't begin to relate to what people in New York are going through. But getting our Barney package is bonding food for us. It means home, family, roots."
Family is also what defines Barney Greengrass. Founded by Gary's grandfather Barney in 1908, the original store opened in Harlem and moved to its current location at 541 Amsterdam Avenue at 86th Street in 1929. After Barney's death, his son, Moe, took over and is still in residence, though in fragile health. Gary now runs the store, which includes a small restaurant, and he supervises its tonier satellite in Beverly Hills, which opened in 1994 on the fifth floor of Barneys New York.
For the Yom Kippur break-fast, Mr. Greengrass fills 350 advance orders in New York, 75 in Los Angeles (many customers there skip the West Coast store and order direct from New York) and 125 in cities and towns in between as diverse as Savannah; Omaha; Kansas City, Mo.; and one of Mr. Greengrass's favorite addresses, Zephyr Cove, Nev. And that is in addition to the walk-in business in the New York store the day before Yom Kippur, when he usually counts 200 to 300 people.
Ed Levine, in "New York Eats (More)" (St. Martin's Press), writes of the food at Barney Greengrass: "The sturgeon here is a work of art; the smoked salmon is beyond reproach; and the homemade borscht, pickled herring and chopped liver are all first-rate." 
Also first-rate is the store's pristine packaging of its catering orders (white paper separates each slice of cheese, orange juice is fresh squeezed and each cheese blintz is handmade). Mr. Greengrass has been known to pick up the phone the day before Yom Kippur to apologize for the inferior quality of the chubs (baby whitefish) in the market that day, asking permission to substitute regular whitefish, instead.
That personalized service is why Jill Grey, a transplanted New Yorker living in Los Angeles, seeks out Mr. Greengrass. She and her husband, Brad Grey, the chairman of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, have 60 for their annual gathering and expect to again this year. "We also include business people because there are a lot here working, without their families," Mrs. Grey said. "And the cantor comes to my house to break the fast, just for the sturgeon."
The cantor has good taste. Sturgeon sells for $48 a pound; Eastern nova, the milder, upscale alternative to low-down salty belly lox, is $35 a pound. "We slice 1,500 pounds of nova here," Mr. Greengrass said. "From this little hole in the wall."
Though the Beverly Hills store also fills advance orders (flown in from New York), it doesn't feel the same as New York. For one thing, its menu includes salade nicoise and grilled chicken quesadillas. Mr. Greengrass shrugged. "When in Rome," he said. "Out there it's fancy-shmancy. Here we're just shmancy."
He's right. With its stained wallpaper and linoleum floors, the store's decor conjures Grand Concourse Grandma circa 1940. Mr. Greengrass, 41, who last Thursday wore jeans and a polo shirt with a pen stuck between the buttons, was finally sitting down after the lunch rush. He didn't sit long. The phone kept ringing; not just with orders, but with customers and friends checking in after the trade center attack. Mr. Greengrass's brother, Barney, is a financial consultant at Salomon Smith Barney and works, fortunately, in Midtown. But even Barney, along with Mr. Greengrass's wife, Sharon, the chief financial officer of the Garnet Group, a hedge fund, helps assemble Yom Kippur orders.
"When I was growing up, my parents would come in days before to slice nova," Mr. Greengrass recalled. "The pressure is incomprehensible." For the week prior to the holiday, Mr. Greengrass will work each day until 1 a.m. On Tuesday he will come to the store at 8 a.m., supervise a temporary crew of 30, and go home on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. He will take a shower and go straight to synagogue, where, he admits, he sometimes dozes. 
Because of the strain, he limits the orders he can take. "I'm just a little guy," he said, smiling. "What I'm knocking my brains out for, Zabar's probably does in an hour. But there's not the personal service we have here."
Scott Goldshine, general manager at Zabar's, says that his store fills 300 to 400 advance orders in New York. But anyone who has ever braved the crowds to shop there the day before Yom Kippur -- not to mention the day of, when the store remains open -- knows that the bulk of the business is walk-in. 
"They have their clientele and we have ours," Mr. Greengrass said. "Our repeat rate is in the high 90 percentile each year. Part of the satisfaction is making people happy, which we've done from generation to generation. It's a tradition I feel an obligation to uphold."
Rhea Isaacs, a native of Minneapolis, is one of many who are grateful. "I have 75 people to my house to break the fast," she said. "I had heard through my sister in New York about Barney Greengrass, and I started there with Gary's father, Moe. This year for the first time I'm also having them send corned beef, pastrami and rye bread because my 87-year-old mother, who was born in New York, asked if they would send a corned beef sandwich too. So, I'm going to make sandwiches that night and give them away as presents to everyone who'll be here." 
Her voice grew tremulous. "We're just lost, a lot of people here," she added. "And this is a way for us to feel connected to New York."

HEADLINE: SHADOWS ACROSS THE CITY; 
Many Buildings Stood Fast on Shaky Ground

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
THEY mobilized the afternoon of Sept. 11, a team of engineers that now totals more than 200, dispatched across Lower Manhattan to quickly, but responsibly, evaluate the structural soundness of more than 400 buildings near what is known as ground zero.
 The results so far: despite the destruction at the World Trade Center, most surrounding buildings had relatively limited permanent damage, the engineers said. 
 Thousands of windows were blown out, with soot filling offices and apartments. Falling beams and other debris hit a few buildings near the complex, including 140 West Street, 30 West Broadway and 3 World Financial Center. 
But the towers' collapse apparently did not cause enough ground vibration to knock buildings off their foundations or cause walls to move in a permanent or dangerous way, the engineers said. So far, none of the buildings outside the trade center complex have to be demolished, they said.
The New York Times obtained a copy of the city's results; the tally is preliminary and does not include all buildings that have been checked.
Buildings with limited structural damage could be closed for up to a year, although any estimate is difficult. Those that merely need cleaning and new windows could be closed for several months or up to a year. Others with little or no damage could open sooner. 
Much of this will depend on how long the trade center cleanup takes, and how that will affect access to other buildings. Engineers involved in the inspections expressed relief that the damage to other buildings was not as severe as it might have been. "This will enable a much faster schedule for the rebuilding and revitalization of the downtown area," said Richard Tomasetti, president of LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, the lead engineering consultant, which is working with the Structural Engineers Association of New York on assessing the buildings.

HEADLINE: High Society Goes Low Key: A Hard Time for Galas 

BYLINE:  By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
SEPTEMBER is traditionally the month when New York's young swans, stalwart matrons and showiest donors dust off their ball gowns and begin to formulate strategy, focusing on concerns no more pressing than what to wear when vamping for the cameras, how best to burnish their social profiles and, in some cases, how to meet Mr. Right.
 But since the attack on the World Trade Center, New York's gilded set has reassessed those priorities or, for a time, has stowed them away. Some plan to stay home. Others who say they will attend the galas that stretch through December and then resume next spring are approaching them with unaccustomed gravity. 
 "I think coming out of this disaster first of all is a serious sense of charity," said Paul Wilmot, a New York fashion and society publicist. "Instead of 'Oh, I've got to go to this dinner at the Pierre -- so-and-so, my friend, is chair,' " he said with mock exasperation, "I think you'll find people will be much more dedicated, will stop looking at these things with such a jaundiced eye." 
And even for those still intent on doing well by doing good, Mr. Wilmot predicted, "recent events will take away some of the fluff that surrounds these charitable evenings."
"This is not the time for cynics," he said. 
Already, traditional events have been hard hit. Of more than a dozen planned before the disaster, at least six have been canceled or postponed. Those that vanished include a benefit for the Museum of Modern Art, a Ronald McDonald House dinner planned for October and a cocktail party given by Louis Vuitton and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center as a curtain-raiser for the center's annual gala next May. "We had to make decisions," said Muffie Potter Aston, a planner of the party. "At the time, it seemed highly inappropriate to go forward with this kind of event."
For the engineers of Manhattan's premier galas, the customary obsessing over timing, menus, guest lists and decor has yielded to the more sober issue of whether many scheduled benefits can, or should, take place at all.
"The legs of the social season are a little wobbly," conceded Guy Regal, an antiques dealer who held a reception in his East 60th Street store Thursday night to honor the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House's shelter for homeless women.
The cocktail party, which heralds a benefit tour of Lower Manhattan homes to take place on Oct. 3, raised about $30,000 in pledges. "But it was hard to look ahead," Mr. Regal said, "too early to determine the future of an event that is not directly related to aiding fire, police and rescue workers and the victims' families."
Directly related events have been added in haste to the season's schedule, among them a Merchants New York East Side benefit for the United Way's Sept. 11 fund last Tuesday, and a cocktail benefit for relatives of lost Cantor-Fitzgerald employees and of firefighters last Thursday.
In addition, four major networks capitalized on their large audience last Friday by broadcasting "TV Helpline," a telethon celebrity benefit.
Since New York has always abhorred a vacuum -- especially the sort left by a string of cancellations -- the party will have to go on.
"In New York, the benefit world fills a particular need," said Simone Martel, an event planner. "Benefits to us in the 90's and the new millennium have replaced the Stork Clubs or El Moroccos of the 50's and the discos of the 80's. Benefits are the occasion when different communities interface," she said. "Otherwise New York is a really splintered place."
Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, added, "People are not feeling like a big-time extravaganza, but they will go out." She is an organizer of one of the city's most lustrous events, the New Yorkers for Children gala, at Cipriani 42nd Street, to benefit the city's foster children, which was held Wednesday night.
"Parties will be more low-key," she predicted. "They will be very straightforward, appropriate for the time -- less about the social connotations and more about the charity." 
As Debbie Bancroft, a New York society figure, put it, "I wouldn't be surprised if we started going to quieter, more meaningful events." Ms. Bancroft, a board member of New Yorkers for Children, added, "In times like these, a sense of community is very important and people need support more than ever."
Stacey Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, said she had noticed signs that people were thinking beyond their own immediate concerns.
"I think people are starting to ponder their own mortality and what kind of legacy they are going to leave," she said.
Many events still on the schedule in the coming weeks will be scaled down, with dancing, fancy dress and elaborate decor ruled out, and funds diverted to relief-related causes.
Old Guard institutions like the Metropolitan Opera have set the tone. The opera, whose official grand opening tomorrow night usually includes a seated dinner, canceled the meal. It also staged a dress rehearsal to benefit the families of victims, rescue and relief workers. The event was sold out. 
Still, planners coping with practical details found uncertainty epidemic last week. Carnegie Hall, which will hold its benefit dinner on Oct. 3, decided to donate a part of the proceeds to disaster relief.
Similarly, Tim Landi, vice president for external affairs of the New York Botanical Garden, said he and fellow planners had been doubtful about proceeding with an event planned for Tuesday.
"We wrestled for a time about whether to cancel our annual Rose Garden Dinner Dance," he said, "but decided to go on." The botanical garden will contribute all visitors' fees next weekend to a variety of disaster relief funds.
And the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals likewise decided to move forward, holding its charity gala last Thursday night at Doubles, a private club in the Sherry Netherlands Hotel. Part of the proceeds, originally designated for indigent pet owners, went instead to the A.S.P.C.A.'s newly formed Animal Disaster Relief Fund, for the rescue of pets abandoned in the crisis.
When the season's most feverishly anticipated evening, the New Yorkers for Children gala, for 720, went ahead on Wednesday night, it got a jolt of adrenaline when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appeared, to wild cheers and applause. The gross, about $800,000, went as planned to the city's programs for foster children.
Many guests found the evening overwhelmingly moving. "I thought there was an extraordinary atmosphere," said Oscar de la Renta, who organized the event with Ms. Wintour, Shelby Bryan and the actress Sarah Jessica Parker.
"When at the close we all sang 'God Bless America,' I could see tears in the eyes of a lot of people," Mr. de la Renta said. "For one time, it really didn't matter what people were wearing."
But Patrick McCarthy, chairman and editorial director of W, found the mood subdued. "There isn't the roar that customarily greets you on these evenings," Mr. McCarthy said, predicting that the muted atmosphere -- hushed conversations, monochromatic lighting, pristine white-on-white decor -- would be echoed at future galas. "There is no other tone," Mr. McCarthy said. "It's nice to get back to a bit of normalcy, but I do feel we will approach these events with some kind of temperance."
The soberness at the New Yorkers for Children gala also reflected widespread concern about whether the generosity would last, particularly for causes not directly related to the disaster. The consensus was that it was too soon to tell. 
"Nobody is asking for money right now -- at least none of my clients," said Toni Goodale, a society figure and chairwoman of Goodale Associates, which consults and raises money for clients that include Beth Israel Hospital, the International Center of Photography and Temple Emanu-El.
"In the short term, people have been very generous," said Dr. Larry M. Hawk, the president of the A.S.P.C.A., who attended his group's gala on Thursday night despite the death of his sister, Kathleen Nicosia, aboard American Airlines Flight 11, which crashed into the north tower.
Dr. Hawk acknowledged that for many charities it would not be business as usual. "There is a great concern about the effect on the economy -- the effect that this disaster will have on all nonprofits across the board," he said.
He told the guests at the dinner: "We're all being impacted by this tragedy. I'm flying tomorrow, unfortunately, to my sister's memorial service. I will not let it interrupt my life. I hope you will do the same." 
Yet interruption is inevitable. "There is a feeling that it's inappropriate to be asking people for things that are not related to the relief effort -- college alumni funds, hospitals, the lot," Stacey Palmer of the Chronicle of Philanthropy said. "We're getting calls asking: 'What should we do? What are other people doing?' Charities are in a hard place."
Allison Stern, organizer of a springtime benefit for the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the Bronx Zoo, acknowledged that she had reached an impasse. "Some of the calls I put out, I made before the disaster," she said. "I think a lot of people will support our event, but right now the committee is at a standstill."
Yet few charities have the luxury of abandoning their efforts. "A lot of the smaller organizations derive 85 percent of their revenues from these benefits," Ms. Goodale said. "If you stop the galas, you stop operations for the whole year."
But she did acknowledge how daunting it could be to try to carry on. "I don't want to call people back just yet -- not for at least a couple of weeks. People are still grieving," she said with a sigh. "I just can't make these calls anymore."

Corporate Planes: Perks or Necessities?

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: WATERFORD, Mich. 

 BODY:
THE TRANSATLANTIC STAR, a 70-seat Airbus jet, is a conspicuous symbol of the 1998 merger that formed DaimlerChrysler, shuttling managers twice a week between the company's offices near here and Stuttgart, Germany.
 If there was any complaining about the expense of the plane and its pampered passengers, however, it is not heard now. The Star, which DaimlerChrysler parks at an airport in this suburb northwest of Detroit, has vindicated itself as a valuable corporate tool. 
 The hijackings by suicide terrorists on Sept. 11 paralyzed much of the commercial airline industry. But they also injected a huge dose of adrenaline into the already energized world of business aviation -- the fleets of private jets that corporate executives have been using increasingly in recent years. In the aftermath of the attacks, many corporations are expected to rely even more heavily on private planes -- through leases, purchases and fractional ownership deals that work like vacation time shares. 
"The issue of a heightened sense of security and safety certainly makes this mode of transportation more attractive to many people," said Jim Holcombe, senior vice president for marketing at the Gulfstream Corporation, a leading manufacturer of corporate jets that is based in Savannah, Ga.
William Curtis, chief executive of CurtCo Robb Media of Acton, Mass., publisher of The Robb Report, a monthly magazine about luxury products and services, said, "Companies are going to decide this is the time to have a jet."
More than 9,317 companies already own at least one jet, a 40 percent increase in the last 10 years, said the National Business Aviation Association, a trade group based in Washington. The number of planes used for business aviation has increased by two-thirds in that period, to 14,079.
Until Sept. 11, companies most often cited convenience as a reason for buying jets. "It's become a necessary business tool to be able to do business in a fast-paced economy," Mr. Holcombe said. 
Commercial air travel certainly costs less -- and may soon be even cheaper as airlines, desperate for customers, slash fares. But Mr. Holcombe and other representatives of private jet travel contend that price should not be a consideration. With a private jet, Mr. Holcombe said, "you can go when you want to go, and leave when you want to leave."
DaimlerChrysler's three planes -- it has two Gulfstream V jets in addition to the Airbus -- sit in a hangar 15 minutes from its operations in Auburn Hills, Mich. It takes 45 minutes to drive to Detroit Metropolitan Airport, the area's main airport.
Corporate jets are often regarded as perks of top executives, but 86 percent of the users are senior and middle managers, the business aviation association said. These jets can save many wasted hours that managers spend in airports, waiting for delayed flights, because the jets also are convenient places for meetings and allow officials to focus on work, said Jack Olcott, the association's president. "A business airplane is an office that moves," he said.
Moreover, it is an office that provides a level of passenger security that commercial airlines may not be able to match. "It is one of the safest forms of travel in the world," Mr. Olcott said. "You know who your pilot is, what's on board the aircraft, who's on board the aircraft." Often, security and customs officials at airports know pilots and passengers of private jets by name, because the same people fly so often.
That does not mean corporate jets are exempt from government scrutiny. Like commercial jets, private planes were grounded for two days after the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. As of last week, a ban on private planes within 25 miles of the capital remained in force. If anything, security officials are taking extra precautions with executive jets.
Last week, passengers on DaimlerChrysler's Airbus jet waited two and a half hours in Stuttgart as police and border guards searched their plane, accompanied by bomb-sniffing dogs. Each piece of hand baggage was searched, said Michael Aberlich, a company spokesman. He said it was the first time he could recall such tight security at the company's private terminal.
For companies that do not want to buy planes outright, an increasingly popular option is fractional ownership of jet aircraft. The plans are somewhat like vacation time shares. They offer companies a share of a plane and provide pilots and crews.
The idea was conceived in 1986 by Executive Jet Inc., based in Woodbridge, N.J., and owned by Warren Buffett, the multibillionaire chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. The concept was slow to catch on; only three customers signed up initially. But the robust economy of the mid-1990's, coupled with a boom in travel, led to a vast expansion. In 2000, there were 3,694 fractional owners of business aircraft, according to the business aircraft association.
Executive Jet's fractional-ownership clients range from celebrities like Tiger Woods to businesses like General Electric, Seagram, Texaco and Dow Chemical. 
Some companies that would like to have their own jets are resorting to fractional ownership because of the long wait to buy planes. Someone placing an order today for a Gulfstream V, which costs $42.5 million, might wait 12 to 15 months for delivery, Mr. Holcombe said. Even before Sept. 11, he said, Gulfstream had seen a surge in interest from people and companies for jets. 
Bombardier, the aircraft maker based in Montreal, has a three- to three-and-a-half-year waiting list for its new flagship plane, the $42 million Global Express, which can fly 14 hours nonstop, said Leo Knappen, a company spokesman.
In contrast, a fractional-ownership contract can be completed in days or weeks, depending on how many hours a company needs each year, and the planes it wants.
The least expensive contract at Executive Jet, which offers 12 types of planes, starts at $375,000 a year. That buys one-sixteenth of a Citation V, which seats eight people, and 50 hours of actual flying time, not the time spent waiting on the ground before or after the flight. Fifty hours would be the equivalent of 25 round trips for eight people between Boston and Washington. Besides that expense, companies pay a monthly management fee of $5,000, which covers insurance, the cost of pilot training and flight crews' salaries. Then there is a $1,325-an-hour occupation fee for using the plane, which, at 50 hours a year, comes out to just over $66,000 a year. The total annual cost for such a contract would be about $500,000.
Despite the price, Executive Jet has been signing up six to eight new customers a month and plans to expand its fleet of jets to about 1,000 by 2005, from 380 now, said Kevin Mitchell, senior vice president for marketing. Most customers sign up for 100 to 200 hours a year, drawing from a roster of 1,800 pilots that includes 10 past crewmen on Air Force One.
Others are competing for the same business, including FlexJet, a six-year-old company started by Bombardier, which has a fleet of 100 planes that will soon include the Global Express; and Raytheon, which has a fleet of about 100 aircraft. Despite a financial crisis caused in part by the downing of two of its jets in the terrorist hijackings, the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, is adhering to plans, announced in June, to enter business aviation in 2002, with a subsidiary called United BizJet Holdings.
United BizJet will take delivery of the first of 200 planes next April, said Steven R. Fushelberger, its vice president for marketing. Some industry analysts are concerned that United BizJet will take away business from United Airlines, particularly in first and business class, areas where airlines still make money. "What I would want to hear from them is that they are going to treat the passenger who pays $5,000 differently than the person who pays $500," said Mr. Curtis, the Robb Report publisher.
OTHERS say the trend toward business aviation will subside as stricter security precautions at airports become routine and as passengers regain confidence in commercial airlines. Incentives like extra frequent-flier miles and airport club membership deals are likely to be offered to affluent travelers. "The airlines will try to keep these people," said Raymond Neidl, aviation analyst at the ABN Amro investment bank.
But, given the growth in business aviation, Mr. Fushelberger said, there are opportunities for his company, and others, to attract newcomers. "A lot of the low-hanging fruit has been picked, but look at the entrepreneurs, look at the executives and look at the travel they do," he said.

HEADLINE: SHADOWS ACROSS THE CITY; 
Nine Miles Away

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ; Additional reporting was provided by Seth Kugel, along with Denny Lee, Tara Bahrampour and Jim O'Grady.

 BODY:
NINE miles lie between the World Trade Center and Highbridge, a Bronx neighborhood of 34,000 just north of Yankee Stadium. The streets here are a jumble of bright sunflowers, broken glass, six-story brick apartment buildings, neat row houses and sagging porches. An occasional rooster pecks at the sidewalks, most of which are cracked with weeds.
 By other measures, Highbridge seems more distant from the city's financial core. Although once a solidly middle-class neighborhood, Highbridge has a median family income of $20,700, compared with $48,200 citywide. The unemployment rate is nearly three times the city average. Nearly 40 percent of families in Highbridge are headed by single mothers. The neighborhood, once mostly Jewish and Irish Catholic, is largely Dominican and Puerto Rican. Most other residents are black. 
 News of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center struck some Highbridge residents like news of another country. They could see smoke pluming in the sky, but the intimacy of the tragedy reached them by television. Others in the neighborhood witnessed the sick, hard rain of terror firsthand. Still others have yet to come home. 
But the story of how the attack on the twin towers rolled through this stretch of New York begins the same way it began at ground zero: with the clear blue of an average late-summer morning.
Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001, started with the usual pilgrimages.
At 7:15 Al Smith looked out the window of his third-floor apartment on Anderson Avenue and called out to Gilbert Ruiz, who was on his way to work in the kitchen of Windows on the World. 
"Have a good one, man," Mr. Smith shouted as he waved goodbye.
At 8, Abdoulaye Kone, a pastry chef at Windows on the World, called his wife, Celestine, from work. Mr. Kone, who is from the Ivory Coast, told her he loved her and asked her to call him later to let him know how the children were doing.
At 8:30, the students at the Family Life Academy Charter School in the Latino Pastoral Action Center gathered for their morning assembly.
Then, at 8:48, the day abruptly changed.
A custodian from the Pastoral Action Center who had stayed home from work called in to report that a plane had crashed into the trade center. Isabel Gutierrez, director of the school, was in the assembly when her secretary told her the news. 
"I didn't say anything," Ms. Gutierrez said a few days later. "I did not want to alarm the teachers because they were dealing with the kids."
Dana Gerendasi, 26, a new teacher at the school, led her first graders back to their classroom. When she checked her cellphone messages just after 9:30, she heard her husband say: "Dana, it's me. I don't know if you heard, but two planes went into the World Trade Center, and ----" Then he was cut off.
After Mrs. Kone, the pastry chef's wife, took her son and daughter to school, she came home and turned on the television set. She saw an airplane crash into the building where her husband worked. "I immediately got on the train and I walked from 14th Street there," she said.

The Same Conversation, All Over the Neighborhood
By midmorning, Highbridge was strangely still. Delivery trucks did not bang down the pitted streets. The skies were silent. The salsa music that typically spills from windows could be heard only occasionally.
People pooled on street corners. One vast, dispersed conversation settled over the neighborhood. The words seemed familiar -- airplanes and television, God and war -- but the situation did not.
In this strangely focused public discussion, some turned to private metaphor.
"All I could think about was my video game, because that's the way I'd play it," said Glenn Wilson, 23, a construction worker who spent the morning with friends in front of the A&N Deli and Grocery on Ogden Avenue, listening for news. "I know strategic warfare. The Pentagon? That's the defense right there. The twin towers? You take out the money, how you going to build up? The next is transportation."
Police officers told business owners around 170th Street and Jerome Avenue to close up and go home. Jack An stayed because his liquor store is encased by bulletproof glass.
Members of a construction crew working at the Pastoral Action Center listened to the news in Spanish on their radios. The only television in the building was tuned to Univision, the Spanish channel. But Ms. Gerendasi, the first-grade teacher, does not speak Spanish. Her cellphone was not working.
"I couldn't even teach because I had to go out and keep crying," she said. She tried to stay calm. She told her charges: "Everything is fine. Your parents will explain everything to you."
News trickled into the school as parents picked up their children. Ms. Gerendasi heard that the United States Supreme Court had been bombed. The Pentagon was gone. Camp David had been bombed. The White House and the Empire State Building were next. The reservoirs were poisoned.
She hugged the children. She hugged the parents. She said she hoped to see them again. Then she went home to her husband.
The flow of people going home to Highbridge quickened in the late afternoon. Lucy Garcia, 50, an assistant manager of sales at J. P. Morgan Chase, arrived about 4, after a seven-hour walk. When the first plane hit, she had run out of her office at 5 World Trade Center and looked up at the sky.
"I saw this man falling," she said, her voice breaking. "It was so sad because as you see him falling from the window you see these little faces looking out the window. I was going: 'God have mercy on him. Jesus, please help that man.' He's like a little rag doll just falling out the window."
Ms. Garcia ran to a nearby post office to call her family. The phones didn't work. She took refuge in St. Peter's, a Roman Catholic church on Barclay Street.
"People were bleeding in church," she said. "St. Peter's was full." She and some co-workers bought sandals in Chinatown for the long walk north.
All day long, information flowed through Highbridge, an anxious breeze of truth and rumor: It was a goof. The pilot had a heart attack. My cousin didn't go to work. My father did. Two Arabs got stabbed. My baby came home. The roads were rivers of people. I walked and I walked and I walked. This is World War III.
Dark men came home white with ash. 
"I was white," said David Morales, who was delivering flowers on Church Street in Lower Manhattan when the first tower fell. "If I had had an Afro, I would have looked like Michael Jackson."
The Bronx suddenly seemed safer than Manhattan. Some people were afraid to leave. 
"I don't feel the Bronx is going to be hit, because the Bronx is full of poor people," said Sandra Joyner, who was shooting pool at the Equator Lounge on 170th Street.
Money didn't seem to matter anymore. But for some, race did.
"What about the Palestinians or the Koreans?" said a man who gave his name only as Leonard. "What about the Arabs? Since they're ready to die, what makes us think they aren't ready to blow up their own stores?"
Khalid Ahmad, 50, who works at the A&N Deli, had come to the United States from Yemen 30 years ago. Tuesday evening, a group of young men including Edison Alcantar walked into the deli and demanded of Mr. Ahmad, "You happy about what happened today?"
"I really went in there because they're Arabic," Mr. Alcantar said later. "To see what was on their mind. If they had been happy, I would have snuffed them."
Mr. Ahmad replied: "I told them you better watch your language because I'm an American. What am I going to be happy for?"
"Everybody comes from outside," he added, "and in America they live like a king. They come naked, and they make a living. America is the best country in the world. God bless America."
The day ended with a thick yellow sunset. The southern sky was scarred with smoke. Mr. Kone, the pastry chef, did not come home. Mr. Ruiz, who also worked at Windows on the World, did not stop by the San Miguel Superette to gather things for dinner, as was his custom. At 8:30, his son, Gilbert Ruiz Jr., taped a note to his father's door: "Pops. I was here to see you. I was worrying about you at the job. Call me. I hope you're all right. Your son. Love you, G. Ruiz Jr."
At 170th Street and Jerome Avenue, 50 people gathered in the darkness to pray.
"In the midst of this turbulence, this chaos, there is hope," said the Rev. Evenecer Martinez. "Governments offer their own hope, but our hope is in Christ. Let's make another cry for those who are suffering. New York is in mourning."
They pressed their palms to the sky and said: Come, Jesus! We are walking in the end of times.

The Aftershock Curls Its Way Through
Tomorrow came. Absence curled its way slowly through the neighborhood. Nearly everyone knew someone who had been touched, but often the connections were once or twice removed. It turned out that neighbors, cousins of friends, in-laws and acquaintances were missing. A woman from Sacred Heart Church on Shakespeare Avenue had not shown up for Mass, but no one knew her last name or her phone number.
For a few, absence cut closer. On Wednesday, Mrs. Kone and Gilbert Ruiz Jr. followed what would become a well-worn path: St. Vincent's, Bellevue, N.Y.U. Beth Israel, the Armory. They found nothing.
In the Jerome Avenue subway station, where the No. 4 train stops, rush hour was unrushed. People scratched their heads before a white board dense with service changes. They asked how to get to St. Vincent's and how to get to Brooklyn. At 8:45 a.m., the token booth clerk, Vanessa Halsey, had sold only $500 worth of fares. On a typical day, she would have sold $1,000 to $1,500.
Virginia Unisex beauty salon on Ogden Avenue was filled with talk of the tragedy.
Virginia Molina, who runs the shop, had spoken with her mother in the Dominican Republic. "My mother said she no longer wants to come here," she said. "They don't have this kind of problem in the Dominican Republic."
But Ms. Molina would not consider moving. "We are here in this country, which has supported us when we have most needed it," she said. "We are not going to run away."
Business was down 40 percent at the B&N Deli, 30 percent at Mr. An's liquor store on Jerome Avenue. But One Hour Photo Express, a few doors down, was doing well. Images of ash, twisted metal and rubble rolled through the processing machine. Pem Tenzin and his brother, Yashi Pelden, the owners, from Bhutan, said they had developed 50 percent more film than usual.
Newspapers sold out. A local funeral parlor went on standby.
On Thursday, the paralysis began to lift. Normal life had become an act of patriotism. People tried to work. Ms. Halsey, the token booth clerk, became hoarse explaining the changes in service. MetroCard sales were still down by 30 percent.
Schools reopened. En route to the Family Life Academy aboard the No. 2 train, Ms. Gerendasi sat near four Arabs. Everyone was staring at them. Then one of their cellphones rang. "Everybody screamed," she said. "I screamed because everyone else screamed."
Her first graders spent an hour talking about the tragedy. "I'm trying to teach them that it's O.K. to feel sad," she said.
She asked them what they wanted to be when they grew up. They answered: Firefighter. Policeman. Doctor. Hero.
The children drew pictures. Karina drew a tall building with an airplane crashing into it. Six faceless figures floated around the building. "Those are the people who died," she said. She also drew glittering red hearts. When asked why, she replied, "For God's love."
The firehouse of Battalion 17 on Ogden Avenue was draped with black and purple bunting. American flags blossomed. Olga Rodriguez bought one for her Delicioso Coco Helado cart. Bolivar Peguero hung one on his hot-dog and pastelito stand.
"Before this happened, I would have been surprised to see an American flag," said Denae Brewer, editor in chief of The Highbridge Horizon, a bilingual newspaper. "The Puerto Rican flags fly high. The Dominican flags fly high. But not American flags."
At 12:48 p.m. Thursday, El Cheapo Depot on Jerome Avenue sold its last American flag for $1.99.
"We are not the epitome of patriotism," said the Rev. Raymond Rivera, president of the Pastoral Action Center. "We're always talking about the government and how they lack resources for people of color, so usually I'm on the other side. But there was something about this week that made you think twice about that and really appreciate in this unprovoked attack some of the freedoms that we have."
Across the street from El Cheapo Depot, Mildred Smith, who worked in the financial district as an administrative assistant for Verizon, sat drinking a Bacardi and Coke in the Equator Lounge. She had seen people jumping out of the windows holding hands. "It was like rain," she said. She had seen the second plane hit. "It looked like a big black bird, she said. "It looked like death."
"It's something that happened," she said. "I had nothing to do with it, so I can't dwell on it in my mind. People I know got out."
Thursday night, Sacred Heart Church held a vigil for those who didn't get out. Mrs. Kone, who lives just down the street, happened to be walking by when she saw people gathering in the courtyard. Relieved to find she was not alone in her grief, she joined them for the Rosary. "I thought I was the only one on the block," she said.
Friday afternoon, Gilbert Ruiz Jr. went to the apartment building on West 165th Street, where his father had lived for more than a decade, to collect photographs and DNA samples. But Wallace Cooke, the landlord, would not let him in. "He could have been anybody with an ID, like those guys that got on the plane," the landlord said. "I could get sued for millions of dollars. I want my sons to own this building."
At 8 p.m., Mr. Ruiz was still standing on the street, talking to neighbors. A woman said that when her father died, she got into his apartment without incident. But Mr. Ruiz's father was not dead. He was just gone. "I'm next in line," said the son. "I'm junior. I'm supposed to lead the family now. I can't even do that."
One of his sisters had been beaten to death at the end of August. He was shaking.
"The world's in trouble right now," he said. The neighbors began to cry.

'Faith Is the Substance Of Things Hoped For'
The weekend came. Men called on God. 
"The world loves us with a cold kind of love," the Rev. Billy Jackson said on Sunday at the Second Southern Baptist Church on Jesup Avenue. "Loves us with unkindness. Loves us with not a gentle love but a love that's horrible. It is not a love from heaven."
Amad Igbara, a Palestinian who came to America 10 years ago and who, with his brothers, owns five stores in Highbridge, said: "Now everybody thinks all the Palestinians are terrorists. That's not good for us in the United States." He said he planned to take his wife and three children out to dinner last Sunday. It would be their first trip out of the house since the attack. "If anything happens," he said, "that's from God."
The routines of daily life reasserted themselves, sometimes from instinct, sometimes from despair.
"I understand life must go on, but the day it happened people were coming in to look for money to pay their rent," said Ms. Brewer, the editor of the local paper, which shares an office with the Highbridge Community Life Center. "It disappointed me."
Mrs. Kone swept leaves and garbage from the gutter in front of her apartment. Her husband stared out from "Missing" posters in her windows and at bus stops and storefronts. He did not come home.
A police office and a locksmith let Mr. Ruiz into his father's apartment. He left with his father's comb, hairbrush, toothbrush and toenail clippings.
Talk in Virginia Unisex beauty parlor shifted to lost jobs, Middle Eastern politics and sleeplessness. Local businesses like Mr. An's liquor store continued to suffer. 
"I don't know if I can pay rent this month," Mr. An said. "Usually by this time I'm very busy, but see what I'm doing here? Reading books."
Your's and Our's Cocktail Lounge had a wedding reception. The bride and groom walked over rose petals. People cheered. Flashbulbs popped. The bride's mother called for a moment of silence for the victims. The owner of the bar had lost his sister-in-law on the 84th floor of Tower 2. He sat quietly beneath the balloons.
Early last week, Mr. Ruiz's body was identified. He was buried on Thursday at St. Raymond's cemetery in the East Bronx.
Mr. Kone is still missing. None of his co-workers on the morning shift have come home.
"We believe he is alive because God makes miracles," said Mrs. Kone, whose husband was Muslim. "God's going to bring him out one way or another."
Other people waited too. They waited for war. They waited for peace. They waited for absence to ripen into death. They waited for the damage to be undone.
But the southern sky stayed empty. The smoke was gone. Nothing took its place.
In church, a pastor clutched his Bible. "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for," he read. "The evidence of things not seen."

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
A Forecaster's Art Takes a Sharp Turn

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
LOUIS CRANDALL is slow to change his mind.
 It wasn't until he was inching his way down the stairs from the 25th floor of 1 World Trade Center that he decided: "Gosh darn it, I was not going to take the Delta Shuttle to Washington this afternoon. I was taking Amtrak." 
 When he got to the sixth floor, where the sprinklers were working, he said, "My socks got wet and I actually began to realize that I wasn't even taking Amtrak."
Mr. Crandall, who turned 43 the day after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, is president and chief economist at Wrightson Associates. It is a six-member research firm that casts a respected eye on Federal Reserve policy and the Treasury market, makes economic forecasts and plays regularly in the game of predicting what economic reports will say. 
All his employees survived, but the destruction of his offices and many of the computer tools he used is making him change his mind about how he runs his business. The same is true for hundreds of other executives and companies.
Wrightson is coping with its own crisis by working to get the business back up. But Mr. Crandall sees a difficult time ahead for forecasters and, therefore, investors -- and not just because the immediate outlook is grim.
The attack on the world's financial capital, he said, has pushed the economy into unpredictable territory, rendering it nearly impossible to make intelligent use of the economic data for September and October and, maybe, even later in the year.
So even if he were publishing now, his stodgy computer-driven spreadsheets and 20 years of annotated notes on Federal Reserve policy meetings (all of which were lost) would be of little help and his routine of predicting economic indicators would be upset.
Speaking of forecasters, he said, "We have less value because we don't know what the numbers ought to say right now."
He added, "In this extraordinary emotional state, you can't draw many conclusions about what this particular number means about the broader economy and about trends going forward."
The uncertainty will make stock and bond markets more volatile and hazarding reasonable guesses about the future very difficult. Even how the financial markets would respond to an attack on the terrorists who did this is uncertain.
"The emotion of the tragedy will affect the numbers, but we don't know how," he said in an interview a week and a day after the tragedy. "Then that initial response will change, and so will the impact on the numbers."
Mr. Crandall has no choice but to change. His cherished routines and his old machines were all destroyed, and Wrightson, he said, can no longer be what it was: "a product that evolved very gradually for the last 23 years." 
It may not sound like much, but the loss of his antiquated spreadsheets and other forecasting tools will give Wrightson the opportunity to rebuild them in a much more useful form. He will review the format of his weekly newsletter and his daily online service. He will add real-time bond and money market prices to the Wrightson Web site.
"Even the extra congestion on New York City highways, making it harder for commuters in our firm to get in, is making us look at ways to build a virtual office," he said.
"This is getting a lot of people out of their ruts."
Such reassessments are being made around the country. "This does force a lot of people to think about how we are doing things, and once you do that, you think of things more than those related to the World Trade Center," said Richard F. Syron, chairman and chief executive of the Thermo Electron Corporation in Waltham, Mass. "You think of things you would not have thought of before," like smoothing out the company's shipment schedules.
IN the long run, these retoolings and refinements of businesses could help the economy by improving productivity and cutting costs. "Obviously, there are huge temporary short-term negatives and long-term negatives from this," Mr. Crandall said. "But in cold-blooded economic terms, this is one of the positives."
In the near term, the economic outlook is grim, which means third- and fourth-quarter corporate earnings will be down even more than expected two weeks ago.
"If we are lucky, were are back to a V" pattern for the economy, he said. The V pattern is based on the idea that the shock from the tragedy will send economic growth plunging as consumers stop spending and production is disrupted. But if those interruptions are temporary, the stage will be set for a sharp rebound, completing the second leg of the V, when the expected huge increases in government spending, and possibly more tax cuts, kick in.
Then the rally part of the V could give stocks a lift. As for interest rates, an end to the economic decline would probably send them higher, especially at the short end.
But Mr. Crandall said that if the consumer spending remained weak until the end of the year, there was less of a case for a V-shaped rebound, and "underlying attitudes may have been changed permanently."
Yet, he added, "I am no less optimistic than I was," even though he said he had learned that there was "more scope" for unpredictable events.
As of now, Mr. Crandall has no vehicle for distributing his views. He received new laptop computers on Friday and hopes to begin producing the weekly Money Market Observer sometime this week. While some people are working from home, Mr. Crandall and other of his colleagues are in a temporary office on Fifth Avenue, at 47th Street, at a company called Numerix, a partner with ICAP, the money and bond market broker that owns Wrightson. (ICAP was also in 1 World Trade Center and is now operating from temporary offices in Manhattan and New Jersey.) 
Because he doesn't think that he and other forecasters will be able to say much that is constructive about economic data for several months, Mr. Crandall will spend his time examining the outlook for the Treasury market as the government surplus shrinks and maybe disappears.
But he is still itching to print the next guess on what the unemployment rate will be in September and how many jobs will be lost.
"Who am I kidding?" he laughed, remembering that he said his analysis would not be worthwhile. "I have been forecasting the monthly unemployment rate for a couple of decades now. When I see the calendar getting to the end of the month, I cannot avoid looking at that."
The data will certainly not be as easy to interpret as what Mr. Crandall saw on the 12th floor of the World Trade Center, where he and many of the escaping workers stopped when they smelled diesel fumes in the stairwell and thought the way out might be blocked. "We got to a place where a TV was working, saw what the top of the building looked like and turned around and headed right back to the stairwell," he said.
When he left the tower, he went toward home. The Brooklyn Bridge was too crowded. He headed toward the Manhattan Bridge and made it home to Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, about two hours later. By then, the twin towers were gone.

New Offices, Mixed Emotions at Fund Companies

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON and ELIZABETH HARRIS

 BODY:
CHARLES ALBERS and Nikolaos Monoyios spent last week setting up the computer systems needed to manage their portfolios from makeshift quarters in central New Jersey, their temporary home after their offices at the headquarters of OppenheimerFunds were destroyed in the attack on the World Trade Center. 
 "Our space was vaporized," said Mr. Albers, who was on his way to work at the time of the attack. "I saw it fall before my eyes." 
 All 598 employees who worked there left safely. Now some 150 employees are working in the New Jersey office complex, the exact location of which the fund group requested not be disclosed.
While it was a difficult week for all mutual fund companies, it was excruciating for those that had been based at the World Trade Center. All companies had to restore operations after equity markets reopened on Monday after a four-day shutdown. Then fund managers had to navigate a treacherous market, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping more than 14 percent for the week.
But some firms that operated at the trade center are missing scores of people. Fred Alger Management counts 35 of 55 employees at the World Trade Center among the missing, including Fred M. Alger's brother, David, who was the firm's president and chief investment officer. The firm's mutual funds and investments totaling $16 billion are running again under the management of Fred Alger, the chairman and president, and Dan C. Chung, the new chief investment officer and portfolio manager.
Fiduciary Trust Company International, a subsidiary of Franklin Resources Inc., has also suffered, with four employees confirmed dead and 83 missing after the collapse of 2 World Trade Center, its headquarters. Fiduciary, which managed $43.9 billion as of the end of June for large institutions and wealthy individuals, is not saying how many investment professionals are among the missing at this point, according to Lisa Gallegos, a spokeswoman for Franklin. The investments are being run from a disaster recovery site in New Jersey; employees there, as well as in the firm's existing office in Short Hills, N.J., will move to permanent space in Rockefeller Center by the end of the year, she said.
FOR others, all employees are safe, but scattered and tramautized.
At OppenheimerFunds, a unit of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, which runs 65 mutual funds with $120 billion under management, all employees working at the firm's headquarters on five floors of 2 World Trade Center escaped. The entire group headed for the exits soon after a plane struck the neighboring north tower of 1 World Trade Center, said Andrew J. Mika, senior vice president for investment operations and administration, who descended 20 stories to the 12th floor when the second plane struck his building.
Now these employees face new concerns as they grapple with the violence of Sept. 11. To help them, the firm has enlisted professional crisis counselors and has provided rooms for reflection. Mr. Mika himself has sought advice on how to talk with his children, who now worry about his safety at work. 
Others, who have been moved to an undisclosed building in New Jersey, find it hard to go to work on its 22nd floor and were rattled by a fire alarm this week, said Craig P. Dinsell, an executive vice president of human resources. People need time to recover from trauma, he said: "This is a long and drawn out process."
Beyond the emotional toll are the practical concerns of finding offices. After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, OppenheimerFunds set up an emergency office in New Jersey for some portfolio managers and traders. The backup site provides everything from computers to trading systems. This week, 90 percent of the employees were directed there and to other sites -- a second one in New Jersey, as well as offices in suburban Westchester County and in Connecticut. 
The fund group expects to move into offices at 498 Seventh Avenue between West 36th and 37th streets in Manhattan beginning next month, according to James Lacey, a spokesman with Massachusetts Mutual. While most analysts and fund managers are in the New York area, the bulk of the group's employees work in Denver.
Scattered operations can strain communications, said Geoffrey H. Bobroff, a mutual fund consultant and the president of Bobroff Consulting of East Greenwich, R.I.
"For a handful or so firms, the reaction is going to be quite difficult," Mr. Bobroff said. 
Citigroup Asset Management was affected when 7 World Trade Center collapsed. The building housed 2,500 Citigroup employees, including the asset management group, which occupied 350,000 square feet of newly refurbished space.
Although the firm successfully evacuated everyone, it has had to scramble for new space around the region.
"It was a real sense of emptiness," Thomas W. Jones, the chief executive of Citigroup Asset Management, said of the loss. "You go into this wonderful area with a beautiful building and not even 12 hours later it was gone."
Mr. Jones credits a disaster relief site in Rutherford, N.J., with allowing the firm to resume investment management of more than $400 billion. Tools from technology to research will let the 400 to 500 people in the portfolio management teams continue at that site for the next six to nine months, the time that Mr. Jones expects will be needed to develop permanent quarters. The remaining employees are being shifted to Stamford, Conn., and other offices in Manhattan. The firm is posting counselors at each site.
EVEN as the firms have solved the nuts-and-bolts problems about space and technology, their portfolio managers and analysts who were returning to work last week faced new concerns wrought by the Sept. 11 chaos: an even more volatile market.
Mr. Albers, who has managed money for nearly three decades and helps oversee $16 billion in investors' money, has been in no hurry to make bold decisions for the Main Street funds that he and Mr. Monoyios run.
"Frankly, our investment philosophy at times like this is that you don't want to jump into frenetic activity," Mr. Monoyios said.
As the two began running computer models, they chose not to do much in the way of trading. Instead, Mr. Albers focused on broad trends in the market. "The economic environment is changing very fast, and our models are picking up on the new data," he said.
He is considering whether to shift some of the portfolio from defensive stocks like utilities and health care to technology, auto and retail stocks that could benefit from a rebound.
"It has been a little hard for me to focus and concentrate on investment issues," Mr. Albers acknowledged. But, come Monday, armed with the information from his computer models, he expects to start trading more actively.

Teenage Bulls See Profits in a Time of Anxiety

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
NIRAV PATEL'S friend pushed up to him through the crush of a high school activity fair on Thursday. His pal had only one thing to say to him.
 Airlines. 
 His friend, who is 17, was liquid, Nirav explained, having saved about $1,000 from his summer job. "He said, 'If I keep it in airline stocks for 10 years, I'll make a fortune,' " said Nirav, who is also 17 and is co-treasurer of the stock club at John P. Stevens High School in Edison, N.J. 
They are among the investors who almost literally cut their teeth on the world's longest bull market. For this generation of adolescents -- who still had training wheels on their bikes after their parents and teachers were pounded by the collapse of 1987 -- "recession" is a distant and somewhat theoretical condition.
These teenage investors, able to jump into the market because of the advent of online trading, where their ages need not be disclosed, did their research in cyberspace, rode the new-economy market of the 1990's to its top and kept the faith over the past year, when the market plummeted. High school investment clubs have remained popular, as students learn about the importance of earnings and other fundamentals. 
Still, Wall Street veterans always speculated that a real market panic would spook these teenage investors. Such untested optimists, the conventional wisdom went, would cut and run in a truly grizzly bear market. 
But even now, with the Dow and the Nasdaq shriveling and with the best economic minds forecasting recession, America's ultimate long-term investors are buying, if an unscientific sampling is any guide.
"The Vietnam generation is a little more cautious than we would be," explained Alexander Danielides, 16, a junior at the Bronx High School of Science who has been investing since he read "The Warren Buffett Way," the 1994 best seller, at age 9. "We have a fresher perspective. Instead of relying on what people used to think, we look and see what we think is important."
Let fainthearted 50-somethings race for the Treasury bill markets. Alexander has spent the past week creating a "top 10" list of equities that he thinks are poised to thrive in a time of public anxiety.
"With what just happened in the World Trade Center, right now, people need things like security systems," he said. "This is the time to buy them. Now. Ground transportation is going to become very important as people get over their fears of flight."
On Alexander's "buy" list, therefore, is Greyhound Lines, a subsidiary of Laidlaw. And because telecommunications played such a prominent role during the World Trade Center attack, he deems WorldCom a buy.
At the Branson School in Marin County, Calif., activities were just being organized for the new school year when the disaster struck in Manhattan and stock markets were shut down. The timing was propitious for Branson's stock club. Last year's members had cashed out their positions in Cisco Systems and Alcatel, and after the graduating seniors took their profits, the remainder of the money was left uninvested over the summer. While many clubs invest for the academic year, the young investors often have their own long-term portfolios.
"Right now, we're mostly in cash, which is a pretty positive stance," said Zachary Skolnick, a Branson School junior who has been trading since he was 14. "We're looking for buying opportunities."
Zachary, who is 17, also says cellular phone stocks have renewed promise. 
"Nokia seems to have gotten a positive boost out of the attacks," he said. But once the club has picked its meeting dates and pulled together its cash, Zachary said, he plans to advocate buying Wal-Mart Stores. 
"It's been talked about a lot how consumer spending is down, and how that could affect some retail stocks," he said. "But at the same time, I don't see any long-term trends in the negative direction. People are always going to be needing just the basic supplies that companies like Wal-Mart are going to cater to."
Some of the youngest investors are still picking stocks the way they did before the catastrophe: buying into companies with products they use and like. Denver Blackwell, an 11-year-old in Kansas City, Mo., who made his first trade at age 6, had just become sold on Linux products before the attack. He had a hunch that "people were just getting tired of Microsoft," he said, and he had tried Linux's operating system at a friend's house.
Now, Denver said, he is "in shock about what happened" and has lost money on Linux-related investments, but he has no intention of selling. Nor is he going to part with his Disney shares, even though some members of the fabled Bass family did just that last week. 
"I'm hoping that once this all goes over, it will ride back up, even higher," said Denver, who learned to trade by attending the Bull and Bear Investment Camp in Kansas City every summer for the last five years. Denver also plans to buy "something better in the next two weeks or so," he said.
"I think it might be a company like Nintendo," he said. "They're going to release a new product in December."
OTHER young traders are thinking not as consumers but as geopolitical strategists. In Edison, Nirav Patel is developing a midterm plan to buy stock in companies in stem-cell research. With virtually the entire United States population riveted on the terrorist attack and its aftermath, he figures, the recent commotion about stem-cell ethics will be forgotten and the field will take off, Nirav predicts.
"I think those stocks will be affected by that," he said.
While he waits for stem-cell research to develop, Nirav is trading in blue-chip companies whose stocks he believes were unjustly battered in the past week. 
"I'm still investing in Philip Morris, Johnson & Johnson, G.E., stocks that have gone down a little bit, so you can make the $5 or $6 on them," he said. "I don't think they should have dropped the way they did. It's a great buying time."
He has no illusions about quick returns -- young investors may have thought that way two years ago, he said, but not any more. 
Even the current talk of an imminent attack on Afghanistan, of possible reprisals and of a long, unpredictable war against shadowy international forces seems not to have fazed America's young bulls. Some are even taking encouragement from the very history lessons that give their elders chills.
"The way we've learned about it in school is that war brings money," said Steven Hopkins, 16, another Bull and Bear Investment Camp alumnus. "War is money. War brought us out of the Depression. I think it's all going to come back up again. People who are selling now are going to be sorry."

Continental's Blunt Leader Faces Crisis, Again

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER REINGOLD

 BODY:
AS the first hijacked airliner smashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, Gordon M. Bethune, the chief executive of Continental Airlines, was at home in Houston, getting dressed for a routine board meeting. Minutes after the attack, his chief operating officer, C. D. McLean, called him with the news. Mr. Bethune ran to the television, only to remember that a contractor working in the backyard had accidentally cut the cable the night before. Mr. Bethune sped to work, where he joined some board members already massed in front of a television in horror.
 A former aircraft mechanic for the Navy and a commercial passenger jet pilot, Mr. Bethune, 60, knew the crashes had to be terrorist acts. "There is no way a 767 could inadvertently run into the World Trade Center," he said later. As the meeting continued, he scrambled to confirm that no Continental airplanes had been involved and that three employees who worked at 5 World Trade Center were safe. 
 Continental and its workers were spared, but Mr. Bethune's relief was brief. By commandeering and crashing four commercial jets in one day, the terrorists had hijacked the business models of not only the companies that lost aircraft -- American, a unit of AMR, and United, a unit of UAL -- but also of Continental and every other airline in the United States. The outlook for much lower sales and significantly higher security costs looked certain to turn a cyclical slowdown into a catastrophe.
Mr. Bethune, a plain-spoken Texas native, has long been famous for saying what others are thinking. So many people were not surprised when, four days after the attacks, he was the first airline executive to speak out about the pressures on the industry. But they were shocked by what he said.
He announced that Continental, one of only two profitable major airlines this year (the other was Southwest), would lay off about 12,000 employees, more than one-fifth of its work force, and cut 20 percent of its flights. He warned that new security requirements, along with the two-day shutdown of air travel after the attacks, could bankrupt Continental and other big airlines unless the government stepped in with a major aid package. The shutdown cost his company $90 million and the overall industry an estimated $1 billion.
"We're not going to be the first ones" to reorganize, Mr. Bethune said, "but we may decide to go as early as October." Last Monday, he chose not to make $69.4 million in aircraft financing payments, raising fears of default and leading to a downgrade of Continental's debt. The stock has lost more than 60 percent of its value since Sept. 10, closing Friday at $14.66. Mr. Bethune said he would make the payment before the grace period was up.
In addition to using lobbyists and layoffs to pressure Congress, Continental tried to enlist its frequent fliers. In an e-mail message last Wednesday, the company encouraged members of its OnePass program to "immediately call or e-mail your Congressman and urge them to pass vital relief legislation for the airline industry." To drive home the point, the message added: "Time is running out."
"This is not a handout," Mr. Bethune said in an interview, adding that airlines were unique because the government grounded all flights after the attacks. "No other industry was denied access to the market," he said. Airlines are vital to the economy, he added, and to everyday life. "You won't have an economy that works without us," he said. "If you were coming down here to the cancer treatment center, you weren't coming. If you ordered anything from Amazon.com, you didn't get it. Nobody went to visit their grandmother."
Mr. Bethune's sudden moves were followed by those of other airline executives, who together have announced layoffs of 79,000 workers in the last two weeks and have created a united front to seek government help. Together, they quickly gained the attention they were seeking. While some critics were galled to see an industry best known for fighting government control suddenly holding out a tin cup, it quickly became clear that no airline was prepared for a disaster of this scope.
Michael J. Linenberg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, estimated that airlines in the United States would lose $6.5 billion this year, almost three times the loss he had forecast before the attacks. Next year, the industry will lose about $3.5 billion, he predicted, instead of posting the small profit he had estimated earlier. Continental said it had $900 million in cash on hand and was consuming $10 million a day since service resumed.
"There are no other sources of liquidity," said Robert L. Crandall, the former chief executive of American Airlines. "We have a problem."
FOR now, the tough talk seems to have worked. The House and Senate raced to approve as much as $15 billion in emergency aid, loans and loan guarantees for airlines. While that is much less than the $24 billion airlines had sought, it is likely to at least stop the hemorrhaging. "We have to give the financial institutions the signal that the government is standing shoulder to shoulder with the airlines," said Representative Tom DeLay, the Republican House whip whose district includes Continental's headquarters in Houston.
Not every politician showed support. Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, questioned the airlines' cry for help. "The airlines told us they were going broke long before these attacks occurred, while at the same time giving their executives $120 million in salaries and bonuses this year," he said in a statement.
With passengers afraid to fly -- on Wednesday, just 48 percent of Continental's seats were filled, near the industry average after the attacks -- Mr. Bethune and other airline executives have a long struggle ahead.
For Mr. Bethune, who led a turnaround at Continental over the last seven years, the sudden change of events was a crushing reminder of his first days at the airline. When he was named Continental's president and chief operating officer in February 1994, the company had just emerged from its second bankruptcy reorganization in 10 years. As he took the job of chief executive in November -- he was the 10th in as many years -- it became clear that the company would run out of cash within two months. At his first board meeting, he said the $750 million cash on hand was disappearing quickly, and he worried that he wouldn't have enough left to make a coming payroll. 
So, in a move that foreshadowed this week's events, Mr. Bethune went outside the company for help -- not to the government, but to Boeing, his previous employer. He persuaded Boeing to let it defer orders and to quickly wire back $29 million the airline had made in deposits. Continental survived its problems and turned a profit in 1995.
From that fast start, Mr. Bethune never looked back. He made a habit of silencing doubters, posting 25 consecutive quarters of profitability before Sept. 11. Continental earned $42 million in the second quarter this year.
"Gordon's done fine, but he started with a huge advantage," said Mr. Crandall, the former American Airlines chief. "He had lower costs than anyone else, because Continental had been through bankruptcy twice."
Bankruptcy, however, had created its own problems, including a resentment among employees whose union contracts were broken when the company reorganized its finances in the 1980's and early 1990's. But Mr. Bethune has managed to turn the airline into an enjoyable place to work by capitalizing on his outgoing, salty manner.
"He is a rare mixture of intelligence and profanity," said Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at George Washington University in Washington.
At the beginning of his tenure, Mr. Bethune began to offer employees cash bonuses when on-time arrivals ranked near the top of the industry. Other incentives would include new sport utility vehicles for some employees with perfect attendance, and family-friendly policies like discounted day care. Continental has been named one of Fortune magazine's "100 best companies to work for in America" the last three years.
A happy employee base led to satisfied passengers. In an industry rife with horrendous service, Continental has stood apart, winning first or second place in the J. D. Power & Associates customer service awards the last five years. The airline was first in on-time arrivals in 2000.
"He is a wonderful motivator of people," said Mr. Richard W. Pogue, a Continental director and a senior adviser with Dix & Eaton, a public relations firm in Cleveland. "Employees just really respect him and look up to him. I have dealt with many C.E.O.'s over my lifetime and he is one of the best I've ever seen."
Now, however, the scale of the proposed layoffs is threatening that tight-knit culture. Even with government help, Mr. Bethune is not likely to rehire those 12,000 employees anytime soon. And he faces the double challenge of motivating the employees who remain and making them feel safe when they know that they, too, could be targets of a terrorist attack.
Capt. Michael Hynes, a Continental pilot, said the uncertainty about knowing who would be laid off was hurting morale even more. "Everyone is really in a funk," he said.
"The only disappointment I've felt is that if the company was going to do this, couldn't they have done that homework in advance? I would have expected a little better than that."
To reassure employees, Mr. Bethune has been talking to them a lot, by phone to people who were stuck for several days in places like Halifax, Nova Scotia, or by expanding his regular companywide voice-mail messages. Although he usually records a voice mail weekly for the entire company, he has used daily messages to bring employees up to date on the latest information.
"I needed to give them reassurance that things were not coming to an end," he said. "I told them who I had talked to and the progress we had made so that all of us are aware of what we're trying to do. They like that. Adversity makes the trust more important."
On Tuesday, Mr. Bethune's voice mail talked about the day's meetings with Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta and others, but he added a personal note. "I know that it has been tough for the last solid week," he told Continental's workers. "We have had just a lot of issues facing us and I appreciate all of your patience and consideration and also the way you have been able to handle the stress of all these situations."
Beyond keeping his workers motivated, however, Mr. Bethune must figure out how to fill Continental's planes again, and he must do it without the assistance of Greg Brenneman, the company's dynamic former president and chief operating officer. Mr. Brenneman, 39, left abruptly in May to return to a consulting company he founded several years ago. He declined to comment. 
Despite Mr. Bethune's assurances that Continental will not be the first to declare bankruptcy, it has some problems that put it in more of a bind than rivals like Delta Air Lines or American. Because it leases most of its planes rather than owning them, the company cannot use those assets as collateral. "Continental couldn't possibly get such lines of credit," Mr. Crandall said. "It had zero net assets."
Mr. Bethune responded that being able to borrow against aircraft was no longer much of an advantage. "If nobody wants to buy diamonds, you can't borrow off of diamonds," he said.
Continental's limited options partly reflect its bankruptcy history. But Mr. Bethune is an aggressive manager, and some recent decisions may have also reduced the company's wiggle room. "They had had some bank facilities and repaid them as they raised debt in other forms," said Philip Baggaley, senior airline bond analyst at Standard & Poor's. "Then they chose not to pay the cost of having those unused bank lines there. Now I imagine they regret it."
Another controversial decision came in January, when Continental bought back a controlling stake in itself from Northwest Airlines. Northwest acquired the stake in 1998 as part of a marketing alliance, but when that alliance ran into antitrust problems, Continental decided it was time to get out. It paid $450 million for the shares, a 29 percent premium to the market price when the deal was struck in November 2000.
The company also paid a $10 million fee to David Bonderman, a board member and financier who had sold the shares to Northwest in the first place and had the first rights to buy them back. The fee gave Continental the first crack at buying back the shares. But while the deal meant that Northwest gave up some control, it still received special preferred stock that lets it veto a merger by any airline with revenue greater than $1 billion, raising questions about exactly what Continental had paid for.
MR. BETHUNE responded that he considers the deal a huge victory for Continental and its shareholders. "They needed the money," he said, referring to Northwest, "and we needed to get the independence so we could have some upside in our share price."
He said the agreement ended Northwest interference in Continental's daily operations while still protecting the alliance.
Continental's decision not to make the $69.4 million payment for aircraft financing did not do much to bolster confidence, either, although Mr. Bethune's assurance that the loans would be paid within a grace period makes it look a lot more like posturing than a signal of an imminent default. 
At a news conference on Wednesday, the airline's president, Lawrence W. Kellner, said that even with a bailout, Continental was likely to bring in just half the revenue it had expected in the fourth quarter. Even before the attacks, he added, the company had revised its growth rate for this year to 2 percent from 6 percent.
Every analyst has a different take on each airline's plight, in part because the instability of the situation makes it difficult to accurately estimate how fast companies are spending cash reserves. But analysts took Mr. Bethune's threat of bankruptcy seriously. With high fixed costs for airplanes, salaries and fuel, airlines can rack up losses quickly when demand drops, and passengers have been scarce ever since the attacks. Mr. Linenberg, the analyst at Merrill Lynch, estimated that Continental had enough cash to remain in business for 40 days without a bailout or any passengers at all, while United had enough for 47 days and Delta, 67 days.
Mr. Jenkins of the Aviation Institute said he considered Continental the most at risk of the major carriers. Before Congress voted on the bailout, he estimated that the airline had only 15 days of cash remaining.
Though Mr. Bethune wants Continental's plight to be taken seriously, he bristles when he hears such numbers. He said Mr. Jenkins was "a nice guy, but he's wrong as hell."
If Congress approves the aid package, it will almost certainly dwarf the last major corporate bailout, the 1979 Congressional act that guaranteed up to $1.5 billion in loans for Chrysler. But Mr. Bethune said that there should be no comparison. "We're not talking about a company," he said, "We're talking about an industry." He said he told government officials that if they did not act quickly, "you're going to lose a lot more than you ever would have spent."
It is a little odd for Mr. Bethune, who loves to rail against government interference, to be soliciting government aid. "It bothers me a lot," he said. "It's not my favorite thing to do, but at the same time this is a war."
Mr. Bethune said he hoped that air traffic would be back to normal by next summer, but he acknowledged that the experience of flying was not what it once was. On Mr. Bethune's flight from Baltimore to Houston on Tuesday, even the first-class passengers used plastic forks and drank wine out of screw-top bottles. "Every time someone would get up and go to the bathroom, everyone would look to see what he was doing," Mr. Bethune said.
That tension is likely to linger for a long time to come.

HEADLINE: Investors Seek a Refuge, and Experts Do, Too 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
THE stock market reopened to resounding cheers on Monday morning, but despite pleas from some Americans to rally around, the week ended on Friday was one of its worst since the Depression. All in all, three years of gains were wiped away, with the prices of most stocks closing at levels last seen in 1998, as investors of all stripes fled to bonds and other conservative investments.
 President Bush's address to Congress on Thursday night only reinforced Wall Street's most pressing concern, beyond human casualties -- when and how it will all end. 
 Many past crises brought sharp declines followed by recoveries in days or weeks, but the recent terror attacks seem to have marked the beginning of a war with an uncertain mission and duration and came to an economy teetering on the brink of recession.
For average Americans wondering how best to protect their savings, it may be small comfort to know that many experts are equally uncertain. Reliable predictions are as hard to find on Wall Street as a soaring stock. "Any effort to extrapolate the range of uncertainties, the economic implications, all of the common claptrap, will be profoundly different after we do something," said Michael H. Steinhardt, a famed hedge fund manager who retired six years ago from running money but is now chairman of the investment committee for New York University's endowment. 
"Once we do something, assuming it is successful, the psychology will truly change," he added. "Until that happens, the stock market doesn't have a chance in hell of going up."
Richard B. Hoey, the chief economist and investment strategist for the Dreyfus Corporation, asked and answered his own question: "Which economic forecast has this in it? There are no gurus."
Even Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and one of the most noted market bulls, was dubious about the immediate prospects. "From a long-term standpoint, right now stocks are undervalued," he said. "That does not mean they cannot go down in the short run. One constant we know about is that uncertainty harms equity markets."
He added: "It is hard to see any sustained rise in prices until the uncertainty dissipates. Given the type of enemy we have, it doesn't appear this is going to happen anytime soon."
When the week was done, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 14.3 percent, to 8,235.81. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had fallen 11.6 percent, to 965.80. The Nasdaq composite index fell 16.1 percent, to 1,423.19. Those are the levels of October 1998.
Much of the selling came, some investment advisers said, from companies and financial institutions that bailed out of large blocks of stock. Others said it was foreign investors, retreating nervously from a long love affair with the United States market. There were reports of wealthy financiers, like the Bass family of Texas, selling huge chunks of stock in a scramble to raise cash to pay off margin loans or other obligations. Others said the sellers were insurance companies preparing to pay the $30 billion to $40 billion of claims related to the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.
Given the declines, it was most likely all of the above -- and individual investors. They poured a record $66 billion into money market funds, one of the most conservative investments, in the three trading days before and after the World Trade Center crashes, according to AMG Data Services, which tracks money flows. Stock mutual funds suffered net withdrawals of $5.9 billion over the same period -- a substantial but not record amount -- and bond funds not devoted to high-risk bonds took in significant new money.
For those who were already pessimistic, the last two weeks offered much to reinforce their view.
"It's clear to me that we were already in a full-blown recession before the attack," said A. Gary Shilling, an economist and money manager who predicted last year that the Nasdaq would fall as low as 1,027. Even with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates aggressively, he said, the economy will not recover until next year.
"In general, I would not be trying to catch falling pianos," Mr. Shilling said. For investors with cash now, he favors longer-term Treasury bonds. As for those who already own stocks, and plan to stay with them, Mr. Shilling says they will have to adjust their expectations to much lower stock market returns of 5 to 6 percent a year.
Seth M. Glickenhaus, the 87-year-old chief investment officer of Glickenhaus & Company, was even more bearish.
"The economic and political uncertainties are so great that one should buy municipal bonds if you need tax exemptions," he said, and government bonds otherwise.
"You should be 100 percent in bonds," he added. "If you are 22 years old, there may be certain groups of stocks you should look at that, for the long term, will be all right. But for the long, not the intermediate, term."
That said, fortunes and reputations have been made before by buying during bleak times. Carl C. Icahn, one of Wall Street's best-known financiers and corporate raiders, said that now could well be the time to make that decision. "I've been quite bearish for the last year, but I am starting to believe that the markets are becoming oversold," he said on Friday. "I intend to start buying in the next week or two."
Ronald Baron, chairman and chief executive of Baron Capital, said: "We're in the middle of a panic right now, and you're going to get opportunities you rarely see. There's tremendous opportunities to invest right now. People are going to travel again and it's going to be a lot sooner than you think."
"This is the end of the bear market," he proclaimed.
Somewhere in the middle is Gary L. Pilgrim, the fund manager and a co-founder of Pilgrim Baxter & Associates. He favors stocks of fast-growing companies and acknowledged that many investors might not have the staying power when stocks are falling, because of margin calls or the need for cash. But he expressed confidence that the markets would recover.
"You do have to recognize our world, our economy and our stock market have already recovered from every setback," he said.
David Dreman, who heads Dreman Value Management, said he did not know whether the stock market would continue to fall. But he has studied the performance of the Dow after 11 crises since World War II. On average, the index gained 30 percent from the bottoms hit after those events.
"There wasn't one year that it was down," he said. "There always seems to be an overreaction to a crisis."
Many experts who have devoted their lives to thinking about how best to balance risk and reward say that the events of the last two weeks, if not the market declines of the last year, reinforced the most obvious but most often discarded tenet of investing: be diversified.
Investors, said Mr. Hoey at Dreyfus, should not embrace any strategy based on a single scenario, be it the market dropping or rising. "There's really never the wrong time to adopt the right investment strategy," he said.
If American investors are looking for tough advice, they will get it from Sir John M. Templeton, 88, the noted investor who founded the Templeton mutual fund family. In an interview from his office in the Bahamas, he contended that this was not the time to rally around any single flag, at least as an investor. He said American investors had placed too much faith in domestic stocks, especially technology stocks, and should be spreading their bets.
Sir John recommends that most people keep up to half of their investment assets in Treasury bonds. A simple way to spread the remainder among quality stocks from around the world would be to buy a global stock index, like the Morgan Stanley World index, he said. Only young people who know they will not need money to pay for college or any major purchases for a long time should put the bulk of their assets into stocks.
"Every once in a while, people go through a period of excess optimism and then go through a period of excess pessimism," he said. The boom in technology stocks in this country in the late 1990's "was by far the biggest and wildest ever seen."
Even now, he said, American share prices are too high, about double historical norms. "Americans are amazing in how self-centered they are," said Sir John, a Tennessee native. "Nobody in Switzerland would dream of keeping all his assets in Swiss stocks."
Unfortunately, investing has many pitfalls that bewitch what seems like good sense. With so many investors looking now to bonds, they have drawbacks. As the prices of bonds rise, the yields go down, making them less attractive.
"Here's the problem for investors: short-term Treasuries yield about 3 percent," said William H. Gross, the chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company and the country's most prominent bond investor.
"What a bank offers has got to be close" to that, he added. "A lot of money is flowing into money market mutual funds, which are going to yield investors 2.5 percent. These investments are safe but don't provide returns."
Yields on Ginnie Mae bonds are more promising, at 5.5 percent to 6 percent, he noted, and are fully guaranteed by the government. Mr. Gross said he had been buying long-term Treasury bonds because their yields looked considerably more attractive than those of short-term Treasury bonds.
Perhaps the best advice from experts to individual investors is the most obvious: don't run too briskly in any direction during such pronounced volatility. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index peaked at 57.3 on Friday, the highest level since October 1998.
"A day or so after the event, we advised people to sit still," said Edward M. Kerschner, chief global strategist for UBS Warburg. "There is no way to reasonably assess the fundamental impact of this. If you truly were investing to retire and put the kids through college 10 to 20 years from now, the decisions you made two weeks ago are probably as rational as any."

HEADLINE: A Disaster for the Working Poor 

 BODY:
One of the tragic byproducts of the destruction of the World Trade Center has been financial crisis for thousands of unskilled, low-income employees who were displaced by the disaster. About 3,500 people who clean the hotel rooms and offices in lower Manhattan lost their jobs when the buildings that employed them were destroyed or closed for the cleanup. With salaries that average roughly $32,000 a year, most have little in the way of savings to fall back on. As New York struggles to recover from the terrorist attack, workers like these have to be among the priorities for help. 
 Some of these workers will receive health coverage, cash assistance and first choice of new jobs in their industry thanks to a special agreement between unions and contractors. Emergency clearing houses have been set up to help them find jobs, and the state has waived the seven-day waiting period for unemployment benefits. But those benefits will cover these workers for only six months, and replacement jobs will be hard to find at a time when hotels and other service-related businesses are cutting back in response to the lagging economy and drop in tourism. Given these special circumstances, the duration of benefits should be temporarily extended. 
 The disaster in Lower Manhattan has had grave consequences for other low-income workers whose jobs were nowhere near the World Trade Center. Half the unionized garment workers in Lower Manhattan were sent home without pay when the trucks that deliver partially assembled clothing to the sewing shops for finishing were unable to get to their factories because of the rescue effort. Most are now back on the job, but workers who earn less than $15,000 a year can be financially crippled by even brief periods of unemployment. Many speak little or no English, and have had difficulty understanding how to apply for help.
The drivers who normally ferry tourists and business people around the city are suffering, too. The union that represents many of the city's 11,000 black-car drivers says that business has been off by about 80 percent and that some drivers have gone a whole day without a single fare. The drivers may be helped by President Bush's designation of the city as a disaster area. This allows self-employed and part-time workers to receive disaster unemployment assistance. Unfortunately, it usually takes up to three weeks for either D.U.A. or regular unemployment checks to reach those in need. Everything possible should be done to reduce that waiting time.
The effects of this tragedy on the city's poorest and most vulnerable workers have been a little-noticed side of a disaster with so many terrible stories. But the displaced workers and their families will be struggling for a long time to recover from the attack, and they should not be forgotten.

Terror Makes Itself Felt on Wall Street

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY

 BODY:
There were calls for investors to stage a patriotic rally when the stock market reopened last Monday after a four-day shutdown in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But stocks ended the week at their lowest levels in three years. 
 Even the Federal Reserve failed to stimulate the market after trimming short-term interest rates by half a percentage point. 
 Much of last week's trading was volatile, fueled by fears of a recession and of the scope of American military retaliation. Wall Street paid little attention to anything else.
 Companies ranging from Eastman Kodak to Adobe Systems, the software publisher, warned of disappointing profits in the current quarter. Perhaps the most optimistic news came from General Electric, which expected double-digit earnings growth in 2001.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,369.70 points, or 14.3 percent, to 8,235.81 - its worst weekly percentage decline since the Great Depression. The Nasdaq composite index lost 272.19 points, or 16.1 percent, to 1,423.19. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 126.74 points, or 11.6 percent, to 965.80. SHERRI DAY

HEADLINE: Aftermath; 
The Prospect of a War Without a Wartime Boom

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHATEVER else they are, wars are usually good for the economy, at least in the short run. World War II completed the job of pulling the United States out of the Depression. Vietnam helped fuel a nearly decade-long boom during the 1960's.
 This time, however, someone forgot to tell the stock market. When Wall Street got back to business last week, the Dow plummeted 14.3 percent, its worst one-week performance since 1933. 
 This, as President Bush has said repeatedly, is a new kind of war. And it will be fought by a nation whose muscle derives in part from having a new kind of economy, one whose response to the war is unlikely to follow any previous script.
The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon clearly dealt a sharp blow in the short run to commerce, the financial system and consumer confidence. The business expansion that began in 1991 and reached record length at the beginning of last year, bringing unemployment to 30-year lows and the federal budget surplus to a record high, may finally have come to an end. The airline industry teetered on the brink of financial collapse last week as planes flew almost empty.
Conceivably, some quick, visible progress on the military front, combined with credible efforts to ensure security at home, could lead to a rapid return to normalcy. But the prospects for such a benign outcome don't seem good.
It is hard to predict the effect a prolonged campaign against terrorism will have on a form of capitalism built around risk-taking, technological advances, lightning-fast reactions and a willingness to let goods, money and people move freely.
This is not going to be a conflict in which housewives flock to factories to build fighter planes. It may not even be one in which consumers, rather than going to the mall, sit around for weeks watching cruise missiles streak into foreign capitals on CNN.
But it could be one in which the national, and global, psychology, now more than ever a vital determinant of economic vibrancy, is affected for a long period. And despite the appeal to investors to buy stocks as a patriotic duty, financial markets, the modern economy's central nervous system, are almost sure to remain jittery if not depressed.
Consumers, suddenly fearful of losing their jobs or feeling poorer as their stock portfolios erode, could choose not to buy that new car or splurge on that blouse. The willingness to gamble, to invest time, money and energy in an idea, could be blunted, sapping the nation's entrepreneurial spirit. "If it changes the way we do business on a long-term basis by imposing risks on air travel, creating incentives to disperse financial activities and culturally making people more cautious," said Peter Morici, a senior fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute, a research organization, "then we're going to have a terrorist tax on growth. It would rob us of a piece of that new economy."
After dealing with the immediate crisis of keeping the financial system operating and getting Wall Street up and running again -- an effort that was encouragingly successful -- economic policymakers began trying last week to sort out all the uncertainty.
After initially rushing toward adoption of a big stimulus package, to be paid for out of a budget surplus that had previously been reserved for debt reduction, Congress and the White House pulled back abruptly last week. They did so largely at the urging of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who said there was as much risk in overreacting or choosing the wrong antidote as in delaying or acting too timidly.
The Fed itself acted forcefully after the attacks, cutting interest rates and making sure banks and investment firms had all the cash they needed. Congress and the administration hastily drew up and debated legislation to keep the airlines solvent. And there may still prove to be a need for a combination of new tax cuts and additional spending to spur more economic activity by individuals and businesses, Mr. Greenspan said. 
But the degree of help the economy needs cannot be assessed accurately for a few weeks, he said. And there is a risk, he added, that a rush to prop up the economy would prove counterproductive if the government could no longer afford to make good on its plan to pay off most of the national debt in the next decade. That would leave less money in the economy for investment in businesses, which would drive interest rates higher than they would be otherwise.
Mr. Greenspan's warning had the effect of torpedoeing an effort by some Republicans to push through a quick passage of tax cuts, including a reduction in the capital gains tax. 
THUS far, despite the mounting toll of layoffs, the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars in stock market wealth and a new consensus among economic forecasters that the United States has entered a recession, Mr. Bush and his team tried to emphasize the positive. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill even suggested that it might be a good time to buy stocks.
But investors peered into the future, saw little to cheer about and sold. Companies began delaying or canceling expansion plans, and warning that they would reduce their work forces. Japan, which has been wallowing in a slump for a decade, looked more wobbly than ever, as did other industrialized and developing nations. If the United States falters, it will further hurt the international economic outlook -- which in turn will deepen problems at home.
Mr. Greenspan has devoted considerable time in recent years to studying the psychology of economic shocks and panics. One of the economy's strengths is that technology has allowed businesses, investors and consumers to spot change even as it is occurring and respond almost instantaneously. Such speed is usually a good thing. But sometimes, Mr. Greenspan has suggested, it blows our economic circuits.
"It has become evident time and again that when events become too complex and move too rapidly," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech several years ago, "human beings become demonstrably less able to cope. The failure of the ability to comprehend external events almost invariably induces disengagement from an activity, whether it be fear of entering a dark room, or of market volatility."
Right now the American economy seems to be poised at that doorway. And no one knows whether the lights on the other side are on or off.

HEADLINE: Aftermath; 
A City Transformed: Designing 'Defensible Space'

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY VIDLER; Anthony Vidler, acting dean of the Cooper Union School of Architecture, is the author of "Warped Space: Art, Architecture and Anxiety in Modern Culture."

 BODY:
THE terrorist attack on the World Trade Center is propelling a civic debate over whether to change the way Americans experience and ultimately build urban public spaces. Are a city's assets -- density, concentration, monumental structures -- still alluring? Will a desire for "defensible space" radically transform the city as Americans know it? 
 For more than a century, architects and urban planners have been trying to design better forms for the modern metropolis. Some, like Le Corbusier, reimagined the city in glass and steel, its transparent towers majestically spaced amid greenery -- prismatic objects in a vast urban park. Others, like Frank Lloyd Wright, envisioned it dispersed in "broadacres," spread across the fertile prairie, each citizen given a plot of land. 
 All these plans grew out of a desire to counteract what were seen as the central threats against life and happiness in the late 19th century: lack of light and air, unsanitary and overcrowded conditions and congested circulation that demanded the opening up of narrow streets and the restitution of "nature" in the form of green space, if not the dispersal of the entire city. 
Such dispersal has, in fact, been taking place since the 1920's, as the "metropolis" grew into the "megalopolis." The result was an uneasy compromise between clusters of skyscrapers in downtown redevelopments and suburban sprawl.
But the central city, for all its economic woes, has retained its strong attraction as a focus of public interaction, a center of trade, finance and consumerism. In recent years, cities like New York have seen a return to livability and a reconstruction of social and cultural services and neighborhoods.
The last decades, however, have seen a major increase in terrorist attacks on the public centers in Europe, the Middle East, and now the United States. Dispersal rather than concentration is being talked about as the viable pattern of life and work, where monumental buildings will give way to camouflaged sheds, or entirely scattered to home offices.
Urban planners are ill-prepared to respond to this new reality. Fear of aerial attack has actually preoccupied planners and architects since the First World War and its Zeppelin bombardments. At that time, decentralization was the watchword. -- a strategy that fit the polemics of the Garden City movement. Regional planning groups in Britain and America stressed the security advantages of "spread" cities. Le Corbusier, in consultation with former military officers, drew diagrams showing that his project for a "Ville Verte" or "Green City" was less susceptible to damage from above. Its wide parks and narrow bands of apartment-buildings offered smaller targets.
But all such plans were drawn up to counter the threat of external attack, rather than to protect against terrorism from within. Indeed, for many critics, security has been seen as a threat to liberty -- the surveillance society as a dystopia of secret cameras, invasion of privacy and the abuse of state power. If planners considered security, it has been in the service of crime prevention in the inner city or the retreat into gated "safe" communities of the suburbs.
Certainly the superficial result of the latest terror will be to confirm the dark images of metropolis drawn by the Expressionists in the 1920's, and popularized by Fritz Lang's silent masterwork, "Metropolis" -- the city as an untamed monster, a vision updated in the cyberpunk stories of William Gibson, movies like "Blade Runner" and the Japanese comic books, "Atari" and "Metropolis," whose ruined streets bear a disturbing resemblance to the devastation in downtown Manhattan. 
There will be an understandable impulse to flee. The "new urbanism" movement, with its low-density developments like Seaside or Celebration in Florida, designed to replicate small-town life in premodern America, will no doubt take the opportunity to denounce tall buildings as inherently mistaken. Certainly a number of firms will relocate outside New York in the search for space and security; maybe a number of New Yorkers will move to the suburbs. 
The experience of the rest of the world indicates however, that terrorism alone will not decrease the importance of city centers for the public life of societies. London, subject to terrorist bombings since the late Victorian age, to the ferocious bombardments of World War II and to the spill-over of the violence in Northern Ireland, has always rebounded with strength. Paris has been on the alert for terrorism since the Algerian War. Yet its museums, monuments and public spaces are continually filled. New York will be no exception.
For real community, as evident over the last week, is bred in cities more strongly than suburbs. The street as a site of interaction, encounter and the support of strangers for each other; the square as a place of gathering and vigil; the corner store a communicator of information and interchange. These spaces, without romanticism or nostalgia, still define an urban culture, one that resists all efforts to "secure" it out of existence.
Proposals have already been made that would change the nature of public space: closing off Times Square to traffic; limiting access to railroad terminals; increasing use of surveillance cameras; reducing access to parks; adding more cameras and security personnel in buildings. Such a world would hardly be worth living in and would inhibit the very contact through density that cities encourage.
Yet it is true that urban public life has suffered major onslaughts in the last 20 years, from the increasing privatization encouraged by reliance on Internet services to the expansion of the mall-effect -- whereby only the largest consumer outlets survive. In the current crisis, it is all the more important that the idea of public space, and its relations to urban community, be sustained. 
This is why it is urgent that planners explore new urban designs that learn from the difficulties of past utopias as well as avoid the nostalgia of anti-city programs. We should search for design alternatives that retain the dense and vital mix of uses critical to urban life, rethinking the exclusions stemming from outdated zoning, real estate values and private ownership, to provide vital incentives for building public spaces equal to our present needs for community.

HEADLINE: Aftermath: Innocence Lost; 
A Tragedy for an Optimistic Land

BYLINE:  By ANNE TAYLOR FLEMING; Anne Taylor Fleming is an essayist on "The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer."

 BODY:
IT has been said countless times on talk shows and op-ed pages, in shops and supermarkets, over the last stretch of days: America has lost its innocence. Politicians and pundits and the public -- in grief-stricken, sometimes angry voices -- have said the same. Americans, they say, have crossed some literal and psychic Rubicon into a darker, scarier world. And the nation mourns the loss of that innocence as it mourns its dead.
 On one level, the sentiment seems true enough. Nothing of this magnitude has happened to Americans before -- especially on our own soil. In that sense, America was new to this kind of horror. But "innocent" one day and not the next? This is not meant to be cheeky or a matter of word-play; that would be obscene at a time like this. 
 But this notion of innocence, the insistence on it, has also penalized the country, kept it locked into a vision of itself and its place in the world that brings harm, that keeps the populace from seeing things -- even this ghastly act -- in their true colorations and complexities.
That innocence helped keep the country from seeing clearly the hatred coming its way and trying to defuse or deal with it. Terrorists had blown up two American embassies -- had, in fact, placed a bomb in the World Trade Center in 1993. The terrorists in question were locked up, a bomb was dropped on an alleged pharmaceutical factory in Sudan and the nation moved on, taking scant precautions against future terrorism and re-embracing the good times. There was a full-tilt celebration of World War II, when Americans were more noble, self-sacrificing and (what else?) more innocent.
Americans have been serial innocents. Not just with Pearl Harbor, much referenced in recent days, but also with Vietnam, Watergate, even the 1950's quiz show scandals. Each time Americans have said, like abashed children: we've lost our innocence. Then that innocence is somehow redonned like an alias or costume. Morning in America. Rise and shine. Start the healing. Part of this, of course, is a sign of strength, the pragmatic, pick-yourself-up-and-dust-yourself-off fortitude now personified by the mayor of New York.
But part of it stems from something else, a need to avoid national introspection, not take on historical weight as it were.
"As a nation and a society, we do have very, very short memories," said Michael G. Kammen, a professor of American history at Cornell University. "We are not unique in doing so. Most societies repress bad memories -- that's a fairly normative thing -- and they commemorate and celebrate good memories. But I do think there are reasons why short memory and collective amnesia are more pronounced and more problematic in our society."
More pronounced, Professor Kammen said, due to the sheer number of newcomers with no shared history. "Polish-Americans might remember a segment of American history that's germane to them, and Jewish-Americans might remember the segment that's germane to them," he explained. "But there are not many Americans who have much of a sense of the overall collective past."
There is a darker current under the ahistoricism and determined innocence, the nation's desire to clean up the past, to distance itself from its self-inflicted scars. The country was founded on a trail of tears: American Indians killed, their land taken, and, of course, slavery, 300 years of it.
In the face of that, Americans still maintained a kind of willful innocence. It wasn't until the late 1970's, Professor Kammen points out, that the docents in Colonial Williamsburg even used the word slavery. Until then, the African-Americans were referred to as "servants," if at all.
There were many crises to test that assumed innocence: the Civil War, in which Americans killed each other in record numbers; the disillusionment after World War I that America had not made the world safe for democracy; the crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression that revealed such economic vulnerability; the cold war and Bay of Pigs; and on into Vietnam and Watergate -- more painful losses of innocence for being self-inflicted.
There seems, at times, an unbearable dichotomy between American goodness and badness. We don't seem to have a vocabulary for it, the juggling act of national self-image, in no small part because within each citizen -- left, right or center, Yankee stock or new arrival -- there is a sense of the magic gift that is America. It is encoded in the national DNA -- the story of the founding, those eminent fathers with their wisdom -- and there is a sense that Americans cannot bear, in a collective and personal way, any transgressions against that magic, cannot bear that they might have tarnished it. (Never mind that some founding fathers had complicated and checkered lives.)
So there is retreat back into innocence, back into what Professor Kammen in his book, "Mystic Chords of Memory," calls the "heritage syndrome," a sort of Americana gymkhana of memorial building (Washington is becoming choked with them), memorabilia collecting (think "The Antique Road Show") and flag-waving nostalgia (as in the recent World War II celebration). If the country is going to go back, then let it be done in an uplifting, myth-reinforcing way. 
WHAT is lost in this posturing is any grasp of the tragic. In its place is the cycle of innocence lost, innocent regained. Tragedy is not part of the national self-image. It is as if in leaving the Old World behind, Americans also left behind a tragic habit of mind, a sense of the complex and textured history that is the lot of any country. They would be different, better, newer forever.
But without that sense of the tragic, America is indeed "innocent," facing each new test or crisis with a combination of abashed patriotism and that feisty spirit. Without a sense of the tragic, its citizens are naked, unprotected, eternally childlike. 
So these days of recovery and shock are bereft of the added piquancy, the added sweetness of having lived with a tragedy and seen the sun shine again and the moon rise, of knowing that America has its own complicated past, complicated motives, and is part of the cycle of life and death and love and loss, no less than the older, scarred countries beside whom it now takes it place in history. Without that sense, that knowledge, Americans are apt to find themselves at more terrible risk, the (avenging) innocents abroad in an increasingly complicated, hostile and ever-shrinking world.

HEADLINE: Driving Through an Altered Landscape 

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
REVERBERATIONS from the terrorist bombings are still sending shudders through Detroit and other centers of a global auto industry that even before Sept. 11 was suffering from slowing sales and cutthroat competition.
 There have been a few encouraging signs -- like increased traffic in dealer showrooms, which were still-lifes in the days just after Sept. 11 -- as the industry prepares for its traditional October transition to a new model year. But the potential for war, recession and higher gasoline prices have deeply unsettled auto executives, dealers, assembly workers and just about anyone else connected to the industry. 
 "Sales are down 30 to 35 percent over the past week," said Van Bussmann, senior vice president of J. D. Power & Associates, the market-research firm, which has been tracking daily activity at 5,000 dealerships. "We haven't seen seeds of recovery, nor have we seen deterioration." 
Mr. Bussman has reduced his estimate of 2001 vehicle sales to 16 million, from 16.2 million before the attacks. That could still be the industry's third-best year, because only three months remain and sales were very strong in early 2001. Previously, analysts were predicting sales of 16.5 million to 17 million.
The auto industry accounts for about 4 percent of the nation's economic output, and a slump in Detroit usually coincides with a recession.
"Industry demand is now expected to be exceptionally weak for the next two quarters, at least, and the likelihood of any improvement beyond that time is highly uncertain," Standard & Poor's said last week.
To stir buyer interest and keep its plants running, both General Motors and Ford announced interest-free loans on all car and truck models in the United States. The announcements came after a visit to Detroit by Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao, who met with auto executives and union leaders to discuss ways to help the economy.
DaimlerChrysler said it would not follow the lead of G.M. and Ford, since it had cut prices on 2002 models just weeks ago.
Keeping factories running has already proved a challenge. Dependent on just-in-time delivery of parts, several plants had to shut down temporarily as trucks full of components -- from factories in Canada, Mexico and the United States -- were initially not allowed to cross national borders and then waited in lines for as long as 15 hours as vehicles were subjected to more rigorous inspections. Factories resumed production last week, and waiting times at the border dropped to an hour or two as National Guard troops were brought in to help Customs agents.
A prolonged sales downturn would accelerate the deterioration of automakers' balance sheets. Both S. & P. and Moody's warned that they might lower their credit ratings for DaimlerChrysler. The Chrysler Group, whose sales have plunged, was already losing money and struggling to meet cost-cutting goals. S. & P. also said the terrorist attacks "increase the likelihood" of downgrades for G.M. and Ford. Lower credit ratings make it more expensive for companies to borrow money.
Some automakers have halted air travel or limited it to essential trips. In some cases, employees who feel uncomfortable traveling are allowed to decline. Mercedes-Benz canceled a dealers meeting in Monaco next month.
News of the attacks in New York and Washington reached many of the world's auto executives at the Frankfurt Auto Show. Automakers quickly canceled or toned down their normally flashy events. A bomb threat forced the temporary evacuation of an exhibit hall. Executives were stranded in Germany for days.
In Detroit, Rod Alberts, executive director of the North American International Auto Show, said plans for the January show were moving forward. He said he was contacting organizers of shows in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles to propose a meeting on new security measures. Before then, the Tokyo show will provide a test.

HEADLINE: Reckonings; 
A Bad Week

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In late 1997, when South Korea suddenly found itself in economic crisis, there was a great upsurge of patriotism. Women offered their gold jewelry to the government, to help rebuild its vanished reserves of foreign exchange; millions of people cut back on their spending, feeling that it was irresponsible to buy themselves luxuries when the nation was in danger.
 Of course, this willingness to make sacrifices for the national good made things worse: the drop in consumer spending was one of the factors that pushed South Korea into an extremely nasty recession. 
 I mention this piece of recent history for the obvious reason: although CNN may be calling this "America's new war," at least so far the economic effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack look very little like those we usually associate with war, and very much like those we saw in the Asian financial crisis. After a terrible week in the financial markets, it's clearer than ever that the usually helpful instincts of a nation under attack -- the desire to give up some pleasures in honor of the victims, the feeling that having too good a time would be in bad taste -- are actually worsening the situation. 
So what's the answer? There have been some efforts to convince people that it is their patriotic duty to spend money. But I don't think that's going to work: it goes too much against the grain of human nature, against the feeling that tragedy demands sacrifice rather than self-indulgence. And the grass-roots campaign that took place before the market reopened, urging people to buy stock as a gesture of faith in America, has already backfired: anyone who patriotically purchased stocks got caught up in a market plunge that wiped out more than $1 trillion in wealth, while short-selling hedge fund managers who didn't let sentimentality get in the way of business did very well, thank you.
So this isn't the kind of problem that can be solved by voluntary action. It's up to the government to ensure that America's sorrow and nervousness don't turn into an economic disaster.
A first step would be some realistic rhetoric. I don't fault the Bush administration for initially using the language of war and revenge; an angry and grieving public would not have accepted anything less. Eventually, however, officials will have to make more strongly than they have the point that this is not going to be war as we usually understand it: there will probably be little impact on daily life for most people, few dramatic events and quite possibly no real catharsis.
A second step would be to accelerate the flow of government spending into the economy. One of the lessons of the Asian crisis, declared the I.M.F.'s Stanley Fischer, was that "Keynesianism is alive and well" -- increased government spending does help the economy. And the additional spending that will take place as a result of the attack -- $45 billion approved so far, much more to come -- will eventually give our own economy a significant lift. But there is now a risk that the "wealth effect" from last week's market plunge, the adverse effects of stock losses on consumer spending, will beat the fiscal stimulus to the punch. Let's get the government spending underway, please. 
True, Alan Greenspan cautioned us last week that "it is far more important to be right than quick." I'm not sure what he meant by that, so I'm not sure I agree. If he means that it's very important not to respond to the economy's weakness with a so-called stimulus package that locks in another round of permanent tax cuts, I definitely agree. As Mr. Greenspan pointed out, one risk to the economy is that a worsening long-run budget prospect will drive up long-term interest rates; that's the last thing we need. To limit that risk I would suggest the general rule that Congress shall make no laws in the heat of this crisis that affect either revenue or spending beyond next year. 
But in terms of immediate action, it may be more important that the money already in the pipeline be spent quickly than that it be spent well.
A final, optimistic thought: South Korea's recession lasted less than a year; by 1999 the economy was rapidly recovering. We ought to be able to do better.

HEADLINE: Bill in Brazil Would Allow More of Jungle To Be Razed 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BRASILIA 

 BODY:
A joint commission of the Brazilian Congress has approved a measure that would more than double the amount of the Amazon jungle that ranchers, loggers and miners would be permitted to raze.
 The measure, sponsored by a "rural caucus" of legislators, would weaken many restrictions on Amazon land use and eliminate other safeguards altogether. 
 Though the bill must be approved by both houses of Congress to become law, environmental groups are alarmed and have begun a national campaign to defeat it.
"This legislation is dangerous to the Amazon and to all of Brazil because it puts the government's entire program of sustainable development at risk," said Adriana Ramos of the Social and Environmental Institute, a research and advocacy group. "The initial vote reflects the intransigence of a rural lobby that thinks only of defending its own narrow interests at the expense of society." 
The measure, a new forestry code, would modify the government's current policy of requiring owners of land in the Amazon to preserve 80 percent of their property as forest. Instead of the 20 percent left for development, the new code would enable landowners to use at least 50 percent of their holdings for "productive purposes" once a "zoning study" granted approval.
"We have no objection to preserving the Amazon, which is, after all, part of the patrimony of the Brazilian people," said Senator Rubens Moreira Mendes, a leading member of the rural caucus. But the current restrictions, he said, "go too far in discouraging rational development and investment."
The draft code would also remove a longstanding provision that obligates landowners to replant deforested areas along riverbanks, allow them to replace some virgin forest with nonnative, commercially attractive species like eucalyptus, and redefine what constitutes jungle. 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso opposes the changes and was able to thwart an effort to pass a similar bill in May. But his government's coalition in Congress has weakened since then and is likely to become more divided ahead of presidential elections a year from now.
"A lot of bad things can happen at the end of a government, and one of the things we are seeing in the eastern Amazon is a sense of a free-for-all, with nobody minding the store," Stephan Schwartzman of Environmental Defense said in a telephone interview from Washington. "It's kind of open season, and that kind of mentality could lead people in Brazil to do things they think could create some sort of electoral advantages."
The debate comes as the pace of deforestation in the Amazon, which is bigger than all of Western Europe, appears to be picking up. After reaching a record level in the mid-1990's, the destruction of tree cover slowed somewhat in 1999 and 2000, according to government monitors, as the Brazilian economy stagnated. 
But Brazil has largely recovered from that crisis, and the current Amazon dry season has been marked by drought. That makes felling or burning trees easier. 
"We have been seeing massive numbers of trucks and buses hauling laborers deeper and deeper into the jungle to cut down trees so as to create new cattle ranches," said Amarildo Gomes Pereira, who monitors deforestation patterns for the Roman Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission from the jungle town of Tucuma. 
The government is seeking to postpone a final vote on the proposal. But backers of the bill like Mr. Moreira Mendes are pushing for a quick decision. 
"The integrity of the most magnificent forest on the planet is a right of the many future generations of Brazilians who, unlike large landholders, have not been heard in Congress," the Minister of the Environment, Jose Sarney Filho, said recently. "It is up to the state and public opinion to undertake an intransigent defense of this right."

HEADLINE: Italians Hold Large Protest Rally After Parliament Clears Police 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: ROME, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets here this week, just hours after Parliament approved a report absolving the police of wrongdoing during a meeting of world leaders in Genoa two months ago. The legislators acted even though reports of brutality there have never been seriously disputed.
 The crowds appeared Thursday to protest globalization, which was the target of the protests in Genoa. But they also protested against terrorism, NATO and a proposed tightening of immigration laws. 
 With the terrorist attacks in the United States, the protesters' concerns seem to have evolved since the Genoa meeting in July. That is partly because there is deepening support among Italians for police action to assure public order.
The new concerns of the left include a proposed law that would impose jail sentences on people repeatedly caught entering the country without proper papers.
Proposed changes in the way that white-collar crimes are prosecuted have also given the protesters a chance to mobilize opinion against the center-right government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. His critics have complained, to little avail, that the law could have the effect of causing judges to throw out several accounting fraud cases pending against Mr. Berlusconi. 
In recent days, though, there has been some real debate over whether a provision in the same group of proposed laws, one that makes it more difficult to follow money trails abroad, might benefit terrorists.
An article in La Repubblica said today that Parliament might make it "so difficult to exchange information with other nations that it would hinder investigations into terrorism."
Despite a police raid in the middle of the night on protesters at the July meeting in Genoa, and the death of one protester, this week's government report defended the police, saying that in Genoa the officers "did their utmost, paying a high price in terms of risking injury."

HEADLINE: New Kind of Settler Finding a Way in Japan 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
With Japan's population set to shrink further and faster than that of any other economically advanced country over the next half century, foreigners like Steven Gan are acquiring something of the aura of pioneers. 
 As a rare Westerner who settled here for the long term, Mr. Gan neatly fills the bill for a government that realizes that Japan must attract people from elsewhere in dramatically increased numbers, and yet remains jittery about large-scale immigration. 
 What is more, as Mr. Gan has built up a successful debt-collection business here, he has shaken up what had been a cottage industry with an unsavory reputation, and perhaps injected a bit of vigor into the country's sluggish economy. 
"For most people the image of the Japanese collection industry is the yakuza, or mafia," Mr. Gan said. "But as a foreigner I've been able to get beyond that, and lend some legitimacy to the business. There are over 7,000 collection agencies in the United States, but when I started out there were only five or six in all of Tokyo. 
For years Americans have complained that Japanese culture was impenetrable, that companies here only wanted to buy Japanese and that after a polite initial reception, those who sought to settle down here were often made to feel less than welcome. But Mr. Gan, and other Americans who have started their own businesses, bought homes or even gone to work for Japanese companies, say that things have been changing subtly in this society.
With only 1.7 million foreigners in Japan, out of a population of 127 million people, the country faces a huge task in attracting the 600,000 immigrants a year that the United Nations estimates it will need in order to stabilize its population and prevent wrenching labor and fiscal crises. 
If nothing is done, according to the Japanese government's projections there will be 100 million people in 2050 and only 67 million at century's end. 
Of the foreigners who live here, a million or so are Korean and Chinese residents who have long complained of discrimination. Many of the other foreigners here are actually people of Japanese ancestry who immigrated to Japan from Brazil and elsewhere during the economic boom years of the 1980's.
Although Japan has recently set a priority of attracting skilled immigrants, and people who can make an economic contribution right away, there are only about 45,000 Americans living in the country, according to government statistics. Hong Kong, with a population of only six million, has roughly the same number. 
Though discrimination in housing and other areas, like the academic world, still exists, many of the new professionals from the West share the belief that the Japanese work world is not as impermeable or unfair as long reputed. Moreover, they say, the influx of outsiders is increasingly appreciated for introducing badly needed new ways of doing things.
After spending a year as an exchange student at a Tokyo university, Jake Adelstein transferred there outright. Though he got his degree and was offered a job with the Sony Corporation, he decided to try his luck with the newspaper industry's famously difficult hiring examinations. "I never believed I would be hired by a Japanese newspaper, especially a major one like the Yomiuri, and never on the same terms as a Japanese person," said Mr. Adelstein, who is 32. "People had told me that was just impossible."
He took a cram class to prepare for the exam. But when he showed up at the Yomiuri Shimbun for the first of his interviews in 1992, Mr. Adelstein said, "at the reception desk people kept hinting to me that I was in the wrong place."
Japanese labor experts say that cases like these suggest that although a national effort is just beginning, the country will be able to attract talented immigrants. "Japanese companies cannot find human resources within their own organizations anymore, and there are few people who move from business to business with the skills that companies need," said Jiro Nakamura, a professor of labor economics at Tokyo Metropolitan University, who said that Japan had little choice but to lure more foreign workers. 
William Stonehill, a Chicago native, also arrived in Tokyo planning to study, hoping to add a graduate degree in Japanese to one he had already earned in Chinese, and like Mr. Adelstein, he eventually decided to settle.
"When I looked around, I noticed that there were no imports here," he said. "I had studied watch making, so I got into importing Swiss watches and German clocks. It is like wildcatting. You don't need a license or anything, so I got into business, walked into a shop and threw some stuff on the counter and asked if they would like to buy any of this merchandise." 
Before he got his start in watches, Mr. Stonehill said he had worked as a door-to-door salesman, selling courses in English and "terrorizing housewives to buy stuff for junior." 
"You ask a lot of foreigners in business here how they got started here, and they'll say the same thing. Nobody ever told them that it was impossible, so they just went out and started a business."

HEADLINE: Unthinkable, And Now, Unspeakable 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
Beyond the direct devastation of so many lives, beyond the economic hardships and changed routines and gashed New York landscape, the attack on the World Trade Center has reached into the quieter corners of our existence.
 It has changed our inner landscape, in the words we use, the way we see images, the way we think. 
 Obviously, the nation's news media and entertainment industry have embarked on a sweeping purge, whether delaying movies that involve terrorism or bombs in planes ("Big Trouble"), deleting shots of the towers in television shows ("Sex and the City"), discouraging radio stations from playing certain songs (Talking Heads' "Burning Down the House") or pulling ads that now could have double meanings.
People are doing their own interior editing. Words are bearing freight they never had to before. Imaginations are rendering certain images and sounds differently. 
"Every time I hear a large airplane motor, I look up," said Paul Fussell, an author and emeritus professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania. "I think we have a new 'sky consciousness.' Every time I look at a tall building in Philadelphia, I can imagine it as a potential victim."
"In the late Victorian period, there was almost no sense of disaster for ordinary people," said Dr. Fussell, who wrote "The Great War and Modern Memory" (Oxford University Press, 1975), an influential study of language and World War I. 
Dr. Fussell speculated that a new sense of language might also emerge. "How about what this is going to do to words as innocent as 'cement,' 'ashes,' 'parts' as in body parts, 'planes,' 'fuel' and so on?" he asked. "Each one of those is going to take on a partially negative and menacing implication."
Other disastrous events have changed perceptions of words and the human condition; it is difficult now to refer to a fire as a holocaust.
The writer Jonathan Rabb, who has written two history-based thrillers about plots to achieve world domination, says he has now become highly sensitive to the words he uses in conversation.
"At one point I was going to use the word 'towering,' like, 'He's a towering intellect,' and there was a hitch," said Mr. Rabb, who lives in Manhattan. "I went, 'Oh, do I want to use that word?' " 
Second thoughts and even dirty looks have followed phrases heard in conversation like "crash and burn" (as in fail), "shoot down" (as in nix an idea), "had a blast" (as in fun). One man on a city street was heard to say, "He folded like a house of cards." His friend said, "Bad choice of words, man."
The mundane has taken on new meaning. A 3-year-old boy at a Montclair, N.J., nursery school last week built a tower of blocks. As he innocently knocked them down, the teacher gasped in shock.
An eighth-grade science teacher at the Horace Mann School said she would eliminate a test question this year that asks students to calculate potential gravitational energy using the example of a tightrope walker between the World Trade Center towers.
Thomas A. Lucas, who is producing and directing a documentary for the Discovery channel about the Milky Way, has altered his script. To illustrate how large stars collapse into black holes, he had planned to use the implosion of a building as a light-hearted metaphor.
Humor, of course, was an immediate casualty. David Letterman choked up on air, The New Yorker published no humorous cartoons, and gallows humor was markedly absent from newsrooms. 
One Manhattan woman who used to tease her unshaven son for looking like an "Arab terrorist" said she would never make that remark again.
Rob Stevens, a record producer, and a market analyst, Paul Marsh, have for months been planning a call-in radio program that would take Wall Street to task with a mix of humorous banter and irreverent analysis. It was to begin Oct. 1 but will be delayed two weeks and then assume a more sober tone. 
"I haven't really laughed much since Tuesday," Mr. Stevens said. "It's just incredibly inappropriate."

HEADLINE: Chinese Creating a New Vigor in Russian Far East 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: ZABAIKALSK, Russia 

 BODY:
For a lesson in 21st-century geopolitics, come to this border town, until just a few years ago an outpost for Russian infantry awaiting a Chinese invasion. 
 Russian gun emplacements are crumbling now but the invasion is under way anyway: Chinese built the town's few new apartments, China Telecom connects the cellular phones, and Chinese traders hire busloads of jobless Russians to tote Chinese-made clothes and electronics through the Chinese-built border crossing. Maybe 1,000 of the 11,000 or so residents are Chinese, too. 
 The inescapable impression, here and elsewhere in the region, is of a land clinging tightly to its essential Russianness -- and slowly losing its grip. Along a stretch of Russian borderland as big as Western Europe, demographics, economics and, for the first time, history are all working against Moscow. 
"What we see in the Russian far east is the peaceful and slow colonization of all Russian territories in the area by the Chinese," said Alexei D. Bogaturov, the deputy director of the Institute of U.S.A. and Canada Studies here. "We have a grave problem, I think." 
Grave is a strong word, and many would dispute it. After all, decades of ideological and territorial disputes -- and a near war in 1969 -- have been settled and Russia-China relations are warmer now than at any time since the 1950's. In July the two countries struck a strategic alliance aimed in part at offsetting America's global dominance. 
One result of this sudden coziness has been a burst in trade. Chinese purchases of weapons, oil and timber have kept Russia's arms industry afloat and its trade balance healthy. Russian purchases of Chinese produce and clothing saved many from starvation and freezing during hard times in the 1990's. 
Overall trade jumped 40 percent last year alone -- albeit to a fairly puny $8 billion -- and could easily pass $10 billion in 2001. While all that may be good for Russia as a whole, it has so far overwhelmed its far east, given the gross imbalance along the border between a booming Chinese economy and this part of Russia that has perennially failed to feed, clothe and house itself. 
Though fabulously rich in timber, gold and coal, the Russian far east was long propped up by huge Soviet subsidies -- in the 1970's as much as half of all meat, dairy products and vegetables -- to keep the miners and loggers at work. For a long time, much of the economy also turned on the military's heavy presence in the border region. 
When Communism collapsed, so did the subsidies. The military all but disappeared, too, leaving a wreckage of near ghost towns behind. China has filled the vacuum. From Vladivostok to Zabaikalsk, Russians are coming to depend on the Chinese for everything from buildings to bananas to boomboxes. And that is unsettling even to the architects of the Sino-Russian reconciliation. 
President Vladimir V. Putin warned last year that the spread of Asian influence in the Russian far east placed Russia's very existence at stake. "If we don't make concrete efforts," he said, "the future local population will speak Japanese, Chinese or Korean." 
By themselves such fears are old hat. A scare swept the region in the late 1800's, when 75 percent of Amur region gold miners and 90 percent of Primorsky region railroad workers were Chinese. The difference is that in 1890 Russia was the expanding power, pressing its advantage against a China in disarray. Today it is the Chinese who are on the rise, and Russia a husk of its 1990 self. 
The Europe-size stretch of Russia along the border holds fewer than 6.2 million people, down 5 percent since 1991. The equivalent provinces on the Chinese side are home to 132 million -- and growing by a million a year. 
But what most bothers Russian experts is not the potential for Chinese immigration: right now, there are no more than 250,000 Chinese in the Russian border provinces. Rather, it is the inexorable spread of Chinese economic clout. In 1990, the economic outputs of China and the Soviet Union were roughly equal. In 2000, China's gross domestic product was four times the size of the Russian Federation's -- and the gap is widening. 
Mr. Putin's fear is that Chinese economic expansion will crowd out Russian commerce and political power unless Moscow repopulates and rebuilds this ravaged region first. But precious few Russians want to move here, and money for rebuilding is scarce. 
All that is painfully apparent in Zabaikalsk, a desolate cluster of concrete-slab buildings laid on the treeless plain just miles from where Russia, China and Mongolia meet. The original Trans-Siberian Railroad paused here before entering China on its way to the Pacific. Later, when the Soviets rerouted the main track within Russian territory, Zabaikalsk became the end of the line. 
It still is. Even though the railroad is again clogged with China-bound oil tankers and timber flatcars, Zabaikalsk remains a dust-whipped, one-street town where potholes outnumber people and the flies are thick as, well, flies. 
For Zabaikalsk residents, paradise begins 50 yards across the border, past abandoned Russian tanks and rusted barb-wire fences. There the Chinese have built a gleaming free-trade center, a small city of hotels, freight-forwarding offices, wholesale stores and pagodas. 
On the horizon, 10 minutes down a freshly paved highway in China, is the city of Manzhouli. Ten years ago a Chinese version of Zabaikalsk, it is today a staging area for Russian trade -- a forest of skyscrapers and cafes "where even the street sweepers have cellular phones," one Russian said enviously. 
"It's a beautiful city. I wish ours was like that," said a Russian woman who would identify herself only as Valentina. "The Chinese spend money on Manzhouli. All our money goes to Moscow -- or into the pockets of the people in charge." In local parlance, Valentina is a camel, a pack animal for Chinese goods. Customs rules allow visitors to carry up to 110 pounds of Chinese products into Russia duty free. Every day Chinese and Russian merchants hire busloads of camels to lug sacks of Chinese goods across the border for sale throughout the Russian far east. 
According to local immigration service officials, border crossings here jumped 50 percent last year, to 300,000. Many were camels making up to three trips a day. Most sacks wind up at the Chinese market and warehouse, a labyrinth of rusting metal shipping containers dubbed the Field of Miracles, after the Russian knockoff of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" 
"The trade is going pretty well now, but economically, the situation is pretty weak here," said Chen Zelin, who rents one of the shipping containers. "For me, it's bad because a lot of Chinese are coming here. Competition's increasing. But I think it's good for the Russians, because they make money, too." 
Russians do make money. Zabaikalsk's finest homes, in a dirt-road subdivision nicknamed Santa Barbara, belong -- tellingly -- to local customs officers. But the money has not flowed to where it is most needed: infrastructure and workers, and even if the infrastructure is built to support greater trade and the economy revives, few Russians seem willing to move here. 
The only group that is willing, it would seem, is the one already close by: the Chinese. 
In Chita, the ramshackle 313,000-person capital of the Russian region of the same name, the economy is hardly brisk. But two Chinese construction companies are busily renovating a government building and a hotel, and putting up apartments and even a bowling alley. 
"To say we don't have our own construction workers isn't quite right. It's a matter of business," said Aleksandr Novastinsev, the deputy governor for foreign trade in the Chita region. "The Chinese do high quality work. And it's quite cheap." 
A five-story hotel near downtown is crammed with Chinese traders, three, four and more to a room. Its six-room basement harbors 50 Chinese construction workers -- "but they're big rooms," one explained cheerfully. 
In an adjacent warehouse that houses one of Chita city's Chinese markets -- there are three -- 40-year-old Gao Min sells brassieres and women's tops, a far cry from her last job at a food stand in Tsitsihar, a northeast China metropolis. She arrived here in 1994 on a tourist visa. Her husband followed in 1995, and their teenage son in 1998. The three of them pay about $160 a month to live in one of the hotel's biggest rooms -- an 8-by-12 foot cubicle with two daybeds, communal kitchen access and a ceiling-high stack of portable stereos. 
"There's a lot more opportunity to earn money here," Ms. Gao said. "We go back quite often, and we come back either according to our tourist visas or my husband's commercial passport." 
Asked how long the family would stay, she said only: "We haven't decided yet. We'll see."

TV Benefit Audience Surpasses Oscars

 BODY:
Almost 90 million people watched at least some of a star-filled telecast on Friday night to raise money for injured victims and the families of people killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
 Barbara Brogliatti, a spokeswoman for the event, said yesterday that there was no estimate on how much money was raised and that there would not be one until at least tomorrow. 
The money is for a fund established by the major broadcast networks, which would be administered by the United Way under the guidance of a board of broadcast network representatives. 
 The Nielsen Media Research audience measurement service said 89 million people watched the telecast for at least six minutes. At any given time, Nielsen said, the telecast had an audience of 59 million people.
The audience was far higher than that of the Academy Awards show in March, watched by 43 million people, but not as large as that of President Bush's speech on Thursday, watched by an average audience of 82 million people.
Called "America: A Tribute to Heroes," the telecast was the most widely carried program ever shown, available on more than 30 national networks.
The telecast featured celebrities like Jack Nicholson and Julia Roberts and had no commercials. Ms. Brogliatti said the costs of the event were low because nearly every aspect of the production was donated.

Lifelines to Home, Severed in an Instant

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
A man making his usual breakfast deliveries up and down the twin towers was the sole breadwinner for six of his relatives in a farming village in Morelos, Mexico.
 An information technology specialist from Rockland County was the anchor to whom poor distant cousins in a rain-drenched village in Bangladesh still turned in times of need. 
 A single mother in Jackson Heights, Queens, who cleaned the suites of an international money management firm scrimped so her nieces in Colombia could eat.
The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center has not only left families across the New York area in dire straits, both emotional and economic, it has taken away men and women who were lifelines for needy families and impoverished towns halfway across the world. 
Some of them wired money home as soon as they cashed their paychecks. When the well ran dry back home, they were the ones who covered college tuitions or pitched in for a cousin's wedding. They sent home blenders and television sets and sneakers for their children. Some of them were the human tugboats for their communities -- the first in their families to migrate, the ones to help friends and relatives gain a foothold later in the new land.
Beyond the dead and the disappeared, there are those who are now blind, burned, maimed or jobless. A great many of them have relatives who depended, in varying degrees, on the dollars they sent home.
"They had this line of money every week, every 15 days," said Brother Joel Magallan, a Jesuit who runs Asociacion Tepeyac, an advocacy group for Mexican immigrants. "Now they know they are not receiving anything from the United States, from New York City."
His observations could hold true for families in Bangladesh or the Dominican Republic or Ecuador -- any one of the poorest corners of the third world, where prosperity, and sometimes survival, depends on remittances from relatives abroad.
A State Department spokeswoman, Susan Pittman, said on Friday that citizens of 79 countries were among the trade center victims. According to the mayor's office, they included 91 Indians, 35 Dominicans and 15 Colombians, though those numbers may fluctuate. Consular officials from around the world have spent the last week making arrangements for family members to travel to New York to offer DNA samples and fill out paperwork.
When the trade center collapsed, Juan Ortega Campos, 32, was still paying off his passage fee from Mexico -- $100 every month -- from what he earned as a deliveryman for Fine & Schapiro, a deli on the concourse under the twin towers.
Some weeks, the tips were good; some weeks they weren't. But no matter what they were, Mr. Campos's routine was the same, said Miguel Garcia, his childhood friend and his roommate. Every two weeks, he wired money home to his wife, Luz Maria -- sometimes $500, sometimes more. Every few weeks, he picked up something for his children: a book, a toy, a pair of shoes.
All told, Mr. Campos supported six people back home in Jonacatepec, a farming village in Morelos: his mother, his mentally ill brother, his wife and their three children -- two boys, 13 and 11, and a girl, 8. He had no intention of staying here forever, Mr. Garcia said. Mr. Campos was setting aside some money to build a house back in Morelos. He called home every Monday and Saturday.
The last time was the night before the attack; he told his wife he was coming down with a cold, and she urged him to buy some Theraflu. "He was a very responsible parent," Mr. Garcia said of his friend. "He was the only one who worked. He used to work for everybody."
That is why, Mr. Garcia said, he helped his friend make the trip here. 
Mr. Garcia's task now was to pick up Luz Maria Campos at Kennedy International Airport and take her to the Family Assistance Center to fill out the proper paperwork.
Gloria Nieves, the youngest of 10 siblings, was the first to leave Cali, Colombia, for the good life here, said her 15-year-old son, Christian Reyes. The good life turned out to be a job cleaning the offices of Fiduciary Trust. It was a boon for many others: nieces, to whom she sent money back home; a sister she helped bring here; even a friend's relatives, for whom the first stop was Ms. Nieves's Jackson Heights apartment.
Ms. Nieves wanted her son to have a different life. She had goaded him into enrolling in a high school where he could take a specialized computer class. "She wanted me, of all things in the world, to become a network administrator," Christian recalled. "To have money and stuff."
Mohammed Shajahan, born and raised in Asadpur, a village in the wet, marshy southeastern corner of Bangladesh, was also the first in his family to make the trek to New York. He studied computer science at Pace University, ran a convenience store and worked his way up to a well-paying job as an information technology specialist at Marsh & McLennan.
Year by year, Mohammed and Mona Shajahan's family grew in Spring Valley, N.Y. Mr. Shajahan, 41, helped two brothers immigrate here, one from Bangladesh, another who had been working in the Middle East. He became a generous, stalwart member of the Rockland County mosque. He brought visiting relatives to the twin towers.
But his home never quite left him. There was always someone in the village -- a distant relative, a friend of the family -- who needed his help, his sister-in-law, Ruby Zigrino, said. For them, Mr. Shajahan was a source of sustenance. She guessed it was driven partly by his faith.
He took seriously the notion of zakat -- the Islamic mandate to give alms to the poor. "He was a very simple, very decent man, a generous man," Ms. Zigrino said. He planned to take his four children -- the eldest, 8, the youngest, 3 -- back home to Asadpur soon.

DICKEY, JOSEPH DERMOT, JR.

 BODY:
 DICKEY-Joseph Dermot, Jr. Loving husband of Irene, devoted father of Joseph and Elizabeth, treasured brother of William and Walter and their families, and beloved nephew of Isabelle Lawson and Eileen McPeake died on Tuesday, September 11, 2001 in the World Trade Center tragedy. Joe, the son of Irish immigrants, grew up in the Bronx where he attended Fordham Prep High School. He graduated from The University of Wisconsin in 1972 and received an MBA from SUNY Binghamton. Over the past twenty years, Joe worked tirelessly to build a successful career on Wall Street. At the time of his death, Joe was a Managing Director of Cantor Fitzgerald, working in the Interest Rate Swaps department. He was on the 105th Floor of Tower 1, directly above where the first plane hit. Honest almost to a fault, generous and kind, Joe was greatly admired and respected by all who knew him. He was an eternal optimist and had an unforgettable passion for life. But Joe always measured his own success on how good he was to his family. And he was an exceptional husband and father. He taught them to embrace life, take on new challenges and to love the outdoors as much as he did. In their early years together, Joe introduced Irene to the city and took her on long strolls in Central Park. On Fire Island, Joe taught his children how to swim out past the break, how to stay on top and out in front of the ocean's barrels. 
He coached his children's basketball teams, sat proudly on the sidelines at Joseph's crew regattas, and never missed an opportunity to play the back nine with Elizabeth. A savvy New York sports fan, Joe took the kids to see the Knicks, Rangers and Yanks, and enjoyed catching the Wisconsin Badgers on TV and talking sports with those around him. Although Joe has been taken from us all far sooner than we were ready to give him up, the whole family feels blessed to have had him in our lives. His smile and laugh will remain with us forever. Please join the family on Friday, September 28th to remember and celebrate the extraordinary life of Joseph Dermot Dickey, Jr. A memorial service will be held at 10:30AM at St. Mary's Church in Manhasset, followed by lunch at Leo's, a local restaurant. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests a contribution in the memory of Joseph D. Dickey, Jr. to the families of the New York fire fighters who lost their lives trying to save our Joe and countless others. UFA Widows' and Children's Fund: 204 East 23rd Street, NY, NY 10010.

RUDIN, LEWIS

 BODY:
RUDIN-Lewis, 74 years old of New York City, co-chairman of Rudin Management Company, Inc. and Chairman of the Association for a Better New York.

Morton's Foresees a Loss

BYLINE:  By Warren Strugatch

 BODY:
 Morton's Restaurant Group (NYSE: MRG) of New Hyde Park said that revenues at its Morton's of Chicago steakhouse chain dropped more than 10 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same quarter last year, ending a decade of continuous quarterly revenue growth. 
 The company attributed the diminished revenues to cuts in corporate spending, reduced business travel and the continuing impact of the national economic slowdown. The company repeated an earlier warning that it expected to report a loss for the third quarter, which ends Sept. 30.

Defiantly, TheStreet Retakes The Street

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
FOR many Manhattan bankers, brokers and lawyers who returned to work last week, the mission was to show the world they had not been stopped.
 Markets may have plummeted after the New York Stock Exchange reopened on Monday -- and throughout the week -- but denizens of Wall Street voiced a defiant determination to keep on doing what they had done before, only more successfully. 
 Many said they felt the attack that destroyed the World Trade Center was aimed at them, not just because it killed relatives, friends and colleagues, but because it seemed to seek to destroy their way of life.
"I'll be damned if I'm going to allow anybody to put us out of business or succeed in perpetrating terror," Joel Simon, a partner in Serko & Simon, recalled telling a colleague last week. The offices of Serko & Simon, a small law firm, were on the 33rd floor of 1 World Trade Center, but all lawyers and the rest of the staff escaped. 
"We're just anxious to do what we've done for all these years," Mr. Simon said in an interview last week from the law offices of Baker & Hostetler, which has provided Serko & Simon with temporary space. "That is the sense that I get from what's going on in New York these days."
Another investment banker, who did not want to be identified because he was working on a transaction, said, "We're doing deals, and we're going to keep doing deals."
By going back to work and continuing to buy and sell stocks, to negotiate and seal mergers and to find credit for corporate clients, the investment bankers and lawyers say they can best show the world that if the intent of the attack was to shut them down, then it had failed.
"That's the contribution I can make here," said Greg Fleming, head of the financial institutions group at Merrill Lynch. "A lot of the people on Wall Street aren't the people who are going to be part of some military response."
Mr. Fleming said that even in the aftermath of the attack, some investment bankers he supervises were ready to hop back on airplanes to meet with clients as necessary. So many staff members wanted to work at the firm's temporary offices in Midtown that their shifts had to be staggered -- the new office space was not big enough to hold everyone at the same time, he said.
The firm offered some evidence that bankers' determination was bearing some fruit: On Wednesday, Merrill Lynch underwrote the sale of $600 million in bonds for Canadian National Railway. The firm is also serving as financial adviser to RWE in its acquisition of American Waterworks, an $8 billion deal announced on Tuesday.
SO strong was the impulse to respond to the disaster, both to help and to send a message that Wall Street was still ticking, that Elizabeth T. Davy, a lawyer, left her 6-week-old daughter, Lily, and 3-year-old son, Colin, with a baby sitter and headed in to the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell on the Monday after the attack -- even though she was on maternity leave.
"That's the Wall Street way," Ms. Davy said. "I just trooped in there."
At J. P. Morgan, the investment banking arm of J. P. Morgan Chase, software and systems employees worked nearly 24 consecutive hours after the attack to get computer equipment running, said Geoff Boisi, co-chief executive of the firm. They switched to 12-hour shifts the second day after the attack, he said, and on Monday the volume of stocks traded was double anything the firm had ever handled.
The firm has closed deals even in the current hostile market environment thanks to the anger felt by many bankers, Mr. Boisi said.
But it is more than defiance, several Wall Streeters said. On trading floors and in conference rooms, there is a new esprit de corps, a feeling that everyone is, in the big picture, on the same side.
That attitude was reflected in displays of kindness, a little less of the hardheaded, take-no-prisoners attitude associated with doing deals, said Kenneth A. Lefkowitz, co-chairman of the mergers and acquisitions group at Hughes Hubbard & Reed. 
"Negotiations have been much more friendly," he said. "There's usually a certain back and forth; sometimes deals are collegial, but other times there are real discussions and there's some bitterness."
Last week, a lawyer negotiating a deal with him called and left a message wishing Mr. Lefkowitz a happy new year on Rosh Hashana. The same lawyer, he said, had been far more adversarial earlier.

HEADLINE: Gossip Holds Its Tongue 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
TWO nights after the attack on the World Trade Center, Harrison Ford walked into Da Silvano, a favorite restaurant in Greenwich Village, with a woman on each arm. Mr. Ford has been a constant source of celebrity gossip because of his separation from his wife of 18 years. But what would have turned heads two weeks ago went totally unremarked.
 Sarah Jessica Parker, the siren of HBO's "Sex and the City," walked by the restaurant. No one blinked, said Silvano Marchetto, the restaurant's owner. 
 But a firetruck -- now, that was something to behold. 
As one slowed to a stop nearby, diners rose in a wave through the restaurant and its patios, clapping and whistling. The firefighters nodded solemnly as the truck drove past. Only then did the room begin to buzz with conversation. 
New Yorkers, jaded by celebrity, seem thoroughly tired of it for now. They are also shrugging off the industry that both sustains celebrity and feeds off it: gossip, as natural a part of New York as designer martinis and trophy wives. In the days immediately after the attack, the city's professional tattletales fell appropriately silent. The New York Post's most popular column, Page Six, by Richard Johnson, failed to appear for the first time in 25 years. And in a chastened statement, the eminent Liz Smith, whose syndicated column also appears in The Post and about 70 other newspapers, complained to readers of the trivial nature of her work at such a time. "I want to go somewhere and volunteer," she wrote. "To hell with gossip and entertainment."
Now the columns have hesitantly come back to life, but their bark is much diminished, both in terms of column inches and the viciousness of their tone. 
For 12 days, at least, columnists folded the tents they have long propped up so gaudily with speculation about which teenage star had breast implants and whose marriage of convenience was falling apart.
David P. Columbia, the editor in chief of both Quest magazine and of NewYork SocialDiary.com, a daily posting of Manhattan gossip, said he expects the genre to continue, but in a subdued (translation: boring) form for a while. "The real viciousness and sniping that has been going on for so long, that coy 'letting people have it and passing judgment,' that has been frozen for a while," Mr. Columbia said. "I think this has cleaned up our consciousness a bit." He added: "I don't know how long it will last but I hope it has some permanent effects." 
What happens to Anne Heche's alternate universes? And what of the episode the columns called "L'Affaire Grubman"? From Swifty's on the Upper East Side to Della Femina in the Hamptons, people seem embarrassed that they ever cared enough to read about it. 
"We all seem so superficial to have ever cared," said a woman whose name often appears in gossip columns and asked that it not be used. "It all seems shameful and stupid, that we had such tiny lives." 
Columnists and editors predict that the greasy wheel of gossip will turn again, of course, if only to serve as a distraction. But the immediate effect of Sept. 11 is a new, genial tone, and the Daily News columnist Mitchell Fink, Richard Johnson of The New York Post and MSNBC's Jeannette Walls said they have received fewer anonymous finger-pointing phone calls. The content often focuses on the budding generation of celebrities produced by the events of Sept. 11: Page Six' Sightings columns noted "Mayor Giuliani getting a standing ovation from everyone in Fresco's."
Linda Ashland, a former editor at Town & Country, said that she still reads the gossip columns but is more interested in the lives of real people. "I couldn't care less about celebrities," she said. "But I'm still reading all the columns. It's a part of life in New York." 
In The Post, the Page Six column was moved to the back of the paper after the disaster. By last Wednesday it had inched forward, although as of Friday it had not yet reached its standard slot, on Page 8. 
At first "the sheer gravity and weight of the story moved gossip toward the back of the paper, Col Allan, The Post's editor in chief, said on Thursday. "But in the last couple of days we have moved it forward because the paper is a destination for people who want to read gossip. So it has to have a significant position in the newspaper." 
Gossip's significant position in New York culture stems from its ability to separate the insiders from the outsiders, said Leo Braudy, a historian and the author of "The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and Its History" (Replica, 1996). 
Gossip, he added, is also a useful way to bring the rich and famous down a notch. People spread it to demonstrate the knowledge they have that others do not, and depend on it to humanize the famous, who appear impossibly distant and perfect. Now that the rich are just as vulnerable as everyone else, gossip about them has lost its punch. 
"Are you helping the world by passing on gossip and wondering who a better sexual partner for Anne Heche is?" he asked. "No. But I don't think the events have changed celebrity and gossip forever. I can only hope it gives us a sense of proportion. This is the fall. A fall of innocence. A fall into a different kind of awareness." 
Carol Wallace, the managing editor of People magazine, spent Friday morning with staff members, discussing how to move with sensitivity back into the celebrity grind. 
But this time with a difference: when a publicist called her last week, pitching a story that might have flown three weeks ago, about the wife of a famous actor and her battle with irritable bowel syndrome, Ms. Wallace turned the story down. 
"We're going to hold off on stories like that, I would think," she said. "The news right now is not pretty and it's not happy. Is some frothy, silly celebrity story going to appear in People magazine again? Yes. But we'll ease back into it." 
Though it's hard to draw parallels with the glory days of gossip, the 1940's (origin of canoodling and leggy starlets), once the United States entered the second world war, gossip columnists stopped training their sights on Hollywood and focused on the enemy. Walter Winchell, who started his career scooping the theater world, became such an influential voice during the war that Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked that he be excused from serving in the Navy so that he could continue writing his anti-Nazi columns. 
Celebrities similarly looked for ways to express their patriotism. Unlike today, many mingled comfortably with their admirers. "Jack Benny and Bob Hope were entertaining the troops, and you could go to the Hollywood Canteen and dance with a starlet so long as you were a man in uniform," Mr. Braudy said. "There was not the sense that they necessarily lived in this rarefied world." 
The fate of celebrities today may be determined by how the public perceives their responses in coming weeks, or how their image custodians counsel them, said Mr. Fink of The Daily News. 
"Who knows about someone like Pamela Anderson Lee?" Mr. Fink said. "She could lead a war bond drive. I just don't know."
Ms. Walls, the gossip correspondent for MSNBC, said that celebrities would be expected to play different roles in the culture now. "They have the ability to create a great sense of unity," Ms. Walls said, noting the large number of stars who were gathering for Friday's celebrity telethon benefiting the victims of the attack.
Mr. Johnson, whose typical recent items have included an upbeat report on prominent actors in a benefit performance to help children face the tragedy and an item titled "Bloomberg to the Rescue," about the mayoral candidate Michael Bloomberg's disaster relief efforts, said he was not sure how long all the goodwill would last. (Nanoseconds, apparently. He has already sharpened his tongue, calling Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani "a big star who's about to be unemployed.")
Even with the new spic-and-span intentions, some of the publicity pitches Mr. Johnson was hearing were the same-old, same-old.
"There was a total silence for a few days from the professional public relations people who normally try to feed the column," he said. "Then it picked right back up again." He turned down one "salute" -- he hung verbal quotation marks around the word -- to the spirit of New York, sponsored by a onetime Warhol-crowd icon. "It's at some sleazy discotheque," he said. "Yech." 
Leslee Dart, a public relations executive at PMK, who manages the public's perception of celebrities like Tom Hanks and Woody Allen, is confident that celebrities will survive, and that the gossip machine will bounce back to nurture or punish them. 
"The general gossip stuff is not going to be of much interest right now, but it will come back right to where it once was," she said. As far as celebrities, "we have canonized them," she said. "We have as a culture gone so far off the deep end I think we have no choice but to go right back to where we were."

HEADLINE: Dazed Companies Sit on Their Wallets 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
FOR the first time in 15 years, the England brothers have decided that their family-owned trucking company, C.R. England Inc., will not expand its fleet of 2,500 tractor-trailers. "After the terrorism," Dean England said, "nothing will entice us."
 Manpower Inc., the nation's largest supplier of temporary workers, canceled plans to open 40 new offices in response to the attacks on Sept. 11. "We were expecting a short recession -- over by March," said Jeffrey Joerres, the chief executive. "Our new horizon is next September." 
 Eastman Chemical, one of the nation's largest suppliers of material for plastics and paint, has not yet experienced a drop in orders, but expansion is delayed. "Any investment that was planned is at the very least postponed," said Earnest W. Davenport Jr., the chairman. 
American business, already pulling back as the economy weakened, is now cutting back even more, freezing the investment in new buildings and equipment that had contributed so much to the prosperity of the late 1990's.
Analysts are just beginning to notice the cutbacks. In the days after the terrorist attacks, they had focused on consumers, who curtailed spending immediately. Consumers appear to be gradually returning to more normal shopping habits, although they continue to be cautious about big purchases like cars and homes and extra spending on family outings.
Business, however, has moved in the opposite direction, and its retreat seems to be gaining momentum. The slowdown that hit the nation more than a year ago came mostly from a sharp cutback in business investment, not consumer spending. Now, thousands of companies, simply by waiting or avoiding additional investment, appear to be pushing the economy more deeply into a recession. 
Moreover, as the companies hit hardest -- airlines and aircraft makers, hotels and convention centers, computer manufacturers and car dealers -- lay off tens of thousands of workers, the damage to the economy will spread.
"In autos, in steel, in electronics, in farm equipment, in airlines -- everywhere -- business executives are too uncertain to go forward," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of DRI-WEFA, an economic consulting and forecasting service in Lexington, Mass.
Among forecasters, there is little doubt that the economy is shrinking. The discussion has switched to how long a recession will last and how steep it will be. Like most of the nation's forecasters, Mr. Behravesh has reversed his prediction that the economy would start improving in the second half of the year. Instead, he, like many others, now expects a slump to last at least through spring.
Uncertainty is overwhelming the economy in ways rarely experienced in the United States. David Collander, an economic historian at Middlebury College, says that companies are used to dealing with risks, but that the response to terrorist attacks goes beyond the normal range of economic theory. "The only thing economists and forecasters can do," he said, "is follow along and see what happens."
For the moment, the uncertainty has caused executives to delay investments until they have answers to some difficult questions: Will there be more acts of terrorism? What form will American retaliation take? Will consumers here and abroad adopt a bunker mentality?
Those concerns were evident in interviews last week with business managers across the country. The reaction, Mr. Collander said, is similar to corporate behavior during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. That crisis and the uncertainty it generated hurt the economy, but the fear that the world was on the brink of nuclear confrontation lasted less than three weeks. The current crisis is open-ended.
When the uncertainty lifts, or corporate executives learn how to live with it, then the economy may come back stronger than ever, rebounding from the sharp decline in part because Washington is moving aggressively to cut interest rates and to expand federal spending.
For the moment, however, caution rules, even among companies that expect to benefit from the new atmosphere.
Allen J. Lauer, chief executive at Varian Inc., based in San Mateo, Calif., has divided the future into short term and long term. For the next three or four months, Mr. Lauer says, Varian, which makes instruments and vacuum pumps used in manufacturing high-technology equipment, will be cautious about how much it invests and how many employees it adds. 
Longer term, Mr. Lauer said he was counting on "a shot from stepped-up federal spending for weapons." Military contractors are big purchasers of Varian's products.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was similarly optimistic on Thursday. "For the longer term," he told the Senate Banking Committee, "prospects for continued rapid technological advance and associated faster productivity growth are scarcely diminished."
A few companies see their operations as immune, even if uncertainty endures. Hospital companies fall into this category. "We will be continuing with a number of major capital expansions" to meet the needs of aging baby boomers, said Harry Anderson, a spokesman for Tenet Health Care, in Santa Barbara, Calif., which owns or runs 114 hospitals.
Wal-Mart displayed a similar spirit, going ahead with the opening of a new supercenter last week in Union, N.J., across the river from Lower Manhattan and within view of the ruins of the World Trade Center. 
"We are sticking with our expansion plans," a Wal-Mart executive said. "Sales have bounced back from last week."
But Manpower, based in Milwaukee; Eastman Chemical, in Kingsport, Tenn.; and C.R. England, operating out of Salt Lake City, are more representative of the new cautiousness chipping away at the economy.
So are small thriving companies like Burrelle's Information Services, which clips media references for corporate clients. It was about to expand two offices in Maine, adding to the 780 employees there. "We won't do that now," said Robert Waggoner, the chief executive of the company, which is based in Livingston, N.J.
Summarizing conference calls last week with several chief executives, Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said, "The freeze is on new capital investment, hiring and nonessential travel." For most companies, "it is a freeze, not a downsizing," he said. "Because of the emergency nature of the situation, you really want to avoid any new commitment."
Some companies are facing a more immediate crisis. Airlines, forced to cut back flights until more people are ready to fly again, have announced that they will eliminate 79,000 jobs, almost 12 percent of total employment.
The ripple effect is much worse, said David A. Swierenga, chief economist of the Air Transport Association. For every airline job that is lost, six or seven jobs disappear in related industries. These include, he said, "people who work in airports, at travel agencies, for aircraft manufacturers, hotels, resorts, Disneyland-like amusement centers."
THE terrorism has also jolted home builders, whose energetic activities have been, until now, a mainstay of the economy. Although new construction starts on single-family homes fell in August, they are still above the levels a year ago. That is mainly because builders, until Sept. 11, had been willing to build houses they have not sold in advance.
These "speculative starts" represent more than 30 percent of new single-family construction, according to the National Association of Home Builders. "Now some builders are telling us they will discontinue spec starts," said Michael Carliner, the association's vice president.
Centex Homes, based in Dallas and one of the nation's largest home builders, was already moving in this direction. Of the 22,000 houses that the company expected to build in its current fiscal year, only about 2,000 -- one month's supply at its current sales pace -- will be built on spec.
"If our perception is correct that sales will come down in the wake of what happened last week," said Lawrence Hirsh, Centex's chief executive, "then one month of unsold homes can quickly become two months. We are going to become more careful in our construction and sales."

HEADLINE: Suddenly, the Magic Is in Short Supply 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT with SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
ONE are the Mickey T-shirts and the Pooh paraphernalia. After the terrorist attack on New York, Disney stores in Manhattan swapped the colorful merchandise that usually fills their display windows for huge posters quoting the company's founder, Walt Disney: "Tomorrow will be better for as long as America keeps alive the ideals of freedom and a better life."
 Tomorrow may not be better, however, for the Walt Disney Company. Like many other companies, it faces the likelihood that the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon will cause a slowing economy to come to a stop. Public anxiety about further attacks and military reprisals is keeping people at home, with their wallets closed. 
 Not all businesses will be hurt to the same degree, but the evidence so far is that companies that rely on travel, advertising and retailing are in for a particularly rough time. Disney, because of its heavy investment in theme parks and hotels as well as broadcast and cable television, faces more uncertainty than its competitors. 
At the Epcot Center near Orlando, Fla., for example, acres of parking lots sit almost empty, as does Main Street at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. Advertisers are reluctant to buy television time while the nation's consumers are preoccupied by the prospect of war. And thousands of prints of "Big Trouble," a movie that Disney had expected to be a big hit, are in storage because the plot involves a bomb in a suitcase on a plane.
That explains in part why Disney's stock has slid 38.2 percent this year, to close at $17.89 on Friday, a larger decline than any of its big-media rivals. Even before the disaster, Disney was having problems, and the terror attacks only made them worse.
"Disney has been hit the hardest of the media companies due not only to its advertising exposure but the impact that safety concerns have had on park attendance," said Scott Davis, a media analyst at First Union Securities.
Adding to the company's concerns, the Bass family of Texas on Thursday had to sell $2 billion of Disney stock -- almost 6 percent of the total -- to cover its losses on telecommunications stocks. The sale has diluted the influence of the staunchest supporters of Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman, and put ownership of a flood of company stock in diverse hands. That is likely to increase speculation of a possible takeover, analysts said.
"It never even crossed my mind about getting taken over," Mr. Eisner said in a telephone interview on Friday.
More than half of Disney's revenue comes from businesses that depend on travel, including theme parks and cruises, or on advertising -- the two parts of the entertainment business that appear most threatened. The comparable figure for AOL Time Warner, by comparison, is about 25 percent.
Tourism is even more important for Disney's profits than it is for the company's revenue. The theme parks and resorts segment accounted for about half of the entire company's $1.12 billion in operating profit in the last quarter. Analysts said they think the resorts business is the unit most vulnerable to a slowdown.
Last year, Disney made a $920 million profit on $25.4 billion in revenue.
FACED with further potential declines, Disney, like so many other mainstays of corporate America, is simply trying to cope. But there is only so much to be done. On Thursday evening, after news of the Bass sale had roiled Wall Street, Mr. Eisner issued a statement acknowledging that the terror attacks had hurt the company's retail outlets, theme parks and resorts. But, he added, "as the nation slowly regains its equilibrium, so does Disney."
Disney's president, Robert A. Iger, said he believed that "it is too soon to judge the events which were previously unthinkable."
"Clearly there was an impact," he said, "but we don't think it should be used as a bellwether of what is to come. We believe that our businesses are resilient."
Mr. Eisner declined to quantify the company's near-term costs as a result of the attacks, including a loss of television advertising revenue. But he said, "I am an optimistic person by nature and that has not been knocked out of me by this."
In the past, he added, gasoline shortages, recession and other problems that have cut attendance have created "enormous" pent-up demand. "If we have a couple of months where fear holds people home, by the time that has subsided, the demand for our products is always greater than anything we had anticipated," he said.
Right now, however, Disney's distress stems from its commitment to theme parks, a commitment that rewarded the company handsomely when the economy was booming and Americans were eager to spend. Even as other big entertainment companies got out of the business -- Time Warner and its partners, for instance, sold the Six Flags chain to Premier Parks Inc. in 1998 for $965 million -- Disney doubled down, building new properties. For good reason, perhaps, the company has always seen its parks as an invaluable conduit for building lifelong loyalty and identification with Disney characters.
But as a result of higher fuel prices and the slowing economy, attendance at Disney's parks was already stagnating this year. In particular, its new California Adventure park in Anaheim, which opened in February, has not attracted as many visitors as analysts had expected.
NOW fears of more terrorist attacks are halting skittish travelers. As unthreatening as Mickey, Pooh and other Disney characters may be, many potential customers these days are finding home even more comfortable.
To be sure, some strong-minded tourists are exhibiting a defiant attitude and keeping scheduled visits. Kelly Gurick, of Blackwood, N.J., for example, was on her 25th visit to a Disney park. "I was a little nervous about getting on an airplane," she said, but she was determined not to be intimidated by terrorists. "I paid so much money, and they are not going to ruin my vacation," she said.
But terrorists are apparently ruining the vacations of many others. Disney does not release attendance figures for its parks, but one employee who spoke on condition of anonymity estimated that they were receiving only half the usual number of visitors. One tourist, Robin Senecal, 37, an interior designer who was born in Canada and has lived in New Zealand for 10 years, said she had never seen a theme park as empty as Disneyland when she visited last week. "The shops are almost empty," she said. "It's almost creepy."
Paul Pressler, who heads the theme parks and cruises business, said that visitors had been postponing rather than canceling visits, and that there had been some rebound since the tragedy.
The theme parks have security strategies in place, though Disney itself understandably tries to play down any possibility of violence, for fear it will frighten visitors. "There are plans for hurricanes and terrorism," said John Dreyer, a company spokesman. "When it is appropriate, we immediately put those plans into place. But there are some we prefer not to talk about."
Renae Callahan, a Disney spokesman, said that security had been increased at the parks, and that there were more uniformed guards than in previous months, with systematic searches of visitor bags and purses at entry points.
There is also the repeated assurance that Disney's parks have survived the downturns in travel after the Persian Gulf war and the California earthquakes and have always come back.
Others agree, as long as the parks are not directly affected. "The worst horrible nightmare that any theme park company has is that there will be some acts of violence," said Sidney Sheinberg, who was president of MCA Inc., which owned Universal Theme Parks in the 1990's. "Violence can destroy your friendliness to the public."
To cope with the financial problem at hand, Disney is trying to cut costs. At the Orlando parks -- Walt Disney World, Epcot, Disney-MGM Studios and Disney's Animal Kingdom -- 40,000 hourly workers have had their work weeks cut. Overtime has been eliminated and operating hours have been shortened. The Magic Kingdom is losing its magic after 7 p.m. instead of its usual 9 p.m.
At Disneyland, hot-dog stands, often reduced during off-peak periods, have been eliminated because there are not enough customers. 
But cost-cutting can help only so much at a company like Disney, because many costs at its theme parks are largely fixed. The company can dismiss some employees, but not too many or it risks corrupting what it calls the "Disney experience." And the parks cannot simply cut back on rides when business slows because guests pay for all of the attractions whether or not the park is packed. And whether a roller coaster is 80 percent full or 30 percent full, it costs about the same to operate and maintain -- especially for Disney, which prides itself on delivering a top-notch experience to each guest.
"When attendance is rising, Disney's business works terrifically because they are putting so many people through the theme parks, and they don't have to spend any extra money," said one veteran media executive familiar with Disney. "But it runs into problems when attendance drops, because they are stuck with those same costs.
"There is simply no way to calibrate supply and demand," he added. "It's not like a car company, where you can close a plant."
As a result, "the largest challenge, which is not controllable, is how fast the tourism volume comes back," said Richard A. Bilotti, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley. A comeback may be more difficult for Walt Disney World than for Disneyland, he said, because about half the people who go to Disney World arrive there by plane, and travelers so far seem reluctant to fly.
If one assumes that families will stay away from the theme parks in rough times, they may prefer to cuddle up around videos at home. That should benefit Disney, with its roster of evergreen animated hits like "Pinocchio" and "Alice in Wonderland." Next month, Disney will reissue "Snow White" on video.
But Disney cannot just saturate the market with re-releases. "Films cannibalize each other," Mr. Dreyer, the company spokesman, said, with each movie stealing a part of the audience from all others. Most of the classic collection is in constant release. There are 10 big titles, like "Cinderella," that the company re-releases on a staggered basis with great promotion. And "Atlantis," its animated adventure movie, is scheduled to come out on video this year.
In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, Disney has not stormed the video charts. In the week ended Sept. 16, Disney had one movie among the top 10 video rentals, one among the 10 best-selling videos and none among the 10 best-selling DVD's, according to Videobusiness.com, an industry Web site. Meanwhile, it has yanked "Big Trouble" from release for the foreseeable future. Though Mr. Dreyer said that decision would not cost much money, Disney has tied up millions of dollars of capital that is not generating any revenue.
At the same time, it borrowed $1 billion last week in a bond offering that it used in part to buy back some of the Bass stake. Disney now has $16 billion in debt, a larger load than it has ever previously carried.
Compounding the company's problems, the advertising market has softened considerably. About one-quarter of Disney's revenue comes from advertising, mostly through the ABC television network and the company's other broadcast and cable networks, including ESPN.
With the dot-com collapse and the general cooling of the economy, the advertising market has been lukewarm at best all year. Now, it is getting positively chilly.
"The problem is uncertainty," said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. "Advertisers don't know quite how to deal with it. So instead of saying something that might come across badly and would leave a poor impression with consumers, they say nothing. Or they say that if consumers are not ready to buy, then why advertise?"
Mr. Bilotti of Morgan Stanley said he had been estimating that advertising revenue at the big four broadcast networks would grow by 2 percent this year. In the current environment, he said, he had revised that estimate to a 3 percent decline. For cable networks, he changed his estimate from 3 percent growth to a 5 percent decline.
The company is trying to turn the bad news into in-house marketing, using some unsold air time on its network, TV and radio stations to promote its parks, stores and films.
Disney's problems are worsened by the fact that ratings at ABC have tailed off badly as "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" has become more routine. The wild early success of that program may have even distracted ABC from developing new hits, according to analysts. Disney's premier cable channel, ESPN, is growing strongly, meanwhile, but may face difficulty in the future as overall viewing of sports declines.
Much like the theme parks, the network cannot simply cut costs without reducing the quality of the programs. "You cannot simply slash hours of prime-time programming," said a media executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.
THERE is less pressure to cut costs in cable programming because a portion of the revenue comes from subscriber fees. But at some of its networks, Disney is under heavy pressure to build revenue. Last August, it committed $5.3 billion to buy Fox Family Worldwide: $3.2 billion in cash and the assumption of $2.1 billion in debt. At the time, the purchase of the company, which owns Fox Family Channel, was considered very expensive at 35 times this year's $150 million in anticipated cash flow. Now, with the ad market even weaker, it has become that much harder to raise revenue and justify the purchase of the service.
That puts an even greater burden on Mr. Eisner to justify a strategy of sticking with programming assets, and buying at least some of them at high multiples. For chief executives like Mr. Eisner, who faced troubling economics at their own companies even before the World Trade Center debacle, managing out of this crisis will prove an exhausting task.

HEADLINE: Failed Disney Vision: Integrated City 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

DATELINE: CELEBRATION, Fla. 

 BODY:
Seven years ago, when the Walt Disney Company transformed the wetlands here into a suburb, executives promised to do their best to ensure that this planned community would not become as racially homogenous as many other towns. 
 To do that, the company placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines that catered to blacks and Hispanics, printed brochures featuring minority members and held a lottery for homes to ensure that developers could not discriminate based on race. Those efforts have been a failure. Even Disney officials say so. 
 The 2000 census numbers released this year say it all: the 2,376-resident community is 88 percent white in a county that is only 59 percent white; it is 1 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic in a county that is 6 percent black and 29 percent Hispanic. 
Immediately surrounding Celebration are neighborhoods and towns made up largely of black and Hispanic residents. This has placed Disney in the difficult position of having to defend its municipal creation. More than that, Celebration, just a few miles south of Walt Disney World, has become an example of a trend away from integration that social demographers say only became evident with an analysis of the census.
Diversity was an ambitious goal, said Peter O. Muller, an urban geographer at the University of Miami who has studied Celebration and cites it is an example of how people are increasingly seeking comfort in others who look like themselves. 
"The trend toward racial balkanization, particularly in the suburbs of the Sun Belt and other parts of the country, I think made it wishful thinking," Mr. Muller said.
Segregation has increased from 1990 to 2000 in almost every large suburban area, from Milwaukee to metropolitan New York, said the Lewis Mumford Center at the University of Albany, a research concern that specializes in demographics. What makes the experience here so striking is that the town was not immune to that pattern despite the efforts of Disney, which remains the primary force in running the town. 
In many respects, Disney went to extraordinary lengths to foster diversity in Celebration, which it built to fulfill Walt Disney's vision of an ideal community, at the same time that it wanted to expand into real estate. In late 1995, when the sales office for Celebration opened, Donald Killoren, the Disney executive in charge of the $2.5 billion, 10,000-acre development, emphasized the company's interest in economic and ethnic diversity. Mr. Killoren said that $600-a-month apartments would be built near $700,000 colonial revival houses and the community's sprawling golf course. He said the owners of the first 350 houses and 123 apartments would be chosen by lottery to prevent racial discrimination.
Disney officials had black workers in the sales office to help prospective black home buyers feel more comfortable. But fostering diversity in a real town has proved much harder than socially engineering a theme park designed by Walt Disney Imagineers. 
But few blacks or Hispanics attended the open houses or signed up for the housing lottery, and the community started off mostly white. Only 12 of Celebration's 1,093 houses and apartments are owned by blacks, according to the census, and the few minority workers who are seen here are mostly housekeepers and service workers. 
Some critics say they believe that Disney at best made several missteps, and at worst made a halfhearted effort to ensure racial and economic balance. These critics point to the fact that instead of building subsidized houses and apartments for low-wage earners, Disney gave surrounding Osceola County $900,000 to help area residents buy houses under $80,000. All of the money went for housing outside Celebration. Market forces have driven the prices on the rental apartments here to about $900 a month.
"I feel they left out diversity, and I feel they did it on purpose," said Viva Matthews, a black worker at an antique shop here, who lives 10 miles away. "I would not want to live here. They are not comfortable with us and I am not comfortable with them."
Milan Payne, a hotel worker in nearby Orlando who said he had looked for a place to live here but was uncomfortable with the atmosphere, summed up the sentiment of many blacks in neighboring communities when he said, "It's just amazing how the community keeps growing, but it does not get any more diverse."
But many demographers and experts in housing discrimination say that even the best intentions here would have been thwarted by the decade-old national trend toward suburban segregation, particularly in the South and the Sun Belt.
"They made a bona fide effort," said Edward J. Blakely, a black professor and dean of the Milano Graduate School of Management at the New School University in New York, and the co-author with Mary Gail Snyder of "Fortress America: Gated Communities in the United States" (Brookings Institution Press, 1997). "They were just thwarted by national trends, including the fact that when it comes to integration, being a pioneer is not an experience that a lot of people are looking to have anymore."
Robert Tennebaum, the real estate development director at the University of Maryland at Baltimore, who helped design Columbia, Md., a community noted for its racial diversity, said that Disney officials might have underestimated the amount of effort necessary. 
In Columbia, for example, officials paid both black and white families to move into different neighborhoods to keep areas from segregating, Mr. Tennebaum said. But the overarching problem here, he said, probably had to do with the new demographic trends.
"You would have a hard time doing a Columbia today," he added. "In the 1960's we were filled with idealism and even promised to create an open community before federal law required it. Some of that idealism has dissipated."
Perry J. Reader, the president of the Celebration Company, a Disney subsidiary that holds the majority of seats on the town council, acknowledged that Disney's efforts to bring diversity here had failed. "Even though we are not as diverse as we would like to be," Mr. Reader said, "I think it's encouraging that the community recognizes that." 
Asked what the company might do to address the issue, he said that officials were considering building cheaper housing for retirees. He said they had not decided what to do about the racial disparity. 
The issue of diversity has become so contentious here that it has been brought up in town hall meetings and on a Web site for community residents. In one exchange on the Web site chat room, a resident said he "can't complain" that there were few blacks or Hispanics here. 
"It is generally peaceful and quiet here and it even looks like the perfect American community," the resident wrote. "Our homes cost a lot more but any honest person would have to admit that part of the charm of buying here is living a life style that mimics what most American families could only hope to enjoy. No ethnic or racial problems in sight here."
Tobi Santagado, who is Jewish and lives here with her two children and husband, does not call her neighbors prejudiced, but says they are too quick to associate minority people with crime and blight. 
Ms. Santagado, who has diversity in the platform for her campaign to win a seat on the council, says she fears that Celebration's homogenous atmosphere will not prepare its children for the increasingly diverse world outside its white picket fences. 
"A black family toured a house on the block recently," she said. "And I said to the real estate agent that 'I hope you sell it to them, because we need somebody.' "

HEADLINE: Aftermath; 
Forget the Past: It's A War Unlike Any Other

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
NO one, not Alexander the Great, not the Persians, not the Moghuls or the British or the Russians, has successfully occupied Afghanistan. It is a nation of warriors, where children glue broken glass to their kite strings to cut down other kites, boys are given rifles at puberty and old men keep thrushes in wooden cages trained not to sing, but to fight. 
 But it is Afghanistan that President Bush, in his speech Thursday night, pledged to attack unless it delivered up the terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden. Mr. Bush warned Americans to expect "a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have seen," in his fight against terrorism, and it will certainly be that. 
 American naval carrier groups are steaming toward positions in the Indian Ocean, and Air Force bombers are heading toward distant airfields to fight a shadowy foe flitting through the mountains in a deeply hostile land already so poor and so ruined by two decades of war that is virtually bereft of targets. 
It will not be like the gulf war, made to order for America's massive bombing, tank and helicopter attacks. And the economic and industrial might that helped carry the United States to victory in two world wars, while still a strength, is also, as the suicide airline hijackers showed, a vulnerability.
It's true that the president has a number of options at his disposal, but all are fraught with uncertainty. A lightning strike -- by helicopter-borne Marines, for example -- could swiftly take down what rudimentary government there is, but what next? Afghans have always rallied against outsiders, so it is unlikely that even those resentful of medieval Taliban rule would join a government set up by Americans. 
Special Forces -- the Green Berets -- will likely train and arm the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, a former Green Beret commander said. But most of them belong to ethnic minorities, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazari, who are riven by infighting and who would be rejected by the majority Pushtun population. 
Then there are the Special Operations soldiers the Army does not talk about -- Delta Force and Direct Action Units among them -- capable of dropping in so-called snatch teams or snipers to hunt down Mr. bin Laden and his associates. But Mr. bin Laden may have already slipped into hiding among the neighboring Baluch tribesmen or in the lawless North West Frontier. And the members of his organization, broken up into small cells, are said to be spread across 60 countries. 
All of these options could have unintended consequences. Indeed, the whole problem stems from what the intelligence community calls "blowback," the unexpected, negative fallout from an operation. Mr. bin Laden and the Taliban government of Afghanistan are themselves examples of such unexpected consequences. They are the creations, in large measure, of the training, weapons and dollars funneled into Afghanistan by the Central Intelligence Agency during the 1980's to help seven Islamic Mujahadin factions, fierce mountain tribesmen, defeat the Soviet occupation.
"Military action in this atmosphere will have very damaging political results," warned Selig S. Harrison, a project director of the Century Foundation and expert on South Asia. "It's going to create a more poisonous atmosphere, with a very counterproductive impact in the rest of the Islamic world. It will lead to more terrorism in the future."
Afghanistan, for example, became a vast guerrilla training ground, and Arab volunteers who fought in the war, Islamic fundamentalists now called afghanis, spread out to new battles against Egypt, Algeria and other Arab governments. After the Soviet Union withdrew, these same fighters prepared to, among other things, try to blow up the World Trade Center.
 THEN there is Pakistan, the key ally President Bush is depending on in the hunt for Mr. bin Laden. Its intelligence service, Inter-Service Intelligence, or ISI, may know more about what goes on inside Afghanistan than anyone else. But Pakistan also neatly fits Mr. Bush's own definition of a state sponsor of terrorism. 
With Afghanistan falling into anarchy, Pakistan in 1994 essentially created the Taliban by backing Mullah Mohammed Omar, a one-eyed cleric who had been a fighter under one of the C.I.A.'s favorite commanders. They drew their recruits from radical young Islamic students in the refugee camps around Peshawar. 
Mr. bin Laden was not the only one to take advantage of the Taliban's training camps. In fact, when the United States fired cruise missiles at a camp near Khost in retaliation for the bombing of two embassies, it was actually being used by Pakistani military intelligence to train an Islamic guerrilla group called Harakat-ul-Ansar to fight against India in Kashmir. Another organization, mostly Pakistani, called Lashkar-e-Taiba, sponsored by the ISI, not only trains militants for the assassination of Indian soldiers and officials in Kashmir, but acts as a kind of secret police for the Taliban.
"The Taliban are basically an extension of Pakistan," said Mr. Harrison.
So the Pakistani government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf finds itself in an odd position. The Pakistan that General Musharraf took over in a military coup is only barely a state: impoverished, anarchic, awash in refugees, guns and drugs from the Afghan wars, whole areas under the sway of feudal lords or tribal chiefs, with daily gun battles reported in its newspapers. And radical Islam is a strong force. "Trust me," the general said in a television address in Urdu to explain his support of the Americans. But he risks an Islamic backlash that could sweep away his government. This in a country that Jane's Intelligence reported last year has 25 nuclear-tipped missiles.
And there are similar risks for other Muslim or Arab governments that the president seeks to enlist in his coalition against terrorism. America's key ally in the region, Saudi Arabia, for example, may be particularly vulnerable. Its legitimacy rests on its position as protector of the two holy places of Mecca and Medina and the interrelationship of the royal family with the ranking religious leaders. But its strict Wahabi form of Islam is the basis of Mr. bin Laden's own beliefs and younger clergy, much like Mr. bin Laden himself, are reportedly increasingly upset by the American military presence. In addition, there is unrest as economic difficulties undermine the once easy life in the kingdom.
Even language is a problem. President Bush at first spoke of a "crusade" against evil, a word the White House swiftly retracted when its implications became clear. In America, with perhaps a fuzzy recollection of Sir Walter Scott's novels, the word has a noble ring; in the Middle East, where historical memories run much longer, it has other connotations: bloody massacres of Muslims, Jews and Byzantine Christians. Indeed, Mr. bin Laden's favorite expression of rage is "American crusader forces." 
Mr. Bush's choice of words was more than a verbal gaffe: it shows the danger of allowing the struggle to be defined in Mr. bin Laden's terms, as a Holy War between Islam and the West, gaining him new recruits and supporters and thwarting Mr. Bush's efforts to form a broad coalition against terrorism.
And on Friday, the Muslim sabbath, mosques throughout the Arab world rang with defiance and cries of crusaders and jihad.

HEADLINE: Austro Turf 

BYLINE:  By Herbert Muschamp; Herbert Muschamp is the architecture critic of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Some people think that architecture critics are in the business of promoting their personal taste. In my case, the opposite is true. I write to get as far away from my taste as possible. This story is an exception, up to a point. There is one architect whose work reflects my taste and incites me to escape it at the same time: Adolf Loos. His designs embody the idea that, in the modern city, taste should be constantly challenged.
 Loos, who lived from 1870 to 1933, was a forerunner of what some now call minimalism. Today, he may be best known for his 1908 essay, "Ornament and Crime." Even before Mies van der Rohe introduced himself to the world with the Barcelona Pavilion, Loos championed an architecture of severe reduction. At a time when designers across Europe were enmeshed in the flowing tendrils of Art Nouveau, Loos hacked away the vines. Instead of inventing new decorative systems, Loos proposed eliminating decoration altogether. Architecture was, for him, a process of mental and cultural hygiene. 
 "Please be stronger than your past./The future may still give you a chance." -- George Michael, "Cowboys and Angels"
Sing that song again, mister! So what if there's no absolute progress in art? Some art helps us cope better as life rolls along. We don't have to keep rushing and rushing around, chasing one another in a fog, bumping into the same dumb furniture. Clarity is character. Even if architecture cannot reform society, it can clarify our vision of the status quo. Loos stands for this idea: a lucid view of self and others requires perpetual polishing of the lens.
Loos was a pivotal figure in the community of artists and intellectuals that flourished in Vienna's fin de siecle. He not only frequented the city's famous coffeehouses, but also designed one. You can visit Cafe Museum today, though little remains of Loos's design. Never mind. What matters are the echoes of the conversations that once transpired there. In those years, the city's best minds were often engaged by a pivotal set of issues. What is the proper relationship between private and public life? Between politics and the imagination? Between our inner and outer worlds? Freud, Schnitzler, Wittgenstein, Klimt, Hofmannsthal, Mach and others were stirring these deep thoughts around in their coffee.
Architecture reckons with the relationship between public and private on the material plane as well as the conceptual one. Buildings are hinges between interiors and the street. Loos clarified the function of the hinge in formal and spatial terms. It was, for him, a site of moral action, a place where self and society negotiate the boundaries between private rights and public responsibilities.
The American Bar, designed by Loos in 1907, is a most relaxing place to enjoy your private rights in public. A key landmark in the history of modern architecture, the tiny cocktail spot is also known as the K* rntner Bar and is just off K* rntnerstrasse in Vienna's inner city. When was a landmark ever this minute? As your eyes adjust to interiors darkened by deep mahogany walls, you realize that the place is even smaller than it appears at first: a band of mirrors at clerestory height multiplies its dimensions. Then when you take your seat at the far banquette facing the door, your eye is drawn up to a large panel of backlighted alabaster that dissolves the front wall into a shaft of sunlight caught by thinning clouds.
Overhead, the ceiling is coffered with marble. That's ornament up there, no doubt about it. Police! Police! But Loos was not opposed to ornament per se. His argument was with those of his contemporaries who sought to invent new decorative systems. Loos himself was not averse to employing ornamental devices that had passed into vernacular use. In this sense, his approach anticipated Robert Venturi's use of classical motifs. Venturian, too, is the stylized stained-glass American flag on the bar's entrance facade. Salute Jasper Johns.
The American Bar was an institution that flourished across Europe in the 1920's, along with flappers, jazz and beach resorts. The counter with stools in front, and bottles of booze behind the patron, imbibed the New World spirit as much as cocktails. Loos himself was indebted to the American idea. His approach to architecture was partly formulated during a three-year sojourn to the States after his student days. Like other Europeans, Loos was impressed by the scale and vigor of our industrial culture. Factories, grain silos, bridges: to European observers, such feats of engineering possessed the primitive vitality of archaic Greek architecture. His own designs aspire toward spartan simplicity.
Nowhere was this aspiration more fully realized than at Looshaus, the largest of his built works. Now home to the Raiffeisenlandesbank, the building was originally designed for Goldman & Salatsch, a swell gentlemen's tailor. It occupies a prominent site on Michaelerplatz, directly opposite the entrance gate to the Hapsburg imperial apartments. Reportedly, Franz Joseph was so disgusted by the view of the building from his windows that he permanently pulled the curtains. Looshaus also offended the young Adolf Hitler. In his watercolor paintings of Michaelerplatz, rendered when he was living in a homeless shelter, Hitler replaced Loos's building with an imaginary faux baroque edifice of his own design.
A period cartoon of the building shows Loos in a moment of inspiration as he gazes down at a storm-drain cover while walking down the street. But what a drain cover! Looshaus defines luxury as the 20th century later came to perceive it: fine materials, polished surfaces, sumptuous spaces, refined details. Even now, these elements are clearly legible as metaphors for the spiritual rewards of spartan living.
Access to Looshaus is limited today. And the present banking floor atmosphere is a far cry from that of Goldman & Salatsch, where Loos established a clear continuity between architectural and sartorial values. But you can still experience that continuity at the legendary Knize shop, built by Loos in 1913. Today, Knize sells sportswear made by other designers, as well as its own bespoke attire. The clothing is of refined, Loosian taste (I peeked inside last April and came away with three jackets), and the shop itself enjoys landmark protection.
From the small entrance facade and ground floor, to the sizable main floor upstairs, the impression is one of good grooming rather than design. The two shop windows flanking the entrance are discreet. Inside, a narrow aisle divides the sales counter from ceiling-high cabinets for shirts. Ascending the small spiral stair at the rear of the shop, you may imagine that you are trying on the world's first modern space for size.
Display cabinets, fitting rooms, dressing rooms, open storage areas for fabrics, seating areas with round tables and club chairs: though the spaces are devoid of overt machine-age references, they have a distinct nautical feel. With none of the ponderousness or medievalism of the Arts and Crafts movement, Knize is an essay on the aesthetic of craft. A new vocabulary takes shape amid the bolts of cloth. Economy of means, easy access to tools, openness to the eye, scale shaped to human form: it fits. It's me!
The store's atmosphere is British, but not stuffy. It is the Britain of navy uniforms, country wear, sports attire: the same sources that inspired Coco Chanel, in fact. With her scissors, Chanel once said, she had cut away all that was inessential in the creations of others. Loos might have made the same claim for his pencil. In fact, he was keenly interested in fashion. He wrote about clothes. British gentlemen's attire, Loos maintained, was the only suitable form of dress. Haberdashers were among his most important clients. Their advertising also supported publication of Das Andere ("The Other"), a polemical broadsheet that Loos put out in his early years. Loos's interest in fashion was in large part polemical. For him, architecture was not an art. Rather, it was analogous to fashion: an enlightened response to the material need for shelter, as fashion is a cultivated solution to the body's need for clothes. Architecture and fashion were not culturally inferior to art in Loos's eyes. Rather, both were tantamount to philosophy, or should at least take their cue from the world of ideas. 
Loos developed his ideas in tandem with Ludwig Wittgenstein, the brilliant philosopher who sought to refute all philosophical systems. In fact, it has been argued that Loos provided the basis of Wittgenstein's most influential theories. For Wittgenstein, philosophy was a little trick that the Greeks had played on us. All philosophical problems are essentially semantic problems. Clear away the rhetoric, and the problems disappear. "What can be said at all, can be said clearly," Wittgenstein insisted. "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent."
For Loos, the 19th-century debates over architectural style were so much rhetoric. Strip away the styles and a building will appear. Organize interior spaces and circulation; add walls, a roof, windows, doors and plumbing; decorate to taste; and move in. If you build it, architecture will come: this was the general idea. It was one of the main roots of what would later be called functionalism. In 1926, Wittgenstein co-designed a house in Vienna for his sister. (Thanks to the historian Bernhard Leitner, the house was spared demolition and has been restored to mint condition.) Wittgenstein's collaborator on the project was Paul Engelmann, a pupil of Loos's. Their design carries the master's spartan approach to nearly sadistic extremes. Glass doors and windows with thin metal frames, even floors of iron; the whole place feels like one big clang -- closer in spirit to Peter Eisenman than Adolf Loos.
A Loos interior, by contrast, is warm. Lots of mahogany. Oak. Pear wood. Walls and wood trim painted bright colors. Leather. Fur. Amusing lighting fixtures with lampshades of gathered silk -- intimations of Philippe Starck. Loos did not believe that architects should retain control over interior decoration, at least in private houses. He wasn't a Frank Lloyd Wright. You bought it, it's yours. Enjoy. The private and public realms, while overlapping, remain distinct.
Loos's approach is no longer Other. It is normative. It's Wallpaper, as sophisticated people, with some disdain, now describe the minimalist aesthetic promoted by that magazine. It's background. A snore. Black jeans, white T-shirts. "Real simple." Uniforms. I've decorated my version of it with splashy views of the Manhattan skyline, more books than I have room for, unkempt piles of writing and research material that litter every available surface. Housecleaning is a Loosian homage. Picking up the room excavates a neutral space that is ideal for an architecture critic who distrusts norms. It reminds me that norms do have a place. My place, in fact.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Taking the Attack Personally After a Career on Wall Street

BYLINE:  By Raymond Hernandez; Raymond Hernandez reports from Washington for The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was one thing to hear Jon Corzine on the Senate floor denouncing the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, as many of his colleagues did. But it was quite another to hear him describe how the attack had touched him personally.
 "I worked for many years in that neighborhood that I saw buried in the rubble yesterday, and I fear that many whose paths I crossed suffered unspeakable horrors," said Mr. Corzine, who entered the Senate this year after a career on Wall Street, most recently as the chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company. 
 More than anyone else in Congress, Mr. Corzine had many close friends and business associates who were in the World Trade Center at the time of the terrorist attacks and who are now among those missing and presumed dead.
More than that, Mr. Corzine is also among a small group of lawmakers in Congress who have had to be national spokesmen as talk of war brews while at the same time tending to the needs of constituents whose lives have been directly affected by the catastrophe.
Just last week Mr. Corzine estimated that as many as 50 percent of those who died in the attack were residents of New Jersey who commuted to work at the World Trade Center each day.
Mr. Corzine, a resident of Summit, said the losses in his town alone were staggering.
"There are a bunch of us for whom this mixes in personally, and it hurts," he said in an interview the day after the terrorist assaults.
Last week his mood was no less somber after touring the twisted, smoldering remains where the towers once stood and attending prayer vigils all over New Jersey.
"It's unimaginable," he said a few hours after paying a visit to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. "It makes your blood boil. It really does. It makes you mad. You're overwhelmed by the devastation."
Apart from his comments on the Senate floor, he has been reluctant to talk about his personal experience, perhaps out of respect for the families of the victims. "It's hard for everybody," he says.
Like almost everyone else in the country, Mr. Corzine has been changed by the attacks. Only a few weeks ago, he was offering sharp criticisms of President Bush. Today he bristles at commentators who say the president has come across as inexperienced and unsure of himself.
"I don't think people who get into that game realize the burden that he's had to take on," Mr. Corzine said. Political battles, he said, are for another day.
More than that, Mr. Corzine now speaks with urgency about the need for Washington to step in and help bolster the nation's sagging economy in the attack's unsettling aftermath. His views on economic matters, after all, do carry some weight down here.
His stances on certain issues have changed as well. Only a few weeks ago, there was a great deal of tsk-tsking among Democrats like Mr. Corzine as the economy slowed, the budget surplus shrank and Mr. Bush faced the prospect of breaking his promise not to dip into the Social Security surplus.
The Democrats wanted to force the president to explain how he planned to pay for things -- a military buildup, a prescription drug benefit for the elderly or increases in education spending -- with the economy in a swoon and his huge tax cut on the books.
Democrats were sore that they had not been able to stop President Bush's tax cut from being enacted, and so they refused to offer him their own solution in light of the increasingly unstable economy. Let him stew, was their attitude.
But now Mr. Corzine says there is no place for such gamesmanship. He says Congress cannot afford to bicker about economic policy, and argues that the nation will need a huge infusion of cash from Washington to help rebuild from the attacks and to jump-start the economy.
He thinks that a large public-works programs could help make the difference, even if it means dipping into the Social Security surplus, a notion that was once taboo.
"We need economic stimulus now, fiscal discipline later," he said.
Mostly, though, he has been all over New Jersey in recent days: a memorial mass in Newark, a prayer service in Bayonne, a vigil in Edison.
"The real hard part," he said, "is that this has only begun."

HEADLINE: A City Rises to the Occasion 

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
IN one awful instant, this patchwork city that is part high-tech, part high finance and part third world assumed an even more integral role in the region's stability.
 In the early moments after hijackers slammed two fuel-laden Boeing 767's into the World Trade Center -- even before Jersey City straightened its shoulders and gave a shattered financial community a place to come to -- it lent New York a shoulder to cry on and a place for the weary and the wounded to seek comfort. 
 Only days ago Acting Gov. Donald T. Difrancesco signed an order making official what Jersey City had been doing on its own since those first stunning moments after the attack -- he created an Office of Recovery and Victim Assistance to coordinate the efforts of various state agencies and established a family assistance center for relatives at Liberty State Park here, where on the day of the assault 2,600 people were evacuated to a National Guard field hospital that had been hastily set up there. The center will allow families to register a missing person, provide DNA samples, speak with law enforcement and seek counseling, among other services. 
"While this is a New York story, it is also very much a New Jersey tragedy," said Mr. DiFrancesco.
By last Tuesday, Attorney General John J. Farmer spoke a terrible truth that most people had feared and assumed for a week -- that the state's losses were staggering, as many as 2,000 people.
From the first fiery moments of Sept. 11, 2001, Jersey City rose to the occasion, with hospitals providing medical care; schools and homeowners giving shelter to victims and evacuees alike; sending scores of police officers and firefighters to secure the scene of unspeakahble horror; and shipping a steady stream of volunteers and supplies from the same waterfront promenade in Jersey City's financial district that is now being called Wall Street West because of the number of firms that are relocating on this side of the Hudson River.
Today, this is a city brought more sharply into focus because of the bitter events of the past two weeks. In Jersey City's sizable Arab and Muslim communities -- in many instances quite distinct -- the usual tensions are giving way to more open animosity.
It was on Kennedy Boulevard, the main thoroughfare that slices through the city's largely Arabic section near Journal Square, that Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman -- the Egyptian-born blind cleric who was the ringleader of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center -- preached at the Masjid Al Salam mosque.
The spiritual leader and the bombers are gone, jailed on conspiracy charges, but the mosque remains.
As recently as this summer, in a tape that was widely disseminated, Osama bin Laden -- a Saudi exile blamed for numerous anti-American attacks and the prime suspect in the Trade Center assault -- described the cleric as "a hostage in an American jail." He added, "We hear he is sick, and that the Americans are treating him badly." Then, addressing his followers, he shifted into an exhortation to martyrdom. "You will not die needlessly," he said. "Your lives are in the hands of God."
Five days after the hijacked planes slammed into their targets in New York and at the Pentagon, five Arabic men were seized in an F.B.I. raid on their apartment building on Tonnele Avenue here, just around the corner from the mosque.
Now, once again, a veil of suspicion by association -- unjustly or not -- hangs over Jersey City's Muslim community.
Afsha Sheikh, 10, her sister, Faiza, 11, are students at the Al-Ghazaly School, which shares an old brick building with a mosque on Park Avenue at the Islamic Center of Jersey City.
The girls, who live in Weehawken, were born in the United States, wear bell-bottom jeans, watch basketball and football and listen to rock music. They wear their hijabs -- the scarf that Muslim women cover their heads with -- only to the mosque and to school. But widespread suspicion that Mr. bin Laden, a former Saudi Arabian citizen, was linked to the attack made the girls fear anti-Muslim recriminations.
"When we heard it was the Saudis we were scared we were going to get killed," said Afsha, a fifth grader.
Her sister, Faiza, added, "Like, if it was Arabs, then we would get in trouble."
Their friend, Sarah Mohamed, 10, a classmate of Afsha's and every bit as much a product of American pop culture, said she experienced some anti-Arab backlash the day of the attack.
"When I was in the car, this little boy, he told me, 'God bless America,' " said Sarah, who was born in the United States, and lives in Jersey City. "He said it like he was laughing at me. I wanted to punch him. This is my country and I like it."
Sarah's mother, Karen Mohamed, who wears a hijab regularly, puts into even sharper relief how diverse the city's Muslim population is.
Ms. Mohamed, 37, was born Karen Corn in Chicago, and was raised a Baptist. Her mother was adopted by Christians after being born of Jewish parents. She met her Egyptian-born husband, Moustafa Mohamed, 18 years ago while the two worked for a car service in Jersey City, and they married soon afterward. It was several years later that she converted to Islam, though not because of any pressure from husband, she said, but rather because she finally felt the spirit of Allah in her heart.
Yet it was when she began wearing the hijab, she said, that people began to change their perceptions of her.
"You get a lot of stares," she said after the recent horrors. "I was driving my car, and one woman said, 'Go back to your country.' "
"O.K., I'm from Chicago, actually," Ms. Mohamed said. "My sister said, 'You're not going to wear that, are you?' "
"I said, 'Why not? I haven't done anything wrong.' "
With fear and suspicion rising to the surface now -- especially among Jersey City's patchwork population, Ms. Mohamed's friend, Kathie Shedeed, who also converted to Islam after marrying an Egyptian Muslim, commended President Bush and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York for speaking out about unjustified attacks on Muslims reminiscent of how Japanese-Americans were mistreated during World War II. 
As recently as last Sunday, Ahmed Shedeed, the husband of Ms. Sheheed and also the director of the Islamic Center, was present when nearly 200 Muslims gathered at the center for a talk by the Jersey City Police Department urging them to notify police officers of any violence or harassment.
"Rest assured, with your cooperation, with everyone's cooperation, we're not going to have a problem," said Detective Abab Perez. "But rest assured, if we do have a problem, we're going to be behind you 100 percent."
The crowd gathered inside the center's small auditorium -- women on the right, men on the left -- applauded.
To be sure, in a world turned upside down, there is uneasiness.
Take Abdus Salaam Kahalil al Amin, who was at the gathering last Sunday. The 27-year-old truck driver, who is black, first gave his name as Kevin Austin. In a show of patriotism unique among the Muslims at the center that day, Mr. Austin, who lives in neighboring Bayonne, was wearing a red, white and blue bandanna tied around his wrist. While black and Arab Muslims generally get along, Mr. Austin said, he admitted feeling a complex set of emotions after learning of the attack and suspicions that Islamic fundamentalists were behind it.
"I'm a Muslim, but I'm also an African-American," Mr. Austin said. "So my emotions and my beliefs were in a crossfire, if you know what I mean."
Even within the city's ethnic Egyptian population, relations between Coptic Christians and Muslims are sometimes strained, and the suspicion that Islamic fundamentalists were involved in the attack seems to have exacerbated those tensions.
Among the volunteers loading supplies at a waterfront staging area a few days after the catastrophe were a handful of Egyptian-born teenagers with a group organized by the local chapter of Coptic Community Services. Mike Matthew, 18, who left Egypt when he was a year old and now attends the St. George and St. Shenouda Coptic Orthodox Church in Jersey City, was one of several young Egyptians who clearly had no love for Muslims from their homeland.
"The most that it affected me is that I'm Egyptian, but I'm a Christian and those people are Muslim, and they're giving us a bad name," said Mr. Matthew, a freshman at Hudson County Community College in Jersey City. "Our priest, he has a long beard and he wears a cross, but people confuse him with a Muslim, and they spit on him in the street yesterday."
Mr. Matthew went on: "I met this girl at my bank. She's a teller, and she's a Muslim, and she said, 'They're exaggerating this whole thing.' I was surprised and I said, 'Just give me my money, and I left.' "

Lending a Hand
The catastrophe has also brought out the best in people.
At the staging area at 70 Hudson Street -- site of a huge volunteer effort -- John Curtis and Beth Stark were taking a break.
The couple, who are among the thousands of young professionals to have moved to the waterfront in recent years, were loading bottles of Poland Spring water, Gatorade, Diet Coke, Purina Dog Chow, rubber gloves, breathing masks and other supplies onto New York City Police boats.
Mr. Curtis and Ms. Stark munched on cheeseburgers and Chicken McNuggets that were prepared at a mobile kitchen supplied by a McDonald's distribution center in Bedminster. The clear skies, steady breeze and spirit of cooperation made the atmosphere at the staging area seem incongruously festive. 
Ms. Stark, a 31-year-old graduate student, felt compelled to say, "I feel so selfish, like I'm out here trying to make myself feel better."
She and Mr. Curtis, a 34-year-old investment banker for CIBC World Markets in Midtown Manhattan, had moved to the city's historic Paulus Hook section near the waterfront directly across the Hudson from Lower Manhattan only a month earlier. But the twin towers -- silvery pillars of Modernism that turned to gold at sunset -- were so dominating that their presence had already been ingrained in the young couple's vision of New York. 
"I think one of the things that attracted us to the this area was having that view of the financial district and the trade center in particular," Mr. Curtis said. "You take them for granted. You think they'll always be there."
For those who live far from New York, time will dim the horror, but for residents in such riverfront towns as Jersey City, Bayonne and Hoboken, the trade center's conspicuous absence will serve as a constant reminder of the devastating loss.
Indeed, from some vantage points, the Trade Center and its sprawling financial district even looked like it was part of Jersey City, blending seamlessly into the budding skyline.
"It didn't look like there was a river in between, like we could just walk to it," said Daniel Lugo, 31, a freelance programmer and designer. 
The historic districts that make up most of downtown Jersey City -- Hamilton Park, Harsimus Cove, Van Vorst, Paulus Hook -- have neighborhood associations that are known in town for their vigilant, even aggressive, defense of the quality of life. An extensive e-mail network has helped them to thwart or scale back some development proposals and to obtain city funds for pet projects. It was through that same network that two activists, Geoffrey and Karen Elkind, helped spark the drive for supplies that ended up at the foot of Hudson Street, and recruited other downtown residents to lend a hand.
For instance, Mr. Elkind, a lawyer and former city council candidate who is chairman of the city's Downtown Coalition of Neighborhood Associations, sent an e-mail message to the Howard Stern Show on WXRK-FM. "Within about 30 seconds and lasting the next 10 hours we took phone calls with offers of assistance from across the country," Mr. Elkind said. "There isn't a state that hasn't called."
Mr. Elkind, whose organizational experience had in the past involved trying to tamp down building heights and nightclub noise, suddenly found himself in the thick of an unprecedented catastrophe. When he is not at his computer, the unassuming neighborhood activist may be found conferring with the staging area's burly coordinator, Lieut. Michael Louf, a veteran Jersey City Police officer who had his own personal connection to the trade center.
"I was an iron worker in 1968, and I worked in the building when they were building the place," said Lieutenant Louf, who, like many of his colleagues found it difficult to tear himself away from the rescue effort. "It got so bad I fell asleep on the toilet, so I knew it was time to go home."
It was an e-mail message from the Elkinds on the day of the attack that prompted two Van Vorst neighbors, Mia Scanga and Jennifer May, to go to the emergency room at Christ Hospital in nearby Hamilton Park, which treated 66 victims that day, to volunteer their town houses as overnight accommodations for victims who could not get back to New York. In all, about 600 of the injured were transferred to New Jersey Hospitals for treatment, including 150 to Jersey City Medical Center.
That night, Ms. Scanga's two guests included a financial consultant from North Carolina who barely escaped from the collapsing Marriott Hotel, where he was staying, and a man who had recently moved to Battery Park City from Boston. Ms. May, a product director for a shoe design company, took in a Queens woman and a Long Island man who worked in the financial district.
"I don't know, I was just, like, yeah, I can sleep two people, let's go," Ms. May said. "Actually, my husband was out of town, and I was a little nervous about that, because I have a baby, too. But I thought the circumstances were such that I didn't think I was putting myself at risk."
Despite the unusual gesture of kindness, Ms. May said she was surprised by the depth of her guests' gratitude.
"They didn't think that people like that existed," she said. "They were kind of reluctant to even take us up on it, and the woman who was assigning people was like, 'Look, they're here to help, let them help.' I just feel like I'm glad I was able to help them feel comfortable. It's still awkward -- imagine being in a stranger's home and just wanting to go home. I could barely sleep myself and I didn't even go through it."

Businesses Respond
One of the more prominent people on the waterfront, Ed Nicoll, president and chief executive of Datek Online Corporation, offered the 11-story building his company leases at 70 Exchange Place as a landing point for police officers and firefighters overcome by smoke as well as evacuees from Lower Manhattan.
For hours ferries, tugboats and police launches dropped people off at a pier in the shadow of the Colgate clock next to the office building. From there, some were treated by emergency crews while others rested on office chairs set up in the lobby, drank water or ate sandwiches provided by the cafeteria or called concerned loved ones from a bank of telephones that the company hurriedly set up.
Mr. Nicoll said he and his company's 1,000 employees watched the tragedy unfold from their unimpeded view of the smoky ruins across the river. When the financial markets closed, about half of Datek's employees chose to stay and assist the victims and rescuers.
Other buildings in Exchange Place had closed their doors and posted security guards to keep people out. When Datek ran out of bottled water, it was to these buildings that employees went -- with police escorts -- to raid their supplies. In addition, the company reached out to area restaurants for ice and cloths that they drenched with cool water and handed to those arriving from across the river.
"When the restaurants ran out of cloths, they sent tablecloths, which we ripped up into strips to hand out," Mr. Nicoll said. "We just wanted to help."
In the attack's aftermath, Datek also turned over the vacant 11th floor of its building to the police department, which used it as a waterfront command center, operated by officers who volunteered their time -- often after working regular full shifts. Mayor Glenn D. Cunningham, a former police captain and United States marshal for New Jersey, spent part of his time there, surveying the human chain of volunteers passing supplies on the promenade below. 
Countless small businesses, from pizza parlors to contractors, did what they could. After the Holland Tunnel closed to regular traffic on Tuesday, Chris Cho, the owner of a Gulf station near the tunnel entrance, said gasoline sales went from about 13,000 gallons a day to just a few hundred. Even so, Mr. Cho, 65, who lives in Westfield, offered to provide free fuel to the emergency vehicles that streamed toward the disaster site. City officials said that took pressure of the Public Works Department, which had been making its own pumps available.
"I don't want to brag," Mr. Cunningham said. "But Jersey City has really been the anchor for everything that's going on in there. And not just going in, but on the first day, everything coming out."

Need for Office Space
In addition to the massive loss of life and unspeakable suffering, Manhattan also saw 15 million to 20 million square feet of office space destroyed. For now, businesses have to relocate, and many will never return. Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial real estate firm, said that of the 395 million square feet of office space in Manhattan, about 30 million square feet were available as of last week. But clearly, not all of that space was suitable for the needs of all the displaced firms. 
Competition between New York and New Jersey in luring financial firms has long been a bitter issue dividing business and government leaders of the two states. In recent years as the New Jersey waterfront grew and flourished. Indeed, with increasingly sophisticated technology, New York has lost thousands of jobs to towns across the Hudson as companies sought cheaper land for its businesses and cheaper housing for its employees.
Yet regardless of the reality -- businesses need a lot of space quickly and are finding it in New Jersey -- it is a subject they dare not discuss for fear of coming off as vultures encircling the still-smoking ruins of the trade center.
Others -- even those who lost friends and associates -- feel less encumbered. 
"As a citizen of New York City, I would like to keep every corporation here," said Don Schnabel, vice chairman of Julien J. Studley Inc., a Manhattan-based commercial real estate brokerage. "What are we going to do? We lost 15 to 20 million square feet. The inventory for all of Manhattan is 300 million square feet. How do you deal with that? I'll answer my own question: Some of these companies will leave, and some will not come back."
Mr. Schnabel said his firm was seeking leases for clients in Jersey City, though he declined to say which ones. As for his own company, Mr. Schnabel said Studley would relocate some employees to its office in Edison.
Mr. Schnabel's own office was on the 86th floor of north tower of the World Trade Center. Two employees, including his secretary, Patricia Puma of Staten Island, were trapped there when the tower collapsed and are listed among the missing.
David Houston, president of Colliers Houston & Company, a Manhattan-based brokerage, said two million square feet of office space were leased in New Jersey in the week after the catastrophe, much of it in Jersey City and Newark, because of the PATH train service to Manhattan. But, Mr. Houston added, "I think the vast majority of firms that were impacted by this will not relocate to New Jersey."
Mildred Hanson, vice president of NAI James E. Hansen Inc. in Hackensack, said there had been subleases signed for more than a million square feet in New Jersey. She said her firm had received requests for blocks of 120,000 square feet, 320,000 square feet and 54,000 square feet.
"So far," Ms. Hanson said, "I would say, the strongest demand has been in Hudson and Morris Counties, but we think it's going to trickle into Bergen County."
It may have to. 
Richard LeFrak, president of the Lefrak Organization, said his company had leased 100 percent of the 2.8 million square feet of completed office space in the company's Newport complex here. And while the developer is currently putting up two buildings with a total of 2.5 million square feet, Mr. LeFrak said the space was already spoken for. Beyond that, he said, Lefrak does have plans to build another two million square feet of space, though that space will not be completed for at least 18 months.
In the long run, Mr. LeFrak said, the New Jersey real estate market would not gain from New York's loss. 
"Basically, in my mind, New York's misfortune is not New Jersey's fortune," he said. "It's all one region. If New York is weak, the whole region is going to be weak. You can't separate the two markets."
Goldman Sachs & Company, which was forced to relocate some employees from Lower Manhattan to its existing space in Jersey City, is currently building a 1.4-million-square-foot office tower here on the waterfront that would house more than 6,000 employees. At a proposed height of 821 feet, it would be the tallest building in New Jersey.
A spokeswoman for the company said last week that even in the aftermath of the disaster in which the two planes took aim at the skyscrapers, the company had no intention of scaling back. 
But Mr. LeFrak and others in the building trade suggested that companies might begin to shy away from high concentrations of employees at a single location, and even that landmark buildings -- economic symbols and thus potential targets -- might become less desirable. 
"If people have some diversity within the region, it gives them the flexibility not to be victimized by a single event," Mr. LeFrak said. "And the companies that are faring best are the ones that had that as part of their contingency, and Jersey City is a possible, logical option."

It's Not a Time for Party, But for How Long?

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT could be weeks, months or years, but sooner or later, if history is any guide, the arm-in-arm bipartisanship spurred by the current patriotic fervor will subside and Republicans and Democrats will go back to lambasting one another.
 The pattern is predictable, so much so that Richard A. Brody, a political science professor emeritus at Stanford, built a career out of studying it, most notably in the case of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. "This is a classic rally," he said of the current political harmony. 
 Maybe so. But for all the expectations that politicians cannot help but be, well, politicians, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 present an opportunity to elevate the practice, and the perception, of politics in America. 
It is the first time in years that politicians have been relevant. Abysmally low voter turnout alone underscored how Americans thought it hardly mattered who was elected. Politics seemed to be defined less by matters of life and death and more by the trivial, as encapsulated by 30-second mud slings. The indecisiveness of last year's election gave the nation a civics lesson, but one that lent itself to snide jokes, not grave consideration. The summer obsession with a congressman's affair with a missing intern seems not only long ago, but embarrassingly misplaced.
Now, because of a horrendous national wound, substance is back. Not since 1992, when voters elected a president they thought could fix the economy, has leadership even approached seeming so vital. A central theme of Mr. Bush's presidential campaign was reducing the reach of Washington. Now he will preside over a huge expansion of federal power. 
"In style and substance, we're making a transition to a new era in American government and politics," said Douglas Sosnik, who was a top adviser to President Bill Clinton. "There was a triviality to a lot of our politics in recent years, a lot of posturing on both sides. It was all just a kabuki dance. All that's behind us now. The events of Sept. 11, combined with a public that has grown weary of harsh partisanship and preoccupation with scandal, will lead to a softer partisanship -- and debates that are more meaningful."
For years, lawmakers squabbled over whether buyers at gun shows should face the same checks as customers at gun dealerships. Now the debate has turned to how billions of dollars should be spent to protect the security of Americans. Suddenly, leaders are tackling many such matters of consequence, gravity and complexity. Government, just as suddenly, is central to people's lives: Will Americans be drafted? Will the economy collapse? Will New York be rebuilt? 
Until Sept. 11, the capital was riding a historically partisan period, with leading Democrats still portraying their president as "appointed" by the Supreme Court. In a move that might have stoked the partisan tensions -- but now seems utterly irrelevant -- a consortium of news organizations, including The New York Times, had been scheduled this week to release the results of its ambitious undertaking to recount the Florida presidential ballots. (That has been put on hold indefinitely.)
After decades of eroding public faith in government and presidents that started with Vietnam and Watergate, politicians now have an opening to present themselves as faithful, trustworthy public servants.
In this time of emotion, when people are still in shock over the attacks on New York and Washington, it is dangerous to predict how the terrorist acts will reshape politics, or society. In New York, where city elections are rescheduled for Tuesday, people may be so preoccupied that they do not even think of voting. Or they may be so convinced of the importance of government that they stream to the polls in larger numbers.
 AND it is telling that many New Yorkers would rather just hang onto the tested leadership of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. They may be loathe to elect candidates who can easily seem too parochial for the colossal challenge of resurrecting a global city. The attacks and mass deaths have changed the qualities they look for in a leader. 
That may prove true nationally. The hottest property this early in the Democratic presidential sweepstakes has been Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. Part of his appeal is that he is a fresh face, having served only three years. But now, the prospect of a novice in the White House may be less attractive. Mr. Bush, with his own brief history of public service, has reassured Americans by surrounding himself with people who were ridiculed during the campaign as past their prime but who now appear reassuringly seasoned. 
Of course, many expect politics as usual to resume at some point. There are already stirrings of partisan cleavages over how much leeway the president should have in hunting down terrorists, whether there should be new oil drilling in Alaska to make the United States less reliant on energy from the Middle East and how far the country should go in tightening domestic security. 
"It's easy at this point for the country to feel a sense of solidarity," said William E. Leuchtenburg, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "Who couldn't be horrified by what happened?" He predicted that partisanship would return when people begin to question how such a vast, complicated plot eluded detection. "To put it simply, 'Who is to blame?' " he said. "We'll be hearing more of that soon."
It could also be that partisan disagreements have been submerged not out of patriotism but because politicians know they would look reprehensible if they appeared to be angling for personal gain.
"Everybody's being ridiculously passive-aggressive, saying, 'I'm not political. I'm not political,' " said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist. "Politics has taken a vacation."
 BUT when politicians engage again, it could be in a new way. The more they work together, the harder it may be for politicians to retreat into partisanship. Steve Elmendorf, chief of staff to Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, marveled that the White House told him about the contents of Mr. Bush's radio address on Saturday -- and asked Mr. Gephardt to deliver a similar message.
"It's unprecedented," he said. "We're talking to the Bush White House at as high a volume as we used to talk to the Clinton White House. When you spend a lot of time in close quarters and build relationships, it makes it more difficult to start attacking one another immediately. It can do nothing but help in the long term."
Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, put it this way: "Perhaps by working together in a way that we have not been able to do before we will conclude that this is a good way of doing business. That is what the people have wanted. Politicians are sometimes the last to learn the lessons of politics."

Trouble All Over

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
As the United States tries to assemble an international coalition to respond to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, a number of countries could be ready to listen -- or, alternatively, too frightened to -- because they are already trying to cope with Islamic militancy, or extremism cloaked in the language of a Muslim cause. Many are local, but some guerrilla movements operate across national boundaries. 
 Russia is the largest and most powerful example. For years it has been trying to organize collective action against Afghanistan under the Taliban, calling it a touchstone for rebels in the Caucasus and Central Asia, especially in the breakaway Chechen Republic. As the United States seeks Russian help, it will also try to avoid condoning the serious abuses that Russian troops have meted out to citizens of Chechnya, where last week Islamic-led separatists were rebuffed after a major assault. 
 Muslim countries have known the most violence in the name of Islam, though it would be simplistic to see such rebellions as strictly religious. Most also have clear political, ethnic, sectarian or cultural roots. Pakistan, now at the center of American policy, is home to militant Islamist parties with links to the Taliban that could disrupt the weakened economy or bring mobs to the streets. Neighboring India could use the occasion to crush a rebellion in Muslim Kashmir that Indians blame Pakistanis and Afghans for fomenting. It could also attack Pakistan itself.
Islamic militants have long been active in Algeria, which is now facing a separate rebellion by ethnic Berbers. A decade ago, an Islamic front nearly won a national election there before the military stopped the voting, which helped prompt a bitter civil war. In Egypt, Islamic groups offering education and welfare have won followers among the poor and powerless -- but they have also killed foreign tourists, symbols of the modern, secular world that they reject.
Throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan and Lebanon, groups with Islamic names -- if not causes -- have been used to pursue neighboring nations' foreign policy aims, to bolster political factions or undermine the security of local people and outside investors. The Saudi government came to fear Osama bin Laden and stripped his citizenship in the hope that he would never return.
In Asia, the Philippines has struggled for decades to calm an almost solidly Muslim south, China is actively trying to stamp out moves toward Muslim autonomy in its restive western reaches, and Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, faces its oldest separatist movement in the territory of Aceh, where conservative Islam has combined with a fierce nationalism.

HEADLINE: 3 Candidates Look at Future After Attack 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Three of the Democratic mayoral candidates began spelling out how they would govern a radically changed New York yesterday, using their first forum since the terrorist attack to propose ideas that would have been unimaginable two weeks ago -- from creating a city security commission to forming a public authority to oversee the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan.
 For 60 minutes, at a forum sponsored by NY1 and The New York Times, the candidates -- Fernando Ferrer, Mark Green and Alan G. Hevesi -- alternated between offering dark warnings about the city's immediate economic future and assurances that New York would survive this crisis. 
 All three candidates, speaking in somber if firm tones, took pains to praise the performance of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during the crisis but said the city would -- and should -- endure the change in leadership at City Hall that will take place at the end of the year. Term limits prohibit Mr. Giuliani from running again. 
The fourth major Democratic candidate, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, declined to take part in the forum. "While I do not fault the other candidates for participating, I personally do not believe we should debate politics while our city mourns and while the rescue and recovery efforts continue," Mr. Vallone said in a statement.
The first hijacked jet flew into the side of the World Trade Center's north tower about three hours after the polls had opened on what was supposed to be Primary Day. The election was postponed less than two hours later.
The vote has been rescheduled for Tuesday. New Yorkers who voted on Sept. 11 will have to vote again; the voting machines have been reset. But absentee ballots cast before that day will still count. 
Voters who live in parts of Manhattan where polling sites have been closed because of the emergency can vote by absentee ballots, which they can pick up at the Board of Elections headquarters at 32 Broadway tomorrow. 
Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Green, in particular, used the forum to lay out programs they said they would put into place to handle the crisis, dealing with rebuilding New York and improving security. By contrast, Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, did not outline a specific proposal for rebuilding; he argued that even as the city deals with reconstruction and security, it should not allow issues like education, health and housing to "fall off the table."
Mr. Hevesi, the city comptroller, and Mr. Green, the public advocate, called for creating some sort of public authority, which would include representatives from business, labor, state and city government and perhaps federal officials, to oversee the reconstruction effort.
Under their proposals, an authority might, as a state entity, have the power to condemn land and override land regulations that would normally slow development. In outlining their proposals, Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Green both criticized, if indirectly, a proposal made by Mr. Vallone to have reconstruction overseen by a city commission as insufficient.
Mr. Hevesi said New York would have to hire more police officers to deal with what he described as a much more security-conscious life, and he called for the creation of a security commission headed by the police commissioner.
"We're going to need more police, rather than less police," he said. "There's going to be a different security environment in this city. People have to understand that they can't have an expectation of privacy in public places." Mr. Green also said, "We have to be open to more police," though he added that the city should impose a hiring freeze on other agencies to brace for tough economic times.
The forum will be shown again on NY1 at 9 p.m. tomorrow.
It was held on a day when at least two of the candidates resumed something approaching a regular campaign schedule. Mr. Ferrer began his day at the Harlem headquarters of the Rev. Al Sharpton, while Mr. Green held a news conference with Jerry Hauer, the first head of New York's Office of Emergency Management, to talk about ways to improve public security.
With Mr. Giuliani still a huge presence, , all three Democrats said that they would want him to play some role in the rebuilding.
Of the three, Mr. Ferrer embraced the idea the least, saying that Mr. Giuliani "can play a strong role in that -- and others will, too."
By contrast, Mr. Hevesi said he was open to having Mr. Giuliani assume an official position in his administration if the mayor would accept it. (Before the campaign began, Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Giuliani enjoyed fairly cordial relations, though in the last days before Sept. 11, Mr. Hevesi was accusing Mr. Giuliani of running a smear campaign to derail his candidacy.)
Mr. Green said he would want Mr. Giuliani to play a role in the reconstruction effort but stopped short of saying he would offer him an official position.
Mr. Green, in response to a question, compared the predicament of the man who will follow Mr. Giuliani with that of Harry S. Truman when he followed Franklin D. Roosevelt into the White House at the end of World War II. Truman, Mr. Green noted, filled the presidency during a turbulent time; the next mayor will do the same.
"We have one mayor at a time," he said, adding: "I am not concerned about being overshadowed. Somebody will pick up where Giuliani has left off."
Mr. Ferrer, Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Green all said they believed that the terrorist strike was having a traumatizing effect on the city's economy, and all said it would force them at least to defer promises they had made in the first part of this campaign. Mr. Hevesi said the city might have to turn to deficit spending -- borrowing money to finance expenses. And all the candidates said the next mayor would be forced to cut city spending drastically.
"There are going to have to be a substantial trimming of our sails," Mr. Ferrer said. "But I want to say again -- and I don't know where they are -- I mean obviously essential services cannot be cut. Education cannot be cut.
"We may well have to make some sacrifices in this city," Mr. Ferrer said. "At a moment like this, everyone is called upon to make sacrifices. But that means everyone."
Mr. Ferrer did not say what he believed could be cut, and neither did his opponents.
Mr. Hevesi said: "There's going to be tremendous pain. But to frighten people now in a theoretical exercise before you get elected and before you're there and know what the numbers are, I don't think is an appropriate thing to do."
Mr. Green said, "To chronicle and list now the possible cuts would panic people into thinking they are probable cuts." He added, "The top two priorities are safety and security and rebuilding New York."
In one sure sign of the changing times, Mr. Green and Mr. Hevesi stepped back from their earlier calls to open up the plaza in front of City Hall to pedestrians; Mr. Giuliani had closed it, citing security considerations. Both said they would now defer to recommendations from police and security officials. But Mr. Ferrer said, "I continue to believe that the plaza of City Hall itself must be open for pedestrians, but not vehicles."
In response to a question, Mr. Ferrer said he did not think that what had been the fundamental appeal of his campaign -- that he was an advocate of "the other New York," which had been neglected under Mr. Giuliani -- was any less valid in the wake of the attack. Indeed, even as Mr. Ferrer described the city's economic rescue as its "most urgent priority," he repeatedly expressed concern that other problems facing the city might be neglected.
"It's fair to say that on Sept. 11 much of our world and our city changed," Mr. Ferrer said. "That doesn't mean that the other problems that for example impelled me to run for mayor -- education and housing and health care and permanently good relationships between police and community -- are unimportant or have fallen off the radar screen."
The candidates did not skirmish even once, and for the most part, they avoided what could be taken as direct or indirect political appeals.
There were some exceptions. Mr. Green and Mr. Hevesi both made sure to note that they had toured the disaster site. "All of us who visited it were struck by the horror," Mr. Green said in answer to the first question of the day.
And they both said their offices were involved in the relief efforts. "The first day that the -- when the towers collapsed, I converted my campaign operation into a disaster relief operation," Mr. Hevesi said.
For his part, Mr. Ferrer suggested that his record at rebuilding the Bronx helped prepare him to be mayor during this era.
And Mr. Green responded indirectly to the suggestion by Gov. George E. Pataki that New Yorkers cast a write-in vote for Mr. Giuliani. "Don't waste your vote with a write-in that is really frivolous," Mr. Green said. "Democracy is too important to be a game."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMY; 
Bush Tries to Steady Economy Jolted by Attack

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush predicted today that the economy would rebound "in America in the years ahead," but he faces a Congress and Federal Reserve already divided on policy and partisan lines over how to achieve that goal.
 As evidence mounts that the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington have deeply wounded an already weakened economy, Mr. Bush sought to reassure the country without committing himself to specific actions beyond bailing out the airline industry. 
 His vagueness about how or even whether he would seek to re-energize the faltering economy reflected debates in the White House, Congress and the Federal Reserve about acting quickly or waiting for a clearer picture to emerge from the post-attack chaos. 
Mr. Bush made his remarks in his weekly radio address as he spent the weekend at Camp David, consulting with his national security team and conferring by telephone with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Meanwhile, the military mobilization continued apace as B-52 bombers departed their base in the United States and aircraft carrier battle groups shifted positions. Page B3. 
The economic challenge became intense in recent days as airlines and other companies announced tens of thousands of layoffs, the stock market swooned, consumers grew jittery and the international outlook worsened. Though it will probably be months before it is made official, the economy may well have entered a recession this month, economists said. That would mean an end, after 10 and a half years, to the longest business expansion on record.
A survey of 44 economists this week by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a research firm, concluded that the economy would contract at an annual rate of 0.5 percent in the third quarter, which ends Sept. 30, and then shrink at a 0.7 percent pace in the final three months of the year. The most broadly used definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters in which economic output falls. 
On Friday, Northwest Airlines said it would lay off 10,000 workers, bringing to more than 100,000 the job losses in the last week just in the airline and aviation industries. And by the time trading ended on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average had lost 14.3 percent for the week, its worst weekly performance since early in the Depression. 
In his weekly radio address to the nation today, Mr. Bush sought to assure Americans that the economy remains fundamentally strong and that its entrepreneurial spirit remains undimmed.
"The terrorists who attacked the United States on Sept. 11 targeted our economy as well as our people," Mr. Bush said. "They brought down a symbol of American prosperity, but they could not touch its source." 
But if the rough patch the economy is sure to encounter in coming weeks and months should become something worse or go on for a long time, it could diminish the public's enthusiasm for the campaign against terrorism, undermine Mr. Bush politically and further reshape the nation's domestic agenda. 
The administration and both parties in Congress are weighing a broad range of responses, including tax cuts for individuals and businesses and new spending programs. But the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill are already beginning to stake out differing positions, suggesting that longstanding ideological clashes will complicate efforts to reach a bipartisan agreement.
The debate has been shaped in the last week by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who counseled patience and warned that a hasty move to stimulate the economy through further tax cuts and government spending could backfire. But Mr. Greenspan does not have to run for re-election or maintain political support in the way that Mr. Bush and Congress do as they lead the nation into an open-ended conflict. 
On Friday, two influential business groups advised the White House to move quickly to push a stimulus package through Congress, suggesting that the economy might be deteriorating faster than the administration recognized. But administration officials said they remained as concerned about doing too much for the economy as they were about not doing enough.
"We don't want to overstimulate and just have an inflation problem long term," said Kenneth W. Dam, the deputy treasury secretary, referring to the possibility that an overheated economy could set off a surge in prices.
But with inflation a distant threat and layoffs, lost profits and tumbling stock prices defining the economic landscape in the here and now, political pressure is building to take action. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill told Congress on Thursday that the administration is "looking at every instrument that's ever been used before, and some that haven't" to give the economy a boost if necessary. 
Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Dam have both hinted in the last few days that the administration's preference, should it go ahead with a package, is to focus on permanent tax cuts for business, perhaps a reduction in corporate income taxes.
On Capitol Hill, many Republicans are pressing for a reduction in capital gains taxes, a step they say would help the stock market and provide capital to businesses by making investing more attractive. 
Most Democrats, by contrast, are seeking temporary tax cuts for all workers, saying that the best tonic for the economy would be to put cash into the hands of people who would go out and spend it.
Should they decide to go ahead with a permanent package of tax cuts, administration officials said, they believe there is plenty of money available from projected surpluses.
Democrats, on the other hand, not only want to make any stimulative tax cut temporary, they would also like to roll back parts of the tax bill Mr. Bush signed into law this year. The Democrats especially want to reverse those, like the repeal of the federal estate tax, that do not take effect until the end of the decade. 
The case for a permanent reduction in corporate taxes, Mr. Dam said, is that it would "change corporate investment decisions overnight" by freeing up more cash and promising a higher rate of return on new plants and equipment. 
The case against it, he said, is "fundamentally political" because it would be portrayed as a break for powerful special interests, a characterization that he said was unfair. 
But some economists say that companies are suffering from excess production capacity, not from a lack of investment capital, and are not going to expand their operations until demand from consumers increases. 
"Any stimulus ought to put money in people's pockets to give a lift to the economy now," said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "It has to be coupled with long-term fiscal discipline to take the pressure off long-term rates."

 BODY:
 THE GLOBAL PICTURE

THE SEARCH FOR BIN LADEN -- Now the manhunt begins, on an epic scale, in a vast and forbidding landscape, and for a man whose cunning is internationally renowned. The United States has demanded the handover of Osama bin Laden under threat of American military might, and the Muslim clerics who rule Afghanistan have finally refused. More than that, the bearded men of the Taliban have challenged America to a fight. B3

TRACKING THE TERRORISTS -- Officials in Europe, the United States and Pakistan say they have identified new elements of the bin Laden terrorist network, including a top lieutenant in Europe and a previously undisclosed cell in the Gaza Strip. At least 11,000 terrorists have been trained in the past five years at camps operated by Mr. bin laden in Afghanistan, these officials say. A1

AN UNSTABLE REGION -- As the Bush administration contemplates military strikes in Afghanistan, some officials fear that too strong a blow could create a dangerous opportunity for Afghanistan's powerful neighbors to compete, even clash, over control of the territory. News analysis. B2

CANADA'S CHOICES -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien travels to Washington tomorrow to meet President Bush to discuss America's war against terrorism. But Mr. Chretien is under intense political pressure, from both right and left, as he faces decisions on what to promise Washington. B7

RELIEF EFFORTS UNDER WAY -- Anticipating a huge exodus of Afghans if the United States strikes at their country, international aid agencies have already begun a major relief effort in the region. B7

INTERPOL'S CHANGING WORLD -- The terror attacks on the United States are rewriting the agenda of Interpol, the police agency representing 178 nations, and perhaps its future. B7

A NATION SEVERS TIES -- The United Arab Emirates, one of only three countries to have recognized the Taliban government, broke off relations with Afghanistan because of its refusal to hand over bin Laden. B3

READY TO MOVE -- American forces moved into position for the campaign against terrorism as the Pentagon called up more reservists and President Bush consulted with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. B3

ON THE HOME FRONT

THE FALTERING ECONOMY -- President Bush predicted the economy would rebound "in America in the years ahead," but he faces a Congress and Federal Reserve divided on policy and partisan lines over how to achieve that goal. A1

THE WAR ROOM -- In his speech to Congress, President Bush boldly defined the enemy in his war against terrorism as "any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism." The wording and new strategy that springs from it were the distillation of seven days of intense exchanges -- at the White House and at Camp David -- among the members of Mr. Bush's war council. A1

GERM WARFARE -- Experts say civil defenses across the nation are a rudimentary patchwork that could prove inadequate for what might lie ahead: a terrorist attack involving deadly germs or toxic chemicals. B12

CONFLICTED ON PROFILING -- For many Americans who say they have deeply believed that it was wrong for police officers to single out members of minorities for special interrogation or searches, the terrorist attacks have prompted a painful confrontation with the sudden anxieties they acknowledge feeling in the presence of people of Arab background. A1

HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT -- There was a chilling focus to the madness that left thousands dead on Sept. 11. If the hijackers knew how their operation was to end, they managed to keep their resolve for months even as they strolled through malls, shopped for groceries and went to the gym. B1

IMAGES OF OLD GLORY -- Americans started buying flags hours after the attacks, and the oldest flag factory owned by the oldest and largest flag company in the United States has tripled production. Many employees at the factory in New Jersey have gained a different perspective on their work. B6

LIFELINES CUT -- The terrorist attacks on the twin towers has not only left families across the New York area in dire straits, both emotional and economic. It has taken away men and women who were lifelines for needy families and impoverished towns halfway across the world. B6

RETURNING HOME, UNEASILY -- Several thousand residents returned to Lower Manhattan, to apartments coated with dust. But those who live in the reopened buildings, at the northern end of Battery Park City, say they worry about the environment and safety. B11

RETHINKING THE FAMILIAR -- Habit in New York City vanished in the wake of the World Trade Center disaster, and everywhere, the ordinary has been invested with the tragic. B11

MAPPING GROUND ZERO -- Using a laser-based instrument, scientists are making accurate topographic images of the twin towers site, in hopes that they can help firefighters and rescue workers navigate the mounds and chasms of debris and identify areas that may shift or collapse. B1

A TIME OF NEED

THE CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND -- No list has been compiled of children who lost a father or mother at the World Trade Center or the Pentagon, or on the four planes that terrorists took to fiery ends. Communities face an unprecedented challenge: how to comfort, and raise, all of the thousands of children who lost a parent -- in some cases their only parent -- in an event of epic dimensions. A1

IN THE LINE OF DUTY -- Although they often face hazardous working conditions, New York City's emergency medical service workers are classified as civilian employees, ineligible for the pensions that are paid to the survivors of members of the uniformed services who die in the line of duty, a union official said.

HEADLINE: South Korea Lowers Forecast On Growth to 2%-3% Range 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
The South Korean finance ministry lowered its expectations today for the nation's economy this year in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States.
 While business has been slumping for quite some time now, a finance ministry official said that the economy was now expected to grow at a rate of 2 percent to 3 percent compared with the 4 percent to 5 percent predicted two months ago. 
 The revised forecast follows a week of signs of increasing weakness, including an effort by the nation's central bank to encourage business by reducing the benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percent, to 4 percent, a record low. 
The central bank estimated that figures for the third quarter would show growth of 0.5 percent after rates of 3.7 percent in the first quarter and 2.7 percent in the second quarter. The economy grew 8 percent last year and 10 percent in 1999 as South Korea rebounded from the Asian economic crisis.
Some Koreans say that Washington's threatened war against terrorism has exacerbated a downward trend in the prices of semiconductors and electronics products, which have plunged to record lows amid sharply reduced demand in the United States and Japan, the two largest customers.
"I cannot expect the Korean economy to get better," said Park Jin Dal, leader of a research team for the independent Korea International Trade Association, who predicted that exports would not improve for at least six months and possibly a year.
Exports to the United States have fallen 11.4 percent this year, he said, while exports to Japan are down 9.2 percent and total exports have dropped 8.9 percent. He attributed most of that to the falling prices of electronics products, which account for 25 percent of export earnings.
Mr. Park warned of the additional effect a shooting war would have on South Korean construction companies, already hard hit by declining orders. "Korea expects to earn $10 billion in plant construction projects this year," he said. "I'm afraid there will be some slowdown, rescheduling, cancellation and delays."
The terrorist attacks have already forced the country's two commercial airlines, Korean Air and Asiana, to cut back flights and announce layoffs, as big carriers in the United States and Europe have done.
The government said the airlines could now add a surcharge equivalent of $1.25 to each passenger ticket to cover the cost of additional war-risk insurance -- a total of $2.5 million a month for Korean Air and $1.36 million for Asiana. The airlines, facing huge losses, are expected to press this week for a package of tax relief and special subsidies.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MEETINGS; 
Remote Rendezvous

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Mike Kolleth, a Dow Chemical executive in Zurich, should have been at a Web site design session in Midland, Mich. The sales representatives at Thomson Financial in Boston were supposed to be showing new products to customers in Chicago and San Francisco. Vince Engel, president of a San Francisco ad agency, was scheduled to fly to San Diego for a presentation to Adidas, his most important client. 
 Like hundreds of other business travelers grounded by caution and canceled flights, none of them actually appeared in person at their appointed rounds last week. 
 Instead, they sent avatars through the ether, as would characters from "Star Trek," or a country recovering from a terrorist attack and experimenting with alternative ways to do business. 
Many companies turned to videoconferencing, teleconferencing and Internet-based collaboration tools right after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. That short-term surge in interest, analysts said, was probably behind the jump in the share prices last week of several providers of such technology, including Polycom, Picturetel and Webex.
But even as fears of flying began to recede and airline schedules returned to near normal, there were signs that the moment of crisis might be prompting a nation of road warriors to consider supplementing travel with teletechnology as a general practice. 
"We said, 'Dang, we should be doing this more often,' " said Mr. Engel, who held his San Diego Adidas meeting at a videoconference center in San Francisco that was booked solid last week. "I was amazed at how there was no lag time." 
No one expects a business culture that is filled with maxims like "you can't fax a handshake" to replace face-to-face meetings with videocameras and Internet chats. But executives across many industries say newly heightened concerns for safety are adding gravity to other factors that were already weighing against frequent business travel: technical advances, stretched schedules and an expanding universe of far-flung offices that are hard to get to.
The current enforced break from what is for many a long-ingrained travel habit may help, too. At Dow Chemical, where travel was severely curtailed last week, the company's internal videoconferencing "help desk" oversaw a doubling of activity on its 120 conferencing systems around the world, which had often lain idle in the past. 
"This is one of those catastrophic events that will change the standard operating procedure," said Chris Duncan, Dow's global leader of e-communication technology. "Your human nature is going to say, 'Is there any other way I can do this without going on a plane?' And once people are forced into using these tools because there's no other way, I think the comfort level will go up." 
Still, if the history of virtual communications is any guide, the more business people communicate with high-technology tools, the more likely they are also to want to have a cup of coffee together or make small talk during a pause in a face-to-face conference. 
"What we find, at least up until last week, is that people using these tools get excited and feel the need to meet in person," said James Katz, a professor of communications at Rutgers, whose research shows that millions of in-person meetings have been generated by people who first met online. "These kinds of technologies can stimulate as well as substitute for travel." 
What seems probable is that the suddenly pressing need for tools like videoconferencing and the Internet will speed their social acceptability. Without such an incentive, resistance to new technologies can otherwise stall their adoption for years. Professor Katz notes, for example, that it took about a decade for Americans to shift from finding an answering machine rude to finding it rude not to have one. 
Particularly as a rocky economy places a premium on conveying timely information to employees and investors, dabbling with such technologies may induce executives to adopt them as part of an ever-expanding communications array -- regardless of their travel schedules. 
"The need to communicate is increasing every day," said Frank Bordonaro, who is chief learning officer for the insurer Prudential and who already "beams" executives to various sites with some frequency. "This recent spike may be a replacement for travel, but in the longer term it's just going to be another slice of an increasing stack of communication that has to be done." 
Reservations at a Norwalk, Conn., videoconferencing center that Prudential rents out for public use at $350 to $450 an hour doubled last week, Mr. Bordonaro said. One company scheduled an eight-hour conference, for example, and another convened a virtual meeting that linked 10 sites. 
Many companies that were already urging customers and clients to accept virtual forms of communication found them more receptive last week. For more than a year, MFS Investment Management, a Boston-based financial services company, has offered video presentations for its clients to watch online. The online productions, which integrate slides, charts and graphs, are about a tenth the cost of a simple telephone conference call -- and far less than sending analysts to meet individual clients. 
But it was not until last week, when MFS canceled 40 face-to-face meetings, that it garnered its biggest Web audience ever, with about 1,000 clients logging in to hear the company's views on the state of the stock market and a range of other subjects. 
"People used to say 'Well, that's great that you have the video, but before I give you $100 million for this pension account I want that manager to fly across the country to see me,' " said Jerry Potts, MFS's director of corporate marketing and communications. "But there's a window now where it's kind of tough to demand that someone you know gets on a plane." 
David B. Snow, president of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, whose offices in 1 World Trade Center were destroyed, said the most useful virtual communications tool for him personally during the turmoil has been his cellular phone. But for the long term, Mr. Snow said, he is finding a silver lining in the quadrupling of customer use of the company's Web site to retrieve claims information after the disaster. Visits to a Web site, of course, are not the same as a person-to-person meeting, but as are teleconferences, the activity is a virtual stand-in for direct interpersonal communication.
"We've wanted to see that for some time, but we're hoping people will like it and stay with it," Mr. Snow said. "It's my belief that when people have the experience, they'll say this is a much better substitute for putting things in the mail or calling an '800' number. People don't do this, if they don't have a need. But it was a great way to drive adoption -- not that I would ever want to do it this way." 
Yet, political and military crises have long stimulated adoption of new telecommunications technologies. A chain of semaphore towers was built on hilltops across France to convey information to Napoleon's armies during their protracted campaign in Egypt. And the telegraph took off during the Civil War when it was needed to coordinate the movement of the North's armies. 
More recently, the Persian Gulf war sparked a flurry of interest in videoconferencing, but in the early 90's the technology was so expensive and disheartening to use -- calls were often dropped in the middle, and lip movements failed to synchronize with the sound -- that many who tried it then still disdain it now. And some analysts believe the current interest in the technology will similarly subside, despite the significant decrease in cost of equipment. 
For many, other kinds of virtual communication may make more sense. At Thomson Financial, sales representatives in the Boston office spent last week leading customers through a demonstration with technology from Webex, which allows several people in different sites to view the same presentation on a computer screen as well as see one another in a video window. There is usually also a regular telephone connection. 
Several telephone teleconference companies said they, too, saw a marked increase in use of their services last week, including AT&T, one of the largest providers, which saw its teleconference business pick up 20 percent over usual levels. 
For those intent on owning their own videoconferencing systems, the set-up costs $5,000 to $15,000, plus the installation and monthly cost of a high-speed phone line and a monitor, which can range from a basic TV to a $20,000 flat-panel screen. 
And even so, at a videoconference last Thursday involving the New York, Boston and Washington offices of the law firm of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo, the people on the screen looked as if they were moving in slow motion, and it was difficult to discern individual faces around the large conference table in Boston. 
But Joan G. Howland, the firm's director of human resources, said reading the body language of her colleagues during video calls had often helped her sense problems she could follow up on later, which she might not have flagged during phone calls. The firm plans to increase its use of the technology and to pay for a higher-speed connection, which should improve the video.
Don Western, a vice president at the heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar in Mossville, Ill., says the company has no such kinks in its system. It has invested heavily in videoconferencing the last two years, and when Mr. Western was forced to cancel a trip to Europe last week, he was able to conduct the product review remotely. The trick, he said, is to have a moderator for the meetings and to instill a courteous protocol so that people do not interrupt each other. 
"Selfishly, it's a very useful tool not just from a business standpoint but from a personal standpoint," Mr. Western said. "I like to see my wife. We've been together 32 years. But I like seeing her, and I'm still away half the time."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
Back From the Big City, Just Hangin' Out With the Rubes

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
Even the most banal sitcom has been touched by the events of Sept. 11.
 The opening episode of "The Ellen Show" was changed by CBS at the last minute to excise a line of dialogue the network feared might seem offensive. Originally the pilot contained this exchange between Ellen (Ellen DeGeneres) and her mother (Cloris Leachman): 
 Ellen: "My business collapsed."
Mom: "Well, thank your lucky stars you weren't there at the time."
The mother's response won't appear when the show has its premiere tonight. (It then moves to Fridays.) This may make the show more sensitive, but it doesn't make it good. The other lines of dialogue, unfortunately, remain intact.
The show seems modeled on the premise of "Normal, Ohio," the Fox comedy about a gay man who returns to his hometown, leaving behind his wife and son in Los Angeles. Didn't anyone at CBS notice that "Normal, Ohio" lasted only six weeks?
In "Ellen," Ms. DeGeneres plays Ellen Richmond, an Internet executive visiting her quiet hometown, which is celebrating her success in the big city (also Los Angeles) with a special "Ellen" day. What her success has been exactly is questionable. We learn at the outset that the Internet company -- the one that collapses during her visit home -- is her fourth business failure. But like so many dreary Hollywood comedies, this show seems to think that small-town life began and ended in Mayberry 40 years ago.
The people in Clark are fuzzy, sweet people who are happy to embrace Ellen. When he learns she is gay, her old high school economics teacher even tries to fix her up with the school's female phys-ed teacher, who immediately begins lusting for Ellen. 
This show feels like a throwback, to the old "Ellen," when Ms. DeGeneres was Ellen Morgan, before the character came out of the closet. Until then, for its first few seasons, the show was bland and predictable. But the main character's overt gayness seemed startling four years ago. The show got a ratings boost when Ellen kissed another woman, and the jolt seemed to inspire the writers. The writing improved, or maybe it just seemed that way because we were seeing something new on network television.
As this Ellen, Ms. DeGeneres offers a glib, ingratiating act that quickly becomes cloying. The show's bright spot is the appealing Jim Gaffigan, who plays Ellen's high school boyfriend, now a teacher in their hometown. He specializes in the rube who is actually intelligent as well as good-natured, a part he played so well in "Welcome to New York," one of last year's smarter comedy efforts but a ratings failure. He could use a better break than "Ellen," and so could we.

Straining communications systems to the limit.

BYLINE:  By Eli M. Noam; Eli M. Noan is a professor at the Columbia Business School, director of the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information and a former member of the New York State Public Service Commission.

 BODY:
WHEN tragedy strikes, people want to communicate -- immediately and copiously. After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, how well did our publicly available communications networks perform? So far, the reviews are mixed. And there are lessons that the public, communications executives and policy makers should learn from.
 The star performers were online: e-mail, instant messaging and bulletin boards. But Internet news sites and the wired and wireless telephone networks could stand improvement. And it is clear that there need to be new ways to set up emergency information systems. 
 Within minutes of the attacks, traditional telecommunications were stretched and overloaded. In New York, the collapse of the towers took out a big telephone switch and nearly a dozen cellular antenna sites in Lower Manhattan, but that was only part of the problem. Phone networks are not so much destroyed as congested into uselessness. 
Phone traffic more than doubled for many routes. Cellphone calls often quadrupled. Long-distance service on the East Coast often became an ordeal for voice callers, though it worked well for data traffic. 
As long-distance travel ground to a halt, communications use rose. Long-distance phone companies pleaded for people to make only essential calls, and gave priority to outgoing calls from emergency areas. Some people learned how to beat the system by calling collect, which often worked, but at a price. Others were left wondering what had happened to the network capacity glut to which Wall Street analysts had attributed the poor financial performance of long-distance companies.
International communications experienced the greatest problems. Trans-Atlantic telephone traffic from Britain was reportedly 10 times its normal volume. Less than half the telephone calls from Finland to the United States got through, and only about 10 percent of calls from Sweden and Taiwan. Even with the vast increase in international communications capacity over the last few years, other bottlenecks evidently remain.
No network can be economically designed for extreme load spikes. Nor would it be conceivable to jack up prices in the midst of tragedy to ration the existing capacity, when callers are least sensitive to economic signals. The better alternative for sudden spikes is to rank the priorities of various types of traffic, and divert the lowest-priority communications to other network providers that may have excess capacity, or to other types of networks. For example, voice calls that cannot get through could be replaced by voicemail messages that could be converted to compressed digital files and delivered as conditions allow. 
Cellphones were put to heroic uses, from under the rubble and from hijacked planes. Rescuers were issued free ones to aid their efforts. It seems hard to imagine how after this experience people would ever want to step out without their electronic security blanket. But cellphones also showed limitations, as people walked down city streets, cellphones glued to their ears, tears in their eyes, but frustration on their faces as they encountered busy signals or no signals at all, or eventually ran out of battery power. 
In Manhattan, many resorted to pay phones, which seemed to be mostly working, demonstrating the importance of such an old-fashioned backup system. And making pay phones temporarily free of charge in New York was a nice gesture by Verizon. 
But the chronic problems of getting through wirelessly demonstrated the need for more spectrum capacity on urban cellular networks -- something the carriers have been trying to obtain through a federal auction process that has hit numerous snags in Washington, leaving the United States behind Europe and Japan in telecom mobility. Yet even if the carriers do eventually receive more wireless spectrum space, they need to institute a better emergency priority system. One solution might be for the industry to adopt a contingency plan in which, during emergencies, carriers could automatically cut off mobile calls after a certain number of minutes. Cellphone text messaging might also become a more popular feature; the day of the disaster, brief text messages sent wirelessly typically made it through even when wireless voice calls did not, because such messages take up much less of the network's carrying capacity. 
These experiences also suggest that consumer organizations or others should test the traffic-jam vulnerabilities of different networks, so that individuals can make intelligent choices when they sign up for service. One day, their life may depend on it. 
Private business communications networks performed quite well. Financial firms and big companies are sophisticated users of information. Their data is backed up, and their networks are configured to adjust instantaneously to emergency conditions. Thank you, hackers of the world, for having kept everyone on their toes. But we need still more work to protect ourselves against cyberterrorism and information warfare that aims more deliberately to disrupt communications and data.
With the Internet, the experience was mixed. The high-capacity backbones functioned well, if slowly at times. Making voice phone calls over the Internet worked surprisingly well. But the Internet showed its limitations as a mass medium, when the masses logged on, as the most popular news Web sites were all but inaccessible in the first hour after the trade center attacks. 
The lesson is that if one wants to rapidly provide information of interest or urgency to millions of people, more or less at the same time, two great technologies are readily available. They are called broadcasting and cable. Afficionados of news Web sites may protest this characterization, but during peak need-to-know periods, Net news sites are less efficient. In the early going, the sites may best serve specialized audiences, or people for whom broadcast news sources are not available or are inadequate. 
Where the Internet excelled was in e-mail, instant messaging and bulletin boards. E-mail messages may have sometimes taken longer than usual to arrive, but they typically did arrive. And they diverted billions of voice calls from the long-distance telephone networks, freeing up vital network capacity. A five-minute voice phone call consumes as much transmission capacity as about 4,000 e-mail messages of typical length. 
The Internet's singular contribution was bulletin boards. People posted news that they were well, or said how they could be reached. Other boards listed unofficially the names of people reported missing. Still others included requests for help locating missing friends and relatives -- postings that were hard to read with dry eyes. 
The emergence of these Net tools and practices provides lessons for the future of official emergency communication systems. It is time to revise the basic emergency communication philosophy of official public-safety agencies, which have traditionally employed military-style chains of command in which information is coordinated before being released to the public. 
A similar philosophy also permeates the federal Emergency Alert System (formerly known as the Emergency Broadcast System), in which official bulletins are being issued over all broadcast stations and cable systems (though not Web news sites). The system might be useful in sounding the alarm when the population is facing imminent missile strikes, tsunamis or radiation leaks. But it cannot (and did not on Sept. 11) do much by way of coordination once the calamity has struck.
A more effective approach would be to adopt Internet practices and technologies and supplement the 911 emergency telephone service by what might be called an "811" system. By dialing 811 over telephones, cellphones or computers, individuals would gain access to a regional "emergency portal" with links to a variety of official, nonprofit and ad hoc Web sites that spring up during a crisis. 
Much of the information would also be available to distant parties, thereby reducing the workload on telephone hot lines that are chronically busy when they are needed most. Such a service could be used to give news organizations detailed data and sources, could link worldwide donors with actual needs and provide access to specialized databases -- on how to deal with toxic substances, for instance. When necessary, secrecy of data could be controlled through special levels of access authorization.
In fact, the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster shows that such a system is emerging spontaneously on the Internet. But the public agencies are still far behind the public in making use of this medium and contributing much to it beyond official announcements. 
The data packets of the Internet find their own way around disasters, just as their creators in the 1960's envisioned when they financed the development of the Internet's precursor to deal with an earlier threat -- Soviet missiles. Technology is not the solution to the problem of terrorism. But what we have seen in the last two weeks is that the multifaceted communications system is more resistant to attack than skyscrapers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Industry analysts step back to reassess ad spending estimates, and the picture is not pretty.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
THE deterioration of the outlook for the national economy after the terrorist attacks is leading advertising industry analysts to reassess their estimates for ad spending this year and next. In almost every instance, they are predicting no growth, or steeper cutbacks, for 2001 and 2002.
 At the same time, advertisers and agencies are reassessing marketing plans as they continue to change, postpone or cancel campaigns. 
 "We are entering new and uncharted territory," said Leland Westerfield, an analyst at UBS Warburg in New York. He revised his estimate for this year to a 5 percent decline in spending from 2000, compared with a 4 percent decline he had estimated previously. 
For 2002, Mr. Westerfield said, he now predicts a 2 percent decline from 2001, compared with his previous estimate of flat spending.
"Advertising has never declined two years in a row," he added, but the "high likelihood" of canceled commitments for network television commercial time by marketers in categories like travel, financial and automotive makes that possible.
The worsening outlook for ad spending was the reason given on Friday by Havas Advertising in Paris for abandoning a $620 million takeover bid for the Tempus Group in London.
Kevin Sullivan, an analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, gave two reasons for estimating that ad spending this year could decline by 3.3 percent to 3.5 percent from 2000 rather than by 2.3 percent as he previously forecast.
One reason was the inability of advertisers to spend $750 million to $1.25 billion in the days immediately after the assaults as media outlets undertook continuous news coverage and the broadcast TV networks postponed the start of the 2001-2002 season until today. The other reason Mr. Sullivan gave was the possibility of cutbacks in ad spending by travel, tourism and entertainment marketers.
For now, Mr. Sullivan said, he would maintain his estimate that ad spending next year is to increase 2.5 percent from 2001, but would continue to monitor consumer and business confidence levels as well as the ability of economic growth to resume.
Jack Myers, chief economist for Myers Reports in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters, was more pessimistic.
"Based on the president's speech," Mr. Myers said, referring to President Bush's address to Congress Thursday night, "it looks like things are going to get worse before they get better."
As a result, he added, he had formally adopted a "worst case scenario" he proposed last month that ad spending in 2001 would decline by 6.6 percent from 2000. His previous forecast was for a decline of 4 percent.
Also, "if terrorist activities and U.S. responses continue" through 2002, Mr. Myers said, the effect on ad spending "could be radical." He now estimates ad spending next year will decline by as much as 7.4 percent from 2001. His previous estimate was for a decline of 1.7 percent.
Some marketers plan to continue ad spending at this time, only not for the products and services they would normally peddle.
The Lee Company, a division of the VF Corporation, will replace the commercials that typically appear for its Lee Dungarees with a spot featuring the brand's spokescharacter, Buddy Lee, promoting the American Red Cross.
"We wanted to do something for our young audience, give them a good message," said David Lubars, executive creative director at the Minneapolis office of Fallon Worldwide, the Lee agency, owned by the Publicis Groupe. 
"The greater good is what's good for brands," he noted. "If you look at advertising during World War II, the stuff that was the most powerful was about the greater good." Fallon also produced a special newspaper ad that appeared on Friday for another client, United Airlines, a division of the UAL Corporation, that compared life on Sept. 10 with life on Sept. 11 and ended: "We join you in mourning. As we join you in strength."
The Buddy Lee commercial will run in time slots that Lee had earmarked for product advertising on three cable networks: Comedy Central, ESPN and MTV. Lee spends an estimated $10 million annually on television, print and interactive advertising for Lee Dungarees.
Anheuser-Busch is another marketer that will replace some product pitches with more altruistic messages. About 250 billboards and signs for beer brands like Budweiser and Bud Light -- including one on the scoreboard at Shea Stadium -- will be supplanted by posters of American flags without company or brand identification.
Anheuser-Busch has also started running a television commercial that salutes the Red Cross and rescue workers. The spot was produced by one of the company's roster agencies, the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. 
The Red Cross will benefit from a decision by Nortel Networks to donate $3.5 million worth of commercial time -- the company's remaining TV ad budget through the end of the year -- to the organization to run public service announcements.
"The greatest use of this time right now is to help the Red Cross do what it does best," said Emma Carrasco, vice president for global advertising and branding at Nortel in Sunrise, Fla. "We hope other large companies will follow our lead." Nortel will continue to advertise in print and online.
Another company making a donation is Cisco Systems, which along with the Y.M.C.A. of the United States is financing a public service announcement for the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York that promotes unity and tolerance. The spot features the actor Esai Morales from the ABC series "NYPD Blue."
Marketers will be asked to donate commercial time so the spot can be guaranteed to appear, said Hank Seiden, chairman at the New York Y.M.C.A.'s agency, the Seiden Group, rather than depending on the kindness of local stations to run it on a pro bono basis.
There has been anxiety over the plans of the major automotive marketers, because the auto category typically accounts for more ad spending than any other. The Big Three domestic auto marketers are all now advertising.
The General Motors Corporation is advertising individual models like the new Buick Rendezvous all-wheel vehicle -- carrying the perhaps now counterintuitive theme, "It's all good" -- as well as a promotion, "Keep America Rolling," offering interest-free loans on cars and trucks through Oct. 31. The campaign for the promotion is being created by the Buick and G. M. corporate agency, the Troy, Mich., office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
The Ford Motor Company is beginning a similar promotion, "Ford Drives America," to offer interest-free loans on Ford division cars and trucks through Oct. 31. A campaign for the promotion is being produced by the division's agency, the Detroit office of J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group. 
The Chrysler Group, part of DaimlerChrysler, plans to resume tonight ads for its Chrysler and Dodge divisions, which are to appear during "Monday Night Football" on ABC. Print ads for the Jeep division, centered on a sponsorship of "Band of Brothers," the HBO mini-series about World War II, resumed last week.
The Chrysler Group will also resume running a Jeep TV commercial for "Band of Brothers" that began appearing on Sept. 10, said James Kenyon, a company spokesman in Auburn Hills, Mich., adding that plans for five additional spots would be modified.
Those spots, which are to include brief clips of scenes from the series, "will be changed to use more of the celebratory footage from 'Band of Brothers,' " he added, "rather than some of the more violent scenes" as had been originally planned.
Speaking of anxiety, GlaxoSmithKline has postponed the introduction of a television campaign for Paxil, its antidepressant prescription drug. Two spots from McCann-Erickson New York, directed by the documentary film maker Barbara Kopple, were to have started appearing last Monday.
"We will launch it, but haven't set a date yet," said Holly Russell, a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline in Research Triangle Park, N.C. "We're waiting for the right time."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: MARKET PLACE; 
Asthe Economic Ground Zero Shudders, Ripples Spread

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon has worsened the outlook for corporate profits, drastically in some industries and less so in others.
 Measuring that damage, however, will take time. Distinguishing between the fallout from the attack and the drag from an already slumping economy will be difficult. 
 For the hardest-hit sectors, including insurance, brokerage firms, airlines, travel and entertainment, much of the bad news is out. But it could become worse, especially as the depth of the insurance claims becomes clearer and the nation learns whether the disruptions that have hit the airlines and entertainment industry are temporary or longer lasting. 
And now the bad news on earnings is spreading across the economy to housing, autos and the retail sector, according to analysts who say that the economy has been pushed into a recession by the attacks.
The extent of the damage will be known only as hundreds of companies gauge the effect of things like the expected drop in consumer spending and the supply disruptions that have already led to production cuts at the large automakers.
The damage will not be limited to the third quarter, although many companies, like insurers, will take their biggest earnings reduction in this quarter. The main impact for other companies could come in the fourth quarter.
But there is no doubt that the effect is spreading. The Ford Motor Company, which said soon after the attacks that it would miss its earnings projection of 10 cents a share for the third quarter, announced no-interest financing on new cars and trucks last week. General Motors did the same. Both automakers have announced production cutbacks.
A J. D. Power & Associates survey of dealers said that auto sales plunged as much as 33 percent in the first weekend after the attacks.
"There were painful profit pressures in most sectors of the economy in the months leading up to the attack," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist at Hoenig & Company. "Now this will sharply depress the top line of some companies and reduce the top line of others."
Eastman Kodak is an example of a company that was already hurt by the slowing economy and faces more profit damage in the attacks' aftermath. On Wednesday, Kodak said its third-quarter earnings would be as much as 45 percent lower than expected. But that revision was based on a 7 percent drop in total sales through August, compared with figures for the period a year earlier. The effect of the attacks is not factored into Wednesday's announcement, although Bob Brust, Kodak's chief financial officer, said in a statement: "Unfortunately, the U.S. economy is showing signs of further slowing, exacerbated by the Sept. 11 attack. Kodak, like other companies, is already seeing signs of weakness related to last week's attack."
Of course, there will be companies and sectors that will get more business, including military contractors. Some will have a lot more business. But companies are not trumpeting such good news, although investors have pushed their stocks higher.
The effect of the sharp corporate profit decline, both before and after the attacks, goes beyond the companies and their investors. As profits fall further, companies will lay off workers and reduce production to respond to weakening consumer demand. Airlines have already announced thousands of layoffs, and some technology and chemical companies have added to those numbers.
Mr. Barbera said many companies were delaying layoffs or production cutbacks in hopes that the economic slowdown, which started 15 months before the attacks, would be over soon enough to avoid them. The attacks, he said, have forced "a brutal capitulation in the corporate community, so there will be some mushrooming in layoffs and reducing production." Those additional cutbacks could steepen the economic decline, putting more pressure on profits.
In addition, the corporate losses for many companies are going to cut into federal and state corporate tax revenue. That means the federal budget surplus will shrink faster, and that will put pressure on states to reduce spending because most of them cannot run deficits.
Corporations will be earning less than expected, so they will pay less than expected in corporate income taxes this year. Some will also be receiving refunds for payments already made that turn out to have been too high.
When Berkshire Hathaway announced last week that its reinsurance business would have $2.2 billion in estimated losses, it said it would "receive an immediate tax benefit in the form of a reduction of estimated taxes payable during the remainder of 2001 and a prompt refund of estimated payments made earlier in the year."
The parade of profit warnings since Sept. 11 has been steady. Almost 80 companies have said that their third-quarter earnings will be below expectations or that they may even post a loss. Those companies include the EMC Corporation, a data storage company; Hilton Hotels; McDonald's; CVS, the drugstore chain; PPG Industries, the paint maker; General Electric; American Express; MetLife; Berkshire Hathaway; and Dow Chemical. For some companies, the terrorism is the reason, for some it is the slowing economy, and for some it is both.
Thomson Financial/First Call, which compiles analysts' earnings estimates, said that the insurance company losses announced so far had added just more than 3 percentage points to an earnings decline for the third quarter, which was already down 14.6 percent.
In airlines, the losses and the layoffs mounted so quickly that the Bush administration and Congress have rushed to approve a rescue package for the industry.
Wall Street analysts have already increased the loss for the American Airlines' parent, AMR, to $1.79 a share in the third quarter from 81 cents, First Call says. In the fourth quarter the loss is up to $2.32 a share, from 98 cents. The earnings forecast for Continental Airlines has dropped to 14 cents a share, from 63 cents, in the third quarter, and to a loss of 79 cents a share in the fourth quarter, from a profit of 15 cents a share.
Brokerage firms, some hurt by the plunge in stocks all year and others by that and the dislocations from the attacks, are warning of lower profits. Both Citigroup and American Express, which is also feeling the fallout on the travel and leisure industry, said earnings would be less than expected. American Express was driven from its headquarters by the attacks, and Citigroup, which owns Travelers, said its earnings would be hurt by insurance claims and market disruptions. Hilton Hotels also lowered its earnings forecast.
Wall Street analysts had already projected earnings declines, compared with the quarter a year earlier, of 14.6 percent for the third quarter and 4.3 percent for the fourth quarter because the economy has slowed more than many economists had expected six months ago.
That would mean four consecutive quarters of corporate earnings declines, the first time that has occurred since the recession of 1990-1991. But back then, the overall earnings decline lasted two years.
Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, estimates that the third-quarter decline will wind up at 22 percent while the fourth quarter will show a 15 percent to 20 percent decline, after more data is in. "I am afraid we are in for a lot of bad news in the next month or so," he said.
Special accounting guidance tentatively approved last week by a task force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board will allow claims connected to the attacks -- as well as airlines' loss of aircraft and any settlements with victims' beneficiaries -- to be classified as extraordinary, perhaps reducing the stock market impact of these losses.
Claims losses by insurers are not extraordinary, which means that they force these companies to show losses this quarter.
One issue is whether some companies will try to include other losses under the Sept. 11 banner, a move that would make their performance look better than it should. "That is a risk," Mr. Hill said. "I don't know how much they can get away with."
The companies that can are likely to announce, as Citigroup did last Monday, that they will meet or beat earnings expectations for this quarter, or have already done so, excluding the effect of the terrorist attacks.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE COVERAGE; 
Networks Move to Revive Foreign News

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
Only a month ago, Walter Isaacson, the new chairman of CNN, spoke expansively about the need to broaden the definition of news. Audience interest in foreign affairs was waning, he said, and so was interest in Washington.
 CNN -- acknowledged to be the last holdout among the major news networks in veering toward softer subjects -- would increase its focus on entertainment and technology, health and fitness, he said. Personalities -- stars -- would carry programming when news could not. "The goal should be to make the news smart, but also fun and fascinating," he said. 
 A month later, Mr. Isaacson and other news executives who echoed his sentiments are sounding like they have found religion, as if the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 had shaken them from a daze in which their focus was lost. Hard news, even foreign news, is back in vogue. 
"It's helped all of us regain our focus," Mr. Isaacson said of the attacks. "It's injected a note of real seriousness. And the things we think of doing to chase ratings now pale in comparison to the importance of doing this story seriously and reliably."
But the expressions of contrition seem convenient in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, and the question remains: will the sentiments be converted into the hard cash it takes to finance foreign coverage?
That is the issue in corporate media offices where executives -- especially at the broadcast networks -- grapple with criticism that TV news had given foreign news the elbow for a decade, and had therefore failed to convey the importance of developments in the Middle East beyond those related to the fighting between Israelis and Palestinians. This, the reasoning went, left its audience ill-prepared to understand the dynamics that led to the attacks.
Some executives still wonder if the nation's attention span for the terrorist story will be short. Nonetheless, they are discussing whether to redeploy troops and revive heavy overseas coverage beyond what is necessary to follow current developments.
They will have a lot to revive. Before the attacks, television news was deep into a retreat from covering international affairs. According to the Tyndall Report, which monitors television news content, foreign bureaus provided only a third as many minutes of coverage for the evening newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC in 2000 (1,382) than they did in 1989 (4,032), a high point.
The network news divisions have significantly cut the number of overseas bureaus they maintain and are relying heavily on dispatches from bureaus in London. For instance, ABC News had 17 foreign bureaus 15 years ago. It has 7 now, closing them in places like Damascus, Frankfurt and Warsaw. CBS said it had similarly cut back, and NBC said it maintained staff in 17 foreign sites worldwide but had significantly reduced its overseas staff. 
In an opinion article published in the French newspaper Le Monde last week, the president of CNN International Networks, Chris Cramer, wrote that many of the networks had traded international coverage for ratings, with "most of CNN's competitors focusing on U.S. news only."
He said those networks had "committed the worst crime of journalism" in "the failure to make the important interesting."
Network news executives take great issue with this. They say that the Tyndall Report did not take into account segments on news programs like "60 Minutes" and "60 Minutes II" on CBS and "Nightline" on ABC. But the executives did acknowledge that overseas coverage had been scaled back in recent years.
Many reasons are given for the retreat, ranging from the end of the Cold War, the more ruthless economics of television and a belief among TV executives that young adults care far more about the zone diet than the subtleties of Middle East diplomacy.
Andrew Tyndall, publisher of the Tyndall Report, said that foreign coverage slackened most when Bill Clinton became president. Elected on a domestic agenda, he generally scaled back overseas military activity, giving networks less reason to maintain overseas operations. 
And it is not as if international news has been on the top of the list of things that have interested news viewers -- it usually ranks low on surveys of what they want to watch.
"Generally what people look for in news are things that are relevant and salient and relate to their personal lives," said David F. Poltrack, executive vice president for research at CBS. "International news generally didn't fall into that category and therefore was somewhat down the list of the topics they wanted to see covered in the news."
Erik Sorenson, president of MSNBC, blamed a "national fog of materialism and disinterest and avoidance." Even after staff reductions, he said, TV news could have done more foreign coverage. But, he said: "The public interest and the newsworthiness of international news has been such that the networks didn't even use the resources they had overseas. It was a content issue. There was a decision made not to air these kinds of stories."
Those decisions were supported by slumping ratings. For instance, an ABC News prime-time special about India and Pakistan, "The Dark Horizon," in March 2000, did poorly in the ratings. It drew 7 million viewers, and a small share of young adults. The prime-time audience for ABC that year was, on average, 14 million.
Those figures became hard to ignore as the TV news business became more competitive -- with the Fox News Channel and MSNBC adding to an already crowded mix -- and as advertisers and even reporters who cover media put an ever larger importance on the young audience.
Mr. Isaacson said CNN was one of the networks that had lost its way. In the last year, the Fox News Channel began to gain on CNN -- which had stuck with its hard-news formula -- with a strong mix of opinionated talk-show hosts. So CNN's domestic network began to reverse course from so much hard news, arguing that, with some notable exceptions, there was none. Its executives began talking about building its own stable of opinionated and telegenic stars, knowing that, if needed, the network's vast international reach was there in times of crisis.
"In retrospect," Mr. Isaacson said last week, "when we had a period of no urgent news, we all -- all, and not just CNN -- probably spent too much time looking for different approaches that could attract higher ratings."
Of the attacks, he said: "I think this has been a wake-up call to the public and to all of us in the news business that there are certain things that really matter more than the latest trivial thing that can cause a ratings boost."
That may be the right thing to say in the current climate. But it will be a lot harder to sustain deeper foreign coverage, especially if viewer interest wanes. The advertising climate is already bleak. And coverage of military maneuvering overseas is costly. 
Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said a prolonged conflict could put added pressure on the networks to strike cost-sharing deals with one another and heat up talks already taking place at CNN and ABC and CNN and CBS. He said the broadcast networks are likely to need to increase their annual news budgets -- now an average of $300 million to $400 million each -- as much as 35 percent in years to come.
This all presumes a prolonged interest in foreign affairs. Whether public taste has taken a sharp turn for the long haul is hard to know. 
"A lot of things have changed in the world since Sept. 11," said Jeff Fager, executive producer of "60 Minutes II" on CBS. "People are going to want to know more about how the world is operating, what's going on outside our own borders and there's a lot of reporting to do."
But Paul Friedman, executive vice president of ABC News, said it was too soon to tell. "I just don't think there are any givens here," he said. "I don't know that the current interest will continue much beyond this story, however long it lasts."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE VOICES; 
Investors Try To Adjust To a New Set Of Realities

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Voices around the country no longer talk of economic booms or Internet riches, of golden-hued nest eggs or second homes on beach property.
 In January 2000, the Dow Jones industrial average peaked at 11,723; it now has spiraled down toward 8,000. The Dow plummeted 1,369 points, or 14 percent, last week alone in its worst weekly decline since the Great Depression, with more than $1 trillion in stock market wealth wiped out. 
 In recent years investors typically responded to such sell-offs with optimism by buying on the dips and reaffirming their faith in the United States stock market. But today, after the worst terrorist attack in American history, they are shaken by the prospect of war, weakening consumer confidence and a looming recession. 
Individual investors are not fleeing the market entirely. Last week's heaviest selling came from large institutions. Underlying the near-term pessimism of individual investors is optimism about the long-term health of the American economy and the long-term returns of the stock market.
But right now, investors are adjusting to a new set of realities. In a dozen interviews over the weekend, investors appeared hesitant, uncertain and noncommittal. They said they did not want to buy on this dip; they wanted to wait and see what happened. They wanted to sit on their hands.
And so as a result, people like Barbara Levine, a real estate agent in Cleveland, are trimming back their hopes and expectations and coming to grips with a less prosperous America.
"Everything is collapsing around us," Ms. Levine said on Friday, contemplating the prospects of war, a recession and General Electric falling from $60 to $31 a share in the last year.
People like Ms. Levine, 52, are no longer thinking about early retirement. They no longer believe one of their inalienable rights is a rising stock market and a Goldilocks economy. 
A growing number of smaller investors are pulling back from the stock market, seeking more conservative alternatives like municipal and treasury bonds. 
If attitudes have changed, analysts say, it is because individual investors are starting to grow tired of watching their stocks sink.
Many of the hesitant investors are like the Kaminskys, Elliott and Charlotte, both age 67, and both dependent on stock market returns for some of their retirement living expenses.
Mr. Kaminsky took early retirement a few years ago. He still works part-time as a sales manager at Pierre's French Ice Cream Company in Cleveland. He thought he could get by working part-time, but the market drop may keep him on for many more years. 
"It's a killer," Mr. Kaminsky said of the market plunge last week. "I had $740,000 in my pension plan -- you know, what you call an I.R.A. It's now down to $450,000."
He and his wife, who still works some as a real estate broker, own their own home, a three-bedroom brick-faced cottage in University Heights, just outside Cleveland. They are hardly in desperate straits, but they're worried about the market collapse.
The cost of their prescription drugs alone is about $8,000 a year, they say. So they're already making changes. Perhaps they will drive instead of fly off to vacation. And things could change at home, too.
"Maybe we'll be driving one car instead of two," Mr. Kaminsky said. "And maybe I'll be keeping my job a little longer."
Barbara and Eddy Levine are in a similar situation. Mr. Levine, 61, sells insurance and his wife, Barbara, 52, is a real estate agent in Cleveland. They are both in sales, and they both have a sense that the tide is turning -- that consumers are losing confidence. And so are they. They just canceled a month of vacation in Coronado, just off San Diego, and they are sitting on their cash.
"I wouldn't put money in the stock market right now," Mr. Levine said. "I'm on hold."
He said many Americans were "emotionally still," and his wife agrees.
"I talked to someone in the office yesterday, and she hadn't made an appointment in two hours," she said. "People are waiting. The economy had been slowing down, and now people think it's coming to a halt."
Alan and Bonnie Kenyon, both retired teachers living in Mamaroneck, N.Y., said they sold stocks with lots of other people in the last month, even before the attacks. 
"I've pulled everything out of the market," said Ms. Kenyon, 70. "I left some cash in case something turns around."
The $150,000 they had in the stock index fund was pulled eight months ago. Three weeks ago the Kenyons pulled about $50,000 they had invested in individual stocks. Their money is being put in safe investments like money market accounts.
Ms. Kenyon, like so many other investors, is already talking about the end of the good old days. "Do you remember CMGI? You could make $2,000 in a day," she said, regarding the once highflying company that held investments in other Internet companies. What happens now? "I don't know," Ms. Kenyon said. "Maybe you put your money in C.D.'s, making 3.36 percent." 
That return is a far cry from the double-digit stock gains of the 1990's. "Yeah, but it's kind of good these days," Ms. Kenyon said.
She does not watch CNBC all day any more. Indeed, many investors said they were tuning out the market news on TV.
"I've withdrawn from what's going on," says Carol Potts, a retired crafts maker in Santa Barbara, Calif., who traded stocks and closely followed the market on the Internet in recent years. "The present is too overwhelming and depressing."
For a time, Ms. Potts, 59, said she could not bear to watch television or even check her portfolio after the market collapse was under way last year. She had bought technology stocks like JDS Uniphase and Juniper Networks -- stocks that have been crushed in the sell-offs.
Now, Ms. Potts and her husband, 55, are holding steady. They do not want to buy or sell. 
"Everything is as is," she said. "You either have to be a trader or an investor. And I don't have the temperament to be a trader."
The Potts are being more realistic in the aftermath of the stock market decline. They never spent beyond their means in the good times, but they are tightening their belts anyway.
"We are redoing our kitchen, but it's scaled down, and we're doing some of the work ourselves," Ms. Potts said, taking a break from sanding the kitchen floor. "It's not the $4,000 stove, it's the $1,200 stove."
Not everyone, however, is withdrawing from the market. Here in Chicago, an investment club that was started four years ago by a group of professional women is still hanging on.
The club is called "Ladies in Waiting," and its motto is "Get Rich Slow." The 17 women, who range in age from 30 to about 64, are investing in technology companies and blue-chip stocks with supreme patience. The big market plunge created a spirited debate last week, but the consensus was clear: buy more.
"We're an investment club and we ought to invest," said Virginia Sheldon, 63, who is a medical transcriber and a member of the club. "For me it's hard to imagine that in five years I won't have done better."
But for many investors, particularly people like the Kenyons, now at retirment age, the golden age of investing and of big returns and American invulnerability, seems to be over all at once.
"I told my daughter the other day that the 90's were so enjoyable," Ms. Kenyon said. "And now it's gone. I hate to say that because the good times can't be over. But they don't seem like they'll be back for 10 years."

HEADLINE: Former Communist Who Led Left to Victory in Poland 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Leszek Miller, Poland's next prime minister, has come full circle. Twelve years ago, as a member of the Central Committee of Poland's Communist Party, he watched it crumble in the face of protests led by Lech Walesa and the Solidarity movement. 
 Today, Mr. Miller, 55, and the former Communists enjoyed a sweeping victory that not only puts them back in power but also deals a potentially fatal blow to Solidarity. 
 Neither Mr. Miller nor his party, now called the Democratic Left Alliance, are calling for a return to old ways. He firmly supports Poland's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and has vowed support for the American campaign against terrorism. 
Closer to home, Mr. Miller's top priority is to reduce Poland's big budget deficit. Far from wanting to extend the reach of the state, Mr. Miller has promised Poles deep cuts in government spending.
Like the departing Solidarity-led leaders, Mr. Miller is determined to win Poland's membership in the European Union, a goal that requires both market-opening measures and administrative reforms. Mr. Miller's main campaign slogan, "Let's restore normality and win the future," emphasized steady competence rather than bold new visions. 
The uncertainty about Mr. Miller, though, is about his intentions below the top level of policy. Will he cave in to pressures to shield and subsidize big troubled companies? Will he do anything to relax Poland's rigid job-protection rules, which business executives say have been a major obstacle to hiring? Will he muster the military resources to meet Polish promises to NATO? 
Mr. Miller will take power at one of Poland's most difficult moments since the collapse of Communism. Its economy, which had been growing by about 5 percent a year for the past five years, has stalled. 
The most immediate problem is the government's budget deficit, which has ballooned. Economists say the government will need to make deep cuts just to avoid setting off a panic among Poland's creditors.
Poland's success will have ripple effects across both Central and Western Europe. With 39 million people, Poland has Central Europe's biggest economy and is the region's biggest recipient of foreign investment. Any loss of its credibility is likely to rub off on neighbors.
Mr. Miller, a taciturn man who was trained as an electrician, has based his success on two major principles. The first was to establish the Democratic Left's credibility as a pro-Western party that would continue Poland's support for market economics. 
The second principle, and the one that was probably decisive today, was to promote competence. The issue was crucial because Solidarity had been plagued by infighting, defections and embarrassing political scandals. 
Mr. Miller, who was born on July 3, 1946, in Zyrardow and grew up in a poor family, was trained as an electrician and went to work at a textile factory. He joined the Communist Party in 1969, received a political science degree from the Higher School of Social Sciences in Warsaw in 1977 and rose rapidly on the basis of his organizing strengths. 
He became a member of the Politburo in 1989, just as the Communist regime was collapsing, and he took part in the "round table" meetings with Solidarity leaders that resulted in elections and the Communists' ouster. 
Mr. Miller was among the leaders who stayed with the party after its defeat, and he played a central role in helping to redefine it along the lines of Western Europe's social democratic parties. 
"It became clear the old system would never close the gap with developing countries of the West," he said recently. 
He has been a member of Parliament since 1990 and has served as labor minister and as interior minister during the past decade. 
Some analysts say Mr. Miller is little more than a skilled political tactician rather than a man of deep convictions or ideas. But even former Solidarity leaders say that he and his party are part of current mainstream. 
"The success of Poland's transformation is that the post-Communists began to talk the language of democracy and became part of the democratic process," said Adam Michnik, who was imprisoned for protesting against the old regime and is now editor of Poland's biggest newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza.

PERSON: Solomon Sagall 

HEADLINE: Solomon Sagall, 101, Dies; Early Proponent of Pay TV 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
Solomon Sagall, an early proponent of pay television, died on Sept. 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York. He was 101. 
 In the 1930's Mr. Sagall was among the first to seize on the commercial potential of technology for transmitting video and sound over the airwaves to remote screens, using it first to broadcast sporting events to paying audiences in theaters. 
 Later, waging a prolonged battle against broadcasters and theater owners, he became the leading prophet of what is now known as pay-per-view television.
His 30-year-long drive proved quixotic in the end. His own company, Teleglobe Pay-TV Systems Inc., sought to broadcast coded programming and charge customers a fee for the use of decoding devices attached to their television sets. Just as his plans neared fruition, his concept was overtaken by the advent of cable television. Although cable television was not exactly the revolution Mr. Sagall had in mind, his stalwart advocacy helped to bring it about.
The son of a Russian rabbi in the town of Podberzye, near Minsk, Mr. Sagall attended the University of Moscow before emigrating to Berlin after the Russian Revolution. He then studied economics and political science in Berlin and continued his education at the London School of Economics. 
"Dad went to four universities and spoke five foreign languages -- Russian, German, Yiddish, Hebrew, English and some French -- but he never got a degree," said Mr. Sagall's son, Joel, of New York. 
Mr. Sagall started his career as a journalist, writing in Russian and Yiddish for a Zionist newspaper when he lived in Berlin and continuing to write about Zionism as a freelance correspondent in London. 
But his life changed in 1929 when he read an article about a Hungarian engineer's invention for transmitting video images through the air. He immediately borrowed money to travel to Berlin to acquire the rights to the technology. Although he abandoned the technology almost immediately for a different system designed by a British engineer, Mr. Sagall had found his calling.
"When I was a Zionist, I was a visionary," Mr. Sagall often told his family, "then I became a televisionary."
Mr. Sagall started a company called Scophony to use the technology. Its first venture was broadcasting sporting events to four-foot-high television screens in two London theaters. Mr. Sagall's goal was to use television to make "every home a theater," with "television universities" and "news for breakfast," his son said. 
During World War II, Scophony shifted to the military industry and Mr. Sagall moved to New York. After manufacturing chemicals for the war effort and making televisions for bars and taverns, in 1957 he founded Teleglobe-Pay Systems, based on technology for transmitting coded programming. 
Broadcast networks and movie theater owners were firmly opposed to the idea of charging for television, fearing that it would threaten their businesses and deprive the public of free programming altogether. At their behest, regulators and lawmakers blocked the idea.
But Mr. Sagall maintained that charging a fee would elevate broadcast fare. "Television has largely become a kind of soporific, a mild narcotic having the effect of preventing the majority of the viewers from exercising their thinking faculties," he testified in Congressional hearings in 1958.
Mr. Sagall, meanwhile, began dabbling in theatrical production, partly as a source of programming for Teleglobe. His first production, in 1968, was "I'm Solomon," a translation of a play about the biblical King Solomon. It was a hit in Tel Aviv. But its popularity derived mainly from Hebrew wordplay, and the English production became an expensive flop. Mr. Sagall later staged a smaller production of a play in Yiddish.
By the 1970's, regulators had dropped barriers to pay television. Soon, however, Mr. Sagall's proposed system for broadcasting coded signals was overtaken by cable, which provided more channels. His company, Teleglobe, eventually licensed its pay-per-view technology to cable companies. 
In 1984, Mr. Sagall was elected a fellow of the Royal Television Society of London. He continued going to his office and pursuing other projects until health problems interfered last December. 
In addition to his son, Mr. Sagall is survived by two nephews: Sabby Sagall of London and Myron Sagall of Silver Spring, Md.
Throughout his career, his son recalled, "behind his back, they would say that my father was a Luftmensch -- a man who floats in air, a dreamer."

HEADLINE: Changes Called Likely In Policy on Immigration 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
As the nation takes a closer look at who crosses its borders and why, immigration policy could change in subtle but lasting ways, analysts say.
 In the last few years there has been an open-door policy toward foreign visitors and workers considered vital to the American economy. 
 But a heightened distrust of foreigners since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks could mean far fewer visas for the millions who come each year to study, work or visit, and more government monitoring of foreigners' movements once they arrive.
"We are going to try much more to reduce the opportunities for people to take advantage of the system," said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, a director of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington research group. 
One long-range result may be broader government powers to detain and deport noncitizens based on their political associations or activities, measures the Bush administration has already proposed.
But the attacks' more immediate effect is likely to be an indefinite delay in the debate about whether to legalize the estimated eight million illegal immigrants in the country. Part of that debate concerned illegal Mexican immigrants and the push by Mexico to create a more fluid flow of migration back and forth across the border.
That issue has now been pushed into the background, though an administration official insisted last week that discussions with Mexico would continue.
Groups that fiercely opposed allowing illegal immigrants to become legal residents have recast their arguments to fit the new situation. Before the attacks, they argued that ineffective border controls and tracking systems had allowed illegal immigrants from Mexico to overrun the nation.
Hours after the attacks, a leading anti-immigration group, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, started to transform the argument. It issued a statement from its executive director, Dan Stein, who said, "The nation's defense against terrorism has been seriously eroded by the efforts of open-borders advocates, and the innocent victims of today's terrorist attacks have paid the price."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has introduced legislation to provide American consulates access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's criminal database, said the aim was to "ensure that our borders are secure and our laws are enforced." 
But, Mr. Kennedy added, "we need to move forward with our other immigration agenda, and that includes uniting immigrant families and uniting workers with employers."
In addition to laws to expand intelligence gathering, measures that might be considered include better automated border and port systems, improved intelligence cooperation and increased monitoring of foreigners. Some of these ideas have been discussed before and put aside as too damaging to trade or too expensive. Even now, many analysts say, the best response may be to improve existing systems for screening people trying to enter the country.
"The question is, how complete is the information that's in the database?" said Doris M. Meissner, who was immigration commissioner in the Clinton administration. "The lookout database has literally millions of names in it. But with terrorists, if you don't know who they are, their names are not going to be in there."
The last big revision of laws affecting immigrants and refugees was in 1996. Those changes resulted in much less mobility for asylum-seekers, who are more likely now to be held in detention centers while their cases are decided, and a substantial increase in Border Patrol and immigration agents at the land crossings, seaports and airports.
Improvements have also been made in checking the identities of immigrants against watch lists of suspects in crimes and terrorists, Ms. Meissner said. Immigration and consular officials already have access to some databases. And for most international flights, she said, airlines electronically transmit the passenger manifests to a data system in the United States to be checked against a lookout list while the planes are in the air.
New investments, some officials said, should be made to keep technology up to date.
"If we decide we're going to tighten the border between the U.S. and Canada, that means a lot more agents and inspectors and resources on the border," said Paul Cellucci, the United States ambassador to Canada. "It would be better to put those resources into law enforcement and intelligence. To expect that we are going to catch someone at the border is a needle-in-the-haystack situation."
Some of the most far-reaching changes called for in the 1996 laws were never enacted, but they may now be revived because they focus on the least regulated area of nonimmigrant visas. More than 100 people wanted for questioning in the attacks have been arrested on immigration charges, including staying longer in the country than their visas allowed.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service, for example, is only starting to put in place a computerized database of the estimated 500,000 foreigners in the United States on student visas.
The goal was to create a system for catching students who stay illegally after finishing their studies. But instituting the system was delayed for five years by disputes with colleges concerning who would collect fees. 
Similarly, a plan for a computerized system to catalog each entry and exit at the nation's borders was reduced last year after it was declared cumbersome and harmful to commerce. 
Discussion may now be revived about creating a so-called North American perimeter so that foreigners coming to Mexico, Canada or the United States would face similar visa and entry requirements. 
More uniform visa regulations, supporters say, would reduce the possibility that someone could fly legally into one country and then slip across a less vigorously patrolled land border into another. 
Other measures might limit some visas altogether. Some of the hijacking suspects had M visas, allowing them to enroll in technical courses. There have been calls to eliminate that category, though it accounted for only 6,107 visas last year, a tiny number of the total granted.
Nearly 4.2 million people were granted visas for tourism or business last year. Another 284,000 received visas to study at American universities.

HEADLINE: Nairobi Journal; 
Wily 77-Year-Old Is a Traitor to His Hair Color

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Gray hair has traditionally been worn as a badge of honor in Africa. Wrinkles constitute wisdom.
 But President Daniel arap Moi, who recently celebrated his 77th birthday, has prompted a furious debate among Kenyans -- and possibly a run on hair dye by asserting that gray-haired leaders like himself ought to step aside in favor of a younger, black-haired generation. 
 That Mr. Moi, who has held office since 1978, ought to retire is hardly a matter of controversy. Kenyans frustrated with the country's dismal economy, entrenched corruption and general sense of lawlessness speak openly about the need for a shake-up at the top. The United States and other donor countries have also made clear they believe that Kenya would benefit from an orderly transition into a post-Moi era. 
But Mr. Moi, who according to the Constitution must step down by the end of 2002, says that if he goes, all his gray-haired contemporaries ought to go with him. "People say that I am an old man because of my gray hair," Mr. Moi remarked at a recent public rally. "Then my age-mates who also have gray hair should quit politics."
The president has repeated the remark on various other occasions, leading to banner headlines in this society that has generally accorded great deference to the elderly.
One potential casualty of the new hair test is Vice President George Saitoti, a man whom Mr. Moi seems determined to keep at arm's length. Following the lead of the president, Mr. Saitoti's detractors have begun pointing to his salt-and-pepper hair as one big disqualification.
In the words of Julius ole Sunkuli, a minister in the office of the president, the 57-year-old Mr. Saitoti "cannot be described as a young man." The vice president's backers, however, have scrutinized his scalp and come up with a different conclusion.
"Although the vice president has some gray hair, they do not cover most of his head," Okech Kendo, a newspaper columnist, said in defense of Mr. Saitoti, one of numerous politicians eager to become Kenya's third president since independence.
Kenya's population is a youthful one, with perhaps 70 percent of its citizens under the age of 30. Yet many of those who, like Mr. Moi, are sporting some gray do not seem ready to cede power to their children and grandchildren.
Of course Mr. Moi, who enjoys power, may merely be engaged in an elaborate ploy to provoke alarm and so secure his position, for if every official of experience departs the prospects for mayhem are good.
"Half the world is governed by gray-haired men and women in a most sound and unimpeachable manner," argues Joseph M. Nyasani, a 65-year-old professor of philosophy at the University of Nairobi who is balding but, for now, has no discernible gray hair. "In Kenya, rather curiously, we are being told to lock up our experience and expertise the moment a few gray hairs begin to show."
Another theory among Moiologists, is that the president is casting aspersions on his contemporaries to ensure that rivals like Simeon Nyachae, a gray-haired former finance minister, do not succeed him in the State House. By handpicking a young, inexperienced leader, the thinking goes, Mr. Moi can maintain some of his influence even as an ex-president.
"It is highly suspect to demand that a certain generation should quit politics and go home merely to make room for the youth while at the same time other sectors of our social and economic life remain at the hands of the same 'old' people," Mr. Nyasani wrote in a recent newspaper commentary.
Others agree that age ought to be irrelevant as a presidential qualification. The next leader, they contend, ought to be someone who can stand above the often-bitter ethnic loyalties that divide the country, control the soaring crime rate and reverse the nation's economic free fall. After long being regarded as the star of East Africa, Kenya is now broke and broken.
"The president will come from God," asserted Njenga Karume, a member of Parliament, "whether he shall be a young or an old man."
As this spirited discussion over age, hair and governance continues, there are signs that Kenya has not completely cast away its elders. It is true that many of the traditional values of rural life -- respect for elders among them -- have faded as Kenyans have flocked to the big city.
In villages, the young people step aside in deference to the old. But on the crowded streets of Nairobi, it is every person-- young, old or middle aged -- for himself.
Then there is the case of Ester Nyambura Kaburu, a gray-haired grandmother. Her story suggests that Kenyans still have a soft spot for their elders.
When the 93-year-old Ms. Kaburu was thrown into prison last month for chopping down 12 banana plants in a dispute with her daughter-in-law, the arrest prompted a national outcry. After four days, a good Samaritan stepped forward with $64 in bail money to spring Ms. Kaburu, who is known affectionately as "Cucu." "A carnival mood gripped the jubilant Gituria villagers who erupted in fervent prayers of thanksgiving upon Nyambura's release," said one newspaper account.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding Downtown 

 BODY:
Virtually everyone in New York City, and indeed most of the country, understands the importance and urgency of rebuilding downtown Manhattan. In the aftermath of the terrorist attack, it is vital to reaffirm the city's status as a premier financial capital and restore hope to a battered neighborhood.
 Among New York's senior political figures, there is an emerging consensus that a special commission or authority should be created to oversee the reconstruction. The stars in New York's fractious political firmament are in unusually close alignment at this time of emergency. The task now is for Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to transform this moment of harmony into a workable plan. 
 Step one is to create a commission with the necessary powers to get the job done quickly and correctly. As some of the candidates for mayor pointed out over the weekend, it is critical that this body include representation of both the state and the city. An equal number of members from each might be best, with a tie-breaking chairman who was mutually acceptable to both sides.
Part of the authority's or commission's job will be aesthetic and, to some extent, spiritual -- defining the scale and scope of the restored district, and designing an appropriate memorial to the World Trade Center victims. The group's basic responsibility, however, will be economic -- encouraging the construction of new buildings while making sure there are tenants to occupy them. Speed is important here. Major companies displaced by the collapse of the trade center are less likely to sign long-term leases elsewhere if they can be confident that space downtown will be available in a timely manner.
A package of financial incentives will almost certainly be required to persuade the anchor tenants to return. The devastation displaced nearly 100,000 workers and removed at least 15 million square feet of prime office space, or the equivalent of 15 Empire State Buildings, from the market. The city and state have so far done an extraordinary job of meeting the needs of the smaller firms needing less than 50,000 square feet. But the key to downtown's rebirth will be the big players -- Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, American Express, Lehman Brothers -- that need acres of contiguous space.
The commission may be able to dip into the $20 billion in federal emergency relief funds for some of these purposes, but it would be a mistake to rely too heavily on that source. With the cleanup alone costing $30 million a day, and expected to go on for months, much of that $20 billion will be spent on clearing the rubble, replacing infrastructure like the PATH and subway stations and readying the land for development. A more reliable way of persuading the old businesses to return would be to deploy the traditional array of economic devices -- tax credits, loan guarantees and the like -- that states and cities use to lure and retain businesses.
History suggests that all this is doable. People have been predicting the demise of the financial district for almost 40 years. The World Trade Center itself helped lead an earlier revival in the 1970's, even as law firms and investment banks were migrating to central Manhattan. In the early 1990's, a recession left empty one of every four floors of downtown office space, nearly all of which were full by the end of the decade. The district will never be the same. But there is every reason to believe that if our elected leaders and the best minds in the financial and architectural communities are willing to seize the moment, it can be made even more vibrant than it was before Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INVESTORS; 
No Big Rush To Buy or Sell By Wall Street Professionals

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS with JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Stocks are at their lowest levels in three years, inspiring some intrepid bargain hunters to start buying selectively. But several money managers said late Friday and over the weekend that they were approaching the coming week cautiously, not planning on buying aggressively in case the market dropped further.
 Over the weekend, the malaise extended to consumers as well, with fewer than normal at movie theaters, restaurants and stores. 
 In one hopeful sign for the financial markets, several portfolio managers said they were trying to hold on to stocks they regard as too cheap to discard. "I'm not going to let big fund managers and market makers panic me out of any stocks I'm fully confident in," said Timothy P. Vick, senior portfolio manager for Arbor Capital Management of Anchorage. 
But for the most part, nearly two weeks after the attacks, major investors were still recovering from their shock and still hesitant. "Times of duress are poor times for investors to make decisions," said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, a leading mutual fund company. "I wouldn't plunge in now, but I wouldn't plunge out either." 
Some investors are just starting to become focused. "I lost a personal friend and an investor in my fund," said Neil J. Weisman, general partner of Chilmark 21st Century Capital, a Saddle River, N.J., hedge fund. "I used to talk to him every morning between 7 and 7:30, no matter where I was in the world."
Still, Mr. Weisman said he was beginning to consider some stocks. "I probably will stick my toe in the water over the next few weeks," he said. "A lot of stocks in industries obviously impacted are down already." While he would not touch airlines, he said that hotel companies might be worth a look.
Timothy M. Ghriskey, a former portfolio manager for Dreyfus who left to run the Ghriskey Capital Partners hedge fund, also remains cautious. "Everybody wants the stock market to go up," he said. "But calling a market turn is a fool's game."
Still, Mr. Ghriskey is starting to look at consumer stocks that do well in a downturn, including Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Gillette.
Battered insurance stocks are also attracting cautious interest. "There was an over-reaction in the insurance area last week," said A. Michael Frinquelli, a partner in Renaissance Fund Advisors, which focuses on the industry. He likes the Reinsurance Group of America, Annuity and Life Re, Allstate and Jefferson-Pilot.
Michael F. Price, former chairman of the Franklin Mutual Series funds, who now runs MFP Investors, where he manages over $1 billion, has a conservative 30 percent of that in cash. But he did buy some stocks on Friday, and will probably purchase more in the coming weeks. "There is some value here, but you have to be conservative," he said. 
Or, as one manager of a leading hedge fund, who is keeping more than half his money in cash, said: "My advice to the public is don't be heroic. Sit tight until things settle down. If you can't withstand another 20 percent decline you shouldn't own stocks."
Executives were blaming continuing unease over the attacks and the resulting decision by several studios not to open new films for a steep drop in attendance this weekend.
Another factor may have been the Friday night telethon, which offered a broader roster of film and pop-music superstars than the theaters, said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, which monitors box-office performance.
Attendance was expected to drop significantly the previous weekend but a slate of new films led by Keanu Reeves in "Hardball" had earnings more than 40 percent higher than the comparable weekend a year ago.
This weekend, however, performed more to those initial expectations. The top 12 films earned an estimated $44.2 million, roughly 15 percent less than the previous weekend and 7 percent below the same weekend last year.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's urgings for New Yorkers to spend money received only a limited response. At La Metarie, a Greenwich Village restaurant, business was off about 30 percent, only slightly better than last weekend, when traffic in the neighborhood was restricted. "Still very, very slow," said Josue Elmalem, the maitre d'hotel, explaining that the attack compounded a slowdown he blamed on the stock market's earlier retreat.
Around Los Angeles, stores said business was off sharply. At Macy's in Sherman Oaks, shopping this weekend was estimated down by about half. "They're worrying about the economy and they're worried about what's going to happen next," said Rosie Bally, an employee there.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE SPECIAL FORCES; 
Eerie Quiet as 'Screaming Eagles' Await Battle Orders

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: FORT CAMPBELL, Ky., Sept. 23 

 BODY:
The grim drumbeat of war seemed oddly distant today from this sprawling Army post straddling the border of Kentucky and Tennessee.
 Soldiers played golf on the base's sun-drenched course. Rocket-launching helicopters squatted on the desolate airstrip. The hallways inside the white-clapboard command center were dark and quiet. 
 Yet behind Fort Campbell's just-another-weekend calm, its 24,000 troops have been steeling themselves for battle, packing equipment, honing rifle skills, readying loved ones for the deployment orders they all consider inevitable.
"You take a look at this global problem with terrorism and it's pretty evident that most soldiers in combat units will probably be involved," said Maj. Gen. Richard A. Cody, commander of the fort and its 101st Airborne Division.
Indeed, history suggests that the 101st, which specializes in riding to battle in Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters, escorted by sleek Apache gunships, will be among the first to go overseas if ground troops are needed for the United States war on terrorism. 
The Screaming Eagles, as the 101st is known, helped storm Normandy in 1944, and the exploits of its Easy Company are celebrated in the Stephen E. Ambrose book and HBO series "Band of Brothers."
In 1991, a squadron of Apache attack helicopters from the 101st commanded by General Cody, a lieutenant colonel at the time, fired some of the first shots of Operation Desert Storm, the Persian Gulf offensive.
And Black Hawk pilots from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment flew the ill-fated 1993 mission in Mogadishu, Somalia, where 18 soldiers were killed in the fiercest firefight involving United States troops since Vietnam.
"It's clear to me and the troops that something big is going to happen," General Cody said. "A lot of people will be involved. The Army will be involved. This division will be involved."
"But it's not going to happen tomorrow morning," he added.
About the only thing to pierce Fort Campbell's tranquil facade today was the heightened security. Throughout the base, soldiers in black berets and armed with M-4 rifles stood guard at new checkpoints draped with barbed wire. They were just a tiny part of the newly expanded, 2,800-soldier detail protecting the 65-square-mile post.
Soldiers and their families said the closing of most gates and tighter security at the main entrance since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon had caused hourlong traffic jams along Route 41A. But few were complaining. 
"I'm glad it's there," said Darla Fabunan, 28, whose husband is a staff sergeant with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the Night Stalkers.
"He doesn't tell me much about what he's going to do," Ms. Fabunan said of her husband. "I just figure that if he comes home and grabs his bags, he's going."
That is the nature of the 101st. One of the division's three brigades is always prepared to depart on 36 hours' notice, its equipment already packed and loaded onto pallets that would go inside the cavernous bellies of Air Force cargo planes.
"The eerie calm here is just normal operations," said Maj. Paul Fitzpatrick, a base spokesman. "We're always good to go."
In addition to the 101st and 160th, Fort Campbell is home to the Fifth Special Forces Group, which has trained extensively on the Arabian peninsula and in South and Central Asia.
Though General Cody said the division had yet to receive deployment orders from Washington, its troops have not been standing still. A 90-soldier infantry company will be going to the Persian Gulf region for a training exercise this week. Another 3,600 soldiers will board buses and head south in a few days for exercises at the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, La.
General Cody said both exercises had been scheduled at least a year ago. But these days, any troop movements on base cause a stir in the nearby towns of Oak Grove, Ky., and Clarksville, Tenn., where many residents and business owners worry that a huge mobilization will devastate the local economy, as happened in the Persian Gulf war.
"When the guys left in 1990, you could practically hear a giant sucking sound," said Yvonne Chamberlain, a real estate agent in Clarksville. "Business dried up, restaurants closed, there were foreclosures all over."
The residents have veiled their anxiety with American flags, "God Bless America" banners and the routines of small-town life.
For First Sgt. Emanuel Azan, that meant playing in the over-30 soccer league at Heritage Park under the brilliant Saturday afternoon sun. Looking carefree as a surfer in his sunglasses, he said he was itching to go to war.
"I'd be the first to board the plane," Sergeant Azan said. "My wife, she don't like it. But she understands it's what I do."
General Cody called the impending conflict "a very different fight," which initially will probably involve small-scale, search-and-destroy missions carried out by Special Operations troops like Army Green Berets.
At some point, he said, large numbers of ground troops are likely to be needed. But as in the gulf war, when American troops massed on the Iraqi border for months, the mobilization will not happen overnight, he said. 
"I told the troops, 'This is a marathon, not a sprint,' " he said. "There is no point in wearing ourselves out."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE CONSUMERS; 
Recession's Harbinger Is a Missouri City Not Prone to Boom or Bust

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, Mo., Sept. 23 

 BODY:
The economy is sinking in this, the biggest city in central Missouri. Since the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon, Mary and Bill Hires's notions of buying anything nonessential have evaporated. 
 Ms. Hires, 69, whose husband was a professor at the University of Missouri here before he retired, was putting a bag into her van in the Wal-Mart parking lot near Columbia's new southwestern subdivisions. "We felt very secure," she said. "We were at the point of getting into the 21st century." 
 They planned to replace their old television set and install a satellite dish antenna. "We were going to spend a little more money on personal pleasures," Ms. Hires said. "We don't have that feeling now. The antenna costs $50 a month. We don't need that." 
Priorities here are shifting with the economy.
"We have been thinking of getting a new car next summer," said Anita Bruzzese, 42, a writer and mother of two boys, 6 and 12. "We still have that on the agenda. But I promise you it won't be a gas guzzler." Shuttling children to school, she said, "it's one mom in each car. We're talking about carpooling. " 
For decades, the economy of Columbia has been unusually resilient. Driven by its colleges and universities, its hospitals and insurance companies, it tends to resist the worst of the booms and busts that plague layoff-prone manufacturing towns. For years, it has had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, rarely exceeding 2 percent. 
But last week, even Columbia started showing signs of tumbling into a recession. People are buying what they need, they say, but little of what they once wanted. They are shredding their prosperity-nurtured plans for bigger homes, bigger cars, new appliances and a higher standard of living. They have stopped applying for credit cards. 
As Columbia goes, so, almost certainly, most of the nation is going.
To declare a recession, the government requires six months' evidence of reduced consumer and business spending, and that has yet to show up. But within the banking system, evidence is building that consumers are acting on their post-attack sentiments and scripting a recession.
Thirty miles south of Columbia, in the state capital, Jefferson City, is the Midwest Independent Bank. It is what is known as a bankers' bank, or a correspondent bank. It has no tellers or A.T.M.'s. Its purpose is to provide financial services to more than 300 mostly small banks in Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa. 
By watching the loans and transfers the banks make to one another each day, Midwest Independent can spot signs of a surging or chilling economy almost instantly. It can tell when the customers of other banks start to retreat from stores, fall behind on credit card payments or stop applying for loans. 
Nearly two weeks after the terrorist attacks, Camden R. Fine, the bank's president, sees an already slowing economy slowing even more. He said one compelling sign was that affiliated banks were transferring less money through his bank. Last week transfers dropped to an average of 265 a day from a rate of 300 in the weeks before Sept. 11. 
"Everything has changed," said Mr. Fine, who also owns a small bank in Ashland, between Columbia and Jefferson City. "Prior to the attacks, housing was strong, tourism was slowing, but it wasn't in the dumps. Now you have loan demand slowing. People are more cautious about withdrawing money, and they're adding to their deposits." 
Consumers appear to be shunning anything frivolous. Near Columbia, at the Kingdom City exit off Interstate 70, sales at the barnlike Ozarkland souvenir store have stalled. "People are sad," said Sharon Brown, assistant manager. They ask for only one item, American flags, and the store ran out of them within hours of the attacks, Ms. Brown said. 
In Columbia, at Starrett Fine Jewelers on Broadway, Michael Oetting, the manager, said: "Standard bridal and anniversary jewelry, they're back to normal. Spontaneous purchases, they're not." 
At Summit Travel on Broadway, Jerry Price, president, has cut his five agents' hours by 20 percent. "The phones have been very quiet," he said. "It causes us to be wary about our future."
Mr. Price's travails echo across the economy, in his agents' diminished incomes and in spending for supplies and services that he has curbed. "For a small-business person," he said, "this is a crisis." 
Home sales, too, have plunged. "The people that didn't have to move, they've just gone away," said Sarah Mackey, a broker at Gaslight-Gundaker GMAC Real Estate.
"I had several buyers who were just in the starting phase," Ms. Mackey said. They had talked to their banks about mortgages and were beginning to look for bigger and better homes. "They just went away," she said. 
"It's the middle class that's getting squished the most," she said. She said some of the more expensive houses, those priced at more than $200,000, are selling because wealthier buyers have cash, and homes for less than $90,000 are selling because low-income buyers can get government-subsidized mortgages. 
Phil Gravitt, 39, was stuffing cash into his wallet as he left a branch of Boone County National Bank. He is in the construction business, specializing in building the concrete foundations for the forests of subdivisions that have grown up around Columbia. Like many people here, he says he believes that burrowing in is what the terrorists want.
"I'm not going to stop going on living and enjoying life, or the terrorists have won," Mr. Gravitt said. But like many people, too, he is making compromises. "I take hunting and fishing trips to Colorado and South Dakota," he said. "But I'm going to stay around home and stick with the family." 
With fewer consumers taking money out of banks for loans and spending, Mr. Fine at the Midwest Independent Bank says an immense sea of money is sloshing around in bank coffers.
Part of the reason is that at the same time consumers and businesses have been borrowing less and saving more, the Federal Reserve in Washington has been pouring money into the economy to thwart fearful consumers' runs on banks and assure that when they do want to borrow, they can get the money. 
By Wednesday last week, M.I.B. banks that normally borrow from one another to keep their accounts balanced stopped lending and borrowing altogether. They all had plenty to lend, and none needed to borrow. As a result, they chopped the interest rate they charge one another from 3 percent to zero. 
"They're sitting with excess funds, and they can't find anybody to buy them," Mr. Fine said. "I've never seen zero. That's unprecedented." By week's end, the rate was still below 1 percent.
Once it becomes clear that the rock-bottom rates are here to stay, the same banks can be expected to cut rates throughout the economy, reducing them on credit cards, car loans and home mortgages. Precedent shows that low rates can eventually reignite the economy. 
In Columbia last week, the standard fixed-rate, 30-year home mortgage was stuck at a little above 7 percent. But on Friday, General Motors dealers began offering five-year car loans for no interest at all to reliable buyers. Ford followed suit. Such deals might revive consumers.
"I have a friend in Bolivar, Mo., who has a G.M. dealership," said Doug Collins, 48, a cable splicer for Verizon who drives a 1996 Chevrolet truck. "I'm going to see if what I heard is true," he said. "I might buy a new truck."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: CULTURE; 
New Look for Entertainment In a Terror-Conscious World

BYLINE:  By JOHN LELAND and PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
For executives at MGM, the release of a forthcoming movie called "Gangster" is problematic. It has action and suspense, mobsters and international terrorists.
 Once this was the stuff of box office dreams. But the tragedy of Sept. 11 changed all that. Now the makers of "Gangster" and dozens of other films, television shows, plays, books, musical recordings and video games are trying to find their places in a shifting cultural landscape. 
 The self-scrutiny is unprecedented in scale, sweeping aside hundreds of millions of dollars in projects that may no longer seem appropriate. Like the calls to curb violence in popular entertainment after the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, the reaction may be helpful in the short term. But creators and producers are just beginning to grapple with more difficult, long-range questions of what the public will want once the initial shock from the terrorist attacks wears off. 
Many in the industry admit that they do not know where the boundaries of taste and consumer tolerance now lie, much less where they will be in a year or two.
In the short run there are immediate questions. After such tragedy and insecurity, conveyed in vivid television images, is it responsible -- or commercially viable -- to deal in fantasy violence or the romance of the outlaw? In a climate of mourning and fear, is there a place for humor and escapism, fashion and pleasure? 
"People realize that it is not the time to move forward with the frivolous, exploitative action films," said David Ladd, an independent producer and former MGM executive. "There has been a certain complacency, I believe, in the audience, to be titillated by a certain kind of movie, whether it's on the comedy side or the action side, and I believe that this incident has made everyone a lot more thoughtful."
The new piety strikes an odd note: taste is not what some of these people do best. Industries that have robustly defended depictions of mindless carnage or the degradation of women are suddenly drawing the line in seemingly arbitrary ways, policing even incidental references to the World Trade Center.
All fields of culture are feeling the uncertainty. Playwrights and novelists are reassessing their subjects. Fashion houses, architects and industrial designers, buffeted by both the tragedy and the sinking economy, are rethinking the role of irony, luxury and security.
"That sort of ironic, hip attitude is going to have to undergo revision," said Jonathan Galassi, the publisher of Farrar, Straus & Giroux. "Any sort of sense of cynicism and self-absorption -- nobody is going to be interested in that."
Rock and rap performers, who have been sliding into gaudy irrelevance, are hoping to re-engage the public. "Music was in a very stagnant place before the attack," said Antonio Reid, president and chief executive of Arista Records. "We have good records but not meaningful records. Maybe the attack will jolt writers to speak to the times we're living in." 
First, though, the businesses are scrambling not to offend. Studios have put off the openings of action films like Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Collateral Damage" and a Tim Allen comedy, "Big Trouble," which involves a bomb on an airplane.
Television series are holding back episodes that are now viewed as cutting too close to the bone. And television writers are reformulating pitches for next season.
Bryce Zabel, chairman-elect of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and a longtime television writer and producer, said he had been scheduled to pitch an idea last week to the USA Networks for a mini-series called "World War III." "Obviously this show died when the victims died," he said.
Now he is reaching for story ideas from the heart. "Maybe more character-oriented, something to do with romance or fantasy," he said.
Even an artist as respected as Stephen Sondheim is not immune. The Roundabout Theater Company has withdrawn plans for a Broadway revival of Mr. Sondheim's 1991 musical, "Assassins," because it portrays the killers of American presidents. The McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., has pulled from its season a dark 25-year-old play by Richard Nelson, "Vienna Notes," which has references to a terrorist act.
There is a daunting momentum to such caution. On an MTV message board, a viewer described the singer Alicia Keys as "the bomb," a vernacular compliment. "Someone said, 'Take that off,' " said Judy McGrath, president of MTV Group.
Even the World Wrestling Federation has shown a new sensitivity, decking its performances with American flags and removing a theme song called "Bodies." (It's about dancers, not corpses.) "We're in a gray area in terms of what's right and wrong," said Stuart Snyder, the company's chief operations officer.
This self-policing threatens to yield a culture of blandness, leading some to conclude that cultural comfort food is all the nation may be willing to stomach. "We're going to go right back to Doris Day movies, I can feel it in the bones of the country," said Robert Brustein, a theater director and a critic for The New Republic. "It's escapism."
Comedians and satirists already feel the squeeze; after the tragedy, being funny almost seems treasonous, said Steve Levitan, creator of "Just Shoot Me," an NBC sitcom. "And when you laugh at something, you feel guilty."
Even the unmodulated speech of the Internet is tempering its sarcasm. Last spring Modern Humorist, a satirical Internet magazine, published "My First Presidentiary," a savage paperback sendup of President Bush. This week on its Web site it posted the sort of heartfelt message that might have once been used to sell war bonds.
"You probably wouldn't guess that the creeps behind Modern Humorist are the sort who wave flags and sing 'America the Beautiful' with strangers in the streets," wrote the editors, Michael Colton and John Aboud. "But that is what we have been doing, in unity with others."
Television viewers watched last week as one wiseacre talk show host after another engaged in a kind of public purging. "I'm sorry to do this to you; it's another entertainment show beginning with an overwrought speech of a shaken host," the comedian Jon Stewart said on "The Daily Show," which returned on Thursday after more than a week off.
Eventually the late-night hosts will move on from grief; by the end of the week, David Letterman was beginning to joke around, but only in the gentlest ways.
"It's not that irony is dead," said Mr. Aboud. "It's just that feelings and honesty are in."
But others are resisting a retreat to softness. George Steel, who heads Columbia University's Miller Theater, a haven for adventurous contemporary music, had second thoughts about opening the season on Friday with "Blood on the Floor," a raw, jazz-infused work. In the end he decided that music lovers could make up their own minds. "To cancel it or replace it with something more palatable would be to infantalize the audience," he said.
Tony Kushner, the Tony-winning playwright of "Angels in America," has a new play, "Homebody/Kabul," about a family's search for an Englishwoman lost in Afghanistan. It is scheduled to begin performances in late November at the New York Theater Workshop, whose artistic director, James Nicola, said he had every intention of proceeding.
"It is all the more important now to be thinking about Afghanistan, to explore what we don't know about it and why we don't know what we don't know," Mr. Kushner said.
It is not clear whether any of the current foment will prove substantive or lasting.
"There'll still be explosions and violence in movies," said Edward Zwick, who directed the 1998 film "The Siege," about terrorists in New York. "It's naive to think otherwise."

Air Cargo Industry Losses Put Paychecks in Jeopardy

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
For Nibardo Osores, the sound of planes flying over his house in Richmond Hill, Queens, always meant that business was good. But Mr. Osores, 53, a cargo handler at Kennedy International Airport, does not ear as many planes these days. With air traffic declining, he has lost work hours and has been warned that he will be laid off by his employer, Swisscargo, if the company's flight schedule is reduced.
 While much has been reported about the difficulties the air travel industry is facing after the attack on the World Trade Center, air cargo companies face problems as well, as the number of international shipments dwindle. 
 What for six years was a steady job is now a day-to-day question mark for Mr. Osores, who calls his office each morning at 10 o'clock to see if they need him to work his shift that day, from 1 to 8 p.m.
With monthly mortgage payments to make and two children to feed, Mr. Osores, who earns $9.80 an hour, needs a paycheck every week, he said. His wife, Hilda, 53, worked as a seamstress at a T-shirt manufacturer in Richmond Hill until July, when the company, MG Textiles and Sportwear, closed the factory. She was paid by the piece, stitching T-shirts together and earning as much as $300 a week last year.
What remains is the $1,429 monthly mortgage payment on the couple's three-bedroom vinyl-sided house in Richmond Hill. "I have a lot of financial responsibilities," Mr. Osores said, "especially the mortgage of this house. If you don't pay on time, they add a late charge, that's $60 to $70 a month."
The family got in touch with Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens last week after Mr. Osores had spent a week without work. It was the first time that the family had to ask for help from a charity. "It was a hard decision to call for assistance," Mrs. Osores said.
"There's a big possibility they're going to apply for unemployment benefits," said Rosa Orihuela, a social worker from Catholic Charities who is helping the family. The charity is one of 10 supported by The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund.
Ms. Orihuela would help the family apply for unemployment benefits if necessary. In the meantime, Catholic Charities will pay the family's mortgage for a month. The agency also provided food for the Osoreses from a pantry at the Queens South Family Center in Hollis, which stocks canned juices, fruits and vegetables, cereal and pasta. "It's not only the mortgage they have to worry about," Ms. Orihuela said. "It's all the bills. At least we can alleviate some expenses."
Mr. Osores said he had not asked his children, Isaac, 15, a sophomore at Richmond Hill High School, and Noemi, 12, a seventh grader at Middle School 226 in South Ozone Park, to help out by finding part-time work, and had not told them about the family's financial troubles. Isaac wants to become a scientist, and Noemi a psychologist or a chef, and Mr. Osores does not want them to be distracted from their studies.
So to ensure that the bills are paid on time, the two parents are looking for other types of employment. Mrs. Osores, who is originally from Ambato, Ecuador, a small town about 75 miles south of Quito, is looking for another job as a seamstress. "I have a lot of experience at many machines," she said. "I came to this country 30 years ago, and I take experience at many fabrics."
For his part, Mr. Osores plans to look for a new job outside the airline industry. "I have experience as a driver," he said, then, looking at his wife and smiling, added, "I cook, too."

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Online travel agencies brace to weather the air travel slump.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
BEFORE Sept. 11, online travel agencies like Expedia, Travelocity and Priceline were among the few e-commerce companies that had defied the dot-com trend by keeping their stock prices relatively high and achieving profitability, even amid a softening travel market. 
 Now, in light of the grim events of Sept. 11 and their business and economic aftermath, online travel executives are wondering whether their industry can remain the standard-bearer for e-commerce -- or, for that matter, whether most Internet travel companies can even remain in business. 
 Rosenbluth International's Biz Travel.com was the first online travel company to fold in response to the severe decline in air travel, shutting its doors on Friday. Analysts said some other travel sites would probably follow. 
Given their cash reserves, the biggest full-service Internet travel agents -- Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz -- will probably sustain their businesses through next year, analysts said, if consumers return to the airports even in modest numbers, as they seem to be doing. Indeed, investors acknowledged such optimism late last week, as they began buying back shares of Expedia, Priceline and Travelocity after rounds of heavy selling. (Orbitz is privately held by several major airlines.) 
But if these companies are able to reward their investors' faith, it may be partly because they had already begun diversifying their businesses, to reduce their reliance on airline ticket commissions, which have plummeted in recent years. 
According to Tom Underwood, an analyst with the investment firm Legg Mason, more than half of Expedia's profits now come from nonairline-related sales. "Travelocity's a little more dependent on air," he said, "but they're also getting a significant portion of their revenues from hotels, rental cars and advertising." 
In balancing their revenue sources, these sites have also refined their approaches to selling their products, including airline tickets. 
Rather than simply selling standard fares of airline tickets or hotel rooms at published rates for commission, online travel agencies have increasingly bought blocks of airline, hotel and cruise ship inventories that the suppliers have had difficulty selling. The sites can then offer customers low prices on those products, while still earning more than twice what they would make through a standard travel agent commission (which is now $10, in the case of airline tickets). 
In the short term, this approach may not help sites earn more from airline ticket sales, analysts said, as consumers who do not feel safe flying will not be persuaded to book a flight simply because it is $50 cheaper. That is especially true if airlines continue to shrink the number of flights, because the block-purchase model depends on the airlines' having excess inventory to sell cheaply. 
But for hotel and rental car packages, the supply -- and demand -- could be greater. 
"It's certainly clear that anybody who was planning to hold a conference has generally pushed it out to next year, so there's a very large number of hotels scrambling to fill an awful lot of rooms in the fall," said Erik Blachford, senior vice president of Expedia. "We're in a reasonably good position to not only help the hotels fill the rooms, but also give our customers some really good rates." 
Even if the demand for airline tickets remains depressed, some analysts said airline ticket sales on the travel sites could actually grow. Mr. Underwood said airline bookings for online travel agencies before Sept. 11 had been growing by about 35 percent over last year. 
"Even if you say the industry will be down 25 percent, just to pick a number," he said, "there'll still be the same migration to online bookings, so Internet bookings will still be up." 
Some other analysts agree that travelers will continue to turn to Web sites in increasing numbers. Henry Harteveldt, an online travel analyst with Forrester Research, a consulting firm, said online travel sales might not reach the $16.7 billion his firm had previously predicted for this year. But he still expects the total to be more than the $12.2 billion of last year. 
Mr. Harteveldt predicted a gradual end to the lingering confusion over so-called e-tickets -- in particular, whether they are now acceptable at airports. E-tickets refer to electronic receipts that can be printed out by a buyer of online tickets -- whether from the person's own computer or, in many cases, from kiosks at aiports. Since the attacks, some airports have required people with e-tickets to check in at airline counters for official documentation, but generally speaking, Mr. Harteveldt said, "e-tickets are just as useful now as before the attacks."
Given that consumers will want to research trips -- be they alternatives to longer flights or replacement trips for those postponed in September -- Mr. Harteveldt said they would probably rely heavily on the Internet. "Also, the typical household that buys leisure travel online earns about $72,000, so they have the economic capability to travel," he said, compared with less-affluent families in the current economy.
"So suppliers, who a couple weeks ago were trying to minimize their work with online travel agencies, will want to work with them now to put together promotional programs and offers," Mr. Harteveldt said. "The travel sites will be suppliers' new best friends." 
Terrell B. Jones, chief executive of Travelocity, foresees the situation playing out similarly. "The normal response of the air, car and hotel industry in coming out of a strike situation, or the gulf war, is to stimulate travel through promotion and price," he said. "I suspect it'll happen again, and we're right in the middle of that." 
In the meantime, nearly every online travel site is searching for ways to cut costs, to account for both the dramatic drop in revenues and some unusually large checks they have had to write. For instance, for every flight canceled, the online agencies have to return the commissions they were paid by the airlines. Moreover, some sites, like Travelocity, have had to pay overtime to their customer service teams for the work in the days after the attacks. 
According to Jeffrey G. Katz, chief executive of Orbitz, those cost-cutting measures at his company have included 17 layoffs, or about 10 percent of the work force. "I'm actually optimistic that things will come back more quickly than a lot of people have said, but it's still going to be a rough period," Mr. Katz said. "And we want to operate at a cost level that's consistent with the revenue level."
Echoing the strategies of other online travel site executives, Mr. Katz said the company would reduce marketing expenditures by "as much as 50 percent, since you can't market if the market isn't there." 
Mr. Katz also predicted that there would be "some opportunistic acquisitions" by travel sites with good cash reserves. "Nobody will escape the impact of this, but the second- and third-tier players will be in a very difficult spot," he said. "I think you'll see them disappearing." 
In the midst of such bleakness, some online travel executives said they hoped the coming holiday season would invigorate bookings. "Maybe this is a season where people will want to come together," said Mr. Jones, of Travelocity. "We'll have to wait and see." 
Of course, even such guarded optimism is fragile, given the possibility that last week's attacks may not be the last. If there are further terrorist incidents, said an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, "the return to leisure travel will be longer than anyone's anticipating now."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE SPENDING; 
In the Computer Sector, a 'Blanket of Hesitation'

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
For the last two decades, spending on information technology in the United States has grown at two to three times the rate of the economy and never declined, even in economic recessions. But even before the Sept. 11 attacks, information technology spending, which grew 11 percent last year, was slowing.
 Now projections are being trimmed further, down to 3 percent growth, according to estimates by the International Data Corporation in a revised "worst-case scenario" that the research firm says is increasingly likely. 
 The $450 billion information technology industry, which animates much of the modern economy, is struggling with the impact of the attacks, rethinking its priorities and spending plans, and searching for any lessons to be learned from the tragedy. 
The immediate impact is lost sales from the brake on travel, shopping and investment decisions. Yet there is already the beginning of a rise in the equipment replacement and recovery business because of the World Trade Center disaster. The information technology costs of recovery and relocation after the attacks will be $15.8 billion over three years or more, predicts Computer Economics, a research firm.
But those added sales of hardware, software and services for local recovery, industry analysts say, will be dwarfed by the decline in the fortunes of the industry as a whole as the economy slows further. "The business disruption and the hit to consumer confidence overshadow everything else," said John Gantz, director of research for the International Data Corporation.
Sales of hardware, like mainframes and personal computers, will be hit hardest, Mr. Gantz said, while software and especially services should be more resilient.
The current quarter, ending Sept. 30, will be a rough one. Typically, corporate customers wait until the last few weeks of a quarter to make decisions about large computer and software purchases -- decisions that in many cases have been reversed in the last two weeks.
Technology companies have already begun warning that sales and earnings will probably slide. The Oracle Corporation, a leading supplier of corporate database software, cautioned securities analysts last Monday about the worsening outlook. Before the terrorist attacks, Oracle executives believed that the weakness in technology spending had probably bottomed out.
"But now, everything is a wild card," said Jeff Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer. "We have no idea of how negative things will be in sectors like airlines and hotels."
The EMC Corporation, a major supplier of data storage equipment, warned on Thursday that it would lay off 2,000 workers, or 10 percent of its payroll, and report a loss for the third quarter. "The business world is simply covered in a blanket of hesitation," said Joseph M. Tucci, EMC's president. 
Until the attack, the hopes of the ailing personal computer industry were pinned on the arrival of Microsoft's new Windows XP operating system in October. In the past, when the Microsoft Corporation has introduced a major upgrade of its Windows operating system, the industry standard, the result has been a surge in demand for new personal computers, peripheral equipment and other software.
But now, with consumer confidence shaken, any rebound in PC sales is in doubt, according to Rob Enderle, an analyst at the Giga Information Group, who says that the PC industry may not recover until 2003.
Microsoft, however, intends to spend heavily to prove the pessimists wrong. Windows XP will be introduced on Oct. 25, as scheduled, backed by a $250 million marketing campaign. "Not only the PC industry but the whole country is looking forward to anything that can help jump-start the nation's economy," said James Cullinan, the lead product manager for Windows XP.
With many people skittish about traveling, there are cancellations and delays for computer conferences, at least for those scheduled for the next few weeks. The Internet World conference at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York, for example, has been moved from early October to early December.
The biggest American computer conference, the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas, is going ahead as planned in mid-November. Kim Myhre, Comdex's president, says his six keynote speakers -- including Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle -- all still planned to come.
Security will probably be tighter and the crowds may be somewhat smaller at Comdex, typically attended by 200,000 people, Mr. Myhre said. "Travel is a huge issue," he said, "and so much depends on what happens in the wider world in the next two months."
Indeed, for the industry, as for the economy itself, so much depends on what political and military -- and possibly terrorist -- events lie ahead.
What does seem certain, though, is that priorities will shift somewhat. A larger share of the information technology budgets will be spent on backup storage, recovery services and decentralized operations.
"One lesson," said Howard Anderson, senior managing director of YankeeTek Ventures, a technology investment firm, "was that the more centralized you are, the more vulnerable you are." 
The same thinking lay behind the disaster preparation for the Year 2000, or Y2K, software problem. The investments made to handle that problem helped explain why so many of the banks and brokerage firms housed in or near the World Trade Center were able to get up and running again within a few days from other locations. 
Yet recovery plans are likely to be redefined. Such plans have usually focused on computers and software. "But now it's going to be about people and getting the information and knowledge that's in their craniums onto the corporate network," said Gary Beach, publisher of CIO Magazine, a trade journal.
In conversations over the last few days, Mr. Beach said, technology executives at companies have told him that they increasingly want to insure that critical business information is housed not just in employees' heads, but also, as much as possible, in corporate databases. That sentiment will probably heighten interest in a field called knowledge management, which combines tools like e-mail search programs, collaboration software and data-mining technology.
Spending seems certain to increase on computer security and encryption software. Some experts have long warned that the large computer networks that handle things like banking transactions and airline traffic are susceptible to attacks by technically adept terrorists, and those fears are now heightened. Other niches of the industry could also benefit. The use of videoconferencing technology could grow, for example, if companies curb business travel permanently and seek an alternative.
In a way, the attacks confirmed the wisdom of the Internet's architects, who designed a decentralized system that could withstand nuclear attacks.
A Silicon Valley executive, Eric E. Schmidt, chairman of Google Inc., a Web search service, was in New York on Sept. 11, and he noticed that text messages sent over the Internet to wireless BlackBerry hand-held devices, which send and receive e-mail, had arrived in the attacks' immediate aftermath, while cellphone service had been sporadic. 
"This was about as close as you get to a nuclear attack," Mr. Schmidt said, "and the Internet withstood the test."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE JOURNALISTS; 
Terror Experts Use Lenses of Their Specialties

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Since Sept. 11, the words "terrorism expert" have been used to describe about three dozen academics, diplomats, former military officers and intelligence officers who have appeared on television news programs or been quoted in print.
 What the two tidy words do not express is the unruly collection of disciplines and political and commercial interests that has been the primary source for journalists covering terrorists. After every terrorist incident, some professors and soldiers, spies and diplomats, security experts and political partisans put out reams of fact and conjecture. 
 Early reports can be strikingly accurate. But as one expert, Brian Jenkins of the RAND Corporation, who has studied terrorism since the early 1970's, said, "There's an awful lot that comes out after an incident part in the early days that is unconfirmed, rumors, just misinformation." 
"When you're on the inside looking at it come out," he said, "you say, 'How did anyone get that idea?' " 
The job of sorting out what is known from what is believed or wished, and then trying to make sense of events to an often-bewildered audience falls to a small cadre of journalists who make terrorism their beat. Right now, they are at the core of what may be the most important story of their careers. They can illuminate why it happened, who the country will fight and what Americans need fear.
Like their sources, they arrived at this hybrid beat through many doors. Through experience covering the Middle East and Iran, like Robin Wright of The Los Angeles Times and Judith Miller of The New York Times. Through the police beat, like John Miller of ABC News, who spent years covering the mafia for New York television stations. Through personal interests, like Peter Bergen of CNN, who has been fascinated with Afghanistan since he was a teenager. Through intelligence coverage, like Vernon Loeb of The Washington Post.
Beyond news organizations in the United States, there is the BBC in Britain, which has cultivated knowledge on terrorist movements. Al-Quds al-Arabi, a London-based Arabic newspaper, and Ha'aretz in Israel have also made such coverage routine. Rahimullah Yusufzai of The News of Pakistan, a part-time correspondent for ABC, the BBC and Time, covers Afghanistan -- whose Taliban government has sheltered Osama bin Laden -- as a local story.
And Al Jazeera, a five-year-old, state-financed satellite news station in Qatar that provides CNN-type coverage, has been the first port of call for opponents of the governments in Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Libya, from peaceful dissidents to Mr. bin Laden. Bin Laden representatives sent Al Jazeera his denial of responsibility for the New York terror -- not to mention a videotape of him at his son's wedding last year.
Information about terrorists, Mr. Jenkins said, tends to be filtered through different prisms. "The Paul Revere agenda is: 'The terrorists are coming, the terrorists are coming. We've been warning for years. There are cells in this country.' "
He added, "I'm not saying that's wrong," noting the early results of the investigations of the attacks.
In the second place, he said: "There is the 'you ain't seen nothing yet' apocalyptician school. These include the people who have for a number of years been raising the threat of chemical, biological weapons, weapons of mass destruction."
He said, "It is a legitimate concern," but at the moment, in the face of low-technology attacks, he sees it as a distraction.
Finally, Mr. Jenkins said, "There is the Osama bin Laden fan club," which makes the chief suspect in the Sept. 11 attack "the James Bondian villain at the center of evil." He added, "I am not letting bin Laden off the hook," but he thinks that the investigation "will find something far more complex than simply bin Laden. We are dealing with a network of relationships."
In contrast to Mr. Jenkins, who emphasizes the chaotic and complex nature of modern terrorism, Steven Emerson sees clear financial and operational patterns from one terrorist incident to the next. He has been one of the most visible experts on television. He is a repository of a vast amount of information -- he says he has fielded 1,000 calls, many from news organizations, since Sept. 11 -- but his analyses make him one of the most controversial highly visible experts. 
In 1994 he produced a widely debated PBS documentary, "Jihad in America." It won him accolades and fury, particularly from Arab-Americans. 
That fury escalated when, immediately after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, he told CBNS News, "This was done with the intent to inflict as many casualties as possible. That is a Middle Eastern trait, and something that has been generally not carried out on this soil until we were rudely awakened to it in 1993" -- the year of the first World Trade Center attack. On Saturday, Mr. Emerson said that he was reflecting investigators' first take on that attack. 
In 1996 and 1998 Mr. Emerson told Congress that the United States should expect more terrorist attacks.
But it is not so much his general warnings about American-based terrorists -- which the current investigation bears out -- as his efforts to link individual Muslim scholars or charities to terrorists that have earned him Arab-American enmity. 
Mr. Emerson said, "I'm very antiterrorist. I don't make any bones about it. I don't think the media has done its job in the last five years covering the deception of some of these groups in the United States who feign moderation and still are militant." 
However controversial he is, he is still widely quoted, by USA Today and The New York Times, among others.
Experts have institutional agendas in addition to intellectual ones. Pentagon sources tend to see things through the prism of military action, Israeli intelligence sources through the lens of their domestic terrorism, Saudi sources through the interests of their monarchy, and so on. Closer to home, law enforcement sources tend to view terrorist groups through the prism of organized crime.
ABC's John Miller has a police background and sees close parallels to organized crime. "Though you keep an open mind and realize you are operating in a different terrain," he said, "it still boils down to having a boss, an underboss, a consigliere, captains and crews."
Robin Wright of The Los Angeles Times draws her views from her years abroad. "The last bloc of countries to hold out against democratic reform are in the Islamic and Arab world," she said. "The whole militant Islamic movement emerges out of that. To cover and understand extremism and terrorism, you have to understand the context." She added, "I get real tired of a whole lot of so-called terrorism experts who have never lived in the Middle East and never known a terrorist. They thumbsuck from inside the Beltway."
For reporters who choose to get their information in Washington, however, there is expertise in agencies ranging from the State Department to the National Security Council (and the alumni of both) to the Defense Intelligence Agency. Mr. Miller trusts these sources. But, he warns: "The intelligence community generally favors the individual organization that they've already collected the most information on. It shows they were prepared and informed. If something comes out of left field, that implies that it wasn't on their radar screen."
He added that even if experts had jumped to conclusions right after the attack, "So far it doesn't seem that any of their conclusions were baseless." By contrast, journalists and law enforcement officials investigating the loss of T.W.A. Flight 800, devoted resources primarily to checking the likelihood of a terrorist bombing, and paid less attention to the possibility of a catastrophic structural failure -- the eventual explanation.
Sometimes, the experts depend on the journalists as much as the journalists depend on them. A good deal of the public information on Mr. bin Laden comes from the journalists who went to Afganistan to interview him, including Mr. Bergen and his former CNN colleague, Peter Arnett; Mr. Miller; Mr. Yusufzai, of Time Magazine; and Jamal Ismail, of Al Jazeera.
How does one make contact with terrorist networks? "It's complicated," Mr. Bergen said. "You have to meet the right people and do a lot of hanging out. You're in Kabul, Jalalabad, Kandahar. And you have to have met the right people previously, to make anything happen." Journalists and terrorist go-betweens spend weeks trying to ensure that they are not being duped.
Mr. Jenkins cautioned that journalists are trained to make sense of events and create a narrative. That imperative, he warns, could be inadvertently misleading. "Journalists tell coherent stories," he said. "Reality is far less coherent. In the interest of a coherent story, they may tell the wrong story."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE STRATEGY; 
U.S. Seeks Afghan Coalition Against Taliban

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is backing efforts to build an internal coalition in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and his Taliban supporters. Such a coalition could collect crucial intelligence, provide political support and cooperate militarily in the war on terrorism.
 The United States has stepped up contacts with the Northern Alliance, a coalition also known as the United Front, which has been fighting the Taliban. Officials said there were plans for the United States to provide it with financial support. 
 The group controls only a sliver of territory in northern Afghanistan, and it suffered a grievous setback when its military leader was assassinated, just days before the attacks in the United States on Sept. 11. But it has fought back by carrying out an attack in Kabul and stepping up other operations in the north. 
Recognizing the complex ethnic mix of Afghanistan, the United States has also initiated contacts with the Pashtuns, the dominant tribe in the south.
There has been enormous attention given to the need to build an external coalition involving nations like Britain, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and others in the region. This external coalition is important. Britain, for instance, is expected to join the military operation.
Forging an internal coalition of ethnic groups that could increase pressure on the Taliban government is just as crucial, though the effort to meld together different tribes and factions in a country that has long been at war could be very complex. 
One reason for the effort is military. The United States needs allies inside Afghanistan who can help track Mr. bin Laden and those Taliban leaders who harbor him, and can provide information on possible attack targets, as well as a possible base of operations in the country for American forces. They could also do some of the fighting. 
There are key political reasons as well to build a coalition inside Afghanistan. The administration is trying to counter the impression that the fight against Mr. bin Laden is a war against Afghanistan or Islam. 
A plan for bringing stability to Afghanistan is also needed to attract help for the United States military campaign. To encourage that cooperation, Washington wants to offer the groups a role in governing Afghanistan after the conflict. A plan for bringing stability for the nation is also important to persuade Pakistan and other neighbors to cooperate. The last thing Washington wants is a chaotic situation that creates a haven for terrorists and destabilizes the neighboring countries. 
Today, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld indicated that the United States was trying to encourage defections within Taliban ranks, and that those people could be part of a new governing structure for Afghanistan.
"Some of the Taliban say, 'Well, it could get uncomfortable supporting those people, so I think I'll shift sides,' " Mr. Rumsfeld said today.
Efforts to form a grand coalition involve the 86-year-old former king of Afghanistan, Mohammad Zahir Shah, who lives in Rome. The exiled king is a Durrani Pashtun, like the Taliban leaders. The thinking is that he could serve as the symbolic head of a broad group that would include other Afghans who are not Pashtuns. 
Mostapha Zahir, the 37-year-old grandson of the king, said in a telephone interview from Rome that the king was willing to serve as a rallying point for the Afghans but had no intention of trying to re-establish the monarchy. 
He said the king planned to meet in Rome this week with commanders from the Northern Alliance and other groups. 
There are, however, many obstacles to the effort to form a grand coalition, including tensions among the ethnic groups. Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, foreign minister of the Northern Alliance, recently blamed Pakistan for regional instability. Pakistan has close ties to the Pashtun tribes that would supposedly be in the grand coalition. 
John Moore, who until last year was the chief Middle East analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency, said: "People have talked about this as a great alliance, but that's going to be subject to fractious politics. This is not going to be an easy or quick process."
Influential lawmakers here have been briefed on the administration's emerging strategy to encourage the creation of a pan-Afghan coalition to combat the Taliban government. 
"It could be very useful if it can hold together," said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee. "In the past, there have been such differences among the groups, it's been difficult. It'll take a special effort, and I'm glad the administration is looking at it."
Washington's efforts to encourage an anti-Taliban coalition are coming in the midst of continuing military preparations. Administration officials said a C.I.A. reconnaissance drone had crashed in Afghanistan. The Taliban claimed on Saturday that they had shot it down, but American officials said the unmanned aircraft was gathering intelligence and might simply have crashed. 
The Northern Alliance, one of the anti-Taliban groups, is dominated by Tajiks and Uzbeks, and has 10,000 to 15,000 fighters. It draws financial support from Iran and weapons from Russia. It lost its military leader, Ahmed Shad Massoud, when two suicide assassins, posing as journalists, set off a bomb in his presence. He died of the wounds several days later. 
American intelligence officials now say the attack on Mr. Massoud was orchestrated by Mr. bin Laden. The aim was to decapitate the leadership of the primary anti-Taliban resistance, they say, therefore depriving the Bush administration of a potential ally in any retaliation.
Dr. Abdullah and the Northern Alliance's new military chief, Muhammad Fahim, also met in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, with the head of the Russian general staff, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin. 
As for relations with the Americans, Muhammad Eshaq, the Washington representative of the Northern Alliance, said there had been intense contacts with the Bush administration. The administration plans to offer financial assistance, officials say, but Mr. Eshaq said it had not yet done so. 
Nonetheless, the Pentagon seems to be counting on the Northern Alliance's help. Mr. Rumsfeld has talked openly about a military collaboration with the alliance. 
"These folks, they know the lay of the land," Mr. Rumsfeld said on Friday, referring to the Northern Alliance. "They know, in some cases, some targets that are useful; they have ideas about how to deal with the Taliban. I think that one has to say that they can be useful in a variety of ways."
There was concern in the administration that Mr. Rumsfeld's comments could complicate Washington's dealings with other factions, including the dominant Pashtun group, which has close ties to Pakistan. So today Mr. Rumsfeld made the point that opponents of Mr. bin Laden might also include "tribes in the south."
A coalition would help the United States balance the interests of its outside partners. The Iranians and Russians, for instance, are supporting the Northern Alliance. The Iranians also have ties to the Hazaras, another minority. 
"There is a coalition dimension to this, so we want to make clear that we are working with several groups," a United States official said. "We are not only reaching out to the Pashtun leaders; there are tribes and leaders reaching out to us."
A final reason for the administration's attempts to forge relations with disparate groups inside Afghanistan is its desire to portray the impending military campaign as a fight against terrorism, and not against the Afghan people or against Islam. It is not only a public relations consideration, but also a factor in picking targets and devising the war plan. 
"It is important to avoid actions at all cost that will unify the Afghans in support of bin Laden and against a foreign invader," said Karl F. Inderfurth, who was the senior State Department official responsible for South Asia in the Clinton administration.

 THE GLOBAL PICTURE

TELLING THE WORLD -- The Bush administration plans to make public evidence linking Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network to the terror attacks on the United States in an effort to convince the world that a military response is justified. A1

REPORTS ON BIN LADEN -- United States intelligence officials said they were certain that Osama bin Laden was still in Afghanistan and dismissed statements by the leaders of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban that Mr. bin Laden was now missing. B2

TERRORIST HIERARCHY -- A surgeon from Cairo ranks second in the hierarchy of the Al Qaeda organization and is seen by some intelligence experts as Osama bin Laden's most likely successor. B1

VOW OF SUPPORT -- The Gulf Arab states promised "total support and cooperation" for the effort to find those responsible for the Sept. 11 suicide attacks but coupled that pledge with a call for action against what they called terror acts by Israel. B2

DAYS IN FLIGHT SCHOOL -- Mohamed Atta, thought to be a pivotal figure in the hijackings, stood out from other the students learning to fly in Venice, Fla. He was formally dressed and always accompanied by a second man, who he said was a bodyguard. B3

AFGHANS FLEEING -- With an American attack expected, hundreds of thousands of Afghans are heading for ancestral villages or crossing into Pakistan and Iran. B3

DIPLOMACY WITH SAUDIS -- The United States' announcement that it would use Saudi Arabia as a headquarters for operations against Afghanistan has strained relations. But the administration is confident that Saudi Arabia will agree to the plan. A1

SOME RELIEF FOR PAKISTAN -- The Bush administration's decision to ease economic sanctions against Pakistan came as a much needed boost to that nation's government. B4

WORKING AGAINST THE TALIBAN -- The United States is backing efforts to build an internal coalition in Afghanistan against the Taliban. A1

WATCHING WALLETS

SHOPPING IS DOWN -- A consumer malaise was in evidence over the weekend, as shopping and cinema attendance fell sharply. In one hopeful sign for the financial markets, several managers said they were trying to hold on to stocks they liked. B5

A PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT -- After the Dow's 14 percent decline last week, investors appear hesitant. Many say that until they figure out the new realities of the market, they do not want to buy. C1

CAUTION IN THE MIDWEST -- In Columbia, Mo., many people are scaling back and not buying nonessential items. As a result, the local economy is suffering. B5

REACTION AND PREPARATION

AIRPORT SECURITY WEIGHED -- Democratic leaders of the House and Senate said that they favored a federal takeover of airport security. The Transportation secretary is still waiting for recommendations from two study panels. B5

GIRDING FOR BATTLE -- At Fort Campbell, Ky., the weekend appeared calm, but the 24,000 troops have been packing equipment and preparing for the deployment orders that they consider inevitable. B1

TROOPS AT THE READY -- Soldiers at Fort Bragg, N.C., believe they are going to war soon, but it is not clear where. B6

THE VIEW FROM IOWA -- Sheldon, Iowa, is far from the attacks on the East Coast. But its weekly newspaper is doing its best to retell, recast and remember the events of Sept. 11. B1

HIGH APPROVAL FOR BUSH -- Ninety percent of Americans approve of the way President Bush is handling his job after the terror attacks, the Gallup polling group reports. B6

A DAY OF PRAYER

NEW YORK MOURNS -- With prayers, inspirational music, speeches and seas of American flags, about 20,000 mourners gathered at a flower-decked Yankee Stadium. B7

THE POPE SPEAKS OUT -- At a Mass attended mostly by Muslims, Pope John Paul II spoke out against an overzealous military response to the terror attacks. B7

MOOD IN NEW YORK

A NEW LANDSCAPE -- When workers return to buildings not damaged by the terror attacks, they will catch glimpses of crews atop smoldering rubble piles -- the new landscape of Lower Manhattan. B1

PERSISTENT FEAR -- Throughout the city, an unrelenting fear persists in many people's minds that something else bad is going to happen. A car bomb. A chemical attack. More planes. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is again entreating New Yorkers to show how sturdy they are by resuming their lives. A1

CAB INDUSTRY AILING -- Another New York industry is taking a beating: taxicabs. Some fleets say they are operating only half of their cabs. B8

INVESTIGATING

MAKESHIFT OFFICE FOR F.B.I. -- The collapse of the World Trade Center towers briefly disabled the F.B.I.'s New York office, which is home base to the bureau's most experienced terrorism investigators. But it has since set up shop a bustling shop in a block-long garage. B9

APPEAL TO ARAB-AMERICANS -- New Jersey's attorney general called on the state's Arab-Americans to help the authorities investigating the World Trade Center attack but also urged them to report any abusive treatment by law-enforcement agents. B9

GETTING HELP

CLEARINGHOUSE FOR AID -- With many forms of assistance available to victims of the destruction of the World Trade Center, officials urged those seeking help -- particularly the families of those killed or missing -- to use a central clearinghouse created for them, rather than try to contact city, state, federal and private agencies one at a time. B10

NEW YORK SCENES -- A fund-raiser at a bar, a disagreement over immigration posters and an effort to protect precious voice-mail messages. B10

WORKERS IN NEED -- Catholic Charities helps families whose income is suffering after the terror attacks. B10

AFTER THE ATTACK -- Faces and stories of those still missing. B11

THE CULTURE

ENTERTAINERS STEP IN -- Not since World War II has the entertainment industry responded so swiftly and so unanimously to a crisis, volunteering to raise money for families of the thousands who died on Sept. 11 or to entertain troops to lift morale. E1

SEEKING A NEW TONE -- The makers of films, musical recordings, video games and television programs are beginning to grapple with the question of what the public will want once the initial shock from the terrorist attacks wears off. A1

THE MARKETPLACE

BUSINESS BY REMOTE -- Hundreds of business people, grounded by caution and canceled flights, have turned to videoconferences and collaboration over the Internet. C1

ECONOMIC RIPPLES -- The outlook for corporate profits has worsened, drastically in some industries. The extent of the damage will be known only as companies gauge the effects of a drop in consumer spending and a disruption of supplies. C1

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ENERGY MARKET; 
Military Plans Must Ensure Oil Flow

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Oil, long among the abiding interests of the United States in the Middle East, will unavoidably help to shape the Bush administration's planning of the war on terrorism, according to experts on the industry and the region.
 Some analysts consider it almost unseemly to bring up such matters when deliberating on a response to the killing of thousands of Americans. But the reality, they acknowledge, is that the White House is already analyzing how various forms of retribution for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks could affect American oil supplies. 
 In the short run, it looks as if supplies are safe. In the immediate wake of the attacks, leading oil nations like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait gave assurances that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would keep output stable. 
Ultimately, though, a great deal hinges on how the American retaliation unfolds. Arab allies of the United States are themselves eager to uproot terrorist networks, like the one run by Osama bin Laden, because they have long feared that such groups could topple their governments.
Yet if they align themselves too closely with the antiterrorist efforts and Washington unleashes a wide campaign that hits many Islamic countries, moderate Arab governments could be destabilized by uprisings.
"If the United States wants a broad coalition of allies, it needs to have a narrow list of targets," said Raad Alkadiri, a Middle East specialist at the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington. "If they have a broad list of targets, they will have a narrow list of allies. That's exactly what the administration is wrestling with now."
In the run-up to an OPEC meeting on Wednesday in Vienna, analysts said, the United States let the cartel know that it would like output to rise so that prices would fall in the face of recession. But OPEC fears that this could cause a price crash by supplying more oil as the demand for it drops.
Most analysts think that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, and others will assure the United States behind closed doors that they will do what is necessary, informally, to keep prices on the low side. Oil for November delivery ended trading in New York on Friday at $25.97 a barrel.
The United States has become so widely disliked in Arab countries in the Middle East that governments there risk credibility with their own people by aligning too closely with it. American might and wealth, when compared with the political weakness and poverty of much of the Islamic world, has kindled some of that resentment, a range of diplomats and analysts said. Yet more than anything, they said, Arabs are frustrated with American policy in the Middle East -- in particular what they consider the unquestioning support for Israel in the Palestinian uprising. 
And many Arabs blame the American thirst for oil for miring them in shaky economies run by corrupt leaders.
"The resentment grows when people see democracy is fine, dissent is fine in the United States, but is denied people in the Middle East," said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch.
For now, the United States appears likely to focus on targets in Afghanistan as the Bush administration works to determine what the next steps might be.
Asked whether the administration was considering how any retribution might affect oil supplies, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department directed questions to the State Department. Representatives there did not return calls seeking comment.
But oil industry analysts who have spoken to administration officials said that the United States and the Persian Gulf nations had agreed that as many tankers as possible must soon sail with Middle East oil for the markets to be convinced that OPEC assurances were sincere. So far, that appears to have happened, the analysts said. 
If Washington indeed opts for a wide-ranging response to the terrorist attacks, hardly anyone expects Arab nations to embargo their oil exports, as they did in 1973, in response to American support of Israel in the Middle East war. A decade of low oil prices -- and the producing countries' overspending -- have made oil revenue critical to their budgets. 
A full-scale bombing of Iraq could remove two million barrels a day of oil from the global market. In the past, Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations have made up for interruptions of the flow of Iraqi oil, and they might do so again. But they also might have to back away from open support of the United States.
Iraqis have lived under economic sanctions for a decade, and many Muslims think that Iraq has suffered enough, Middle East experts said. 
The Bush administration has indicated that it might use the existing American military presence in Saudi Arabia as part of any attacks. But those units, there since the end of the gulf war in 1991 and financed in great part by a now-struggling Saudi budget, have been considered an affront to the sensibilities of many Muslims and to national sovereignty by many Saudi citizens, diplomats and analysts said. The Bush administration must take pains to consult with the Saudi government about how American troops on its soil will be used, analysts said. 
"The Saudi monarchy is already considered an enemy by those we might be bombing," said Charles W. Freeman Jr., ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the gulf war, "so we should consult them if we will be placing them in jeopardy."
An unintended consequence of wide-ranging American attacks on Islamic countries could be that through popular uprisings, copycats of the radical Taliban leaders in Afghanistan could rise to power in the gulf region, where two-thirds of the world's known oil reserves are concentrated. 
"We have a dual interest here," said Bill Richardson, energy secretary in the Clinton administration. "We must have a significant impact on bin Laden's network, and we have to preserve the stability of regimes like Saudi Arabia, which is our principal national security and energy ally in the region."

HEADLINE: Penguin Putnam Chief Plans to Step Down 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
Phyllis Grann, one of the most commercially successful editors and publishers in the book business, is leaving her position as chief executive and president of the Penguin Putnam books division of the media company Pearson at the end of the year, people close to the company said.
 Over four decades in book industry, Ms. Grann's nose for page turners has built her a reputation as the queen of the best-seller list. The long roster of best-selling authors she has published includes Tom Clancy, Patricia Cornwall, Dick Francis, Robin Cook, Nora Roberts, John Sandford, Steve Martini, A. Scott Berg and Amy Tan. Last year, more than 106 of the companies books appeared on the New York Times best-seller list. 
 Ms. Grann was among the first in the industry to champion a strategy of heavy marketing and promotion to help books stand out in the ever-expanding sea of bookshelf space at superstores, general merchandise discounters and eventually online retailers. She emphasized publishing a smaller number of titles with more marketing support than other publishers had. She often signed contracts with authors for several books at once, and many became best sellers.
Her departure from Penguin Putnam is expected to set off a flurry of activity around the book publishing industry as other publishers try to lure away the house's top authors. People at the company, however, said her successor will come from inside.
Marilyn Ducksworth, a spokeswoman for Penguin Putnam, also declined to comment. 
The reasons for Ms. Grann's departure were unclear. Pearson, which is based in London, also owns The Financial Times of London, The Economist, a large educational publishing division and some Internet operations. Marjorie Scardino, who was named chief executive of Pearson in 1997, has been under pressure from investors to improve profitability. Its shares have fallen more than 75 percent from their peak in March 2000. Consumer book publishing, however, is among the most profitable parts of the company.
Last year, Pearson acquired Dorling Kindersley, a publisher of illustrated and children's books, for about $435 million, and in May 2001, Ms. Scardino named John Makinson, Pearson's chief financial officer, as chairman of its Penguin Group, the worldwide consumer books division, which includes Penguin Putnam in the United States. Mr. Makinson was charged with continuing the integration of Pearson's book publishing operations with the recently acquired Dorling Kindersley as well as integrating the Putnam Group more closely with its British parent. 
Ms. Grann started her career in August 1958, in the mailroom at Doubleday, eventually becoming the secretary to William Morrow's president, Lawrence Hughes. Mr. Hughes encouraged her to become an editor. In 1970, she was hired to edit mysteries at Simon & Schuster and later ran its Pocket Books paperbacks division. In 1976, she was hired as editor in chief of the G.P. Putnam division of Putnam Berkeley. In 1987, she became chief executive of Putnam Berkeley, then owned by the entertainment company MCA. 
Pearson's Penguin Group acquired Putnam Berkeley from MCA, then part of Seagram, in 1996. After the acquisition, she exerted so much influence that some Penguin editors said their company was "putnamized."

Chief at Penguin Putnam Is Planning to Step Down
Phyllis Grann, one of the most commercially successful editors and publishers in the book business, is stepping down as chief executive and president of the Penguin Putnam books division of Pearson, the media company, people close the company said.

Deutsche Bank to Acquire Scudder
Deutsche Bank has agreed to buy Scudder Investments, the United States asset management unit of Zurich Financial Services, for about $2.5 billion in cash and assets, executives involved in the discussions said. Deutsche Bank will pay $1.2 billion in cash for Scudder and give Zurich its 75.9 percent stake in an insurance business. A10.

A Test for U.S. Communications
So far, the reviews are mixed on how the publicly available communications networks performed during the terrorist attacks. And there are lessons that the public, communications executives and policy makers should learn. The star performers were online: e-mail, instant messaging and bulletin boards. But Internet news sites and the wired and wireless telephone networks could stand improvement. And it is clear that there need to be new ways to set up emergency information systems. New Economy. C4.

Forecast Lowered for Tech Spending
Even before the terrorist attacks, information technology spending, which grew 11 percent last year, was slowing. Now projections are being trimmed further, down to 3 percent growth, according to estimates by the International Data Corporation. C5.

Oil Will Play Big Role in Response
Oil, long among the abiding interests of the United States in the Middle East, will unavoidably help to shape the Bush administration's planning of the war on terrorism, according to experts on the industry and the region. C11.

Travel Web Sites Brace for a Slump
Before the attacks, online travel agencies were among the few e-commerce companies that had achieved profitability. Now, online travel executives are wondering whether their industry can remain the standard-bearer for e-commerce or, for that matter, whether most Web travel companies can even remain in business. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. C8.

Emphasis on Hard News Returns
In the aftermath of the attacks, news executives who had talked about veering toward softer subjects sound as if the events of Sept. 11 had shaken them from a daze in which their focus was lost. Hard news, even foreign news, is back in vogue. C10.

An End, or an Extension, to Irony
In the magazine business, naming a new cultural moment or the latest turn in popular taste is how reputations are made. The most common pronouncements after the attacks have been that an epoch defined by irony and cynicism has finally come to an end. The most prominent early prognosticator was Graydon Carter, editor in chief of Vanity Fair. Others, however, say the return to the business of making such pronouncements itself suggests, ironically, that the city's media business might not have changed so much after all. C9.

Advertising Forecasts Are Lowered
The deterioration of the outlook for the economy after the attacks is leading advertising analysts to reassess their estimates for ad spending this year and next. In almost every case, they are predicting no growth or steeper cuts. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. C12.

No Cable Decision Made at AT&T
At its annual strategic review, AT&T's board discussed at least five options for spinning off or selling the company's cable television unit but did not approve a specific plan, people close to the board said over the weekend. C2.

A Snapshot Gives Bush 90% Approval

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Ninety percent of Americans approve of the way President Bush is handling his job after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the highest rating for a president ever recorded by the Gallup polling group, USA Today and CNN reported today.
 The 90 percent rating, measured in a poll of 1,005 adults on Friday and Saturday, outranks the previous record, a rating of 89 percent garnered by Mr. 
Bush's father, former President George Bush, at the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. 
 The current poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, so the difference between the two approval ratings is statistically insignificant. 
 The younger Bush had an 86 percent rating in a survey conducted last week, just after terrorists slammed hijacked airplanes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan and into the Pentagon, outside Washington, leaving an estimated 6,800 people dead or missing. A fourth hijacked plane crashed in Pennsylvania.
President Bush ended the official mourning period today, presiding over a ceremony to hoist the American flag to full staff for the first time since the attacks.
The Gallup organization said the poll showed the highest presidential approval rating in the six decades it has been posing the question to Americans.

HEADLINE: In America; 
Leading America Beyond Fear

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The past several days have been, despite the agony, among America's finest. New York's remarkable response to the catastrophic attack at the World Trade Center has been well documented. But also, above the tragic din, at the very highest levels of government, have come the essential voices of sanity.
 Americans turned on their televisions last Thursday night and watched as George W. Bush, in the nation's hour of need, delivered a near-perfect speech. With the obscene toll of those lost in downtown Manhattan climbing above 6,000, and with hysterical rumors circulating about imminent additional attacks, Mr. Bush went before a joint meeting of Congress and somehow got things exactly right. 
 He dispensed with the cowboy-in-the-saloon rhetoric. There was no bombast in the speech, no cries of wanted dead or alive, just a perfectly modulated sense of absolute resolve.
"After all that has just passed," he said, "all the lives taken and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them, it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear. Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead and dangers to face.
"But this country will define our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror. This will be an age of liberty here and across the world."
For Mr. Bush, who seldom wanders into the precincts of eloquence, it was a splendid moment. He expressed the collective anger of the nation, declared that the U.S. would mount a sustained global assault against terrorism, and bolstered the sense of national unity that flowered in the aftermath of the attack.
And he did that while assuring the world that it is not the Muslim people who are the enemies of America, but the terrorists who have perverted the tenets of a proud religion, and also the regimes that give them sanctuary.
That tone was maintained yesterday by Secretary of State Colin Powell during an interview on "Meet the Press." Choosing his words carefully in a volatile atmosphere that included serious talk about the possibility of a world war, Mr. Powell said: "Let's not assume there will be a large-scale war. I don't know that we should even consider a large-scale war of the conventional type."
It was important, said Mr. Powell, to follow the president's lead. "The objective that the president has focused on in this first instance is Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and his presence in Afghanistan. And then we will consider all other options and all other sources of terrorist activity and go after it in an appropriate way."
Common sense should tell you it would not be wise in the coming weeks to be hanging out with the Taliban. But Mr. Bush and Mr. Powell have also made it abundantly clear that the U.S. will not be able to bomb the terrorists into submission. The president was wise to ask for patience as more complex responses are fashioned. Provoking a wide and futile war would be as insane as the attack on the trade center.
The president and the secretary of state have shown, so far, that the United States is as shrewd and intelligent as it is powerful. A successful fight against terrorism will require international cooperation and the continued unity of the American people. Neither of those elements can be maintained if the U.S. is seen as waging war on innocents abroad.
If it turns out that we are to engage in a large-scale war, then the nation is being prepared in an odd way. Toward the end of yesterday's interview, Secretary Powell said: "We've got to get back to work. We've got to get back to our ballgames. We've got to get back to our theaters. We've got to get this economy moving again. And that will be the best answer to what happened."
The citizens of a nation on the verge of a major global conflict are not generally counseled to run out and pick up theater tickets. The campaign against terrorism will be ugly, brutish and by no means short. But such a campaign is a far cry from a world at war.
Targeting terrorists rather than innocents will be the key to success as the U.S. and its allies respond to the savage events of Sept. 11. If that is done well, a wider war can be avoided and Americans may have reason to hope that the worst is actually behind them.

HEADLINE: Primary Candidates Urge Voters to Turn Out as an Act of Defiance 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Two days before the rescheduled New York City primaries, some of the mayoral candidates invoked the World Trade Center disaster in their campaigns yesterday, asserting they had skills that made them particularly well suited to lead the city through this crisis. They urged New Yorkers to defy the terrorist attack by turning out to vote tomorrow.
 Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican making his first run for any public office, said his experience creating and running a private company made him a "mayor for tough times." His Republican opponent, Herman Badillo, noted his long experience as a member of Congress and in City Hall, saying, "This is not the time for on-the-job training." 
 Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, said in a televised address that he had been, with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, at the center of efforts over the past 12 days to help the city respond to the bombing. Fernando Ferrer, another Democrat, compared the devastation in Lower Manhattan to what he found in the Bronx when he took over as borough president 14 years ago, suggesting that his years in the Bronx had prepared him for what he might face as mayor. 
Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat, said that his skills as city comptroller made him particularly qualified to lead City Hall through difficult budgetary times. And Mark Green, the fourth major Democrat, noted that one of his central campaign themes before Sept. 11 had been unifying New York; he argued that his theme was particularly crucial now.
The remarks came in a day of interviews and speeches on three New York City television stations, starting at 6:30 a.m., which were entirely devoted to a discussion of how the candidates now viewed the job of mayor given the way the city had been changed. 
In interviews on WCBS and WABC, and in prepared statements delivered on WNBC, the candidates offered a variety of proposals for what City Hall should do. They also made an effort to make sure that voters were aware that the primary -- which was originally supposed to be held on Sept. 11, the day of the attack -- was going ahead tomorrow.
Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Vallone both said they would want Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to head a rebuilding authority to oversee the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan. Mr. Badillo said he would give Mr. Giuliani any position he wanted in his administration, but would like to see him be in charge of overseeing security programs intended to assure the safety of New Yorkers.
Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Vallone said that the city should give subsidies to Broadway theaters and possibly hotels to help them survive what promises to be a difficult stretch ahead, given the downturn in tourism.
Mr. Vallone, Mr. Badillo and Mr. Hevesi all said that the city should, despite the impending huge reconstruction projects ahead, press ahead with its application to bring the summer Olympics to New York in 2012. Mr. Badillo and Mr. Vallone went further, telling Marcia Kramer on WCBS-TV that other cities that had been bidding for the Olympics should step aside to permit New York City to hold it, as a patriotic gesture that would improve both the economy and the spirits of this city.
Mr. Green said he supported the idea of pursuing the Olympics, but only "were I persuaded that the public funding would be modest and the private funding would be substantial." Mr. Ferrer was particularly skeptical of the idea of holding the Olympics.
More than almost anything, the candidates talked about the need for New Yorkers to turn out tomorrow, reflecting concern that Democrats and Republicans are either unaware that the primary has been rescheduled or are too distracted to turn out.
"We must vote," Mr. Bloomberg said in a televised address on WNBC. "Think of it as lighting a candle for the 6,000 missing."
And at an appearance at the Abyssinian Baptist Church yesterday morning, Mr. Green said: "It's awkward, diverting, but essential that we have an election on Tuesday."
He added, "Whomever you vote for, America wins. If we stay as one people, black, white, Christian, Jew, Muslim, we will again rise from the ashes and continue to be in this new century a city of hope."
The candidates have been severely restricted in their ability to campaign since the attack. For one thing, they are concerned about appearing political during such a tough time. In addition, the city's Campaign Finance Board essentially froze the campaign in place on Sept. 11, ruling that the candidates could not spend any more money, other than to get out the vote.
The primary is being restaged. Votes that were cast before the polls closed on Sept. 11 will not count, so New Yorkers who voted on that day will need to return on Tuesday if they want to participate. Absentee ballots cast before Sept. 11 will count toward the result. In addition, New Yorkers who live in parts of Manhattan where the polling places were destroyed can pick up absentee ballots at the Board of Elections today.
As memories of the attack grew further away and the primary grew closer, there were signs of exchanges among the candidates, if indirect ones. Mr. Green disputed a suggestion by Mr. Ferrer that New York, in rebuilding, scatter office buildings across the city.
"The financial services center was centralized in Lower Manhattan," Mr. Green said. "That is the heart of financial services and American business."
And Mr. Badillo took indirect note of Democrats who had been critical of the Police Department, saying: "It's not time for people who have been bashing the uniformed services."
All the candidates acknowledged that their vision of what they would do as mayor had been changed by the attack.
Mr. Hevesi said that his call for raising teacher salaries would have to be slowed down. And he noted that "we'll have to rethink how we build an affordable housing program," given that most of the candidates had planned to use revenues from leasing the World Trade Center to pay for housing.
He also said that the city would need to invest in new tourist advertisement programs to revive the tourism industry.
Mr. Vallone appeared to step back from his commitment to spare the Parks Department from any cuts, though he stressed the importance of city recreation programs, particularly now. 
Mr. Bloomberg argued strongly against raising taxes to help the city through this period. Mr. Green said he thought a tax increase would be unnecessary because "I am hopeful that Washington and the state, with generous gifts and bonding authority, will help us."
But mostly, yesterday was a day in which the candidates struggled to figure out how to adapt what had been their earlier campaign themes to this very new political environment.
Mr. Vallone asserted that he had played a crucial role in City Hall's response to the attack.
"Let me take this opportunity to report briefly to you on what I have been doing," he said in his televised address. He added: "I have been doing my job, which is to govern. I've been working closely with the mayor and the City Council and emergency officials, striving to put the city we love on the road to reconstruction and renewal."
Mr. Bloomberg said: "I am a business leader with experience in both good and bad economic times, in creating jobs, in crisis management, in managing thousands of people worldwide, in dealing with billion-dollar budgets, and conflicting priorities. That is why my experience is right for now." 
And Mr. Ferrer, asked how he would deal with the crisis, responded: "I faced some of these problems when I walked into my office 14 years ago as borough president -- albeit on a far smaller scale, nothing of this dimension."
Finally, the candidates offered some tough words directed at the terrorists. "We will show the world," Mr. Bloomberg said on WNBC. "We will cower to no one! This is America and we are New York!" (The exclamation points were included in the text of his remarks issued by his office).
Mr. Vallone, speaking animatedly to Ms. Kramer, said: "We're going to show these characters they picked the wrong city in the wrong time in the wrong place, and we're going to get back at them in a way they'll never understand."

HEADLINE: The Right Time for Talking 

 BODY:
Over the weekend, New York City voters finally had the opportunity to reassess the candidates for mayor in tomorrow's primaries. At televised public appearances, the contenders attempted to explain how they would govern a city that is so different from the one that existed before the original Election Day, Sept. 11. Their comments demonstrated how important it is now to take a second look at the men who want to lead New York. 
 The tasks for our next mayor will be far different from the ones we, or they, envisioned before the attack. Instead of building new housing, his first priority will have to be reconstructing the financial center in Lower Manhattan. While the city's schools still must be improved, there will be less money available for new programs and teacher salaries. The Police Department, under fire and demoralized two weeks ago, is now filled with pride and grief over its lost officers. 
 Some of the candidates seem to have made the transition more successfully than others. Both Public Advocate Mark Green and Comptroller Alan Hevesi outlined thoughtful plans for quickly rebuilding Lower Manhattan, improving security and renewing the city's businesses, infrastructure and services, while adjusting the budget to these new priorities. Mr. Green and Mr. Hevesi have obviously spent some time interviewing experts and studying the ways other cities have responded to catastrophic destruction. As the two men took pains to make clear, they have also done what they could to aid in the recovery operation at the World Trade Center and to comfort the victims' families.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone have been less successful so far in demonstrating how to move New York forward. Mr. Ferrer's ideas about Lower Manhattan seemed vague and confusing. Mr. Vallone spent much of the last two weeks at Mr. Giuliani's side, and it would perhaps be unfair to expect him to have come up with as detailed an agenda. But he submitted a hastily conceived plan for a commission to oversee rebuilding that gives the city exclusive control, even though the state and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will be crucial players in the process. At a time of stress, it becomes particularly important that the city's leaders take time for reflection before they act. 
Until Sept. 11, the overriding issue in the Republican primary had been public fascination with the wealth and spending of Michael Bloomberg. Now, many Republicans are wondering if they could find a way to keep Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in office, despite term limits. Mr. Giuliani should concentrate on continuing to provide the city with leadership for the rest of his term. The city does not need to be thrown into the chaos that would come with an attempt to somehow change the rules of an election at this late date. 
One point on which all the candidates were right last weekend was the importance of voting in tomorrow's primaries. As many pointed out, that is the best way to honor the fallen and triumph over terrorism.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE REGION; 
End of Sanctions May Ease Pakistanis' Despair Even as the Afghans' Grows Worse

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's decision to ease economic sanctions on Pakistan came as a much-needed boost today to Pakistan's government, steadying some of the nervousness that had been mounting since Pakitan's military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, pledged his backing for American plans for a military thrust into neighboring Afghanistan. 
 President Bush's decision, which also lifted sanctions on India, imposed after both countries tested nuclear weapons in 1998, was announced in Washington on Saturday night. The step was quickly greeted by high-ranking officials here as an early token of the rewards General Musharraf has promised this impoverished nation of 140 million as he seeks support for his commitment to Mr. Bush's plans for a war on international terrorism. 
 "This will be of great assistance to the common man," said Shaukat Aziz, the finance minister, who has wrestled with the burden of a rising foreign debt that has for years kept Pakistan at constant risk of default, as well as unemployment so severe that, by a recent estimate, for every job that becomes available there are 2,000 people awaiting work. 
Mr. Aziz said one effect of Mr. Bush's move would be to help Pakistan gain relief on debts of almost $37 billion, through Washington's influence with international lending agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
But even as the government here held out the prospect of Pakistan's turning the corner on years of deepening social despair, other developments pointed toward the hazards that await Washington as it plans what may be its first war in Asia since Vietnam.
In Afghanistan, reports indicated that the Taliban government that has harbored Osama bin Laden was beginning its own preparations for war, ordering troop reinforcements along the border with Pakistan, building new bunkers and installing antiaircraft batteries. 
The hard-line Islamic clerics who lead the Taliban showed signs, too, of fostering a new wave of hunger and helplessness among Afghanistan's 26 million people, by issuing a decree threatening death to any relief worker caught using a satellite telephone.
The Afghan people, heavily dependent of foreign assistance, have suffered from two decades of unrelenting war and several years of drought. Over the weekend, United Nations officials estimated that fear of American military strikes had propelled more than a million people into a new exodus from cities like Kandahar and Kabul.
The order barring satellite phones appeared to be part of a Taliban hunt for "spies" helping to prepare an American attack, a concern so much on the mind of the movement's leading clerics that they provided an Islamic justification for summary execution of any suspect in a religious decree, or fatwa, that they issued last week. 
The decree specified that "if Muslims, Afghans and non-Afghans, extend cooperation to the infidels during an American attack, or assist them to carry out espionage activities, they will be considered foreign aggressors, and their murder will be an obligation."
At a time when relief supplies inside Afghanistan were already desperately low, it was not clear how, if at all, the relief agencies could continue to coordinate their operations with their supply bases in Pakistan without satellite phones.
Aid efforts have already been on a precarious footing after most agencies withdrew their foreign staff members when the Taliban authorities arrested a group of relief workers, including two Americans, in Kabul in August and accused them of proselytizing for Christianity, an offense that carries the death penalty. They are still being held. 
Some relief agencies saw the Taliban's move barring satellite phones as an attempt to create an even deeper crisis for which the United States could be blamed, further inflaming passions that have been aroused across the Muslim world by the prospect of American strikes.
Nowhere have such sentiments been so closely watched by the United States as in Pakistan, which was chosen as the key partner for the American war plans because of its relatively modern ports, roads and air bases, and because its 1,400-mile frontier with Afghanistan provides a launching platform along the Afghans' eastern and southern borders.
After relentless American pressure for him to cooperate, General Musharraf has begun to breathe easier in recent days as Islamic militant groups failed to draw the vast crowds they had hoped for at protests staged in almost every city and town. Mr. Bush's decision would give him still more maneuvering room. 
Although four people were shot dead by the police at a demonstration in Karachi on Saturday, and Islamic groups have provided local and foreign television networks with vivid footage of American flags and effigies of President Bush being burned, the limited scale of the protests have encouraged the government to hope that it can avoid much wider turmoil as American military planning proceeds. 
Still, it was a measure of how sensitive the political situation here has become that Finance Minister Aziz felt the need to deny accusations by Islamic groups that General Musharraf had betrayed Pakistan by agreeing to help the United States in a war with a neighboring Muslim country, Afghanistan.
"There's no question of a payback," Mr. Aziz said today. Instead, he characterized the American decision as the Bush administration's finally heeding pleas Pakistan had repeatedly made since the sanctions were imposed. 
The first round of sanctions came in 1990, when Washington acted to punish Pakistan for developing nuclear weapons. The second round came after India set off a nuclear blast in 1998, and Pakistan quickly followed suit. 
The finance minister said that one of the most important benefits for Pakistan would be that the Bush administration could now support Pakistan on measures pending before the I.M.F. that had the potential to kick-start the economy here, in particular measures to relieve the foreign debt. 
Immediately after General Musharraf pledged his cooperation to the United States, Pakistan, facing a Sept. 30 deadline for debt repayments, doubled its request for relief, to $5 billion, in the expectation that Washington would push the package through international financial institutions. Officials here said easing the nuclear-related sanctions would also allow Washington to renew some forms of aid, arms sales and export credits. 
The sanctions for the nuclear tests were applied in equal measure to both countries, but because Pakistan's economy is far smaller and weaker than India's, and because the sanctions dropped by President Bush did not include other measures imposed after General Musharraf seized power in a military coup in October 1999, the effects were felt more severely here. That was underscored today when India's finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, greeted the lifting of sanctions as a "good thing," but called the step "a minor issue as far as the Indian economy is concerned." 
Indeed, India's distemper over the growing American cooperation with Pakistan presents another problem to be confronted by the Bush administration. While Pakistan was still hesitating over Washington's demands for cooperation in its war against terrorism, India jumped in with what was billed as an unconditional offer of the use of Indian airspace and air bases. 
In his television address, General Musharraf alluded to that offer, saying that Pakistan, had it refused, might have risked isolation in its confrontation with India over Kashmir, and even an Indian attack on its nuclear installations.
By the end of last week, Indian officials, including Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, had begun to complain that Washington had shunned the Indian offer and sided with Pakistan, which India has accused of being a terrorist state for backing Muslim insurgent groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir. 
At the same time, other troubles were building inside Afghanistan, as the Taliban sought to further muddy the waters over Mr. bin Laden. Today the Taliban said they had been unable to trace the fugitive to tell him that a meeting of Muslim clerics had urged him to leave the country "of his own free will."
"We still have not been able to deliver the clerics' message to him, because we could not find him," said the spokesman, Abul Hai Mutmaen. 
Asked if the world's most wanted man was still in Afghanistan, he replied: "I cannot say."

HEADLINE: Nations in Pacific Rim Are Supporting Airlines 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
Threatened by a wholesale grounding of airplanes, governments around the Pacific Rim pledged today to help airlines that are hobbled by soaring insurance rates and sharply reduced coverage for terrorist acts.
 Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand all said they would bridge a sudden shortfall in insurance coverage by their air carriers after the terror attacks on New York and Washington. 
 The moves, similar to recent government rescue packages in the United States, Britain and Germany, came hours before the insurance industry said it would limit coverage to $50 million a flight for death, injury and property damage on the ground for crashes, hijackings or other disasters.
That figure is far below the threshold of minimum protection required by most airlines, and it could have grounded planes worldwide on Tuesday. Airports, whose coverage is also threatened, would also have closed. 
Even as Hong Kong announced its aid package, two local carriers, Cathay Pacific Airways and Dragonair, said they had negotiated a new policy with insurers that would allow them to continue flying without public assistance.
Cathay Pacific and Dragonair are the first Asian airlines to obtain new insurance in this turbulent environment. But their executives were not crowing because the high cost of the coverage will almost certainly drive up ticket prices.
"It's very expensive," said Antony Tyler, director of corporate development at Cathay Pacific. "One way or the other, it's going to be reflected in fares. It's too early to say when or how much."
The escalating costs come as passenger traffic, especially to and from the United States, has sharply dropped. Singapore Airlines said its advance reservations to New York and Chicago were off 10 percent. Weak bookings led United Airlines to cancel some flights from Hong Kong to Los Angeles and New York.
"We've got a stronger balance sheet, and we're financially more robust than the American airlines," Mr. Tyler said. "But there's no doubt we're going to be hurt. We're in for very difficult times ahead."
The measures announced today are temporary -- generally lasting six months -- but some analysts said uncertainty over American military retaliation may oblige governments to back their airlines indefinitely.
"If you have a worsening of the situation, it might have to continue," said Jean-Louis Morisot, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs in Singapore. "This situation is as bad as we could possibly have imagined."
Unlike their American peers, most Asian and Pacific carriers have not announced layoffs or widespread cancellations. Mr. Morisot said the absence of such measures here so far was less a reflection of Asia's strength than of its uncertainty about how deep the downturn will be.
Some smaller carriers say they might escape the worst fallout. Philippine Airlines, which was nearly shut down in 1998 and has requested state aid to maintain its insurance, is nevertheless optimistic about its prospects.
"We're hoping that this problem will blow over," the airline's president, Avelino Zapanta, said today in an interview with a Philippine television station. "We have faith in the resilience of Filipino travelers, which make up more than 50 percent of our total traffic."
The lack of obvious distress among Asian airlines has made these rescue efforts more contentious than the $15 billion plan approved by Washington. In Hong Kong, members of the legislature challenged officials about why they were offering aid for six months. Such questions resonate here because the government prides itself on not meddling in the private sector.
Antony Leung, the financial secretary, said the territory had to intervene because the airport was one of the engines of the economy. Hong Kong International Airport is the world's busiest international airport in cargo traffic and No. 5 in passengers. Without the extra help, Mr. Leung said, it would have lost $1.25 billion in insurance coverage against damage to its facilities.
"Many people's jobs would be on the line," he said. "We are facing exceptional times, and we are taking exceptional measures."
Some Hong Kong legislators criticized insurance companies for seeking to capitalize everywhere in the world for a terrorist attack that took place only in the United States. "The insurance industry has hijacked the global economy, and we have to surrender," said Cyd Ho, a member of the legislature.
But Jim Eckes, the managing director of Indoswiss Aviation in Hong Kong, said Asia was a prime target for the kinds of airborne attacks that struck New York and Washington. In 1995, he noted, terrorists were foiled in a plan to place bombs on a dozen American airliners in East Asia.
"Any Asian country with serious political problems faces the possibility of terrorism and suicide hijackings," Mr. Eckes said.

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA; 
As Tourism Halts in New Orleans, Musicians Play On

BYLINE:  By Stephen Kinzer 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Life has suddenly become hard in the Big Easy, with many restaurants and night clubs empty, hotels losing millions of dollars in canceled reservations, and Bourbon Street stiller than anyone can remember.
 "It is truly a ghost town," said Sharon Litwin, executive director of the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, as she surveyed a hotel lobby where there were more employees than guests. "It's something I've never seen and no one here has ever seen." 
 The orchestra is trying to help people deal with the jumble of emotions that welled up after this month's stunning wave of terror. At its opening night concert, just two days after the attacks on New York and Washington, the program was changed to include the contemplative adagio movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. 
Over the days that followed, members of the orchestra formed small groups to play in lobbies of office buildings. They distributed copies of a statement pledging "to redouble our effort to keep beauty and harmony and music in our beloved community."
Crowds of people stopped to watch and listen. Tears glistened in more than a few eyes.
"When people left our opening night concert, you could see they had shed so much of their weight," Ms. Litwin said. "After that, the musicians decided they wanted to go out into the community to bring the gift of music to stressed-out people."
"For a long time, those of us in the arts community have had to sell arts as an economic engine or a way to bring new business to town or with some other excuse," she continued. "Not this time. I think everyone who heard our musicians this week came away with a deep appreciation for the intrinsic power of music. It did what music is supposed to do: it touched your soul, it soothed, it calmed."
On Thursday night the orchestra traveled to Zephyr Field, a minor league baseball park in Jefferson Parish, a few miles from New Orleans. The musicians played for a crowd of 7,000 people who had just watched President Bush's speech to Congress on a large-screen television in center field.
This time the music was welcome but little more than incidental. As in countless places across the United States, people had come mostly to be with one another. The stadium was awash in American flags, candles and signs reading "God Bless America." Grief, frustration, fear and rage were among the emotions.
Waves of applause washed across the crowd each time a speaker mentioned American soldiers, police officers or firefighters. People also cheered Hasan Krad, a local Muslim leader who teaches at Dillard University, when he asked God to give American leaders "the wisdom to punish only those who are guilty."
In the crowd Wayne Chalona, a biology professor and World War II veteran, said the events of Sept. 11 were "more than you can comprehend."
"Life has changed for America," Mr. Chalona said. "It's never going to be the same again. Terrorists can strike anywhere, anytime."
Many of those at the ballpark were young, ranging from small children dressed in red-white-and-blue smocks to teenagers. "I'm still scared," said Corey Newell, a 16-year-old high school student who was wearing baggy shorts and carrying a candle. "We have to get them before they get to New Orleans. But I don't know if we can."
Behind the last row of seats, Jefferson Parish's president, Tim Coulon, stood with the fire chief, whose badge was covered with a black stripe. Mr. Coulon described the evening's gathering as "a kind of giant funeral, with people mourning and feeling great sorrow and disbelief."
"The secondary goal of the terrorists was to beak our confidence and spirit, and to some extent they've succeeded," he said. "People are feeling a great fear. They want to be assured that this won't happen in Louisiana, but no one can give them that assurance."
Fear has seemingly cast a pall over the streets of New Orleans, which depends as much as any city in the United States on the tourist trade. Thousands of cooks, waiters, chambermaids, bartenders and others whose jobs rely on tourism have been told either not to report for work until further notice or to come less often than before.
The well-regarded restaurant Dominique's is now open three nights a week instead of seven. Others have followed suit.
A convention of the National Business Aviation Association that was to have brought more than 30,000 people here this week was canceled. Hotels that expected occupancy rates over 90 percent found themselves below 10 percent.
Three conventions scheduled for October, expected to attract more than 50,000 people, are to proceed as planned. But as people who serve tourists looked out over deserted streets, they wondered how many people would leave home at such a moment.
"It's dead; it's a desert," said Mohammed Ihmed, a taxi driver who was born in Egypt but has lived in New Orleans for more than a decade. "If this keeps up for a few more weeks, I'm going to look for another job."
Mr. Ihmed, who wears wraparound sunglasses and whose friends here know him as Mo, said he had not faced any threats, curses or other unpleasantness recently because of his Arab background. "Actually, it's been the other way," he said. "People are calling me and saying: 'We know you, we love you, you're our friend. Don't think that anything has changed between us.' "

HEADLINE: Behind the Scenes, Soldiering On; 
For Theater's Supporting Family, a New Kind of Uncertainty

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
It was when the television at the bar turned from CNN to baseball that Joe Allen knew things were beginning to inch back toward normal. But normalcy is still a long way off for Mr. Allen -- who owns the restaurant that bears his name on West 46th Street, a popular theater hangout -- and the hundreds of other people who make up Broadway's back-office operations, extended family, support system.
 Will the tourists return? Will old shows close? Will new shows come in? The questions affect everyone from the makers of wigs, shoes and marquees to restaurateurs, fight directors, ticket sellers and those who write advertisements or publish programs: all of whom depend for their livelihoods on the Great White Way. 
 Broadway has seen its share of hard times. But veterans say this downturn -- in which ticket sales were off $3 million to $5 million last week, four shows have closed, one show has canceled and warhorses like "Les Miserables" and "Phantom of the Opera" are at risk because they depend on tourists -- is the most dramatic because the duration is so uncertain. 
"In 27 years I've never seen anything like this," said Wayne Sapper, the president of King Displays, a sign and graphics company started in 1938 that specializes in theater marquees.
Mr. Sapper is proceeding with work on the marquees for "The Women," scheduled to start previews on Oct. 12 at the American Airlines Theater, and "Noises Off," due to begin performances on Oct. 16 at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. But he said he was concerned that he would soon have to "paint out," meaning take down signs for shows that prove to be casualties of this crisis.
"I remember when Kennedy was assassinated," Mr. Sapper said. "In three weeks people were back. Even during the gulf war. Theater's always been recession-proof. People didn't have a lot of money to travel, they would come to the theater. Now people are afraid to come out. It's a whole different set of circumstances."
At a time when audiences may have a lower tolerance for watching violence, a theatrical fight director like Rick Sordelet might have reason to worry about the demand for his services. But drama, Mr. Sordelet said, is about conflict, and when words fail, people resort to "physical dialogue," at least onstage. While a show like the forthcoming Broadway musical "Reefer Madness," which he worked on, has falling bodies, body parts and blood, Mr. Sordelet said the audience would be able to make the distinction between goofiness and gore.
"Just because this thing happened doesn't mean the world will be repulsed by violence," he said. "If anything, they will want to understand it better."
To stanch the industry's financial losses, people who work on Broadway -- including actors, stage managers, stagehands, musicians, wardrobe personnel and others -- have agreed to a 25 percent reduction in pay for four weeks. Sam Vasili of Sam Vasili Shoe Repair, which has long shod performers in Broadway shows, falls into that category because he is part of wardrobe.
"We're trying to do the best we can to stay in business," he said. "I'm going to have a difficult time. We lost like 70 percent of the theatergoers. We have to pray we will get all those people back."
Yesterday the League of American Theaters and Producers announced a marketing program to try to bring people in New York region back to Broadway and help the associated businesses that are struggling. The campaign includes advertisements featuring "I <heart> New York Theater"; radio commercials featuring Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Kevin Spacey; and a television commercial to be filmed in Times Square featuring the casts of every current Broadway show in costume singing "New York, New York."
The Theater Development Fund, which runs the half-price ticket booths, is searching for a temporary downtown location to replace its booth at 2 World Trade Center. 
The fund is also organizing a theater relief effort to help get shows through this period. John Breglio, chairman of the development fund, said the moment could be an opportunity for a large-scale reassessment of how the business of Broadway might work better. "Maybe now it will force all of us to start looking at the basic principles of how we operate," Mr. Breglio, an entertainment lawyer, said. "It will never be business as usual. Hopefully it will be business. But it has to be business in a different way."
It is with Broadway's support services in mind that organizations like the Theater Development Fund are trying to establish long-term guards against a disabling falloff in business.
"It's the theater business; we always are on the cusp of failure, even in the best of times, shows have a 99 percent chance of not making it," Mr. Breglio said. "This is a whole new level of uncertainty. But if there's any business that is used to dealing with high risk, it's this business. It's just a greater degree."
Perhaps most difficult is precisely that state of uncertainty. Things are not as bad as they could get if another calamitous event strikes or tourists stay home or theatrical investors steer clear indefinitely. 
Even outside New York City, ticket sales for touring companies like "Kiss Me, Kate," are suffering. "It's been not so hot so far," said Roger Berlind, a producer of "Kate," which was saved from closing on Broadway on Sunday by an 11th-hour agreement by the cast and crew to take a pay cut. 
"The reaction is pretty scary in big cities," Mr. Berlind added. "L.A. is taking a hit. London is a problem. We're just trying to soldier through all this. It's so depressing. I wish Giuliani would take over my business."
For now Broadway's behind-the-scenes population is sitting tight, bracing even while trying to conduct business as usual. Paul Huntley is preparing hair and wigs for various productions -- including "Hedda Gabler," the new musical "Thou Shalt Not" and Neil Simon's new play, "45 Seconds From Broadway" -- hoping that an evening in the theater will prove to be a necessity.
"We are just trotting ahead bravely," he said. "Being English, I'm old enough to have known the war. People rally round, and the entertainment business is their escape."
Some say the doomsayers have spoken too soon; people are still in the shock and mourning phase, and the true test of whether they return to seeing shows is yet to come. "Theater is something that has survived two world wars, recession, depression, assassinations, market crashes," said Philip Birsh, the president and publisher of Playbill magazine. "We need to have some real data, some real time go by."
Theater is getting an inordinate -- perhaps disproportionate -- amount of attention, Mr. Birsh said, because its results are immediately apparent; seats are empty. "We should allow people's patterns to return -- their patterns have been disrupted," he said. "Once people are satisfied that there are not going to be more incidents, they will get back to these patterns, and one of those patterns is they love theater and will return."
Others fear that the business will never be the same, if only because the terrorist attacks have left people permanently changed. "I'm fairly nervous," said Mr. Allen, the restaurant owner, because of one poll's findings that a large number of people say "they would only fly if they absolutely had to."
"We're kind of joined at the hip with the theater business," he said, "and certainly tourism affects the theater."
To some extent the nightly crowd at Joe Allen is made up of locals -- actors, stagehands and resident theatergoers. But people from out of town are nevertheless essential. "The tourists fill in the cracks," Mr. Allen said. "They'll be missed, you can be sure of that."

HEADLINE: Group Sees Slow Growth For Tourism 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
Opening its conference here today, the World Tourism Organization put the best face on what it acknowledged were "difficult times," predicting 1.5 percent growth in worldwide tourism this year despite sudden drops after the terrorist attacks in the United States.
 "In the short term, the industry was severely hit," said Francesco Frangialli, secretary general of the organization, opening an assembly held every two years. This one is attended by representatives of 118 of the group's 135 member nations. 
 Mr. Frangialli said the industry had been expected to post a 3 percent gain for the year before the attacks. Now it foresees double-digit drops in the last quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, compared with the quarters a year earlier. 
The tourism industry must deal with the searing images of four hijacked planes plunging to earth as suicide missiles. Mr. Frangialli and other delegates at the meeting expressed guarded optimism.
"We have had the experience of overreaction before," Mr. Frangialli said. "A lot depends on military developments and the global economy. But we maintain our vision for the long term of 1 billion tourist arrivals in the year 2010 and 1.5 billion in 2020."
The impact of the terror attacks would have been far worse, he said, if they had come during the summer tourist season. "For many countries, the peak season is over," he said.
The tourism organization, a United Nations-affiliated body based in Madrid, issued an analysis of the impact of the attacks before the opening ceremony of the conference. Seoul and Osaka, Japan, were chosen as sites for the conference because the final rounds of the World Cup soccer tournament will be held in South Korea and Japan next year; the meeting shifts to Osaka on Friday.
The issue of terrorism and the impact of the attacks was the consuming topic for delegates. Because the airline industry was already slumping before the attacks, the question now is "how long will we feel the effect," said Peter Shackleford, regional representative for Europe. "If it's a blip, we can cope with it. If it's longer, it will be difficult."

HEADLINE: Leading Index Fell in August For First Time Since March 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators fell in August for the first time since March, a decline that is likely to be extended after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
 The Conference Board's index, a gauge of economic activity over the next three to six months, fell 0.3 percent, after rising 0.4 percent in July. The August decrease reflected fewer hours worked in factories and a decline in consumer expectations. 
 The economy, which expanded in the April-June quarter at the slowest pace in eight years, was showing no signs of picking up before Sept. 11. The attacks may cause growth to contract by damping consumer, investor and business confidence, analysts said. Companies like Federated Department Stores and Honeywell International have already trimmed sales forecasts, in anticipation of slower demand.
"The index showed the economy was already weak before the crisis, and the attacks will now dump it into recession," said Steven A. Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen Inc. in Walnut Creek, Calif. The economy was last in recession from July 1990 to March 1991, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass.
To help prevent a recession, investors are expecting the Federal Reserve policy makers to lower the benchmark overnight borrowing rate to a 39-year low of 2.5 percent at their next meeting on Oct. 2, judging from trading in Fed funds futures contracts. Central bankers cut the target rate on overnight loans between banks to a seven-year low of 3 percent last week.
The Conference Board compiles its leading indicators index from eight previously reported economic statistics and estimates on new orders for consumer and capital goods. Seven of the 10 indicators showed weakness in August.
Analysts expected a 0.1 percent decrease, after the previously reported 0.3 percent July rise.
Falling stock prices, faster delivery times, a narrower spread between yields on 10-year Treasury notes and the Fed's overnight rate, a rise in jobless benefit claims and a drop in building permits also contributed to the August decrease.
Two indicators, factory orders for nonmilitary capital goods and orders for consumer goods, were unchanged. Another, an increase in the money supply, pointed to strength.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index for September, to be reported Tuesday, will probably show a drop to its lowest reading in more than five years, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Apartment Rents and Prices Tremble, but Don't Plummet 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Despite dire predictions about plummeting apartment prices, and despite the bad economic news since the World Trade Center attacks, Manhattan's real estate rental and sales prices have not gone into free fall. 
 "While it would be ludicrous to say it is business as usual, the market does seem to be rolling along, although at a slower pace," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg. 
 Mr. Peters, along with other real estate executives, said he expected some "downward pressure on prices" -- price cuts -- in current deals. 
Brokers said they had already seen price reductions of 10 to 15 percent on the costliest apartments before the disaster: the $8 million Fifth Avenue duplex going under contract for $7 million, for example. They added that less expensive apartments still appeared to be selling at or near the asking price, except those below Canal Street, where there was virtually no activity at all. 
For the most part, closings have gone on, although there have been isolated instances of buyers walking away, effectively handing their 10 percent deposit to the sellers, who then try to sell the apartment all over again.
"We only had one person walk away," said Alan Rogers, chairman of Douglas Elliman, the city's largest real estate brokerage firm. "But he left $500,000 behind."
In general, agents say they worry most about new business, not existing deals. 
"I don't think New York has seen anything like this since the mid-70's," Mr. Peters said. "There's an uncertainty about what will happen next."
Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group (who yesterday announced the sale of her company), said she had told a roomful of shell-shocked brokers last Friday that they should tell their customers to make offers.
"I was suggesting that some buyers are so psychologically low now that they might be having a hard time buying anything," she said last night. "I told them to let the buyer make an offer. Let the buyer set the market."
But she said that rumors that prices were already down as much as 30 percent were absurd. She also said it was premature to say that the seller's market, which peaked 18 months ago, had tipped into a buyer's market, although some brokers were saying privately that it was probably true.
Meanwhile, some would-be buyers are taking advantage of the uncertainty, or are trying to. Ellen Rubin, who owns a public relations firm, said she was staying with her boyfriend in her father's Park Avenue apartment after being evacuated from her TriBeCa rental. She wants to keep looking for an apartment to buy, in the same area. "But to be perfectly honest," she said, "my first thought about apartment-hunting was, 'Now I can really get a deal.' "
Several agents told tales of buyers with signed contracts, which are usually binding, who approached the seller after the tragedy and tried to renegotiate the price downward. (Their threat was to walk away from the deal.)
"We had eight people trying to renegotiate last week," said Scott Durkin, chief operating officer of the Corcoran Group. "And guess what? Three were successful."
Mr. Durkin said landlords reduced the prices of 1,500 of their rental apartments -- from Upper East Side brownstones to luxury towers -- last week from $50 to $200, far more than the 400 such price reductions in the week before the attack. But executives at two of the city's largest rental agencies, Feathered Nest and CitiHabitats, questioned that figure, adding that any reductions they had seen were on apartments that were overpriced to begin with.
Andrew Heiberger, president of CitiHabitats, said that calls from people seeking apartments had been cut in half last week. But that was a lot better than the week before. After what he called "the initial jolt," deals did go through.
"When the planes hit the World Trade Center, we had 300 deals in progress," he said. "They disappeared for a week. Then maybe 250 re-emerged and the contracts were signed."
Yet there are not many contracts, sales or rental, being signed downtown these days. Not surprisingly, brokers cite the shock of the attack and the neighborhood's inaccessibility. "People are streaming out of downtown," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest. "And they are going uptown. Uptown, the rental market is strong." 
While most agents say it is too soon to judge the long-term strength of Manhattan's real estate market, there was one interesting statistic from one of the city's largest mortgage brokers.
Melissa Cohn, president of Manhattan Mortgage, said that some of her business last week was people refinancing their properties because of low interest rates.
"But 15 out of 27 of those new deals were people who had just decided to buy something," Ms. Cohn said. "And that surprised even me."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Television networks wonder how much lower prices for commercial time could go.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
AS the broadcast television networks belatedly begin the 2001-02 prime-time season, they are anxiously trying to determine if the prices they charge for commercial time -- already softening before the events of Sept. 11 -- will weaken further.
 The season officially started last night, a week later than planned because regular programming had been replaced by coverage of the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center. As the networks introduce their new and returning series, they wonder how hard they will be hit by deferrals or cancellations of the estimated $6.7 billion worth of commercial time that agencies bought on behalf of advertisers before the season began in the so-called upfront market. 
 The networks are also concerned about how well demand will hold up for the remaining commercial time that they sell as the season progresses, in what is known as the scatter market.
"The question is, as in all things, where is the economy?" said Jon Mandel, co-managing director at MediaCom Worldwide in New York, a media services agency that is one of the nation's largest buyers of TV commercial time. 
But in this instance, he added, forecasting is complicated by "this overlaying malaise" related to the anger and grief caused by the assaults, as well as by the inability to predict what may happen next as the United States military prepares to respond. MediaCom is part of the Grey Global Group. 
It is difficult to determine at this point if the decisions being made by agencies and their clients are spurred by worries "about an economic downturn," said Joe Mandese, editor of Media Buyer's Daily, a newsletter published by Brill Media Holdings in New York, or by "tactical moves relating to a crisis."
"Because it's hard to tell, that leaves a high level of uncertainty," he added, "and uncertainty in this type of environment is not good."
The sluggish economy had already significantly slowed demand for spots during prime-time programming. The estimated $6.7 billion worth of commercial time sold before the start of the 2001-02 season was down 14.1 percent from the record $7.8 billion sold in the upfront market before the start of the previous season.
As a result, prices for 30-second commercials declined by an average of 15 percent to 20 percent from last season, according to an annual survey by the trade publication Advertising Age. The survey is the subject of a front-page article in the issue published this week.
"The networks are all in the same boat," said Wayne Friedman, the Los Angeles bureau chief of Advertising Age, published by Crain Communications, who wrote the article.
The aftermath of the attacks is raising issues about the content of programs, he added, which may force agencies to rethink media plans.
"Sitcoms may seem too trivial to viewers, who may ask 'Why are we watching this?' " Mr. Friedman said. "If there are any accidents in reality shows, as there was in 'Survivor' last season," he added, "advertisers may say, 'Hey, wait a second; I don't want to be in this.'
"Though viewers may want to watch something a little more serious," Mr. Friedman said, "there might be problems with terrorist-themed episodes of shows like 'The Agency,' '24' and 'Alias.' " He was referring to new dramas on CBS, Fox Broadcasting and ABC, respectively.
"But in the patriotic fervor we're in," he added, "maybe if they catch the bad guys, that's something we'd want to see."
The weakened demand for TV commercial time can be seen in the results of the Advertising Age survey of the prices being charged by the largest broadcast networks for 30-second spots. The most expensive prime-time commercial during the 2001-02 season is $445,000, according to the survey, on "Survivor: Africa" on CBS. By comparison, the most expensive 30-second spot during the 2000-01 season, according to the survey last year, was $620,000, on "ER" on NBC. (See chart.)
While NBC remained the network with the most expensive average price for each 30-second commercial, the survey reported, at $158,400, that compared with $198,864 that NBC commanded as first in that category in the 2000-01 season. NBC is owned by the General Electric Company.
Fox, owned by the News Corporation, follows NBC in the survey at $154,600, an increase from $150,310 compared with last season. After Fox came ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, at $149,700, compared with $193,409; and CBS, a division of Viacom, at $129,000, compared with $190,114.
The survey also gave average prices for each 30-second spot on the two smallest networks, which were not included last year: WB, owned by AOL Time Warner and the Tribune Company, $66,000, and UPN, also owned by Viacom, $37,400.
The lowest price for a 30-second commercial on any of the largest broadcast networks, according to the survey, is $13,300, during the "UPN Friday Movie."
So far, Mr. Mandel said, "our clients have basically stuck with the program" in terms of what they indicated they wanted during the upfront market. "Close to 95 percent have stayed with their spending," he added.
Still, the fourth quarter, which begins on Monday, "is going to be ugly," Mr. Mandel said, "with the networks being undersold" and "the new season being a mess because a lot of shows won't have had the proper promotion as a result of the delay" in starting the 2001-02 season.
But in a paradox, he added, "If the ratings fall, many advertisers will have to spend more to get the ratings they originally wanted," which would benefit the networks.
Mr. Mandese said that to this point, he had not heard of any advertisers "seeking to get more releases than normal" from the commitments they and their agencies made in the upfront market.
"The networks do want to be accommodating" in helping advertisers get out from commitments that now seem ill-advised, he added, "but on the other hand, they do need revenue to stay in business."
In some instances, spending is being shifted to the fourth quarter from the third quarter without difficulty.
For example, the Pontiac division of the General Motors Corporation had planned to introduce a divisional marketing campaign during the CBS broadcast of the Emmy Awards on Sept. 16, but the show was postponed after the attacks. Now, said Leah Haran, a spokeswoman for Pontiac in Detroit, as CBS reschedules the Emmy broadcast for Oct. 7, the campaign will begin then. The campaign is being created by the Troy, Mich., office of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, part of the Bcom3 Group.
In other instances, spending has proceeded as planned. The Taco Bell division of Tricon Global Restaurants went ahead and introduced TV spots last Tuesday as part of a new campaign carrying the theme "Think outside the bun." The campaign is being produced by the San Francisco office of Foote, Cone & Belding, part of the FCB Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
And Ocean Spray Cranberries moved forward last week with two campaigns, both from Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas Advertising. One campaign was for a new white cranberry juice drink, which appeared on the West Coast, where the product is initially available. The other, for the flagship red cranberry juice drink, reviving the theme "Crave the wave," appeared in most of the country.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Cheaper Commercials"Prices for commercials during prime-time programming on the major broadcast television networks for the 2001-2002 season are lower, in many cases substantially, than during the 2000-2001 season, according to an annual survey by the trade publication Advertising Age. Here is a look at the five most expensive 30-second commercial slots this season and last season. 2001-2002 SEASON "Survivor: Africa," CBS -- $445,000"ER," NBC -- 425,400"Friends," NBC -- 353,600"Monday Night Football," ABC -- 330,200"Will & Grace," NBC -- 321,200 2000-2001 SEASON "ER," NBC -- $620,000"Friends," NBC -- 540,000"Will & Grace," NBC -- 480,000"Just Shoot Me," NBC -- 465,000"Everybody Loves Raymond," CBS -- 460,000 (Source: Advertising Age)

HEADLINE: Corcoran Sells Realty Firm She Founded 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Barbara Corcoran, the powerhouse Manhattan real estate broker, agreed yesterday to sell the firm she founded, the Corcoran Group, Manhattan's second-largest independent residential real estate company.
 The buyer is a real estate company jointly owned by the franchising conglomerate Cendant Corporation and the private investment firm Apollo Management. 
 Ms. Corcoran, a 51-year-old former receptionist, started her current real estate firm with just $1,000 and seven agents in 1973 selling apartments on the Upper East Side. This deal allows her to cash out at a time when many in the real estate industry say the market may have just passed its peak and may be heading downward. 
The deal was announced late today. While neither side would divulge how much was paid for the Corcoran Group, a person close to the negotiations said the price was about $70 million.
Ms. Corcoran said she decided to sell the company because "not being national was shortsighted."
She added: "The local business has changed. And we couldn't grow as aggressively as we wanted without help."
Ms. Corcoran said she plans to stay at the company and remain the chairwoman. "I can't imagine doing anything else," she said in a telephone interview. She refused to say whether she had signed a long-term management contract. A person close to the negotiations said she did.
The buyer, NRT, is the largest franchisee of Cendant's many real estate brokerage brands like Century 21, Coldwell Banker and Era. Cendant, which also owns businesses like Avis car rental and the Days Inn hotel chain, started NRT in 1997 jointly with Apollo Management, which is run by Leon Black, the deal maker of the big junk bond firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, now defunct.
Other Manhattan real estate brokerage firms have begun consolidating, led by Insignia/ESG's $75 million purchase of Douglas Elliman in 1997 and Brown Harris Stevens's $9 million purchase earlier this year of the Halstead Property Group.
Industry analysts said that Ms. Corcoran made changes in the leadership of the company last year, signaling her interest in selling before the end of the six-year rise in the residential market. She promoted two senior managers, Pamela Liebman and Scott Durkin, to run the company.
It is unclear what effect the deal will have on the Corcoran Group's well-known perquisites, like company-sponsored dog runs for brokers in Central Park and free food at brokerage offices.
Several companies had flirted with buying Corcoran over the years, but encountered resistance from Ms. Corcoran, who associates said was waiting to sell at the top of the market. In 1997, Ms. Corcoran dismissed rumors that her firm would be sold soon, but acknowledged the benefits given industrywide consolidation.
"My hat is off to her on her timing," said Alan Rogers, the chairman of Douglas Elliman, Corcoran's primary competitor. 
Mr. Rogers said that given Cendant's reputation for maximizing profits, he and other brokers will have an easier time hiring Corcoran agents who do not want to be associated with franchises like Coldwell Banker and Century 21.
In recent years, Ms. Corcoran has pulled back from the day-to-day operations of the firm, which employs 700 brokers who work out of dozens of roomy offices from Brooklyn Heights to Madison Avenue. Ms. Corcoran has sought to project a luxury image for her firm, and she is seen as an international leader in real estate, often speaking in New York, Los Angeles and London.
She is known throughout the industry as a shrewd businesswoman, luring top brokers from other firms. Other brokers tend to follow her lead. Manhattan brokers did not begin to move into neighborhoods like Harlem, Fort Greene and Downtown Brooklyn until after Ms. Corcoran had opened offices in those places in recent years.
In the late 1980's, she was among the first advocates of the limited sharing of listings among brokers in Manhattan, and pushed for the creation of a Web site last year that would include residential sales and rental listings from hundreds of Manhattan firms. 
Manhattan is the only major metropolitan area without a system of sharing all listings, as a multiple listing service is known. But her efforts have been credited with changing the culture of Manhattan real estate.
Not all of Ms. Corcoran's efforts have been successful. A notable failure was the spinoff of corcoran.com, a Web site she thought would expand her firm internationally. The site had listings from Costa Rica to Sweden, but personnel problems and the downturn in the Internet economy were harmful. Last year, corcoran.com was folded back into the Corcoran Group.

Energy Prices Decline; Stocks Rise on Optimism
Oil and natural gas prices plunged on fears that a worldwide recession would cut energy demand. But stocks worldwide soared on optimism that the recession would be brief and that the United States economy would eventually shrug off the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
 The price of a barrel of crude oil dropped $3.96, or 15 percent, to $22.01, in trading in New York. The drop marked the biggest one-day decline since 1991. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 367.63 points, or 4.5 percent, after closing Friday with its biggest weekly loss since the Depression. Page A1. 

Money-market funds have long been the first stop for investors in troubled times. But a number of conservative investments have served as havens recently. C11.

Southwest Meets Challenge Again
Southwest is seen by analysts as the only airline with a chance to post a profit this year after the terrorist attacks in the United States. Many in the industry are watching to see whether Southwest and its chairman, Herb Kelleher, can negotiate the recent changes in how airlines operate in the aftermath of the attacks. Investors clearly think it can, and they believe the Southwest franchise to be as valuable as the rest of the industry combined. C6.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DISPLACED; 
Towers' Former Neighbors Await All-Clear

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
A quarter-century ago, a band of artists dared to do the unthinkable. They looked at the crumpled walls, shattered windows and dripping plaster of an abandoned 19th-century office building in the financial district and saw a home.
 They rebuilt walls. Fixed the boiler. Got the elevators to work again. They turned 125 Cedar Street, on a wisp of a street a block south of Liberty, into an urban homestead with artists and professionals. A block away, two enormous sentinels stood watch: the twin towers of the World Trade Center. 
 Peter Davies, who ran an antiques gallery from his apartment, liked to sit on his rooftop deck and stare at the south tower, its lights "going on and off like a light show." Because it appeared windowless from his angle, he said, "it was more like living next to a monument than an office building." 
The people of 125 Cedar lived through the 1993 trade center bombing and before that a string of bombings in the financial quarter linked to Puerto Rican nationalist groups. Now and then, urban renewal threatened to wipe clean the building.
But the Sept. 11 attack has finally thrown them out, indefinitely, and left them and thousands of other people whose homes are in the restricted area of the financial district in limbo.
Debris and ash, and possibly parts of a plane or the south tower, rained down on 125 Cedar Street, but somehow it still stands and, by early reckoning from city and utility officials, appears structurally sound.
Its location in the off-limits zone has kept the residents of 125 Cedar Street out of their homes except for brief visits, escorted by sympathetic police officers, to retrieve some belongings.
They have camped in the apartments of friends and relatives. They talk to relief agencies and fill out forms. They wrestle with emotions, wondering if it seems petty to worry about getting back to their apartments when thousands of people lie buried almost in their front yard.
But most have summoned the will to come back when the area reopens.
"We are not going to let people drive us out," said Patricia Moore, another longtime resident of the tightly knit community of 23 lofts. "It's the spirit of New Yorkers."
The mayor's Office of Emergency Management has cordoned off a 36-block area surrounding the trade center as off limits to anyone except those involved in emergency rescue efforts. A chain-link fence has gone up, and Richard Sheirer, the director of the office, said he could not say when residents, numbering more than 3,000, could return for good.
Apart from safety and security concerns, much of the area, including 125 Cedar, has no gas or electricity, he said last week.
Last night, more than 300 residents of the off-limits zone turned out for a meeting to ask when they could go home. They reacted angrily -- some stormed out -- when a representative from the mayor's office said he could not tell them.
Sometimes residents can get in for 10 or 15 minutes, or less, by showing photo identification and accompanying a sympathetic police officer; sometimes they are turned away.
Some have recovered passports, legal papers, checkbooks, clothing, and, in the case of 125 Cedar, artwork. Many others have not.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has promised financial assistance, and many residents of the zone had renters insurance, although some companies have said their displacement aid will stop in two weeks.
This state of homelessness has taken a psychological and emotional toll -- from both the displacement from their homes and the harrowing escapes from the building as debris rained down -- that they find hard to explain to people. The image of the towers falling and the loss of life nag at their consciences.
"You see all these people missing," said Mary Dierickx, an architectural preservation consultant who has lived in the building for 22 years. "How sorry can you feel for yourself?" Mary Petrillo, a video artist, asked, "How insane is it that we all survived?"
Patricia Moore, a fashion designer, finds it hard to concentrate at work. "I have no energy," she said.
Mr. Davies stomped out fires on his roof after the planes crashed into the towers. On a later visit, he said, he found a Raggedy Ann doll on his terrace that he figures must have come from one of the planes.
Returning for a short time, Andy Jurinko, a professional photographer and painter, discovered an ash-covered computer on his living room floor. "We had no computer," he said. It must have smashed through the window as the tower fell.
Tenants of 125 Cedar say a straw poll by e-mail and phone of the 50 or so people living there showed all but 2 vowed to come back. To understand why they would want to return to such a place, consider its history.
Most tenants pride themselves on living in a quirky place that they restored on their own. In exchange for cheap rents and a lot of loft space, they agreed to do most of the renovation. Legal entanglements with the owner at the time followed. That experience forged strong bonds among the tenants that exist today.
Grocery shopping meant a trip to Hoboken, N.J., on the train. Decent restaurants required a trek several blocks north to TriBeCa or beyond.
Their neighbors back then were mainly street vendors and Wall Street commuters. At night, with the streets and office towers empty, the tenants still felt safe because security guards patrolled the trade center. Besides, they reasoned, how dangerous could it be with the heavily guarded Federal Reserve Bank a few blocks away?
"It was so quiet and serene," said Kathleen Moore, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History, "and the guards in the trade center were like my doormen."
Cedar Street is a narrow passage, so their grand windows -- most apartments have 17 windows -- looked out on the south tower and 4 World Trade Center.
Ms. Moore found the towers beautiful, in their own way.
"It's not that we loved those buildings per se," she said, "but every morning I would sit in my kitchen and watch the sunrise. The light hit the side of the trade center and reflected in my kitchen. It was very golden. It in many ways was the most serene place I could imagine living in New York. It was like being in the country."
Other residents arrived when Battery Park City opened in 1982. In recent years, several former office buildings have been converted to apartments, bringing more neighbors.
But the tenants of 125 Cedar prefer to think of themselves as distinct, one of the originals, a family. On the rainy Friday after the attack, 15 of them walked together through the streets of Lower Manhattan in a desperate, and futile, trek to pass various checkpoints to their homes.
They are still awaiting answers, as is the building's owner for the last five years, Samson Management.
"We know nothing," said Arnold Goldstein, who owns Samson. Mr. Goldstein said that he was seeking engineering reports from the city and that the company planned to conduct its own. But given that "we sustained no direct hit," he said, he was optimistic that any damage could be repaired. 
Once they do go back, there is the question of how to live next to the site of the worst terrorist attack in history.
"The building was tacky inside; it had terrible decor," Mr. Davies said. "But it was my favorite building to live beside."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Oil and Gas Prices Tumble, But Stocks Soar Worldwide

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Oil and natural gas prices plunged yesterday on fears that a sharp worldwide recession would reduce energy demand. But stocks worldwide soared on optimism that the recession would be brief and that the American economy, the world's leader, would eventually shrug off the attacks of Sept. 11.
 The price of a barrel of crude oil skidded $3.96, or 15 percent, to $22.01, in trading in New York yesterday, falling to its lowest level since October 1999. It was the biggest one-day decline since the Persian Gulf war in 1991. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which on Friday recorded its biggest weekly loss since the Depression, gained 368.05 points, or 4.5 percent, yesterday. Stock markets in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Hong Kong and South Korea also rose strongly. 
In its refined forms, including gasoline and jet fuel, oil runs much of modern life. The sharp drop in its price reflects concerns by energy traders that manufacturing and transportation will be depressed in coming months, even as oil production remains roughly constant.
"There is a conviction that the global economy will be in a recession, not a slowdown," said Sharif Ghalib, editor of research and special projects at the Energy Intelligence Group in New York.
Falling energy prices may actually aid economic growth worldwide by lowering costs for businesses and consumers, who use heating oil, natural gas and gasoline to heat their homes and fuel their cars. 
In the short term, at least, lower oil prices may make it easier for policy makers to respond to the economic slump. In managing economies, governments and central banks must balance the risks of inflation and recession.
If oil prices remain low, keeping inflation in check, the Federal Reserve and its counterparts worldwide can cut interest rates more aggressively, and governments may be more willing to spend.
While oil traders were focused on short-term prospects, stock market investors looked to economic conditions and the outlook for corporate profits next year. After the sharp decline in stocks last week, investors said that some stocks had fallen to attractive prices, especially if a recession proves as short as it is steep.
In Washington, President Bush continued the administration's efforts to bolster confidence and to suggest that markets will eventually respond to the economy's underlying strengths.
"There is no question the attacks have affected America, but I think when the investors sit back and take a hard look at the fundamentals of the economy, they'll get back in the market," Mr. Bush told reporters in the Rose Garden.
"I think that consumers will realize life is going on," he said. "We'll come out of this, and we'll come out of it strong."
Market strategists from Goldman, Sachs; Bank of America Securities; and Credit Suisse First Boston told investors yesterday to move money into stocks, suggesting that the recent sell-off had been overdone.
"I would characterize myself as being very bullish," said Doug Phillips, president of Trusco Asset Management, which manages $45 billion. "I would be switching money from bonds into stocks."
The federal government and Federal Reserve will probably act together to assist the economy over the next several months, prompting a vigorous recovery next year, Mr. Phillips said.
The Fed, which has already cut short-term interest rates once since the attack, is expected to do so again, lowering borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The government is poised to spend tens of billions of dollars on the military and reconstruction, further aiding economic growth.
The long-term impact of falling energy prices is less than clear. Philip Verleger, an economist with the Brattle Group in Washington, estimated that a $1 drop in the price of a barrel of crude oil would cut costs to consumers worldwide by $28 billion.
But James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan, said falling prices might help oil consumers in the United States, Europe and Asia, but in the long run they would hurt oil producers, who in turn buy products and services from the industrialized world.
"It's kind of a wash," Mr. Glassman said.
Since the terrorist attack, there have been fears that American military retaliation in Afghanistan or elsewhere in the Middle East or Central Asia might disrupt the flow of oil. The United States has been working, however, to build a coalition that includes oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia.
Now traders seem to be betting that production will hold steady, while demand will shrink, at least in the short term. Airlines worldwide are using less jet fuel as they cut back on flights. 
"Initially, people thought it would be a Gulf war scenario, when prices shot to $41 a barrel," said Mark Keenan, an oil trader with Prudential Bache in London. "But there's been a lack of fresh news on the war. Meanwhile, you have a constant barrage of economic doom."
The prices of energy products dropped across the board. Home heating oil fell almost 14 percent, to 61.06 cents a gallon, the lowest since November 1999. Natural gas, which cost almost $10 per million British thermal units nine months ago, fell 9 percent yesterday, to $1.91 per million B.T.U.'s, the first time below $2 in two and a half years. Jet fuel dropped almost 14 percent, for a 28 percent decline since airlines were grounded Sept. 11.
Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch, argued that the oil sell-off was an overreaction. The demand for crude oil will continue to grow modestly, even if a slowdown globally cuts economic growth to under 2 percent, he said. He also said that traders and investors were not allowing for the possibility of a disruption in the supply of oil if Iraq was drawn into the conflict.
"The risks are the greatest to the upside, not the downside," he said.
The fall in oil prices, just two days before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is to meet in Vienna, leaves OPEC with one of its most difficult choices in recent years. The group has reduced production several times as the economy has slowed, but is now under pressure to keep output steady. If the organization cuts production to buoy oil prices, it could aggravate the risks of a global recession. But if it leaves production steady, the decline in prices will cost its members revenues.
Mr. Rothman said the organization, which has set a goal for prices of $22 to $28 a barrel, needed to take action to keep prices steady.
"Given where prices are now, OPEC has to reaffirm their view about maintaining a mid-20's market price," Mr. Rothman said. "If they don't take steps to defend the bottom of their trading range, the risk is people are going to think that prices are not low enough."
But Mr. Ghalib of the Energy Intelligence Group said "there is no thought of cutting back production because that would convey the wrong signal."
"It is in their own self-interest to try to keep prices lower to offset some of the decline in the economy," he added.
The S.& P. 500 index, which includes the largest United States companies, rose 37.65 points, or 3.9 percent, to 1,003.45, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 76.21 points, or 5.4 percent, to 1,499.40. General Electric, the world's largest company by market value, led the gains, adding $3.90, or more than 12 percent, to $35.20. G.E. said Friday that it would meet estimates for its profits this year and in 2002.
As the stock market rallied, the yields rose on the closely watched 10-year Treasury note, which helps set mortgage rates, and on the 2-year note, which has been a haven for worried investors.
Many institutional investors said they were optimistic that yesterday's gains were the start of a bigger rally, especially if the United States escaped further terrorist attacks. Investors now have $2.2 trillion in money market funds, according to AMG Data Services. If even a small portion of that cash was moved into stocks, it could lead to substantial gains, said Kent Simons, manager of the $1.5 billion Neuberger & Berman Focus mutual fund. Meanwhile, stocks have fallen to attractive levels for long-term investors, Mr. Simons said.
"There's an enormous amount of cash and buying power on the sidelines, and valuation levels that certainly discounted a recession," he said.
The stock rally came even as UBS PaineWebber released a Gallup survey that showed that investor sentiment had fallen from a score of 86 in August to 63 in September. The drop was much more pronounced among younger investors than older investors, UBS PaineWebber said.
Bill Keithler, manager of the $2.5 billion Invesco Technology fund, said that widespread investor pessimism was a crucial ingredient in a rally, since stocks generally rise at times when the outlook seems bleakest. A declining market flushes out investors who for psychological or financial reasons cannot bear to watch their holdings fall in value, and encourages traders to sell stocks short in the hope of making a short-term profit.
As those investors sell, the slide accelerates. Eventually, the market is left with investors who do not want or need to sell their holdings. "When you have significant numbers of people give up, that have sold their stock, that are out of the market, you really begin to see an easing of the selling pressure," Mr. Keithler said.
Then any piece of good news can cause a strong rally by encouraging traders to cover their short sales and establish new long positions, Mr. Keithler said. "There's a significant chance that the lows we saw last week will hold up," Mr. Keithler said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE RED CROSS; 
Agency Offers Up to $30,000 to Each Victim's Family

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW

 BODY:
Families of those who have been reported dead or missing in the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks will receive immediate lump-sum grants of as much as $30,000 from the American Red Cross, the organization announced yesterday.
 The payments are meant to cover funeral costs and short-term living expenses. They represent the first massive transferal of donations to victims' families and are part of a huge surge of charity in response to the attacks. 
 With as many as 6,453 feared missing or dead at the World Trade Center, and another 189 killed at the Pentagon, Red Cross officials estimated that the total size of the grants will exceed $100 million, roughly half the $200 million in donations pledged to the organization since Sept. 11. 
The size of the payments -- intended to cover three months of living expenses -- will vary, based on the size of each family's rent or mortgage, funeral costs and the number of dependents. Chris C. Thomas, a spokesman for the Red Cross, estimated that for a spouse with two children, the payments would range from between $15,000 and $20,000. For very large families, he said, the payment amounts could reach $30,000.
"The American public has responded in an overwhelming way to these crimes," Mr. Thomas said.
The Red Cross will give families $3,000 outright for the first dependent and $600 for each additional dependent. It will also pay three months of rent or mortgage payments up to $5,000 a month, plus all other reasonable expenses, such as food, utilities, telephone and funeral costs. Living expenses need only be estimated, not demonstrated with receipts or bank statements.
"Tell us what you need, and if it's reasonable we'll help you," Mr. Thomas said. 'We're not going to be interrogators or auditors. We've tried to make this as simple as possible."
To obtain the help, families will be required to fill out a one-page application form available through World Trade Center employers, local Red Cross chapters and New York City's Family Assistance Centers. Families will be eligible for the grants regardless of any other payments they may have received from their employers, unions, insurance companies or relief agencies, he said.
"I'm certain that as the months go on that other needs for this money will arise," Mr. Thomas said, adding that checks will be issued within 24 hours after verifying the family's eligibility through the city's official registry of dead and missing.
Red Cross officials said they were untroubled by the chance that the victim count might be imprecise for the time being. City officials have conceded that the list of the missing could shift significantly in the days ahead.
In the days since the attacks, an enormous wave of charitable giving has stunned even veteran disaster officials. From telethons to seven-figure corporate pledges to church bake sales, hundreds of millions of dollars have been raised. Yet relief agencies are still struggling to come up with efficient methods to distribute the money, and some families have found even the smallest payments held up by bureaucracy and confusing eligibility rules.
The Red Cross plan was conceived after Howard W. Lutnick, chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., the bond trading firm that lost more than 600 of its employees, including his brother, made a plea for immediate help during a meeting last Tuesday with Dr. Bernadine Healy, president and chief executive officer of the American Red Cross.
Mr. Thomas said that for now, the payments will not be offered to the families of those who died when United Airlines Flight 73 crashed in Pennsylvania. Those families, he said, have already received substantial assistance from the airline.
Relief officials also cautioned that large gaps remain in assistance for others. Ken Curtin, an official for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, pointed out that the payment plan excluded those whose jobs disappeared with the World Trade Center. Many secretaries, food service employees and janitors are also facing severe hardships, he said.
"The immediate cash crunch," he said, 'is now on those who are unemployed and have no cushion."

HEADLINE: It's Back to Politics, So New Jersey Candidates Talk Taxes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
The campaign for New Jersey governor was back in full swing today, as Bret D. Schundler unveiled a sweeping tax cut proposal for elderly homeowners while his Democratic rival, James E. McGreevey, released a new television advertisement in which he discusses the recent terrorist attacks.
 Mr. Schundler, speaking at retirement communities in Ocean County, said that if elected, he would cut the school portion of elderly homeowners' property tax bills in half over three years. He said that would save 648,000 households an average of $1,226 each. 
 The plan would replace three existing programs for elderly homeowners, according to Bill Guhl, Mr. Schundler's spokesman: the Homestead Rebate, which sends a $750 check to those who pay more than 5 percent of their income in property taxes; an annual property tax deduction of $250 for the elderly; and a credit toward income taxes of $50.
Many people in retirement communities in Ocean County and other parts of New Jersey pay little in school taxes because there are few children in the local schools. That would suggest that some could stand to lose under Mr. Schundler's plan, because half of what they now pay in school taxes is less than what they receive under the Homestead Rebate and the other programs.
But Mr. Guhl said the existing tax-cut programs would not be completely retired. "If you were in a situation where you would get more money from the Homestead Rebate and the other two programs, then you'd take the higher of the two," he said.
Mr. Schundler said his plan would be phased in over three years, at a net cost of $414 million in addition to the $484 million that he said the three existing programs now cost the state.
His plan is more generous than what Mr. McGreevey has proposed for elderly homeowners: an easing of the income and residency requirements for the state's property-tax freeze program. Mr. McGreevey introduced that idea in March, and said today that he was "glad to see Mr. Schundler join our effort to provide tax relief to New Jersey seniors." But he also asserted that Mr. Schundler's other ideas would only wind up driving up property taxes by billions of dollars.
In any case, it is unclear how easily New Jersey will be able to afford any new tax cuts, especially given growing expectations that the state's economy, and government revenues, will suffer greatly in the aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Center.
Mr. Guhl acknowledged the possibility of a deepening recession, but he said that Mr. Schundler still believed that state revenues would continue to grow and that he would be able to find efficiencies to pay for the new tax cut -- which, in turn, would stimulate the economy by giving citizens more money to spend.

French Search for Cause Of Chemical Explosion
Local and national officials tried their best to quash fears that the explosion on Friday of one of France's largest petrochemical plants, in Toulouse, was an act of terrorism. The city's prosecutor, Michel Breard, insisted, "It is 99 percent certain that it was an accident." The blast left 29 people dead, at least 10 missing, and more than 2,500 injured. A3

Bosnian to Surrender to Hague
The commander of Bosnia's Muslim-led army in the first year of the 1992-1995 war, Sefer Halilovic, is to surrender to the United Nations war crimes tribunal at The Hague. The court has indicted him in the killings of Bosnian Croats in a southern village in 1993, his lawyer said. He will fly today to The Hague. A12

Coalition Likely in Poland
Poland's political future became murkier, with more complete tallies from Sunday's election indicating that the victors, the Democratic Left Alliance of former Communists, will not be able to control Parliament without a partner. That partner would be likely to make demands that could slow both entry into the European Union and moves to slash the budget deficit. A12

British Official Angers Israel
Israeli officials were furious over what they saw as a suggestion by Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, that frustration over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict might excuse terrorism. In response, Mr. Straw issued a statement to explain his comments reported in the Iranian press and said, "There is never any excuse for terrorism." A8

House Votes to Pay U.N. Dues
The House voted to release $582 million that the United States owes in back dues to the United Nations, ending a long-running squabble with the organization at a time when the Bush administration says international cooperation is needed to battle terrorism. A8

Giuliani Doesn't Rule Out Bid to Stay in Office
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that voters should not write in his name on primary ballots cast today, but left open the possibility that he might find a way to participate in the general mayoral election in November. Mr. Giuliani is prohibited by the city's term limits law from seeking a third term, and his hint of interest in staying as mayor provoked a firestorm of responses from city and state political leaders.

Mr. Giuliani would face two big obstacles if he decided to seek a third consecutive term: overturning the term limits law and getting his name on the ballot. A22

Real Estate Firm to Be Sold
Barbara Corcoran, the prominent Manhattan real estate broker, agreed to sell her firm, the Corcoran Group, to NRT, a real estate company owned by the Cendant Corporation and the private investment firm Apollo Management. Neither side would reveal the price, but a person close to the negotiations said it was about $70 million. The deal allows Ms. Corcoran to cash out just as real estate experts say the New York City residential market has passed its peak and is heading downward. A20

HEADLINE: Bethlehem, In Trouble, Picks Chief 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, struggling to remain afloat in an industry that has had 18 bankruptcies since 1998, said yesterday that it had hired Robert Miller Jr., a noted turnaround expert, as its chairman and chief executive. Duane R. Durham, who had held those titles since April 2000, will be president and chief operating officer. 
 Mr. Miller, who is known as Steve, will concentrate on negotiating with Bethlehem's lenders and unions, while Mr. Durham will focus on day-to-day operations. 
 "He'll focus on making and selling steel, and I'll focus on the external communities," Mr. Miller said. 
Both men face formidable tasks. Most steel companies are operating at a fraction of capacity because of the general economic slowdown and a continuing flood of imports that have driven steel prices lower. Even at newer companies like AK Steel and Nucor, which make steel from scrap in low-cost minimills, sales and earnings have eroded. 
But Bethlehem has been particularly hard hit. The company makes steel from scratch, which entails high fuel and environmental costs. And it is carrying a disproportionate number of retirees on its books. The company's current work force numbers 13,300, but it has 74,000 retirees, whose health care costs alone amount to $280 million a year. 
Until the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, most steel executives expected that Washington would provide legal and legislative relief to the industry. Now, many worry that the government will be loath to take protectionist action against countries it wants as allies in the fight against terrorism.
"You just can't predict Washington's mind-set right now," said one, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Wall Street has all but abandoned Bethlehem, which has been losing money since 1998. According to Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call, only 3 analysts cover the company, 9 follow U.S. Steel and 11 cover Nucor. Bethlehem's revenue was $4.2 billion last year, yet its market value has dropped below $150 million.
Still, investors did register a weak vote of confidence in Mr. Miller. Shares of Bethlehem rose 16 cents, to $1.29. Mr. Miller bought 10,000 shares himself. 
Bethlehem is not in an immediate fiscal crisis. It recently negotiated $550 million in financing from GE Capital, and it is close to receiving $200 million from other sources. Moreover, it said it had buyers for about $150 million worth of railroad and mining assets. 
"This company is in better shape than the market's perception would indicate," said Michelle G. Applebaum of Salomon Smith Barney.
Still, Mr. Miller insisted that cash infusions were not a long-term answer. "Borrowing money does not solve the cost and import problems," he said. "Bethlehem Steel cannot be turned around without the help of our union and our government." 
Mr. Miller, a lawyer by education, was on the receiving end of a whirlwind courtship. He said he received his first call from a Bethlehem director last Thursday and had completed his interviews by Sunday.
He certainly has turnaround credentials. He was the Chrysler Corporation's vice president for finance in 1979 and is widely credited with negotiating the complex financial agreements that kept Chrysler solvent. Since then, he has, with varying degrees of success, worked on salvaging such disparate companies as Waste Management, Aetna and the Federal Mogul Corporation, where he remains nonexecutive chairman until the end of the year. "I'm listed in the Yellow Pages under 'Flaming Disasters,' " he said with a laugh. 
Maybe so, but he has garnered a reputation as an island of calm amid chaos. "He's an astute financial engineering guy who always maintains his composure," said Gerard R. Roche, chairman of the executive search firm Heidrich & Struggles, who placed Mr. Miller in several of his turnaround jobs. 
Even if Mr. Miller keeps Bethlehem afloat, it might not remain independent for long. "This industry is so fragmented that consolidation must take place," Mr. Durham said. Although he would not rule out the possibility that Bethlehem could be an acquirer, the company's finances -- and stock price -- make it more likely that it would be bought.

HEADLINE: Saudi Arabia's Moment 

 BODY:
The United States has few more important -- or skittish -- partners in its war against terrorism than the oil-saturated kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Even more than the Persian Gulf war, when Saudi Arabia was directly threatened by Iraqi forces on its border, this new campaign will test the political, economic and military ties that have long made America and Saudi Arabia uneasy allies. 
 As President Bush assembles and tries to hold together a coalition of disparate nations, he will have to be mindful of Saudi sensibilities -- not only because of traditional Saudi anxieties about aligning itself too closely with the West, but because the kingdom has an unusual role in this conflict. Osama bin Laden comes from a prominent Saudi business family. A principal aim of his worldwide campaign of terror is to evict American troops from Saudi soil and end Washington's decades-long commitment to the defense of Saudi Arabia and its royal family. 
 Washington should not hold back in seeking Saudi assistance in dismantling the bin Laden terror network. Saudi Arabia possesses an array of assets that can be critical in the war against terrorism, including great influence in the Islamic world, longstanding relations with Afghanistan's Taliban leadership and modern air bases. The Saudi royal family must put its considerable strengths to work in the American-led campaign. 
History, geography and geology have made Saudi Arabia a fault line between civilizations. It is torn between conservative Islamic traditions and a modern global economy fueled by oil and money and defended by American military power. The kingdom is home to two of Islam's holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, and is governed, at least officially, by the precepts of the puritanical Wahabi strand of Sunni Islam. But for generations, political power in Saudi Arabia has been monopolized by an extended royal family. Saudi kings and princes have been worldly in their foreign policy and business dealings, sometimes ostentatiously corrupt in their personal lives and unyieldingly hostile to political debate and representative institutions.
Now they must rise to the challenge of navigating the kingdom's participation in a fight against terrorists who murder Americans in the name of a twisted interpretation of Islamic purity. Saudi Arabia is one of the few governments to have recognized the Taliban government of Afghanistan. Like the two other nations that did so, it needs to use what influence it has with the Taliban's leaders to insist that they hand over Mr. bin Laden. 
If, as is likely, such calls go unheeded, Riyadh should give Washington the permission it seeks to use air bases on Saudi territory to launch and direct whatever military actions may be needed to destroy terrorist bases and training camps in Afghanistan. It should also cooperate with American intelligence agencies in rooting out terrorist cells and financial networks operating in Saudi Arabia itself. By its actions, it can demonstrate to other Muslim nations that Washington is leading an international campaign against terrorism, not, as some wrongly claim, a Western battle against the Islamic world. Saudi Arabia feels especially vulnerable to the strains of this crisis. But it is also particularly well placed to help build the broadest possible coalition against terror.

HEADLINE: AOL, Blaming Terrorist Attacks, Says It Will Fall Far Short of Its Goals 

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
AOL Time Warner Inc., the world's biggest media company, announced yesterday that it would badly miss its financial goals for the year, largely because the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks exacerbated the erosion of the advertising market.
 Ever since America Online agreed to acquire Time Warner early last year, executives from the companies have trumpeted their relative independence from advertising. 
 Asked in an interview three months ago to describe his vision for AOL Time Warner, Gerald M. Levin, the company's chief executive, replied with a single word: "subscriptions." Stable and predictable, subscriptions are meant to be AOL Time Warner's financial bedrock. 
But while subscriptions may provide AOL's foundation, it became clear yesterday that many of the company's upper reaches were still made of advertising.
Twenty-four percent of AOL's revenue comes from advertising. Of the biggest publicly traded media companies, the comparable figure is lower only at Vivendi Universal of France.
But 24 percent is still much more than zero, which is essentially why AOL will miss its goals. Through the late summer, the advertising market, weak as it was for most of the year, failed to show significant signs of recovery. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon dashed hopes for a turnaround this year as advertisers worried about sending inappropriate messages and about wasting money on consumers far from a buying mood.
"Prior to Sept. 11, the company had not yet seen an improvement in the overall advertising environment," AOL said in a statement yesterday. "Due to the events of Sept. 11, it has further deteriorated. The state of the advertising market is impacting the company's networks, America Online, publishing and cable operations."
Since the acquisition was completed in January, AOL has been predicting that it would increase revenue by 10.5 percent this year, to $40 billion from $36.2 billion in 2000, calculating as if the companies had already merged. Meanwhile, the company has said that it will increase its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, by almost 31 percent, to $11 billion from $8.4 billion. Ebitda is perhaps the most common financial yardstick for media companies.
When AOL announced its results in July, executives appeared to back off a bit from the revenue estimate, saying that revenue could increase to "as much as" $40 billion. But the cash flow goal appeared sacrosanct. Through much of the year, AOL cut costs relentlessly to help ensure that any shortfalls in revenue would not prevent the company from reaching its profit number.
But through the late summer and into the aftermath of the attacks, the weakness in advertising proved too much to overcome. Yesterday, the company said that its revenue would increase by only 5 percent to 7 percent. As for Ebitda, the company said it would increase by only about 20 percent, to about $10.1 billion.
Those are significant downward revisions, but many companies, both within the media sector and outside it, would love to post 5 percent revenue growth and 20 percent Ebitda growth this year.
Last week, Viacom Inc., which owns the CBS television network and cable networks including MTV, said that its Ebitda this year would be only "slightly higher" than last year's. As recently as July, Viacom was predicting Ebitda growth for this year of as high as 24 percent. About half of Viacom's revenue is generated by advertising.
AOL made its announcement after major markets closed. During the day, the company's shares rose by $2.65, to $32.50. In after-hours trading, the shares fell as low as $31.27.
In addition to the effects of the advertising slowdown, AOL said that its results would also be hurt by increased costs incurred by its news operations while covering the attacks and their aftermath. An AOL spokesman would not comment on how much of the shortfall could be attributed to the news-related costs, but those costs appeared small compared with the effect of the advertising slump.
In statements, AOL's top executives barely touched on their company's financial situation.
"No financial impact can compare to the terrible suffering and loss of life inflicted by the vicious attacks of Sept. 11," Mr. Levin said. "The AOL Time Warner family is fully committed to continuing to do everything in our power to assist those who have been affected."
Stephen M. Case, AOL's chairman, said, "The bottom line is -- despite this tragedy and the resulting economic effects -- our unique mix of assets give us confidence that we can generate strong earnings growth next year and into the future."

HEADLINE: Trains Need Help, Too 

 BODY:
Stranded travelers made a fortuitous discovery when the airlines shut down after the terrorist attacks: The country still has an intercity rail system. Amtrak scrambled to provide additional service to accommodate the surge in demand. In the Washington-New York corridor, Amtrak's stylish new high-speed Acela Express trains are especially busy because of the continued shutdown of Washington's Reagan National Airport. 
 Congress has acted admirably to help the troubled airlines. But it should also make a commitment to improve passenger rail. Amtrak, which receives about 1 percent of all federal transportation spending, needs an immediate infusion of cash to beef up security throughout its system and to accelerate much-needed capital improvements along the Northeast corridor, where its fast trains are hampered by antique infrastructure. 
 Congress must also adopt a more sensible long-term strategy. For three decades it has grudgingly subsidized Amtrak, spending enough money to keep it alive but never enough to build an attractive service. Also, Amtrak is required to serve many communities where it does not make a profit, even while facing a Congressional mandate that it become self-sufficient by the end of 2002. 
Despite these obstacles, Amtrak had been posting record ridership levels before the attacks, in part because travelers were frustrated by airport congestion. Congressional support for high-speed train service in designated corridors across the country had also been growing. Congress should now focus on investing in economically viable high-speed service in heavily traveled markets, and create a dedicated rail trust fund for Amtrak like the funds that pay for highway and aviation infrastructure projects. 
The need for high-speed trains serving shorter routes extends beyond the Northeast to the Midwest, Texas and California. The Pacific Northwest from Portland to Vancouver is already benefiting from improved service. And Florida's voters last year gave a green light to developing new high-speed links between the state's largest cities.
Air travel is still projected to grow in the long run, intensifying gridlock. The current slowdown should not blind Congress to the need to upgrade the passenger rail system.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE COMPETITOR; 
Southwest Manages to Keep Its Balance

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
A decade ago, the airline industry was in its worst recession to that point, brought on by the Persian Gulf war, a broad economic slowdown and brutal fare cuts. But Southwest Airlines, then a regional carrier in the process of going national, managed to make money even as the rest of the industry lost more than $6 billion over two years.
 To analysts, Southwest, now much larger, is once again the only airline with a chance to post a profit this year after the terrorist attacks. "It's a worthy goal, at this point, to be profitable for the year," says Gary C. Kelly, Southwest's chief financial officer. "But that's not a prediction." Unlike other major airlines, Southwest has not announced layoffs or schedule cutbacks, though flights will be eliminated if business does not pick up. 
 In an effort to put travelers back in the sky, Southwest could begin a national broadcasting ad campaign as soon as this week. It will include new fare sales on some flights, according to industry officials. Many in the industry are watching to see whether Southwest can smoothly negotiate the changes in how airlines operate in the aftermath of the attacks.
Investors clearly think it can, and they believe the Southwest franchise to be as valuable as the rest of the industry combined. Though the seventh-largest airline by such measures as total miles its passengers travel and revenue, Southwest's total stock market value, $10.5 billion, is roughly the same as that of the nation's other major carriers added together. Since the attacks, Southwest's stock has fallen 20 percent, far less than other airlines'.
What remains to be seen is how much heightened security may impede Southwest's vaunted efficiencies, especially its quick "turn times," or its ability to get planes back into the air after only about 20 minutes on the ground, compared with 45 minutes for most other airlines. Also in question is whether Southwest's many short-distance flights will be most hurt as travelers opt to take a train or drive. So far, Mr. Kelly said in an interview on Friday, the airline's return to the skies shows that such apprehensions appear to be "totally false."
In fact, the industry's current crisis points up Southwest's strength compared with that of other airlines that now appear dependent on the federal bailout for survival. Part of that resilience is because the company focuses on less-congested airports where it can be one of the largest carriers and yet avoid costly delays.
But most investors' current relative loyalty comes from the airline's strong finances and low costs. Between cash on hand and its available credit line, Southwest has more than $1.4 billion. At the same time, flying a full schedule last week with, at most, perhaps half its normal load of passengers, its daily cash burn was no more than $5 million, according to Mr. Kelly, a fraction of the industry's losses.
What's more, should the federal bailout not provide enough cushion, Southwest has 200 planes -- about $5 billion worth, in theory -- that could be mortgaged.
It is also the most efficient airline, although it may take a while to see whether that distinction will be affected by the new security measures after customers return.
Before a recent Southwest flight from Dallas, a ticket agent called over an inspector who searched one traveler's roller bag being checked as luggage. The inspector put on gloves, opened the bag and removed everything. She opened the toilet kit, carefully examining a disposable razor cartridge. After asking another inspector whether it was all right to keep it in the luggage -- it was -- she then repacked the bag.
All told a three- or four-minute procedure -- repeated for several passengers -- that could slow check-in times on Southwest's normally busy schedule, which includes flights to some destinations every half-hour.
Samuel C. Buttrick, an analyst with UBS Warburg who recommended Southwest stock last week, said he had been "encouraged by Southwest's ability to maintain quick turns." But he also added that the bulk of the new security rules "fall on passengers, and as loads rebuild bottlenecks could develop."
Mr. Kelly said that new security measures would not hurt Southwest's turn times. "We're checking in customers in minutes, not hours, though admittedly, the loads are light," he said, adding that the airline has been able to land and get back in the air within normal operating times. 
What is less clear, Mr. Kelly said, is if it will cost more to add security and keep tight schedules, which may depend on whether security is taken over by the federal government. "The security procedures alone may lead to increased security costs; that's all in play," he said.
Industrywide, analysts say load factors -- the percentage of seats occupied by paying customers -- have dropped to about 30 percent to 40 percent. Some say Southwest's loads may be at the low end of that range, partly because the airline has yet to cut its flight schedule. Mr. Kelly said loads are "down consistent with the rest of the industry," but he declined to be more specific.
Betsy R. Snyder, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, said that customers' shying away from short flights "could have an impact," but that since Southwest has been lengthening its average flight, "the impact won't be as dramatic as it would have been several years ago."
Mr. Kelly said that based on last week's performance, "I would totally discard this notion that short-haul flights will be impacted more than long-haul flights."
While shorter flights have lost more passengers than have long-haul flights, he said, it is "not a remarkable difference."
Southwest has asked Boeing to defer deliveries on five 737's due this month, and the airline will almost certainly seek more delays. "To be blunt, we don't have a plan right now for 2002," Mr. Kelly said. "I don't see how we could."
But he said that layoffs were unlikely; before the attacks the airline was actually short of employees and had been paying a lot of overtime.
Though Southwest is not cutting back its schedules right now, it will if passenger loads do not improve, Mr. Kelly said. This will not mean ending service to any markets, but, instead, reducing the number of flights. Perhaps instead of every half-hour, he said, they would be every hour.
"We don't want to do things in the short term that hurt in the long term," he said. "But at the same time, if we can't get through the short term, we won't have a long term."

Fashions Turn Nostalgic, in Shows Planned So Long Ago

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
Had you been driving on Main Street in Easthampton the Sunday after the World Trade Center attack, and were you able for a few seconds to turn off the newsreel running relentlessly in your head, you might have wondered who had chosen such a surreal moment to shoot a Ralph Lauren ad. 
 On a park bench along the clapboard-lined avenue sat a good-looking couple in the final hours of their middle age, he slouched into his denim shirt, her hair ash blond. Their lives, to borrow a phrase from Spalding Gray, did not appear "ruled by regret." If the couple resembled Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Lauren it was because they were Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Lauren. Behind them, American flags not in evidence the week before waved in unison. This time though, the flag poles hadn't been erected to sell anything. 
 At the onset of Mr. Lauren's spring 2002 show last Friday, it was hard not to long in a real way for the America of his exacting mythology. Like most of the New York designers whose shows were postponed, Mr. Lauren presented his collection intimately, in his showroom, to a small group of editors and buyers. He spoke movingly of the heroism after the crisis and the importance of keeping New York's economic life vital. It is a sentiment that has been voiced repeatedly by designers, among them Helmut Lang, who canceled his Paris show scheduled for Oct. 6, choosing to stage it in Manhattan, where he is now based, for viewing over the Internet and on CD-ROM.
But just how far the collective mind-set still is from the business of clothes became clear before Mr. Lauren's show as many in the audience talked anxiously about rumors of another terrorist attack. There was the editor who decided she would feel better if she took her family to an inn in Connecticut for the weekend, another who had borrowed a friend's lake house and a third who talked of leaving New York permanently, for Vermont maybe, or Charlottesville, Va. -- somewhere closer to Mr. Lauren's unburdened world.
Mr. Lauren's collection, had it been shown before Sept. 11, might have seemed corny. (It was designed, like all others shown last week, before the rush of events). The reference point, as for other designers, was a particular psychic slice of the 1970's -- one that evokes images of girls with lank blond hair parted in the middle and standing in fields of sunflowers. It is the 70's of Joni Mitchell's "Court and Spark," Big Sur and Transcendental Meditation, an era suddenly worthy of nostalgia. Mr. Lauren showed beautifully delicate silk, fringed ponchos and suede embroidered shawls, in a palette of cream and sand colors, with unassuming linen pants suits, which had the temporary effect of quelling the nerves.
Cynthia Rowley's show the evening before produced the same feeling. Ms. Rowley's sweet clothes always suggest a yearning for times less complicated, and you could not help looking at her with a new, less jaded eye. Anna Sui's baby-doll dresses, shown the day before, had a similar effect. 
Ms. Rowley also seemed to invoke Joni Mitchell, but with that came what one might expect from Ms. Rowley -- the eyelet and souvenir-shop prints, a shirt emblazoned with the image of Bob Hope. Even the presence of Monica Lewinsky seemed oddly quaint, calling to mind a time when the country was happily bored enough for sexual dalliance to consume whole news cycles.
The cancellation of Fashion Week on Sept. 11 was sure to have the harshest repercussions for young designers trying to build identities in a climate where many of fashion's top editors are reluctant to make long trips below Houston Street past 8 p.m. to view the work of people they know little about. Benjamin Cho, a talented designer of 24, was to have his shot at the brass ring on Sept. 12 with a show sponsored by the cosmetics label Shiseido. It was not to be. "The first day," Mr. Cho said referring to the day of the World Trade Center catastrophe, "I didn't think about my situation at all." The second day, he said, "I had my long moment of self-mourning, and on the third day I went out to the piers to volunteer."
But designers like Mr. Cho, Elisa Jimenez and the promising Michael Soheil, among others, did not ultimately go unnoticed. Vogue underwrote a group presentation for young independents on Friday in Carolina Herrera's Seventh Avenue showroom. It presented the unusual and somewhat exhilarating spectacle of Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor in chief, and other major editors and buyers taking in clothes they would otherwise dispatch minions to examine. Mr. Cho's truncated mohair jumpsuit and dress with a bodice made of ribbons were among the most inspiring looks in the group show.
Adding heft to the event were Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley of Tuleh, who showed two perfect, fitted coats among their looks and an A-line tweed suit executed without cliche in the Jackie-meets-Audrey school.
Narciso Rodriguez presented a capsule version of his collection on Thursday afternoon. Its dark colors, corset looks and angular, asymmetrical silk skirts were reminiscent of Mr. Lang's aesthetic. Somber clothes for somber times.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
With Bipartisan Zeal, Rival House Leaders Bond

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
After years of hostility, frosty exchanges and seemingly intractable distrust, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt, have bonded.
 The two sit side by side on television talk shows, something they had never done before last week. They huddle at least once a day on Capitol Hill to talk business. They even go out in public together, sharing the limelight and speaking in dulcet tones about unity and cooperation. 
 All this bipartisanship has translated into a string of legislative victories in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Working with Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, and Senator Trent Lott, the Republican leader, the two men have cobbled together compromises on a $40 billion emergency spending bill; a resolution on the use of force; and, last Friday night, a large bailout for the airline industry.
But as Mr. Gephardt told his restive colleagues on the House floor on Friday, "bipartisanship is hard."
Already, things are growing more complicated for the two leaders, and the negotiations will only get harder. In the days and weeks to come, lawmakers must strike a balance between civil liberties and counterterrorism, agree on how to improve the economy and figure out a way to help 100,000 laid-off airline workers. All are issues that will test their ideological convictions.
The strain of so much bipartisanship is beginning to show in the stalwarts of both parties. Last week, a bill to bail out the airlines came close to unraveling. Several angry Democrats were pushing to include a measure to extend unemployment benefits and health insurance to the laid-off airline workers. Republicans, including Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, the majority whip, wanted to go slow on a provision to protect the airlines from liability, which could end up costing the government billions of dollars.
All of a sudden, said a senior Republican leadership aide who was in the room, "you were further away from the event" and "the passions and the need to work together were starting to ebb."
At 2 a.m. on Friday, after hours of negotiations among lawmakers, Mr. Hastert overrode Mr. DeLay and several others in the room and declared that because all four top House and Senate leaders supported the bill, it would advance.
"The four of us down here are for doing this, so let's go," a senior Democratic aide quoted Mr. Hastert as saying.
The next day, some Democrats criticized Mr. Gephardt for his decision to move ahead with only a promise from Mr. Hastert that Congress would address the worker issue separately. They did not trust Republicans to keep their word, aides said. To allay their concerns, Mr. Gephardt met with Democrats for six hours.
"You can't get everything you want," he told his colleagues. "Bipartisanship means you get some things you want and you give back some things you really want."
Mr. Hastert, whose colleagues were not entirely happy with the bill either, took the unusual step of going to the House floor to say he would consider proposals to help the workers. The bill passed, with 46 Democrats and 6 Republicans voting against it.
How long the two men can keep their caucuses in line is anyone's guess. Looking ahead, Representative Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is chief deputy whip, said Democrats were closely watching whether Mr. Hastert would keep his commitment to help workers.
"People are hoping we can work together," Mr. Menendez said. "But democracy is based on a conflict of ideas. Ultimately, I don't think that you will find a willingness to capitulate simply for the sake of appearing bipartisan."
Republicans have echoed that sentiment in recent days.
For now, though, the good vibrations are working. They are even spreading. President Bush gave Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Daschle big hugs the night he addressed Congress. On Thursday, the two congressmen are expected to join Mr. Bush for breakfast at the White House, with their Republican counterparts.
And Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Hastert, buoyed by their success, say they are committed to staying united.
"I think once you walk down that trail and find out that you can do these things in this way," Mr. Hastert said on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday, "you can do extraordinary things."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: TRADE; 
Senate Approves Bill to Lift Barriers to Trade With Jordan

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
The Senate passed legislation today that would remove all trade barriers between the United States and Jordan after the Bush administration persuaded a pivotal Republican senator to drop his objections.
 The measure commits the two nations to upholding workers' rights and environmental standards, the first time a full-scale trade agreement has passed Congress with labor and environmental provisions at its core. Its adoption illustrated how political and ideological considerations in Washington are giving way in the push to prepare for the campaign against terrorism. 
 Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, dropped his months-long effort to block the bill after calls over the last week from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser. The measure, which passed the House this summer, was approved by the Senate on a voice vote. 
Mr. Bush said he would sign it into law. The agreement, the president said in a statement, "sends a strong signal to Jordan, as well as other countries in the region, that support for peace and economic reform yields concrete benefits."
In an interview, Mr. Gramm said he dropped his objections because it was important that the United States send a signal of friendship to Jordan, an ally that could be instrumental in building support in the Middle East for military and other action against terrorists. 
Like many conservatives, Mr. Gramm has long argued that international trade agreements are the wrong vehicles to address issues like pollution standards, freedom to organize unions and workplace safety.
The bill was negotiated last year by the Clinton administration. King Abdullah of Jordan will visit Washington on Friday to discuss the anti-terrorism campaign with Mr. Bush, the White House announced today just after passage of the trade bill.
"From a foreign policy point of view, this was a must-do thing," Mr. Gramm said. "From the point of view of economic policy and long-term trade policy, this was a bad agreement negotiated by another president."
As Congress and the White House debate what steps to take to bolster the economy in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, advocates of free trade have begun arguing that a push for more trade deals should be part of any package.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told the Senate Banking Committee last week that the United States should use the outpouring of international support to develop support for a new round of global trade talks. Members of the World Trade Organization are scheduled to meet in November in the Middle East nation of Qatar to negotiate a framework for the talks.
In a speech today to the Institute for International Economics, a research group here, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, encouraged Congress to grant the president "trade promotion authority."
Such authority would give the president the right to negotiate trade deals that would be subject to yes-or-no ratification by Congress but that could not be amended by lawmakers. The main opposition has come from liberal Democrats who say trade can kill jobs as well as create them.
Moving ahead now with the administration's free trade agenda, Mr. Zoellick said, "will send an unmistakable signal, with one voice, that America will lead in the promotion of free markets and free people."
But trade politics was complex before the terrorist attacks this month and it remains so now. Mr. Gramm, for example, held up the deal with Jordan not over any concern about the merits of expanded commerce between nations; he is one of the foremost advocates of free trade in Congress. 
Rather, Mr. Gramm said he feared that including labor and environmental provisions would lead to a loss of sovereignty by the United States and subject the country to penalties for pursuing its economic self-interest.
Democrats have insisted in the last several years that the United States dissuade other nations from holding down the cost of their exports by limiting the earning power of their workers or avoiding the expense of anti-pollution efforts. 
Republicans have responded that while such goals are worthy, including them in trade agreements would be more likely to inhibit international commerce than to promote it. And many developing nations have resisted pressure to tighten labor and environmental laws.
The deal with Jordan was an attempt to find a middle ground. It commits both countries not to weaken or to fail to uphold their own existing labor and environmental standards, but does not impose any new standards on them. Should a dispute arise, the two governments have said they will seek to resolve it through negotiations. 
If negotiations were to fail, the dispute would be subject to a settlement procedure between the two countries.
Jordan is one of only four countries, along with Canada, Mexico and Israel, to gain relatively unrestricted access to the United States market. Beyond the deal with Jordan, the United States has made labor and environmental issues part of side agreements in some trade pacts, and is experimenting with innovative arrangements with developing nations like Cambodia.

HEADLINE: Liberals' Ideology Challenged by Urge to Fight Terrorism 

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
For many liberals in New York, these are confusing times, as they try to balance their ideals about what the nation should be with their fears of a crisis that threatens to dwarf issues like civil liberties and racism.
 Some believe that Americans for now have to put aside their differences on issues like supporting the president or accepting racial profiling in order to identify terrorists. Others argue that the worst outcome of the terrorist attacks would be for Americans to follow authorities blindly into war or to tamp down their criticism of social ills. 
 In dozens of interviews across the New York area, ordinary men and women, as well as those active in organizations working for social change, talked about what it meant to be liberal after Sept. 11. 
"We have to cherish our rights as leftists, as liberals," said Maurice Berger, 45, a cultural and social critic who lives on the Upper West Side and is a senior fellow at the New School University. "I don't want to see the country turn its back on civil liberties, when people's phones are tapped or people are pulled off planes because their skins are dark." 
But Betsy Llanos, 32, a sales clerk at the Columbia University bookstore, who calls herself "very liberal," said, "We wouldn't have so many problems if we would inspect these people from other countries."
New York City has historically voted Democratic and has been more supportive of abortion rights, labor unions and gays than much of the rest of the nation. 
It is a measure of the times that with the mayoral primary today -- and the efforts to extend Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's tenure -- even many liberals say Mr. Giuliani has been great in the last two weeks.
"If we knew that we were going to have a tragedy like this every six months, I'd love to have Giuliani," said Bill Rosenthal, a Hunter College professor who was attending a peace rally at Columbia University yesterday. "People are forgetting what happened before Sept. 11 and the problems we had," he said, mentioning his particular dislike of Mr. Giuliani's school budget cuts.
Many liberals are worried that patriotism will be narrowly identified as the province of some groups or some political ideologies. At the New York Urban League in Harlem, its president, Dennis M. Walcott, said there were many blacks and dark-skinned Hispanics proudly waving flags and yet wincing at the idea that Arab-Americans could be racially profiled the same way they are.
On the Columbia campus, some students who think of themselves as liberal said they sensed a change in acceptance of public criticism of the country or President Bush. 
"Three weeks ago, it was O.K. to be a dissident" said Jason Paez, 20, a junior majoring in economics. "Now, it's our duty to stand together. We are facing a lot worse than a president with a low I.Q. and delusions of grandeur."
Many who are otherwise dovish said their feelings about military response were complicated because the enemy is not so clear and this time the personal losses hit so close to home.
"I think if you raise the political consequences of the attack, people see you as heartless," said Andrew Stettner, the executive director of Jews for Racial & Economic Justice.
Mr. Stettner said that although he saw a continuing robust liberal commitment to civil liberties, "I've been surprised that a lot of people are willing to support a level of military action that they would not have accepted before."
Along those lines, Judith Stallwert, 51, a secretary in Montclair, N.J., said, "In college, I joined movements against the war in Vietnam, but I don't think I would join protests this time, for this war. I don't want to see people die and I don't want to raise my children during a horrible time. On the other hand, I don't want my grandchildren to one day live in a world with terrorism and fear."

 THE NATION'S RESPONSE

ASSETS FROZEN AND BANKS WARNED -- President Bush ordered an immediate freeze of all assets in the United States of suspected Islamic terrorist groups and individuals. Banks worldwide were warned of sanctions if they do not cooperate. A1

WHO WAS SINGLED OUT -- Administration officials said that the 27 individuals and organizations whose assets were frozen include the top lieutenants to Osama bin Laden and the entities most directly tied to his Al Qaeda network. B4

THE SEARCH FOR ACCOMPLICES -- Two weeks after the terrorist attacks, investigators say they have not yet identified any knowing accomplices or uncovered a broad support network in the United States that assisted the hijackers, a senior law enforcement official said. A1

PILOTS WANT WEAPONS -- The nation's largest pilots' union will propose that cockpit crews be permitted to carry handguns to foil hijackers. The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said she is open to the idea, but that it posed practical problems. A1

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE POLL; 
Poll Finds Support for War and Fear on Economy

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
Americans favor going to war even if that means thousands of casualties for the nation's armed forces, yet they say that the United States should wait to act until it is certain who is responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll shows.
 The survey painted a portrait of a nation unsettled about the terrorist attacks -- and is expecting more of them -- at the same time it is worried about the state of the economy. For the first time since 1990, a majority of Americans say the economy is worsening. Six in 10 say the nation is in a recession and 2 in 10 saying the nation is near one. 
 President Bush's ratings continue to soar, as is common for presidents in times of crisis, with people giving him impressive marks for his leadership and judgment under pressure. Eighty-nine percent approve of the way he is doing his job, up from 50 percent in late August. 
Yet there are suggestions in the poll that Mr. Bush is buoyed because people hold a high regard for his advisers. Asked whether they had more confidence in Mr. Bush or his advisers, 70 percent said they had equal confidence in both. But of those who chose one or the other, 22 percent expressed greater confidence in Mr. Bush's advisers, and only 5 percent said they had more confidence in the president.
Many people, particularly those in big cities, worry about another terrorist incident in the United States. Even so, people overwhelmingly express confidence in the government's ability to protect them.
But, clearly, Americans' way of life has been altered. Despite security measures the government has taken, about a third of people say the attacks have made them less likely to travel by airplane any time soon. Eight in 10 say Americans will have to forfeit some of their personal freedoms to make the country safer, an increase even from a week ago.
And more than 7 out of 10 Americans consider themselves very patriotic, a substantial rise since the question was last asked a decade ago.
The attacks have enhanced peoples' feelings about New York City even though tourism has been depressed. Eighty-four percent of Americans say they have a good image of the city, up from 61 percent when the question was last asked in early 1998. Sixty-one percent of people who do not live in New York City said they would take a trip there in the next six months if they could afford it or had the time off.
And there was near unanimity about the performance of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, with 95 percent approving how he has handled the attacks, a rating that surpasses that of President Bush.
The ardor for military force, the nervousness about terrorism in this country and the fears of a recession are reminiscent of American sentiments in March 1991, when the nation was at war in the Persian Gulf. It was then that the elder President George Bush drew the highest approval rating of his presidency, a level matched by his son in this poll.
The nationwide telephone survey of 1,216 adults was conducted Thursday through Sunday. Most people were questioned after Mr. Bush delivered his speech to a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday night. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
The willingness of Americans to accept that there could be significant casualties among the military, as well as among civilians in other countries, underscores the public's determination to root out terrorists. During the gulf war, 4 of 10 people said the United States should not continue sending troops to the region if it cost many American lives.
Now, if there is a war against terrorists, 28 percent say they expect fewer than 1,000 American soldiers to lose their lives; 28 percent put the number at 1,000 to 5,000, and 27 percent predicted higher casualties.
While 92 percent of Americans said the United States should take military action, many respondents emphasized in follow-up interviews that the nation should not be in too much of a hurry to retaliate.
"I would like to see quick justice, but if you jump the gun and attack the wrong person, it's not going to accomplish anything," said Ryan Clark, 19, a forest firefighter in Lewiston, Idaho. "You have to be at least somewhat certain who it is before anything takes place."
But Mr. Clark insisted that he was not squeamish about American casualties, saying, "It's never a good thing for lives to be lost in a conflict, but some casualties now would be better than a whole lot later on."
Diane Stevens, 49, a real estate broker from Washington, Conn., also called for patience, saying, "We should wait and get as much data as we can before we plunge into World War III, because that's where it's going to go."
The public seems to agree with Mr. Bush's assertion that there are great complexities in battling terrorism and that a military campaign would be protracted, and probably far more onerous than those in the past. Americans say the United States will have to dispatch ground troops, cruise missiles and even plot assassinations to eliminate those responsible for the attacks on Sept. 11. Again, perhaps, reflecting Mr. Bush's remarks, 65 percent said military action should be aimed at the terrorists and countries harboring them, while only 27 said it should be limited to the terrorists.
Eighty-four percent of respondents said the United States would win a war, and 8 percent said they did not think the United States would win.
Mr. Bush said last week that he wanted to get Osama bin Laden "dead or alive," and for a majority Mr. bin Laden is either the person they hold most accountable for the attacks or one of them. Asked who they thought was responsible, 45 percent said Mr. bin Laden; 13 percent said Mr. bin Laden and others; 6 percent said Mr. bin Laden and Saddam Hussein of Iraq; 36 percent offered other possibilities like terrorists in general or the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan. And 20 percent said they did not know.
Americans are more likely to blame lax security at airports for the attacks than they are lapses in the nation's intelligence or backlash from United States policy in the Middle East. Asked if the government had done enough to make the country safe since the attacks, 61 percent said the government had and 30 percent said it had not.
For all their uneasiness about the economy, relatively few people said they had altered their spending or investments after the attacks. Four in 10 Americans said the country was in a recession before the attacks, and two in 10 said the attacks led the country to economic turbulence.
"I don't think we're in a recession yet," said Jodii Guilbeau, 31, a homemaker from Kendrick, Ind., "I think we're dangerously close any time there's uncertainty."
But, Ms. Guilbeau said, the national crisis "hasn't altered our spending plans at all."
In question after question, it was clear that Mr. Bush enjoys the public's full backing. For now, at least, old animosities have faded as Democrats, Republicans and independents alike, have rallied behind the president. Ninety percent approve of the way Mr. Bush has handled the attacks, and 81 percent say he has explained clearly enough how his administration is responding. Eighty-one percent said Mr. Bush has displayed good judgment under pressure, up from 45 percent in June.
Antoine Valdetero, 73, a minister in Jennings, La., said he feared that the country would be attacked again. "We are a very vulnerable nation," Mr. Valdetero said. "I am Christian, and I have hope."
Jane Guthrie, 53, an editor in Newton, N.J., said she was concerned that no one detected the terrorists.
"The intelligence community has been chopped off at the knees for a long time," Ms. Guthrie said, "and we should have remained very vigilant. Somewhere we got too complacent and lax, like 'it couldn't happen here,' but it has."

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted on Thursday through Sunday with 1,216 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, marital status and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.
Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE OVERVIEW; 
BUSH FREEZES ASSETS LINKED TO TERROR NET; RUSSIANS OFFER AIRSPACE AND ARMS SUPPORT

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
President Bush ordered an immediate freeze today of all assets in the United States of suspected Islamic terrorist groups and individuals and gave the treasury secretary broad new powers to impose sanctions on banks around the world that provide them access to the international financial system.
 Announcing his executive order this morning in the Rose Garden, Mr. Bush reached beyond American borders and said that any foreign banks that did not cooperate with American investigators could be cut off from doing business in the United States. 
 Mr. Bush's plan to punish foreign financial institutions that handle terrorists' money echoes his threat to other nations that harbor terrorists: if the banks choose to harbor terrorists' money, they will be treated as hostile entities. 
"We're putting banks and financial institutions around the world on notice," Mr. Bush said. "We will work with their governments, ask them to freeze or block terrorists' ability to access funds in foreign accounts. If they fail to help us by sharing information or freezing accounts, the Treasury Department now has the authority to freeze their banks' assets and transactions in the United States."
In effect, a foreign bank that refused to cooperate would find itself unable to operate in the United States.
Among the 27 individuals and organizations on a list attached to the order were three charities that the government believes knowingly or unwittingly channeled money to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network. The groups were Makhtab al-Khidamat, the Wafa Humanitarian Organization and the Al Rashid Trust. Page B4. 
"Money is the lifeblood of terrorist operations," Mr. Bush said. 
"Today, we're asking the world to stop payment," Mr. Bush said, calling the move "a major thrust of our war on terrorism."
Officials said the listed groups were the most prominent with identified links to Al Qaeda.
But there are questions about what the president can expect with the financial crackdown. The demand that overseas banks release information about accounts reportedly controlled by terror groups could run afoul of domestic confidentiality laws. Past attempts to crack down on the assets of terrorists and drug lords have had just limited success.
In 1998, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order that sought to freeze the assets of Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda, though it did not include many of the other organizations linked to Al Qaeda that were on the list today. Moreover, Mr. Clinton's administration never openly threatened sanctions against countries and overseas financial institutions that did not join a crackdown.
Of the groups or individuals cited today, one-third had been previously identified by the United States in connection with terrorism. The others were new.
One difficulty in using such economic sanctions against terrorism is that the amounts of money used to conduct terrorist activities may be a few drops in the trillion-dollar torrent that rushes through the world financial system each day. 
The bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 cost an estimated $20,000, and the F.B.I. has said it believes that the attacks on Sept. 11 were conducted for $200,000 in training, airfare and living expenses.
Mr. Bush declined to talk about the evidence behind his list. He said it was based on "clear evidence, much of which is classified."
The White House refused to discuss what it knew about the links between the charities, for example, and Al Qaeda. Mr. Bush deflected calls for details, insisting that "we will not jeopardize the sources."
"We will not make the war more difficult to win by publicly disclosing classified information," he said.
But White House officials acknowledged that they did not believe that Mr. bin Laden maintained significant assets in the United States and that they did not have a clear idea how his activities were financed.
The Clinton administration began tracing funds to Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda in 1998. That effort did not locate any assets held here. 
Mr. Bush said his order was much more sweeping. He cited a number of related groups operating in places like Egypt, the Philippines, Somalia and Yemen. 
Two of the proscribed groups are generally believed to have ties to Pakistan. An Islamic militant group, Haraka Ul Mujahidin, is based in Pakistan, and it is widely believed to conduct terrorist activities against India in Kashmir.
Several groups, including Abu Sayyaf of the Philippines, the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria and Al Jihad of Egypt, are well-known Islamic militant organizations that the State Department had already classified as terrorist groups, meaning that the Treasury Department should already have taken action to seize their assets.
Other new targets appear to be suspected associates of Mr. bin Laden. Two, Tariq Anwar al-Sayyid Ahmad and Tharwat Salah Shihatah, have been sentenced to death in Egypt for plotting to overthrow the Egyptian government, according to Middle East news reports.
Mr. Bush is betting that by giving Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill the power to shut out foreign banks from the American market, he can force cooperation. Under the wording in the order, Mr. O'Neill can act against terrorists' associates, as well as financial intermediaries, even if it is not possible to prove complicity. Under the order, if a bank's offices and equipment are used by terrorists, the United States could seize the bank's assets in this country.
The treasury secretary already has the power to impose penalties on domestic and foreign banks that do business with Colombian drug cartels. But the secretary has not had the authority to threaten banks with similar sanctions if they provide services to terrorists.
Although it seems highly unlikely that Western banks or even secretive offshore financial centers would willingly provide services to terrorists, the new order could pressure banks around the Persian Gulf elsewhere in the Middle East to guard against even unwitting terrorist ties for fear of losing access to the international system.
It is unclear how much money the order will affect. The Treasury Department gave no estimates. In all likelihood, Mr. bin Laden's organization has kept its funds in places that are as difficult to find as the reclusive terrorist himself.
French and Swiss officials said they were acting against suspected terrorist financiers who operated in those countries. The European Commission directed its finance, justice and interior ministers to stop financing terrorist activities, though it was not clear whether Europe would immediately focus on the 27 groups and individuals listed here.
As Mr. Bush focused on the financial war, the Pentagon nearly completed its deployment of roughly 50 bombers and surveillance aircraft, including U-2's from Beale Air Force Base in California and RC-135's from Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, to within easy striking distance of Afghanistan, military officials said today. Many of the planes are at a field on Diego Garcia, the British island in the Indian Ocean.

HEADLINE: MARKETING; 
The Web Doesn't Sell Cars but Lets Buyers Build Their Own

BYLINE:  By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
ALONG with the purveyors of other consumer goods, carmakers have been extolling their products on Web sites for some time. There are also independent sites that profess to give unbiased views of what the automotive marketplace offers. Both kinds of sites provide information and offer various ways of buying vehicles.
 Does that mean that shoppers use the Internet to buy cars without going through a dealer? 
 Not exactly.
There are many reasons for this. Many states, for example, allow car sales only through dealers and bar discount online price offers from manufacturers. Even if direct online sales were allowed, a carmaker could hardly bypass its dealers and still retain their loyalty.
Moreover, car buyers "still want a local, permanent presence," said Baba Shetty, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. People want a test-drive and want to "look someone in the eye and shake their hand," she said.
These revelations have not led carmakers to give up on the Internet. Instead, their Web strategies are structured to develop leads for dealers -- to engage people and get them into showrooms, actually or virtually. While accepting the limits on Web sales, carmakers are also experimenting with expanding sites by offering data on models, options, prices and, in some cases, inventory.
The companies' efforts to corral browsers who might be buyers often start with advertisements on the independent sites where they go to do research on models, prices and options -- like Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), Edmunds (www.edmunds.com), Carpoint.com (owned by Microsoft) and Autobytel .com. Some sites, like Kelley and Edmunds, are linked to manufacturers' sites, like GMBuyPower.com of General Motors. 
That is because G.M. and the independent sites have an alliance, said Olga Purington, the G.M. alliance manager for Kelley and Edmunds. The manufacturer pays the sites for ads that may pop up as a consumer shops for G.M. cars or comparable vehicles, and for a prominent link to its site to appear when the consumer is ready to buy.
Such affiliate relationships between carmakers and third-party sites are common. But because the third-party sites are supposed to be impartial, the links cannot overtly favor one carmaker over another. That means that fancy promotional gadgets and interactive offerings are on the company sites, which do not have the same limitations.
So, which manufacturer sites are the best? Web sites are revised frequently. Model years change annually, usually prompting a revamping of the sites each fall. Nevertheless, for the 2000 model year and the 2001 model year just ending, Forrester Research, J. D. Power & Associates, a Los Angeles consulting firm, and Gomez, another consulting firm that analyzed the models, rated a number of Internet sites above average. These sites include Mercedes-Benz (www.mbusa.com), Saturn (www .saturn.com), Honda (www.honda 2001.com) and Dodge (www .4adodge.com).
These and other highly rated sites share many features, the most important being a "configurator," which allows people to configure and then see images of the models that interest them by features and pictorially, sometimes in three dimension.
The Saturn site is representative of many. Visitors to the site who click the rubric Shop & Buy are taken to a screen with other links that permit them to put a car together by choosing among Saturn's models and options. The car they create is pictured with features as they are chosen, in color. Each feature is priced, and additional links allow visitors to compare the car they are building with other Saturn models.
There are price and affordability calculators, too, which consumers can use to determine the payments on their dream vehicle. There are even links to independent Web sites that quote used-car prices, so that consumers can get an idea of the value of any trade-in. Finally, there are links that allow consumers to find their closest dealer, and to continue the sales process there, at the price quoted on the Web site.
Other sites take the process further. As with Saturn, prices are listed, though state regulations usually allow only the dealer's invoice and sticker prices, or "average" local prices, putting off any additional price negotiations until the dealer and customer meet. (With its "no haggle" policy, Saturn does not have to contend with this issue.)
But these sites do something else -- they allow consumers to find out whether their dream car is actually on a lot or whether it needs to be built.
FOR example, GMBuyPower .com (which does not include Saturn) permits buyers to see whether a particular car exists. And DaimlerChrysler recently began posting dealer inventory on its Web sites for its Chrysler lines, www .4adodge.com, www.chrysler.com and www.jeepunpaved.com. The vehicles on the lots of five-star dealers are listed by vehicle identification number and the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Information is accessible by building a virtual car and looking for a close match, or by searching a list of cars on the lot by model and feature. 
Another site, FordDirect.com, works similarly. The site, a joint venture between Ford Motor and some of its dealers, has been online since April. It operates through dealers in only 26 states, and is too new to have been included in the Forrester or J. D. Powers studies.
The manufacturers' Web sites boast impressive visitor numbers, like 1.7 million monthly visits to Honda's site, said Erin Pinto, a spokeswoman. According to Tom Folger, the director of relationship marketing and Internet for Saturn, half a million visits have been made to its site. Roughly a million unique visits have been made to the Mercedes-Benz site every month, according to a company spokeswoman, Liz Hamill. In June, the first full month during which all three Chrysler sites began offering their version of what Ms. Hamill called "dealer inventory transparency," 70,000 people sent price requests to dealers, said Freda Bane, the group's interactive e-strategy senior manager.
About 17 to 20 percent of visitors to the Chrysler sites bought a vehicle, Ms. Bane said. The industry calls this the closing ratio. 
That's better than most automotive sites, said Chris Denove of J. D. Powers. But it is still lower than the average for walk-in customers, which he said was 20 to 25 percent.
Does that mean that the Internet-generated sales leads will never equal those arising from actual showroom visits?
No, said Mike Devereux, the director of business development for e-GM, the Internet business unit of G.M. He is managing a test partnership between Autobytel.com, the independent Web site, and Chevrolet dealers in the Washington area, providing online shoppers with pricing and vehicle availability information. 
The test began in May and will continue through October. According to Mr. Devereux, G.M. tried it because "not everyone is comfortable with a manufacturer's Web site or a dealer's Web site." 
How many cars have been sold? Mr. Devereux declined to give exact numbers, but he said that the closing ratio was about 25 percent, the same for dealer walk-ins. That's higher than anything else G.M. is doing on the Internet. "We are very pleased with this test," Mr. Devereux said. "It proves definitively that different consumers want different things."

HEADLINE: BY THE BOOK; 
An Old-World Explorer

BYLINE:  By AMANDA HESSER 

 BODY:
IN America, Greek cuisine seems to exist on two planes. There is its old form, steeped in "classics" like moussaka, baklava and seemingly anything stuffed into phyllo layered with butter. And there is the new form, which tends toward a Mediterranean diet and foods that appeal to modern diners, like tangy tzatziki, eggplant caviar and expensive fish grilled and sprinkled with olive oil. It seems implausible that one country could have such vastly different styles of cooking.
 But it does, as you will read in Diane Kochilas's fabulous new book, "The Glorious Foods of Greece" (William Morrow, $40). What American chefs have failed to do is fill in the gap between that hearty moussaka and that lean fish with the richly varied cooking from Greece's island and mountain regions. Ms. Kochilas does this with such clarity and depth that you feel you have happened upon a new cuisine. 
 Like the cookbook writers Paula Wolfert and Lynn Rossetto Kasper, she explores a cuisine by traveling down seemingly every lane and alley in a region, knocking on doors, peeking into obscure tavernas and asking questions.
Ms. Kochilas begins with the food of the Peloponnesus, a peasant cuisine full of one-pot meals, then takes you through Roumeli and Epirus, home to many cheeses and savory pies, which were created as portable foods for shepherds. From there, she travels through Macedonia, where peppers and leeks color the culinary landscape, and Crete, a model of Mediterranean cooking, with its fresh fish and vegetables.
The recipes are superb and enlightening. As against the many books on supposedly humble Tuscan food, which have you buying expensive mushrooms and olive oils, Ms. Kochilas's book resonates with the economy and simplicity of Greece's regional cuisines by calling for common vegetables and inexpensive cuts of meat. It is the rich cuisine of a poor people. There are no airs. Just flavor.
Many of the short headnotes and sidebars are filled with useful information. You learn that Greek cooks turn to chervil much as French cooks reach for thyme. That egg-lemon sauce can be made by two methods, one using whole eggs, the other separating them and folding in the whipped whites.
Ms. Kochilas has a perceptive cook's eye, and it shows in her recipes. In a dish of giant beans with celery, the beans are first simmered, then baked until soft. "This is the whole secret to this dish," she writes. "The beans have to soak properly and cook enough so that they are creamy, almost the texture of roasted garlic, without disintegrating." From this, you immediately know what to look for. 
Tomatoes are rarely peeled, seeded and chopped, but grated, a sure sign of old country cooking. You simply rub the tomato on a coarse grater, and in less than a minute, you are left with just the stem and skin in your hands, the rest of the tomato reduced to a juicy pulp at the bottom of a bowl. 
The great delight of the book for me, though, was coming across dozens upon dozens of recipes that I had never heard of before. There is fresh pasta with garlic, in which the pasta and three heads of smashed garlic cloves are boiled together. You drain the cooked pasta and garlic and toss it with olive oil. Artichokes (have you ever seen artichokes on a Greek menu?) are stewed with tomatoes, wild fennel and rice, and rolled in an egg-lemon sauce.
A dish that I will make again and again is from the Aegean Islands. A small amount of pork sausage is simmered with red onions, dill, fennel, green beans and mint. The vegetables meld into a fragrant tomato broth. The sausage flavors the dish and retreats to the background. Lamb sausages cooked with peppers and tomato had the same kind of reserved brilliance. A parsley and onion dip for crudites had the makings of a green sauce, with parsley, red onion, oil and vinegar pureed in a food processor. The pivotal ingredient was bread, which gave it a texture that was creamy, a little springy and tamped down the sharpness of vinegar.
The best dish of all was tagliatelle with sheep's milk yogurt and caramelized onions from Kassos, on the Dodecanese Islands near Turkey. You drain the yogurt, then mix it with a little of the pasta cooking water. When the pasta is cooked (until it is soft, writes Ms. Kochilas, not al dente), you toss it with the yogurt, then sprinkle it with grated aged sheep's milk cheese and a dollop of caramelized onions. It is as dull looking as could be, but one of the most subtle, delicious things I have ever tasted.

PASTA WITH YOGURT AND CARAMELIZED ONIONS, FROM KASSOS
Adapted from "The Glorious Foods of Greece"
Time: 45 minutes, plus 2 hours to drain yogurt

2 cups sheep's milk yogurt
5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
6 cups coarsely chopped onion
Sea salt
1 pound tagliatelle
1 cup coarsely grated kefalotyri cheese or pecorino Romano.

1. Line a colander with cheesecloth, and set over a bowl or in the sink. Add yogurt, and let drain for 2 hours.
2. Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and add onion. Reduce heat to medium low, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are soft and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, fill a large pot with water, and bring to a boil. As it heats, season with enough salt so that you can taste it. Add pasta, and cook until soft, not al dente. Combine drained yogurt with 1/2 cup cooking water, and mix well. Drain pasta, and toss with yogurt mixture.
4. Divide among 4 bowls. Sprinkle generously with cheese, and top with caramelized onions and their juices.

Yield: 4 servings.

STEWED VEGETABLES WITH SAUSAGE, FROM LIMNOS
Adapted from "The Glorious Foods of Greece"
Time: 1 hour 10 minutes

1/2 pound mild pork sausage, removed from its casings
2 medium red onions, chopped
1 fennel bulb, chopped
1 1/2 pounds green beans, trimmed
2 large firm, ripe tomatoes, grated on a coarse grater into a bowl
1/3 cup snipped dill
1/3 cups chopped mint
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
3 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil.

1. In a large pot over medium heat, brown sausage meat, breaking it up into 1-inch to 2-inch pieces. Add onions and fennel, and cook together until they are softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add beans to pot, together with tomatoes, dill and mint. Season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat in the pork fat. Add olive oil and enough water to come about halfway up vegetables. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until all ingredients in stew are soft, about an hour. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Yield: 4 servings.

HEADLINE: Gucci Warns That Results Are Suffering 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
A growing list of luxury goods makers, which had been largely untouched by the developing economic slowdown, are reporting that demand has fallen sharply since the terror attacks on the United States.
 The latest, and among the most severe, report came today from the Gucci Group, which warned of a 13 percent fall in profit this year. 
 Analysts said Gucci's forecast could be more negative than those of some rivals' because it has had more time to assess the impact on its business. When LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton warned that its profit growth for the year would slow to 5 percent from 10 percent, it did so just two days after the attacks. 
"Despite what was looking like a recession in the United States, luxury companies were still doing quite well," Scott Weldon, a Deutsche Bank analyst in Paris, said. "Sept. 11 has changed everything."
Gucci said sales would probably be $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, below the $2.45 billion it once predicted.
Sales have been hit by an erosion in consumer confidence, leading shoppers to postpone buying expensive items, and by the sharp falloff in tourism, which has cut traffic in shops in resort areas. 
Domenico De Sole, the chief executive, said that before Sept. 11, Gucci thought it would raise its profit target for the year. The second quarter was better than expected, he said, with much of the growth coming from strong sales of leather jackets, pants and accessories.
Yves Saint Laurent, which Gucci bought in 1999 and is trying to turn around, recorded an operating loss of $13.2 million in the quarter, on sales that fell 11 percent, to $21.6 million, because the company had ended some licensing deals. Mr. De Sole said Saint Laurent "has turned the corner" and that sales were far above expectations in August.
Not all investors are convinced. "What we've seen with Y.S.L. is encouraging, but turnarounds are always difficult to predict, especially in a tough economic environment," said Scilla Huang Sun, manager of a luxury goods fund at the Clariden Bank in Zurich.
Gucci shares fell 2.35 percent, to 87.15 euros ($79.83) in Amsterdam.
On Friday, regulators in the Netherlands, where Gucci is incorporated, approved a deal Gucci struck earlier this month to be acquired in stages over three years by Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, which analysts said would act as a floor under the stock. The Dutch said Gucci must obtain a $234 million letter of credit to compensate minority sahreholders if Pinault backed out.

HEADLINE: Downtown: A Triumph to Reopen, a Struggle to Fill Tables 

BYLINE:  By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
FOR more than a week, most of the restaurants in TriBeCa and the financial district -- including some of the city's most vibrant and popular -- were completely shut down, or devoted to feeding rescue workers and the stalwart people who remained in the neighborhood.
 Over the weekend, and particularly by Monday, they made their first attempts to return to business as usual. Deliveries were back to normal, and people were making an effort to come downtown. Le Zinc reopened almost immediately. Chanterelle reopened Friday. So did Capsouto Freres and Pico. TriBeCa's best-known places -- Nobu, Nobu Next Door, Montrachet and Tribeca Grill -- opened on Monday. 
 Now what the restaurants need are customers -- and a business plan to keep them afloat until those customers are back in force. Some, like Chanterelle, have reduced prices. Others have dreamed up creative ways to get their customers below Canal Street, where cars are still prohibited: Pico is offering a shuttle from Canal and Greenwich Streets.
Many restaurants have had to lay off workers or reduce hours, among them City Hall at 131 Duane Street, which let 10 dining room workers go and cut down on the kitchen staff's hours.
But some restaurants may already be lost. Morton's of Chicago on West Street is closed indefinitely. And some restaurants, already in trouble because of the downturn in the economy, may not be able to weather the storm. Chuck Hunt of the New York State Restaurant Association said: "With decline in sales there are some restaurants that will not make it. This probably could not have happened at a worse time."
On Monday, restaurants like Grace and F. illi Ponte said they lost 90 percent of their business last week. Optimism about the future has not disappeared, however. Harry Poulakakos, owner of Bayard's in Hanover Square and Harry's, in the same building, said: "Because of holidays our industry may recoup a little faster. Personally, my problem is my labor. I may have to cut down a little, but overall I'm going to ride it out. It's going to take a little time."
Fred McKibbin, an owner of Grace at 114 Franklin Street, said he was grateful that this week his business was off by just 50 percent. 
All are hoping that low-interest government loans and and postponement of tax payments will help them through the huge drop-off in business.
Some restaurants are both open for business and feeding workers at the World Trade Center site as well as offering them free meals in the restaurants. At Capsouto Freres, at Washington and Watts Streets, there is a buffet table for the police and for Con Ed and telephone workers. 
"I did my first souffle last week, and for me it was like the reopening of the stock exchange was for New York," said Jacques Capsouto, one of the owners.
That souffle now costs $6.50 instead of $8, and the prices on the still- limited menu have been reduced by 25 percent. Prices at Pico, 349 Greenwich Street, are reduced by $2 or $3. The $84 prix fixe menu at Chanterelle, 2 Harrison Street, has been joined by a $35 three-course menu.
Monday night, TriBeCa was quiet, and looking down West Broadway, the still smoldering ruins and the eerily lighted sky where the World Trade Center once stood were sharp reminders of why. A few sightseers wandered about, but most of those on the street lived in the neighborhood or were on their way to a restaurant. People were free to move about the area below Canal and above Duane as well as in the financial district east of Broadway. The police were not letting anyone through the barricades at Duane Street without proper identification. "We just want to go to that restaurant down on the corner," one man said to an officer. "Sorry, sir, why don't you try one of the restaurant up there," he said, pointing north. 
Cars and taxis are not allowed below Canal Street, though the barrier may be moved farther south at any time. The Franklin Street subway stop, in the heart of TriBeCa, is open. The subway stops at Wall Street and Bowling Green are also open. The subway is the quickest route, and many restaurants are within a few blocks of the subway stops.
The Wall Street area was quieter, the few people on the street rushing to the subway.
David Waltuck, the chef at Chanterelle in TriBeCa, had nothing better to do at 6:45 than shoot the breeze with some of his employees. Three tables of diners told the story, but by the end of the evening, the restaurant had fed 60 people. 
Some restaurants are trying to conduct business without the normal telephone service. Henry Meer, who owns City Hall, has arranged to have calls forwarded to his other restaurant, the Cub Room. David Bouley, who has spent the last week feeding rescue workers, hopes to open Bouley and Danube on Friday, temporarily using cellphones for reservations (646-232-0321 and 917-929-9950).
In the financial district, lunch business has been steadily increasing. Vine, at 25 Broad Street, reported three customers on Sept. 17, 150 on Monday. But dinner business is nonexistent, said Julie Menin, an owner. 
Mr. Poulakakos reported that lunch at Harry's was also strong. At 55 Wall Street in the Regent Wall Hotel, where the ballroom was used to feed workers after the attack, the electricity and gas are back on, the restaurant is open for business and everyone is waiting for it to return to normal.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Even with oil prices down, OPEC is expected to maintain production levels.

BYLINE:  By Neela Banerjee 

DATELINE: VIENNA 

 BODY:
FACING stiff international pressure to keep oil prices low as the global economy slumps, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to maintain current production levels when it meets today at its headquarters here.
 The campaign to keep prices tamped down -- which would serve the interests of the United States -- puts OPEC in a bind, analysts here said. 
 Oil prices have fallen sharply in the last week, particularly a 15 percent drop on Monday and a further decline of 0.9 percent yesterday, and that has OPEC, a 10-member cartel of major producers, worried. Nonetheless, analysts said, the producers risk grave political effects if they cut back production now to shore up prices, because the move might be seen as coldly opportunistic in the wake of the attacks in the United States and the shocks these set off through much of the world economy. 
"If OPEC cuts production now, it will look exceedingly insensitive, politically and economically," said Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "What OPEC is going to do is do nothing." 
After the attacks, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other OPEC members regarded as American allies pledged to keep oil supplies stable to show their solidarity with the United States as it embarks on a protracted campaign against terrorism. On the political front, the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates announced over the last few days that they were severing diplomatic ties with the Taliban, the radical Islamic leadership in Afghanistan. 
In the last two years, OPEC has struck a balance that provided stable oil supplies to importing countries and high revenue to its members by successfully modulating production to meet changes in global demand. For months, oil prices have remained between $25 and $30 a barrel. 
Now, even though crude oil prices settled yesterday at $21.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down from $22.01 on Monday, the earliest that analysts expect OPEC to decrease output is during its next meeting scheduled in November.
The oil market's volatility has begun to chip away at the cohesion that allowed OPEC to manage supplies and prices so ably over the last year. Some members, like Algeria and the Emirates, said the group would look for ways to buoy prices at about $25 a barrel. But Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC and the world's largest oil producer, indicated that the organization would let current production levels of more than 23 million barrel a day stand.
"OPEC is an organization of the world, and we are extremely preoccupied and concerned about the world economy," the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told reporters here yesterday. "But we recognize that OPEC doesn't really control the price. You know who determines the price. It's the market."
OPEC reduced daily output several weeks ago by one million barrels a day, and analysts said the impact of that decision had yet to be felt in the world markets. 
The high level of oil supplies now is partly a result of most OPEC members' producing above their official quotas, according to Mehdi Varzi, an independent oil analyst. Given the constraints that OPEC now faces, its only option, Mr. Varzi and other analysts said, is to tighten discipline and make sure that members stay within those lower production levels. 
Fear of a crash in the commodity prices of crude oil could be the best incentive. "I think what they've seen the last two days has really shocked them," Mr. Varzi said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ADVERTISING; 
In a whole new climate, the networks scramble to review and revise their own fall promotions.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
AS the big broadcast networks work frantically to accommodate marketers that must change, postpone or cancel advertising after the terrorist attacks, they are also scrambling to change, postpone or cancel advertising of their own: the elaborate and expensive campaigns to promote the series they will offer for the 2001-2002 prime-time season.
 Network executives are using words like "chaotic" to describe the revamping, which is required for two reasons. One is the weeklong delay in the official start of the season, to Monday of this week from Sept. 17, which blunted whatever momentum the networks managed to gain from the initial phases of campaigns that began as early as May. 
 The other reason is the need to review the content and tone of almost everything, including commercials, posters, banner ads and store displays, to revise whatever may now be deemed offensive. 
"Three months of planning have been reconfigured in a week," said Bob Bibb, co-president for marketing, advertising and promotion at WB, owned by AOL Time Warner and the Tribune Company.
In some instances, ads that were reworked once are being reworked again. For example, NBC, part of General Electric, will replace promotions for two series, "The West Wing" and "Third Watch," that were already changed or withdrawn to reflect the scheduling of special episodes being centered on the attacks.
NBC also scrapped some cheerful commercials promoting the new season, which featured a jingle asking if viewers were "looking for a place to land," and substituted somber, subdued spots. But those have been supplanted by more upbeat promotions, said Vince Manze, co-president and creative director at the NBC Agency, the network's internal shop, because "we felt we were depressing people who might be happy to know 'Frasier' is back on."
"There are things you never would have thought of," Mr. Manze said. "A lot of it is going with your gut. It's new territory."
It is also valuable territory in that the promotions are considered crucial to help the networks lure viewers back to their TV sets after a summer of reruns. Higher levels of viewership may ameliorate the effects of the recent economic slowdown, which forced the networks to lower significantly the prices paid for commercial time.
"The new season will be a mess," said Jon Mandel, co-managing director at MediaCom Worldwide in New York, a media services agency owned by the Grey Global Group. "A lot of shows won't premiere as well as they should because they won't have the proper promotion."
The network executives are redoubling their efforts to prevent that.
"We've jumped through hoops to move whatever we can and rebuild our media schedule," said Mike Benson, senior vice president for marketing, advertising and promotion at the ABC Entertainment division of the Walt Disney Company.
"We've looked at every single spot," he added, "to make sure the tone is sensitive to the situation."
That scrutiny at ABC and the other networks has prompted widespread revisions. A line from a commercial for the season premiere of "The Practice" on ABC, promising "a story more gripping than the headlines," was removed, said Alan Cohen, executive vice president for marketing, advertising and promotion, and ads for the series "Mole 2" that "emphasized it's a show about finding the traitor, a show where someone betrays somebody, have been redone because that didn't seem appropriate."
The Manhattan skyline vanished from posters and print ads for "Law & Order: Criminal Intent," a new series on NBC, and so did scenes of an explosion from commercials for "24," a new series on the Fox Broadcasting Company division of the News Corporation.
"There's no manual," said Joe Earley, senior vice president at Fox. "We're just going day by day."
In many instances, changes could not be made. For example, the CBS unit of Viacom could not stop in-store promotions co-sponsored with a sibling, Blockbuster Entertainment, and the Target discount chain, part of the Target Corporation.
"We tried to reconstruct our plans, but those were done," said George F. Schweitzer, executive vice president for marketing at the CBS Television Network division of CBS.
It was not a total loss, he added, because the Blockbuster promotion, which included giveaways of "CBS Sneak Peek" tapes and DVD's, took place during the weekend of Sept. 14 to 16, when "a lot of people were in the stores" renting entertainment fare to escape the grim news.
But the "tune in" print ads for many of the networks' series -- named for the time and channel information for specific shows -- were overtaken by events when the season's start was rescheduled. More money had to be spent to rerun those ads with updated information.
WB has had to run ads three times to promote a new block of Friday sitcoms because the premieres were moved from Sept. 14 to Sept. 21 and then to Oct. 5. That caused delays for promotions scheduled with two other parts of AOL Time Warner, America Online and Netscape, as well as for commercials to appear on cable network siblings like TBS and TNT.
"This whole 'ecosystem' has been disrupted," Mr. Bibb said. "On that front, we did lose momentum."
Many series, however, have not been affected because plans called for them to be introduced before or well after Sept. 11.
The new Fox lineups for Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday are now scheduled to be introduced in November, Mr. Earley said, after the network completes its broadcasts of the 2001 World Series.
Joanna Lowry, a spokeswoman for UPN, another Viacom unit, said: "Our new Monday lineup has already premiered, and our next premiere is 'Enterprise' " tonight, followed by "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," on Tuesday; "Special Unit 2," next Wednesday; and "Roswell," on Oct. 9.
At WB, "Smallville," a drama about a teenage Superman for which executives have high hopes, is to begin on Oct. 16. So its promotions -- featuring the actor portraying the young Superman with the letter "S" painted on his buff bare chest -- are proceeding as planned.
"Testing told us we had to lose the altruistic, Americana aspects of Superman, to make the kid seem interesting" to younger viewers, Mr. Bibb said. "But in the last two weeks, we've seen people very accepting of that, so maybe that should be altered."
Mr. Manze at NBC glimpsed a silver lining in the clouds.
"Because of all the scrambling, because of all the problems we've all gone through," he said, "perhaps the networks will be a little more patient" as they ponder the performance of the season's shows, particularly the new series.
But Mr. Earley at Fox injected a cautionary note, delicately phrased.
"We have to expect the unexpected and be prepared for whatever comes," he said, "and always have contingency plans should we return to breaking news."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMY; 
Spending Weakens as Confidence Wanes

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In the 10 days of September before terrorists struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, consumer confidence plunged more sharply than at any time since the last recession, the Conference Board reported yesterday, suggesting that the nation was moving quickly toward a recession even before the attacks.
 New reports of falling retail sales suggested that the attacks had done fresh and perhaps long-term damage to consumer spending, which had already weakened before Sept. 11 in response to rising unemployment and declining stock prices. Because consumer confidence and spending tend to move in tandem, consumer confidence after Sept. 11 almost certainly took another significant plunge, economists say. 
 "You should read the Conference Board's report as basically confirming what we already knew, that by early September the economy had entered a new phase of deterioration," said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. The first survey of consumer confidence after the attacks will be released on Friday by the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. 
Like most forecasters, Mr. McKelvey thinks that the statistics will show that a mild recession probably started in late summer and that the attacks deepened it. A slowdown started 14 months ago when businesses cut back on investment. The much more important consumer spending held up, preventing the economy from contracting until late summer.
A recession is usually defined as at least two quarters in which the national output of goods and services contracts. 
Almost every day, one retailer or another has announced that sales fell in September. Federated Department Stores, which includes Macy's and Bloomingdale's, for example, announced on Monday that sales in stores open at least a year were 15 percent to 20 percent below last September's levels, with most, but not all of the damage coming after the attacks. 
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which tracks sales at chain stores, reported that sales have declined for four consecutive weeks, with the biggest drops after Sept. 10.
"We are beginning to see some stabilization among the discounters like Wal-Mart and Kmart," said Michael P. Niemira, an economist at the bank who compiles the data. "They have the basics that people need. But broadly speaking, the numbers continue to be weak." 
And those retailers that have not yet issued results for September often speak pessimistically.
"Sales slowed way down immediately after the attack," said Charlotte LaComb, manager of investor relations at the retailer Lands' End. "In the following days sales came back," she said, "but it has been a very slow process. There are so many factors involved, it is next to impossible to sort them out." 
The attacks are a significant factor, of course. But the Conference Board singled out two factors that predated the attacks -- "deteriorating labor markets," the unemployment rate jumped to 4.9 percent from 4.5 percent in August, and falling stock prices. Its consumer confidence index fell to 97.6 this month from 114 in August. The slide of 16.4 points was the largest single drop since October 1990, during the last recession.
Those who responded to the poll were pessimistic about their current situation and what they expected six months from now.
"They expect fewer jobs to be available and their incomes to decline," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
The part of the index that measures expectations fell to 79.2 from 93.7 in August. "Usually when the expectations component goes below 80," Ms. Franco said, "it is indicative of a recession."
The overall index is calculated from the responses to 5,000 questionnaires mailed out in the first days of September. Of those who responded, 85 percent did so before Sept. 11. The University of Michigan's early September survey, published last Friday, showed similar results. 
"In only three other monthly surveys in the past 25 years have consumers expected smaller income gains," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the Michigan surveys. "All three were right before the 1980 recession."
The ISI Group, a Wall Street firm that surveys home builders, chain stores and auto dealers each week, reported that before Sept. 11, there had been "a significant but not extreme weakening" in all three sectors. "The terrorist attacks have added 10 to 15 percentage points to the decline," the president of ISI, Ed Hyman, said yesterday. 
Through August sales of existing homes remained strong. In a report yesterday, the National Association of Realtors said that sales in September reached a record annual rate of 5.5 million, from 5.2 million in August, and the median sale price rose to $154,7000 from $151,700.

Venture Capital FinancingIs Further Sapped by Events

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Venture capital investing, the high-risk financing of early-stage companies that has been markedly curtailed in the last year, is being further challenged in light of the recent terrorist attacks and growing signs of recession, those investors say.
 The venture capitalists assert that the slowing of the economy, coupled with an uncertainty about the public markets, is affecting all facets of their industry, including their ability to raise new funds, their decisions about which and how many companies to invest in, and their expectations about when their existing investments will become profitable. 
 Putting a fine point on the concern, the National Venture Capital Association issued a statement today saying the industry "is preparing for an extremely difficult economic environment" in the next 12 to 18 months. 
At the heart of the issue is a question about how venture capitalists can expect to sell the investments they make. Typically they take their companies public, or sell them outright. But those so-called "exit strategies" are sharply limited, said Mark Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group based in Arlington, Va., with 400 member firms.
"We were already in tough times," Mr. Heesen said. "What Sept. 11 did was make the likelihood of the I.P.O. market opening in the next four quarters pretty unlikely. A lot of V.C.'s are saying it might not open until 2003," using the abbreviation for venture capitalists.
The investors say that as a result, they must put more money into companies in which they are already invested, making sure to keep them afloat until an exit strategy emerges. The numbers on investments made in new companies bear that out: this year, venture capitalists will invest about $50 billion in start-up companies, Mr. Heesen said, compared with $105 billion last year.
Still, venture capitalists point out that this market appears to be so difficult because this year is being compared with the two years previous, which were anomalies, with exorbitant returns being driven by the dot-com boom, and the expansion of the public markets.
Steve N. Lisson, editor and publisher of InsiderVC.com, said recent events were reminiscent of the time around the gulf war, when the industry had its last downturn. At that time, the ability to attract capital to invest in start-ups "fell off dramatically," but he said the industry bounced back within several years to have the "best period in its history."

HEADLINE: Finance Ministers Agree on October Meeting 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
The finance ministers from leading industrial nations agreed today to meet in early October to discuss global economic prospects in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 that dealt a shock to the already sputtering United States economy.
 The meeting, where officials are expected to discuss interest rates, fiscal policy, global currencies and financial aid to poor nations, will take place in Washington, the Group of 7 ministers said in a joint statement without specifying an exact date. 
It was originally scheduled to start this Saturday, but was postponed after the attacks on New York and Washington. 
 The meeting comes as most economists see the American and world economies performing below the forecasts that prevailed before the attacks. The American economy grew at a negligible 0.2 percent rate in the second quarter, and many private economists expect it to shrink in the third and fourth quarters.
The Conference Board reported today that consumer confidence plummeted in September at the sharpest rate since October 1990, which was during the last recession. The board's survey, conducted mostly before the attacks, showed its monthly consumer confidence index fell to 97.6 from 114 in August.
A joint statement of the Group of 7 ministers, issued by the Treasury Department, noted the deteriorating economic prospects but predicted that a turnaround was not far off.
"For the U.S. economy, we reported that the events of September 11 will delay the recovery that was under way," the statement said. "However, our economic policies and fundamentals remain strong and we expect a near-term return to sustained economic growth and stable financial markets."

HEADLINE: Alaska Antimissile Site: Too Close for Russians' Comfort? 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: FORT GREELY, Alaska 

 BODY:
In a patch of fire-scorched forest in central Alaska, under the shadow of towering peaks, construction crews have been carving the outlines of a 135-acre missile field at an Army base here, 100 miles south of Fairbanks. They are laying the foundations for a rudimentary missile defense site.
 But as those crews rush to beat winter's subzero temperatures and pounding snows, their work may complicate the Bush administration's efforts to keep Russia in an international coalition to fight terrorism in the aftermath of the attacks on New York and Washington. 
 The Pentagon plans to build a command center and five silos at Fort Greely for launching rockets that could demolish enemy missiles high above the earth. 
Though the site would initially be used for antimissile testing, the Pentagon has said it might declare Fort Greely a working national missile defense site as early as 2004. 
More immediately, the construction holds the potential to become an irritant in the cooperation between Washington and Moscow to combat terrorism that has already seen Russia open several doors to an American presence in central Asia.
Russian officials have said they would view the construction of missile silos at Fort Greely as a violation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, signed in 1972 by the United States and the Soviet Union to prohibit national missile defense systems. Moscow considers the treaty the cornerstone of current arms control policy.
For that reason, any moves by the United States to withdraw from the pact -- which the Bush administration might have to decide in two or three months -- could undermine the administration's efforts to maintain Russian help in the war on terrorism, experts said. 
The United States has won Russia's support for using its airspace for relief missions and gained backing for the possible basing of American troops or jets in the former Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan on the Afghan border.
"If we move ahead to do something the Russians very clearly object to, it cannot help but impact their attitude on our requests," said Lee Hamilton, the former Democratic congressman who is director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. "They will be less supportive, less enthusiastic."
But some experts contend that if the administration succeeds in forging close ties with Russia in fighting terrorism, it may smooth the way to winning Moscow's endorsement for missile defenses later.
"The Russians themselves will have to worry about terrorism, perhaps terrorism involving long-range ballistic missiles," said Stephen P. Rosen, director of the Olin Institute for Strategic Studies at Harvard.
Outside the Army base here, a coalition of antinuclear, antiwar, church and environmental groups has demonstrated from time to time against the project. On Kodiak Island, hundreds of miles south, concerns have been voiced about disruptions to the fishing industry. "The fishermen are furious about this," said Vikki Jo Kennedy, a local tour guide in Kodiak. But in Fort Greely itself, people see the construction as a boon to the local economy.
Since hijackers attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Bush administration has not backed away from its missile shield program, which calls for beginning silo construction in the spring of 2002. The administration has held to its position even though such a shield would have done nothing to prevent the two attacks.
Indeed, some officials have gone as far as to suggest that the attacks prove the extraordinary lengths to which terrorists will go to harm the United States. Clearly, if terrorists obtain the technology to launch a missile attack they will not hesitate to use it, those officials contend.
It appears that there are divisions within the administration, pitting State Department officials against the Pentagon, over how quickly to move ahead with missile defense and whether Washington should avoid antagonizing the Russians now.
"There's a group in the State Department who believe Russian support and participation in what's coming is absolutely critical," said a person familiar with some of those discussions. "If we abrogate the ABM," which might be done as early as November or December, "it will be extremely difficult to work with them."
Pentagon officials say they will put Fort Greely into operation only if the threat of a missile attack seems imminent, and only if the system is ready for use. Even an imperfect system would be better than nothing if an enemy threatens the nation with nuclear missiles, they argue.
Though opposition to missile defense remains strong among arms control advocates, the recent attacks have muted Congressional critics. Last week, Senate Democrats withdrew measures to cut the administration's missile defense budget by $1.3 billion and to place restrictions on any spending that might violate the ABM treaty.
Under the treaty, Washington would be required to notify Moscow of its intention to withdraw from the pact six months in advance -- this November or December -- if the Pentagon is to begin silo work next spring.
As the clock ticks, the question in Washington has remained: is Fort Greely really for testing, or a veiled project to build a working missile shield?
Administration officials argue that Fort Greely will be part of a new range in which test-rocket trajectories will simulate those of missiles fired from Asia more realistically than earlier tests, something even Democrats have urged.
But in a paper published in Arms Control Today, the Union of Concerned Scientists argues that much of the work planned for Alaska has little testing value. It might make sense, though, as part of a working missile defense system, the authors argue.
For example, the Pentagon wants to upgrade a Cobra Dane early warning radar on Shemya Island in the Aleutians for tracking test missiles. But the radar points northwest toward the Kamchatka Peninsula, where the Russians once conducted missile tests. 
The radar unit cannot rotate and therefore cannot track missiles coming from California or Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific, where the military is likely to launch most of its test rockets. But it could be used to track missiles fired toward the United States from North Korea, the report says.
The report also questions why silos need to be built at Fort Greely at all. The Pentagon has no plans to launch test rockets from the base, because it is close to populated areas. Instead, test missiles will be fired from a state-owned site on Kodiak Island off the Alaskan coast.
"It becomes more and more clear that there is no justification for having Fort Greely as part of a test program," said Lisbeth Gronlund, senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Pentagon officials dispute that. Test missiles would be stored at Fort Greely, allowing crews to practice maintenance procedures and testers to check whether rocket fuel deteriorates in Arctic temperatures. The officials also say the Cobra Dane radar could be used to track test missiles fired from aircraft over the Bering Sea.
The debate has only recently begun to touch Alaska itself. Many residents of Kodiak Island are worried that test launchings will disrupt fishing, the island's major industry. But in Delta Junction, outside Fort Greely, many of the 3,500 residents have welcomed the plan. 
The town has been reeling since the Army closed most base operations after 1995, and silo construction could pump $400 million into the local economy over five years.
"I'd say about 99.9 percent of the people in Delta Junction support it," said the mayor, Roy Gilbertson, who owns a building supply company.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: CAIRO; 
U.S. Has a Long Way to Go To Bring Around Egyptians

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Mahmoud Bahi Radwan, the principal, held court behind his battered wooden desk at Mustafa Kamal Middle School on Monday, urging teachers seated on plastic chairs in his cramped office to discuss Egypt joining the battle against the forces who carried out what he called "the slap." 
 "It is not Egypt's battle and Egypt should not fight the American battle," groused Ibrahim Khalil, the thin, 55-year-old history and geography teacher. 
 Adel Muhammad Mahgoub, 48, the Arabic teacher, interjected: "To participate in punishing Islamic countries with no evidence is unacceptable. People will revolt if the government sent troops to kill innocent Muslims." 
The remarks by the teachers are typical of those echoing through Cairo these days, in buses and taxicabs, in cafes where the patrons sit around smoking waterpipes and even in Parliament and government offices. They indicate that the American government has a long way to go in convincing the Muslim public that its fight deserves the support of the wider world. 
Mustafa Kamal is a dilapidated government-supported boys school, a slightly off kilter four-story building with a coat of dusty salmon paint slapped over its rough concrete walls. One sadly bent basketball hoop hangs off the first floor.
Twenty years ago, its pupils included Mohamed Atta, an accused hijacker and possible ringleader of the attacks in the United States. None of the teachers who were at the school then remember him. But some maintain a certain grudging admiration for pulling off such an audacious attack. 
"They are very fine young men who did this," murmured one teacher. "America deserves a lesson."
Egypt has long endured Islamic terror attacks -- from the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat to the death of 58 tourists in Luxor in 1997. People here are keenly aware of the horrors of bloodshed and the economic battering from tourism losses. 
No one argues that if the United States has solid evidence against Osama bin Laden, they should not hunt him down. But the recent history of American involvement in the region sways the public away from supporting Washington.
Egyptians frame their doubts with a list that inevitably includes American support for Israel against the Palestinians, sanctions against the heavily Arab list of countries accused of supporting terrorism and the 11-year blockade against Iraq. They wonder aloud whether already beleaguered Afghan civilians will be the next targets. 
"America will abuse the terror attack to impose more control and tyranny on the world," said Seifeddin Abdel Sabour, a mathematics teacher. 
President Hosni Mubarak is visiting Europe this week, drumming up support for an international conference to hammer out an agreement on fighting terrorism.
In a string of interviews last week, he made points echoed with approval by the teachers. The United States should not act in haste. His country cannot join a coalition against terrorism without a broader international, preferably United Nations, framework. The West has been too liberal in granting asylum to violent opponents of Middle Eastern governments. There is no discussion of Egyptian troops at the moment and no plans to send any -- the government is even leery about using the word coalition. 
Back in 1990, when the United States was building a coalition against Iraq, many Arab countries joined because the fight to liberate Kuwait seemed to have a clear objective. Egypt proved pivotal in that effort. 
But this time is different. The target is vaguer. Although Egyptians expect some kind of attack on Afghanistan, they say an extended guerrilla war will only inspire yet another generation of terrorists. 
The grand sheik of Al Azhar University, Sayed Tantawi, the top religious cleric in Egypt and often considered the highest Sunni Muslim religious authority, distanced Egypt from any coalition. On Sunday he ruled that Muslim nations could join only alliances "championing the oppressed." 
Perhaps the most striking reaction from the teachers, and widespread in Egypt, is the sense that the United States immediately singled out the Arab names on passenger lists without any evidence. 
Their suspicions are fed constantly by a vibrant rumor mill that favors Israel as the culprit. The teachers repeat the grotesque but widely believed story that 4,000 Jews were warned away from the World Trade Center before the attack. 
Political cartoons mock the American eagerness to act, one showing a general shouting "Get me Rambo!" and another suggesting a list of target countries be picked out of a hat.
The teachers said they had not heard that one of their alumni might be involved in the attacks, but it does not completely absorb their interest. They lament the lack of a door to the schoolyard. Anyone can wander in.

HEADLINE: SPORTS BUSINESS; 
Between the Body Slams, the W.W.F. Shows a Sensitive Side

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Ten years ago, with the Persian Gulf war just ended, the main event of the World Wrestling Federation's Wrestlemania show in Los Angeles featured Hulk Hogan, the blond and bronzed hero of kiddies, against Sgt. Slaughter, a turncoat Iraqi sympathizer. In Slaughter's corner stood his muse, General Adnon, a Baghdad-born Saddam Hussein stand-in. Hogan beat Slaughter and exultantly draped himself in the American flag.
 But the W.W.F. -- that bastion of sweaty, scripted entertainment -- insists it will not capitalize on the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 by creating a terrorist character as a surrogate for fan anger. Not known for Iron John sensitivity, the W.W.F. wants to be seen as patriotic without being politically bellicose, as it was in the early 1980's when it featured the malevolent Iron Sheik to capitalize on the Iranian hostage crisis. 
 "After the war, we pared that back, because it wasn't where we wanted to be," Linda McMahon, the chief executive officer of W.W.F. Entertainment, said Monday. "We're not going to do anything to connect to the attacks. We want to be perceived as conscientious programmers."
An immediate manifestation of the approach was the emergence of Kurt Angle as the new W.W.F. champion. He defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin -- who presents no discernible political ideologies other than "Do Unto Others" and "Give Me A Hell Yeah" -- at Sunday night's "Unforgiven" pay-per-view extravaganza. Angle won the freestyle wrestling gold medal in the 220-pound class at the 1996 Summer Olympics.
"I think the attacks played a factor," said Dave Meltzer, editor and publisher of the Wrestling Observer, a newsletter. Although Angle was being developed as a character deserving of a championship shot, Meltzer said, "A month ago, it didn't seem giving him the title was the right thing to do."
McMahon would not specifically say that the W.W.F.'s response to the terrorism of Sept. 11 was to install an Olympic champion as the champion. But she said: "There was some discussion, that continued through yesterday, about whether he or Stone Cold Steve Austin would win. It was determined that winning was a good move for Kurt. It was thought-provoking to be a good hero for the time, and he was in line."
The W.W.F. has made additional moves since the attacks.
*Renaming its longtime Monday night TNN program "Raw is War." Now the first hour is called "Raw I," the second 'Raw II."
*Scratching "Armageddon" as the name one of its pay-per-view programs, replacing it with "Payback."
*Ending the playing of the song "Let the Bodies Hit the Fabric" at live events.
"We are part of the American fabric," McMahon said, "and we want to be sensitive."
The W.W.F. remains outrageous and outlandish, in its costumes, story lines, humor and sexual innuendoes. Feuds, jealousies and pectorals predominate.
But it seems to be smart business to refrain from playing off the horror of the attacks, which were far worse in every measure than the hostage crisis or the gulf war. "There's no reason to step things up and bring criticism on themselves," said Breck Wheeler, an analyst for Legg Mason Wood Walker. "They're based in Stamford, so they're close to New York and they know how sensitive things are."
Meltzer recalled how the W.W.F. was criticized for the story lines played out by Iron Sheik, General Adnon and Sgt. Slaughter.
"They exploited the gulf war; I don't see them doing that again," he said. "It shows how the W.W.F. has grown up."
But the wrestling company's business is not as robust as it was a year ago, when anticipation was high for the XFL, the football league it created with NBC. The XFL expired earlier this year, leading to a $46.9 million loss for the W.W.F. 
For the three months ended July 27, advertising and sponsorship revenues were down $4 million; revenues from live events fell $3.7 million. Pay-per-view revenues slipped by $3.6 million. And sales of merchandise tumbled by $8.4 million. The company also canceled or moved seven arena shows, largely because of slow ticket sales. Since then, an Oct. 7 show in Fairfax, Va., was moved to Valparaiso, Ind.
The ratings for "Raw is War" have gyrated through the year, but it is still the strongest regularly scheduled basic cable program. The Sept. 17 edition produced a 4.8 cable rating. (Each cable rating for TNN equals 810,000 television households.)
The W.W.F.'s net income for the quarter fell 21 percent to $11.9 million. Its stock, as high as 15.28 in July, closed at $11.70 yesterday, up 25 cents. Like many other entertainment companies, the W.W.F. is suffering from a broad-based slump in advertising and the fears of consumers about spending money in a backpedaling economy.
"The W.W.F. is not as expensive as pro sports like the N.F.L. or Nascar, but if times get tough, people cut back," Wheeler said.
McMahon said the company was hurt by the absence of its eye-brow-wiggling superstar, The Rock, who was off making a movie, and injuries to Triple H and Chris Benoit. "When you have three or four stars out, you have to adjust story lines," McMahon said. "And arena and merchandise sales went down."
The Rock has since returned.
She added that shows this month, including one in Houston two days after the terrorist attacks, sold out.
"We've been in a cycle," she said. "We've had our highs and lows."
One low the W.W.F. will not plumb is an Osama bin Laden character.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FAMILY CENTER; 
On Pier 94, a Welfare State That Works, and a Possible Model for the Future

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Inside the Family Assistance Center on Pier 94, where bereaved relatives and surviving workers of the World Trade Center disaster are being urged to seek help of all kinds, it is as though the welfare state stumbled into paradise.
 The blue carpeting is thick enough to soothe the weariest step. No matter what language is spoken, there are interpreters to translate and explain. The banks of telephones are free, like the child care, the all-day buffet, and the kindness of strangers. 
 Even more important to many of those gathering here under row upon row of star-spangled banners is the presence of every relevant federal, state and city agency. They are not only neatly labeled and well staffed, but eager to cut through rules and red tape to speed financial help to those in need.
"If it was like this always, it would be heaven," said Elsie Valentin, a social services worker who went to the center with Maxima De Pena, the wife of a missing kitchen worker at the World Trade Center who has a 2-year-old child, Edwin, and is expecting another baby soon. "Before we came here, every agency I called gave me the runaround."
It is too soon to say whether the overwhelming generosity shown to victims of the attack on the twin towers will change the way government handles the needy. But some scholars and advocates of social welfare say that this moment could represent a turning point in the national consciousness about public responsibility for private woes. To others, that seems like wishful thinking.
"I think this whole thing is going to bring back the importance of the public sector," said Roger Hickey, organizer of the New Century Alliance for Social Security, an umbrella group that has opposed the investment of Social Security contributions in the stock market. "Every one of those survivors will receive Social Security survivor benefits, and there's absolutely no uncertainty to it. Whereas if we were dependent on the stock market -- the stock market, as you know, is crashing right now."
Alan Brinkley, a professor of American history at Columbia University, said it was too early to tell if a shift in public attitudes would last. But it is significant, he said, that the survivors and displaced workers are now the vanguard of a much larger population facing hard times.
"It's going to be hard to disentangle the results of the attack from the results of what seems to be the beginning of a recession," Mr. Brinkley said. "There's going to be a lot of new distress that will not have old welfare systems to fall back on." 
He added that "the image of both public and private agencies helping people in distress has been such an important part of this experience, it's quite possible that the vision of assistance is going to improve." 
Certainly the reality of assistance improved markedly for Ms. De Pena as soon as she entered the family center, said Ms. Valentin, who works for REAP, a program affiliated with Mount Sinai Hospital that helps people obtain benefits. 
Ms. De Pena's financial needs were urgent: rent on the family's temporary room in the Bronx, moving costs and day-to-day expenses like food and diapers that Mr. De Pena met from paycheck to paycheck. Knowing that an application for public assistance could take a month to process, and that Social Security survivor benefits of $1,082 a month would not come through for at least 10 days, Ms. Valentin said, she called the Red Cross last week. She made it clear, she added, that the family's only wage-earner was missing in the twin towers attack.
"The Red Cross said call the Salvation Army, and from there they said call FEMA. I was very upset," Ms. Valentin recalled. "I said, 'They're asking for all these donations, but nobody is giving her the assistance that she needs.' "
But at the family center on a pier opposite West 54th Street, everything changed. Red Cross workers quickly gave Ms. De Pena vouchers worth $75 for groceries and $25 for diapers. The Immigration and Naturalization Service assured Ms. De Pena, who joined her husband from the Dominican Republic last March, that she was still in line for the green card he had sponsored. A staff member for Safe Horizon, a nonprofit agency under contract to the state's Crime Victims Board, steered her through paperwork. A volunteer even coaxed Ms. De Pena, who speaks no English, into accepting a massage.
The next day, she was handed a check for $1,050 from the Crime Victims Board. "I feel protected," she said in Spanish, noting her pregnancy with one hand tracing the outline of her belly.
Such checks went to eligible bond traders and mail clerks alike, and cash assistance from relief funds has become even more readily available this week. The Red Cross, for instance, has announced that the families of those reported dead or missing in the disaster can collect immediate grants of as much as $30,000. 
It is an axiom of social welfare policy that benefits that go to all income groups are always more generous than those aimed at the poor.
That may help explain why the response to Ms. De Pena's plight depended on the World Trade Center disaster, though her need would be the same if her husband had been killed in a car accident, said Penny Schwartz, director of REAP, short for the Resource, Entitlement and Advocacy Program.
"We were all in the disaster," Dr. Schwartz said. "We have private troubles all the time, but now it's become a public issue."
That sense of common vulnerability may not extend to those defined as somehow less deserving. 
"I don't think that attitudes about welfare dependency would necessarily be affected by the World Trade Center disaster." said June E. O'Neill, a conservative economist whose welfare research has been published by the Manhattan Institute.
In fact, it would be hard to find a starker contrast between the hospitality of the Pier 94 family center and the longstanding efforts by the Giuliani administration to discourage applications for public aid and shelter. 
Marc Cohan, director of litigation for the Welfare Law Center, a national advocacy group based in New York, said he would like to believe that the World Trade Center could be a turning point in public compassion. Instead, he said, "I fear that when the bill for cleaning up the disaster and coping with the economic repercussions comes due, the various levels of government will turn to cuts for the poor as the tried-and-true method for balancing the budget."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares End Slightly Higher After a Day of Fluctuation

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stocks eked out modest gains after a directionless day yesterday, as Wall Street paused after last week's market plunge and Monday's surge.
 Investors continued to have trouble evaluating the economic and corporate prospects in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon two weeks ago, and their difficulty was evident in stock prices. The major market gauges swung up and down throughout the day. 
 The steep losses last week, which led to the worst weekly decline in the Dow Jones industrial average since the Depression, were to be expected. The bounce-back rally on Monday was easy for analysts to explain. After the big swings, though, there was just confusion. 
"You still have a very emotionally charged market," said Jon Brorson, director of equities for Northern Trust, a money management concern. "I've been on both sides of the coin today. I've been on the buy side and the sell side. I don't have a lot of conviction."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.11 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 8,659.97. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 2.24 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,501.64, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 8.82 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,012.27.
Shortly after trading began, the Conference Board, a research group in New York, said consumer confidence fell sharply in September -- to a level far below the published predictions of Wall Street economists. But analysts said investors had most likely expected the drop in confidence to be even worse.
But corporations began to provide some signs of hope. Coca-Cola tempered its volume growth predictions but suggested it would meet its profit goal for the year.
Douglas N. Daft, the chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, said that worldwide unit case volume for Coke sales would grow 4 percent to 5 percent this year instead of 5 percent to 6 percent. Profits should still meet Wall Street's expectations, the company said. But Mr. Daft surprised some analysts by saying that the reason for the overall decline in sales growth was slowing growth in the United States, which he said had taken place since the attacks. Soft drinks are not typically considered to be sensitive to economic weakness. 
After rising early on, shares of Coca-Cola ended down 3 cents, to $48.
The dollar fell against the euro. The euro settled at 92.25 cents, up from 91.66 cents on Monday. The dollar was nearly unchanged against the Japanese yen, falling to 117.60 yen from 117.57. The dollar has declined 2.7 percent against the euro since the attacks and has fallen 2.9 percent against the yen.
Among the 30 Dow components, telecommunications companies did well. AT&T gained 94 cents, to $17.95, while SBC Communications climbed $2.09, to $47.15.
AOL Time Warner edged up 30 cents, to $32.80. Late Monday, the media company said it would miss its financial goals for the year by a wide margin, largely because the terrorist attacks would add to the deterioration of the advertising market.
Johnson & Johnson gained 53 cents, to $52.94, while Merck, its pharmaceutical rival, fell $1.54, to $62.45.
Mr. Brorson of Northern Trust said that his firm had raised the levels of cash in its mutual fund portfolios slightly, to just under 10 percent, in anticipation of redemptions. But those never came.
In the bond market, trading was light, and investors were focused on comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary who was once a top Goldman Sachs executive and now is co-chairman of Citigroup. They advised Congress not to pursue two of the leading Republican ideas for reinvigorating the economy, cutting the capital gains tax and reducing corporate income tax rates, people involved in the discussions said.
Gemma Wright, director of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York, said that investors in long-term bonds reacted negatively to the notion that the United States might quickly pump money into the economy.
Prices of Treasury securities showed little change. The price of the 10-year note rose 4/32, to 102 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.70 percent from 4.71 percent.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 3/32 to 97 4/32, while its yield was unchanged at 5.57 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 4-week bills and Monday's auction of 3-month and 6-month bills:

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE SITE; 
Architects, Planners and Residents Wonder How to Fill the Hole in the City

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON and CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The destruction of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 cut a huge hole in the fabric of New York City. But already, even as the grief and mourning go on, the city's wound is becoming a kind of repository of ideas about what the site, and the city around it, should become.
 Proposals range from the grandiose and ambitious to the small and intimate. Some business leaders argue for a crash-course construction project that would replace lost office space for corporations displaced by the disaster. Others say rebuilding at the trade center site must be sensitive, above all else, to the human losses, with a memorial incorporated as part of the very essence of the design. 
But there is nearly universal agreement among people in fields as diverse as economics, urban planning, security and ethics that New York is about to encounter a question that few great cities have ever faced: What is to be done with an immensely valuable piece of land that is crucial to the local economy, but which has also become hugely important -- indeed almost spiritual -- to people in New York and around the world? 
One idea put forward in recent days would make the trade center site a new home for that ultimate Wall Street symbol, the New York Stock Exchange, a home that could also include the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Another developer has proposed a ring of 50-story towers. Urban planners and economic development experts say that improving transportation to downtown, by adding rail connections, should be a priority.
But for now, every idea is just that -- words and arguments. The architects, planners, builders and corporate executives who have put out proposals have done so almost into thin air. No process exists yet to act on any because the machinery to begin even sorting through the ideas has yet to be built, and state and city officials have differing notions of how much control each will bring to bear on what is conceived, and then built.
But the framework for that process -- the different sorts of intellectual and emotional components that will be involved in rebuilding at the site -- are coming into place, development experts say. And here, too, the questions are many and difficult.
Is the World Trade Center site still purely a place of trade and business, as that part of Manhattan has been since the 1600's, or does it now belong, in a way, to the world -- or to the families of the victims in the disaster -- with new obligations about what happens there? How should New York, in thinking about what is to come, weigh the needs of its businesses and residents alongside the global statement that redevelopment will make about New York in the 21st century?
Underlying all those questions is one that millions of people are also asking themselves: What kind of city is New York now, in the aftermath of the attacks?
"We're going to have to invent something entirely new here, and it's going to mean rethinking the ways we use the city," said Richard Sennett, a sociologist and Manhattan resident who is also the chairman of the Cities Program, an urban design program at the London School of Economics.
The still-evolving ideas about the trade center range from the immediate and concrete to the long-term and conceptual. One plan being pushed by the former president of the State Urban Development Corporation, Richard A. Kahan, would combine a new home for the New York Stock Exchange with a major cultural element, perhaps a big part of the Guggenheim Museum. The combination, he argues, would acknowledge and capture the broader place that downtown has become.
Professor Sennett and others say that a memorial to the victims must be the first element on the drawing board, and that the commercial use should then be adapted to that vision. The transformed human meaning of the World Trade Center site, they say, has become the driving force.
Some people are arguing for an international design competition that would produce something emblematic of a global city. Others favor an emphasis on local ideas to embody New York at its most distinctive.
In order to get going on the rethinking and rebuilding, some have called for the creation of a powerful new government agency led by the state that could cut through the ordinary approvals system and expedite the redevelopment; others contend that the wounds of the disaster are so deep that a broad conceptual effort giving a say to city residents and the families of victims, even if it slows down the rebuilding process, must be a priority.
Most experts on the downtown economy agree that simply replacing lost office space with new buildings would be a pallid response to the disaster, and that the opportunity must be seized to rethink the city's needs, from transportation to new work and life patterns, modern telecommunications and, of course, the threat of global terrorism.
The trade towers, they say, were conceived in the 1960's in an era of moon shots and urban renewal. The city has moved on.
"This tragedy has given us an opportunity to rethink and rebuild all of Lower Manhattan," said John E. Zuccotti, a former city planning chairman and deputy mayor who heads the company that owns the World Financial Center near the trade center site. But it will take, he added, "political leadership, compromise, planning and public-private cooperation at a pace unprecedented in the history of the city and state."
One major element of that rethinking centers on Lower Manhattan's transportation needs.
Many developers, for example, are arguing for a new rail link as part of the redevelopment, one that would allow Long Island Rail Road commuters to come all the way into Lower Manhattan. Other transportation proposals include an extension of the PATH train system from New Jersey so that it could connect with the No. 4 and 5 lines of the New York City subway at Fulton Street, and an extension of the No. 7 subway line from 42nd Street farther south to 31st Street or beyond to encourage the development of Manhattan's West Side north of the trade center.
Many planners and developers also say that Battery Park City, which has given Lower Manhattan a residential element it did not have 30 years ago when the trade towers were built, should be incorporated into a new design. One proposal includes taking a stretch of West Street, a busy thoroughfare that now separates Battery Park from the trade center site, and putting it underground, creating a kind of mall effect that would give the new site a great human accessibility.
A major question still to be settled in all of this is whether the money to rebuild will match the ambition. Although $20 billion in federal money has been pledged to aid the cleanup and rebuilding, it is unclear how far that will go, or how expensive transportation or other improvements in the area would be paid for.
Another issue is just how fast the city has to go in rebuilding. The impetus to plan well and make the redevelopment a kind of rebirth for the city would take time, but many economists and business leaders say that the need to quickly and firmly articulate a vision is also great because it would send a strong signal to corporations that New York's energy and momentum had not been lost.
"The tension is between doing something quickly and doing it well," said Robert D. Yaro, the executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit economic and land-use planning group in Manhattan. "This space, almost regardless of what we do, will become a pilgrimage site. It cannot be just a standard-issue commercial real estate deal or we will not be living up to the expectations of the world."
Whether New York, where entrenched battles over development projects are the norm, is even capable of the kind of compromise and cooperation necessary for fast decision-making at the trade center site is another question.
Mr. Zuccotti at the World Financial Center has said as part of his proposal, for example, that the glass-roofed Winter Garden atrium at Battery Park City could perhaps become part of a new transportation hub where train lines would connect, something like the old Pennsylvania Station in Midtown.
The chairman of the Battery Park City Authority, James F. Gill, promptly said he would oppose any such idea.
"The Winter Garden is one of the crown jewels of Battery Park City," he said. "It is a breathtaking structure and I wouldn't want to see it turned into a subway station."
What kind of memorial is appropriate for the site is also likely to provoke a major civic debate even without taking into account the real estate interests, and here, too, specialists in urban design and architecture have been free with their ideas.
Some have suggested leaving part of the tower wreckage in place, the way some cities in Europe did after World War II. A cathedral in Lubeck, Germany, for example, was rebuilt as it had been before its destruction, but for one thing: the cathedral bells that had crashed down from the belfry were left where they lay, partly embedded in the ground.
New York might also face a variation on the kind of debate experienced in Lisbon in the mid-1700's after an earthquake destroyed much of the city. A statue of the king on his horse was to be built, and opinion raged about which way the statue should face: inward to the new triumphal arch of the city's reconstruction, or outward toward the Portuguese empire. The king and his horse today look out and away from the arch.
"That's a real question for New York," said John R. Mullin, a professor of urban planning at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. "Whether the new design looks in or looks out: Will it be something for New Yorkers or something for New York's symbolism in the world?"
Professor Mullin says his own view is that because the trade center site is already so invested with meaning, almost anything New York does will become a new icon no matter what, and that leads him to support a memorial and a design that distinctively reflects the New York experience. 
Unlike the days in the 1960's when the trade towers were conceived, he said, New York's role as a pre-eminent world capital is secure, and so the city doesn't have to proclaim itself with towers to the sky as it did then. It can whisper, he said, and the world will still listen.

Not a Fuels Errand

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
As the shock of Sept. 11 has faded, we've started to hear a few old slogans. A handful of people on the left claim that we are about to start a "war for oil." A considerably larger and more influential group on the right seems, oddly enough, to agree, though these people draw a different policy conclusion: that the terrorist attack means we should drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
 But this is not a war on behalf of the oil companies; it's not even a war on behalf of S.U.V.'s and McMansions. 
 It's true that oil is part of the backstory to the terrorist attack. Apparently the greatest single motivating factor for the terrorists was not, as you might suppose, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; it was the continuing presence of American soldiers in Saudi Arabia. That presence is a legacy of the gulf war. And while the gulf war did involve defending a small nation against aggression, we probably wouldn't have waged that war, or maintained a permanent military presence in the region, if it weren't for the oil. 
But when people suggest that this is in some sense a war for oil, what they are in effect arguing is that by doing something different -- drilling for oil in more national parks, driving more fuel-efficient cars, whatever -- we could have avoided putting ourselves in this position. So the question we should ask is whether there are any energy policy proposals on the table that would remove this flashpoint -- that is, make it a matter of no great concern to the United States who controls the oilfields of the Persian Gulf. And the answer is a clear no.
Drilling in Alaska would make no difference worth mentioning. Right now the United States produces less than half the petroleum it consumes, making us highly vulnerable to disruptions in world oil markets. At its peak, the wildlife refuge would supply only about 5 percent of our consumption. So with it we would depend on imports for 45 percent of our needs instead of 50 percent. Somehow, that doesn't sound like an impressive reduction in vulnerability.
Strong efforts at conservation, which could reduce U.S. per capita oil use to European levels, would make us roughly self-sufficient. But even so, the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf would be only minimally reduced. The reason is that even if the U.S. became self-sufficient, our allies in Europe, Japan and elsewhere would still be highly dependent on imported oil -- this despite the fact that they use much less oil per person than we do. And if this crisis has taught us one lesson, it is that the United States cannot go it alone; we need to protect not just our own interests but also those of our allies. 
So the bottom line is that as long as oil is important to modern economies, the Persian Gulf will remain strategically crucial. This presumably means that the West will have to maintain a military presence in the region, with all the tensions that creates. And I haven't heard any proposals, whether they involve increasing domestic oil production or reducing oil consumption, that would make a difference to that bottom line.
In fact, reduced oil dependence, by putting downward pressure on oil prices, could actually be destabilizing. A quick, unfair summary of the political analyses of the gulf region I've read over the last few days is that oil revenues, which allow the Saudi monarchy to buy off potential opposition, are pretty much the only thing that keeps Saudi Arabia from turning into another Afghanistan. Even before the terrorist attack the Saudi system was looking wobbly, with persistent deficits, mounting debt and growing unemployment. Lower oil prices will only make that situation worse.
So what is the answer? For the present and for some years to come there is no way to escape the awkward reality that the oil reserves of the Middle East are crucial to the world economy. If that dependence is ever to end, we will have to do more than drill in a few more wilderness areas, and it won't even be enough to drive more fuel-efficient cars. We'll have to find a way, through some combination of technological innovation and radical policies, to wean not just the United States but the world economy as a whole from its dependence on oil.

Arafat and Peres Meeting Is Set After Many Delays
Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, agreed to meet this morning at the Gaza airport. The meeting will be the first high-level talks since July intended to reach a truce in the Mideast conflict, but there was still a danger that a burst of fresh violence could cancel the meeting. A10

Students toned down an exhibit at Al Najah University in the West Bank that celebrates a suicide bombing and has outraged Israelis since it opened on Sunday. The exhibit includes a mock-up of the suicide bombing at a Sbarro restaurant in Jerusalem where 15 people were killed in August. Mr. Arafat said that he was "gravely disturbed and offended by the images in the exhibit," and that he had ordered it closed. A10

Struggle to Raise Sub
An international team of divers was continuing preparations to lift the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, while a barge to hoist it to the surface was waiting out a storm near the Barents Sea coast. The Kursk exploded and sank in the Barents Sea in August 2000, killing its entire crew of 118. Russian officials want to raise the submarine to eliminate any potential threat to the environment from its twin nuclear reactors and to try to solve the mystery of its sinking. Officials said they hoped it would be lifted Saturday. A8

HEADLINE: Poverty Rates Fell in 2000, But Income Was Stagnant 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
New economic statistics show that poverty in the United States declined in 2000, with the poverty rates of blacks and female heads of households the lowest on record. At the same time, median income has leveled off after years of growth.
 The new figures, released today by the Census Bureau, showed that the median household income in 2000 was $42,148, adjusted for inflation -- a shade off the record high reached in 1999 ($42,187 in 2000 dollars). Only the Northeast showed a statistical gain in income, up 3.9 percent to $45,106. 
 Median household income among Hispanics and blacks set records ($33,447 for Hispanics, $30,439 for blacks), with the income of blacks rising $1,600 from 1999. The median income for blacks was $15,000 lower than the median income for whites.
"This shows the continuing remarkable success of welfare reform," said Robert Rector, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. "There's been a dramatic drop in dependence."
The figures showed that the number of people in poverty had dropped, to 31.1 million in 2000 from 32.3 million in 1999. For a family of four, an annual income below $17,603 qualified them as impoverished; for one person, the poverty line was $8,794.
The poverty rate fell as well, for the fourth consecutive year, from 11.8 percent in 1999 to 11.3 percent in 2000, the lowest since 1979 and about the same as the lowest poverty rate ever recorded (11.1 percent in 1973).
However, analysts say, the average poor person fell further below the poverty line in 1999 and 2000 than in any other year since record-keeping began in 1979. They attributed the drop to cuts in food stamps and cash-assistance programs and to declining participation in those programs.
The figures are based on a survey of 50,000 households in 2000 and do not reflect the recent rise in unemployment or other indicators that the economy was softening in the months before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
"The economy was clearly weakening before Sept. 11, and that added another swift kick," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. 
"It's too early to know if this is a mild, short-lasting downturn or whether the positive period of the '90s has ended and the downturn will be deeper and the rate of growth slower," Mr. Greenstein said.
He said it could take years to recover to the highs of 1999 and 2000. After the earlier peak prosperity year of 1989, poverty was never as low again until 1998 and income was never as high until 1996.
Mr. Greenstein and other analysts were puzzled about why the median income in 2000 remained unchanged from 1999, given low unemployment.
"I was surprised, frankly, that household income was stagnant in 2000," said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group. "So many other indicators were positive, one would have expected middle-income families to get their share of the growth, but that didn't happen."
Not only did income remain stagnant, but the earnings of men who worked full time dropped by a full percentage point, to $37,339 in 2000, the first time in four years that men experienced a decline.
The earnings of women were statistically unchanged, at $27,355. Women earned 73 cents to each dollar earned by men.
The household incomes of Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders continued to be higher than those of other Americans, as they have since this group's income began being recorded by the Census Bureau in 1987, although they showed no significant increase in 2000 over 1999. Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders had an average median income in 2000 of $55,521, compared with $45,904 for non-Hispanic whites (this is the only category that does not include Hispanics), $44,226 for whites, $33,447 for Hispanics and $30,439 for blacks.
Analysts said that most gains in income had been among high-income households and that the income gap between high-income earners and lower-income earners remained at a post-World War II high.
"We still have an economy with very impressive opportunities for those at the top and not for those at the bottom," Mr. Bernstein said. "Yes, low-income families are working more and may have crossed the poverty line, but they are still near-poor. We have structural imbalances in our economy leading to ever-higher levels of inequality, and this boom hasn't cured that problem."

HEADLINE: Senate Backs Plan to Close Military Bases In 53-47 Vote 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
The Senate narrowly endorsed another round of military base closings today, overcoming opponents who argued that because of the uncertainty of terrorist threats, this was no time to cut back defenses.
 Backed by a majority of Democrats, the Bush administration won a 53-to-47 vote to establish a new commission to call for base closings and transfers of military units to save money. 
 The measure is part of the $343 billion military authorization bill, and because the companion House bill has no such provision, the issue will have to be settled in a House-Senate conference. 
The House passed its version of the defense bill tonight on a 398-to-17 vote after diverting some money from missile defense to counterterrorism. 
Under the base-closing procedure, which has been used several times in recent years, a commission proposes closings and Congress votes up or down on the entire package without amendments. 
Thirty-one Democrats, including Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, 21 Republicans and one independent backed the provision. Twenty-eight Republicans, including Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority leader, and 19 Democrats opposed it. 
Although no senator mentioned the bases in his or her state by name, many of the 47 senators who opposed the plan have major installations in their states. Senator Jim Bunning, a Republican whose state, Kentucky, is the home of two major Army bases, Fort Knox and Fort Campbell, said, "None of us know for certain that we need to downsize our military structure under these extraordinary circumstances." 
The new homeland security cabinet office, Mr. Bunning said, "may decide that they need these bases to keep our homeland secure."
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat whose state has Air Force bases at Minot and Grand Forks, argued that establishing a new base-closing commission, even though it would not act before 2003, would "stunt the economic growth" of any community with a military installation. 
But Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who leads the Armed Services Committee and who voted to set up the commission, said it was "imperative to convert excess capacity into war-fighting capacity."
Michigan is a major military contracting state but does not have significant bases. 
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, argued, "There is not a single military expert in this country of any credibility that doesn't believe that we need a base-closing round." And Mr. McCain voted for the commission.
Arizona has Fort Huachuca, an intelligence and testing center, and two major air force bases.
In midafternoon, the Senate quickly passed a stopgap spending measure that will allow the federal government to continue to operate through Oct. 16, while Congress struggles to complete action on the appropriations bills that are supposed to be completed by Sunday. The House passed the stopgap bill on Monday, so the Senate action will send it to President Bush for his signature.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "Rebuilding Downtown" (editorial, Sept. 24), you call for New York City's elected leaders and the best minds in the financial and architectural communities to seize the moment and make the financial district more vibrant than it was before Sept. 11. But you leave out an important participant: higher education. 
 The city's colleges and universities have been and will continue to be essential if New York is to maintain its place as the world's capital.
The education of today's and tomorrow's work force and general citizenry, as well as the value added from the world-class research undertaken in the city, has earned higher education a place at the table whenever serious thought is given to the city's or the financial district's future.

HEADLINE: For Displaced Companies, Details on City Aid Are Few 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, one of the larger tenants of the World Trade Center, is simultaneously trying to find temporary space for 1,900 workers and a permanent home, in a matter of weeks.
 The decision-making process is complicated not just by the speed with which it is being conducted, but also by the confusion surrounding what tax breaks and other subsidies are available from the city for Blue Cross and others displaced by the destruction of the trade center, inducements that companies routinely seek in making real estate decisions. 
 Two weeks after it began negotiating with the city over building a new tower in Brooklyn, Empire Blue Cross is still not sure what subsidies it can expect, said real estate executives, who fear that the insurance company may soon decide to move some employees permanently to its offices in Melville, on Long Island.
City officials, they said, are also worried that every other company will want the same tax breaks and other incentives Empire Blue Cross gets, or more. 
The situation is complicated by the fact that even before the attacks, the city faced a projected $3 billion budget gap next year and contract negotiations with municipal employees. Budget analysts are now more concerned than ever that tax revenues from Wall Street will slow to a trickle, worsening the city's fiscal woes.
In lieu of a clear municipal policy, some corporate executives have complained that they have not even received a telephone call from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani or his top deputies imploring them to stay put until the city learns whether there is state or federal money available for displaced companies. "We've had a couple of corporate executives, people responsible for locating businesses, indicating that there's no reaching out," said City Councilman Herbert E. Berman of Brooklyn.
Michael Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which has been negotiating with Empire Blue Cross, said the city had been working in recent days with state and federal officials on some kind of incentive package.
"We are looking at what kind of relief we can offer across the board to companies that were displaced," Mr. Carey said. "Ultimately, it'll be on a case-by-case basis, pursuant to a standard formula."
Mr. Carey said that some tax breaks are available to Empire Blue Cross and other companies that move to Brooklyn or Queens, although they fall short of what the companies are seeking. 
According to TenantWise.com, a real estate company, the top 30 tenants at the World Trade Center have already moved thousands of employees from Lower Manhattan to Midtown, New Jersey or Connecticut. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and others have said they are committed to remaining in New York. But city officials, real estate brokers and landlords wonder how many of those employees will return.
Empire Blue Cross has temporarily moved its headquarters into space it has in Melville. Dr. Michael Stocker, chief executive of Empire Blue Cross, said that the company was looking at temporary space in Brooklyn and New Jersey, while it decided exactly where it would locate permanently. He said the company was considering whether to become an anchor tenant in a new 700,000-square-foot tower at Metrotech, in downtown Brooklyn.
Empire Blue Cross would take about 300,000 square feet in the tower and lease space for a headquarters in Manhattan, Mr. Stocker said. The company is also considering taking space at 450 West 33rd Street, at Tenth Avenue in Manhattan, although the rent would be a good deal higher than in Brooklyn.
Empire decided to sell its building on Third Avenue in 1997 and moved in 1998 to the World Trade Center. Its annual rent was less than $25 a square foot, negotiated just before the downtown rents soared.
Empire Blue Cross, like many of the other companies in the twin towers, is competing for office space in Midtown, where rents are $45 a square foot or more, for the little that is available. According to real estate executives, the developer at Metrotech, Forest City Ratner Companies, could build a new tower for about $40 per square foot. Bruce Ratner, the chief executive of Forest City Ratner, did not return calls requesting comment.
Dr. Stocker would not discuss his negotiations with the city, but according to executives who have been briefed on the meetings, city officials initially expressed a willingness to provide a package of tax breaks worth about $4.5 million a year. But as the magnitude of the destruction downtown became more apparent, they said, city officials became less clear about what could be done. 
"Our assumption is that benefits related to the Sept. 11 attack would go to people who stay in New York City, not just in Manhattan," Dr. Stocker said. "We need space right away. We can't wait for a decision about the subsidies."
One city official said: "There's a lot of pressure to provide discretionary benefits. Hey, we're broke."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE UNEMPLOYED; 
Disaster's Aftershocks: Number of Workers Out of a Job Is Rising

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN and LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
More than 100,000 New York City workers are likely to find themselves unemployed, at least temporarily, as a result of the World Trade Center disaster, according to government estimates released yesterday. 
 Already, 10,800 people who have asked the New York State Department of Labor for unemployment assistance have attributed their situation to the terrorist attack on the twin towers and its fallout throughout the economy. 
 Some of the people who are out of a job -- janitors, hotel cashiers, store clerks -- worked in or near the towers. Many more -- waiters, limousine drivers, flight attendants -- worked far from ground zero but are economic victims of the aftershocks like the steep drop in tourism. 
And the fate of many in other occupations -- printing, securities, the garment industry -- will depend on the stock market and on how quickly the city's economy rebounds, economists and labor analysts said.
Even before the disaster, the city's economy, once red-hot, had cooled significantly. In August, New York City companies employed 8,200 fewer people than in July, according to the city comptroller's office, which said it was the steepest monthly decline in five years. The unemployment rate jumped to 5.8 percent in August; it was 5.0 percent the month before. 
"In all likelihood, the city was showing signs of recession before this happened," said Barbara Byrne Denham, a private economist.
But the disaster will add significantly to the ranks of the unemployed. About 75,000 people who worked in the city are likely to apply for unemployment insurance because of the disaster, Emily S. De Rocco, an assistant secretary of labor, said yesterday at a news conference in Washington.
An additional 37,500 are expected to receive special unemployment benefits under the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program that will be available to those who worked in the five boroughs of New York City and are not eligible for regular unemployment insurance payments. 
In total, about 700,000 of the almost four million jobs in the city have been affected in some way by the devastation at ground zero, said Stuart Roy, a Department of Labor spokesman.
Not only have many people lost their jobs, but companies that continue to operate have also lost everything from phone service to a week's revenues. People who are paid on commission lost income, while some people simply could not get to work because of transportation problems.
The new unemployment figures are based on estimates from the New York State Department of Labor, which tried to forecast how much federal aid the city might need. The state's unemployment insurance fund has more than a billion dollars in it, and it can draw upon federal help should that become necessary, Mr. Roy said.
People who qualify for unemployment insurance are eligible for as much as $405 a week for up to six months. Those who are not eligible for unemployment insurance -- because, for example, they are self-employed -- can apply for the disaster unemployment assistance program, which provides the same amount of money. A family in which the breadwinner has died because of the disaster may also be eligible; all benefits are awarded on a case-by-case basis.
Of course, some workers will find themselves in demand in the coming months. Construction workers, for example, are very likely to be in short supply. Demand for security guards also appears to be rising.
But many New Yorkers worked at places that no longer exist, in jobs that no longer exist. 
Among them are 2,000 janitors, security guards, porters and window cleaners who worked in the World Trade Center or in surrounding buildings that were destroyed or shut down. Of these, 350 were on duty during the attack, and 26 died.
Their union said many of these survivors may be able to find work eventually. Last week, the union, the Building Service Workers Local 32BJ, reached an agreement that requires contractors to give these workers first choice when new jobs become open.
"There's a strong possibility of absorbing all of these people in the next few months," said Bill Meyerson, a union spokesman.
Worse off, perhaps, were about 1,000 people who worked in the four hotels in and around ground zero. Their prospects of finding new jobs are dim, because even before the attack, the hotel business was already reeling from a decline in business travel.
Since Sept. 11, of course, tourism has taken a nose dive. About 600 members of Local 6 of the Hotel and Restaurant Workers were laid off before the attacks, and 1,200 more have been let go since, said John Turchiano, a union spokesman.
Until Sept. 11, Daniel Mensah, 35, was holding down two jobs and sending money home to Ghana for his wife and three children. At night, he waxed and stripped floors and shampooed carpets at the Millennium Hilton, next to the trade center. During the day, he mopped and swept at the Muse Hotel in Midtown.
Last week, he said, Muse employees were warned to expect layoffs, prompting Mr. Mensah's wife to urge him to move to another state. But he said he chose to stay and take his chances. "My feeling for New York is too great," he said.
Expecting a long dry spell, the union local and the Hotel Trades Council have set aside $2 million in relief for the displaced workers and have assured workers that they will get medical coverage for a year. And the hotels have pledged to spend $5 million to help workers laid off.
Restaurants that rely heavily on tourists or are in or near the financial district, beyond the reach of taxis and private cars, are also cutting back on staff. At City Hall, the name of a three-year-old restaurant on Duane Street, Henry Archer Meer, the chef and owner, said he had reduced his staff of 115 employees by 25, and was doing without 15 of his 22 waiters by operating one shift instead of two.
The tourism drought has also hurt companies that transport people to airports. "The day they destroyed the World Trade Center, they destroyed our business," said Steven P. Ellis, the sales director of XYZ 2-Way Radio Service, a car service based in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
XYZ drivers are independent contractors, who own their Lincoln Town Cars. Mr. Ellis said at least 25 of the 425 drivers had decided to search for other work.
But they are lucky compared to people like Inocencio Tecalero, 18, who worked as a deliveryman for Candy's, a restaurant in the financial district that will be closed for months. Mr. Tecalero, who earned $8 a hour, is the sole support of his seven brothers and sisters in Mexico.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Runs, Hits and Healing at Stadium

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
The fans knew it was supposed to be business as usual last night. But there were more than a few things that just did not feel quite right to them.
 Rick Fortune remarked to his co-worker at MetLife that the crowd at this game, the first Yankees home game since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, seemed sparser than it should have been 30 minutes before the opening ceremonies. Patrick Maly, Fortune's co-worker, pointed out the police officers roaming the highest tiers of Yankee Stadium, something he never noticed in previous regular-season games. Then there were the gray storm clouds, which reminded the two men of billowing smoke. 
 And the video display flashed a picture of the Manhattan skyline, complete with the World Trade Center towers.
"Look, there's fireworks going on behind that," Fortune, 41, said of the video segment. "I don't know if that's politically correct. They've got to do something about that."
But for all the slightly off-kilter things the two men noticed, they still agreed on one thing. "We're just happy that baseball is starting up again," Maly said. "Everybody's a little depressed."
It was a sentiment that was voiced yesterday by the flag-waving fans throughout Yankee Stadium in the hour before the game. Sure, they had come for the spiritual succor. They had come for the sense of community. But deep, deep in their hearts, they had come with hopes of seeing their home team trounce the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in a game where 21 could prove to be the magic number for Roger Clemens and the Yankees, who needed one victory to walk away with the American League East title.
"I don't know what is better -- Clemens going for his 21st win, the Yankees clinching the division or just being here on this special night," Robert Glew, 35, of Rye, N.Y., said. "I wonder if I'll be able to hold myself together."
On Sunday, the Stadium was the site of a somber memorial in which clerics from different religions -- and people like former President Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey -- tried to provide public comfort.
The mourning was far from over, but the healing took a different form last night.
"A lot of people like to go to church to feel together with the city, with different people," said Richard G. Cirino, 49, a Manhattan public school teacher. "I get that same feeling here at Yankee Stadium, and I expect that feeling today."
Laura Prichard, a lifelong Yankees fan, drove more than two hours with her neighbors from Walden, N.Y., to attend her first game at the Stadium this season.
"We hadn't been to a game all year, and we felt it was important to come and show our support to the economy," she said. "But more importantly, it'll show to Americans that we can come out to a gathering like this and not be afraid."
Her neighbor, Anne Pompeo, sauntered up with a hot dog for her 12-year-old son, Stephen.
"I don't have any problem with coming," she said. "I think more people should come to New York to support this. The more people who get out, the better for the economy."
Several rows away, one fan was thinking more about the record books than about matters of commerce.
"I'm just happy to watch the Yankees play," said Anthony Fonseco Jr., 18, of the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. Referring to the fact that Clemens was pitching, he added: "I'm going to watch history. I want to get emotions out, to scream and cheer and stuff like that. And I get to express it through the Yankees."

HEADLINE: Antiunion Measure Passes in Oklahoma 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Oklahoma voters today approved a measure that makes the state the 22nd to ban labor contracts requiring workers to pay union dues.
 With 98 percent of the vote counted, the measure was ahead with support from 54 percent of the voters. 
 "I am excited for Oklahoma," said Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican who supported the measure. "This is the first step in the liberation of Oklahoma's economy."
Jimmy Curry, head of the Oklahoma A.F.L.-C.I.O. and an opponent of the measure, said the labor movement would "back up and regroup." 
The vote came after the most expensive election campaign in state history, pitting business and labor interests in a rematch of a battle 37 years ago over the issue. Unions won the battle in 1964 by fewer than 25,000 votes. Until today, no state had passed such a measure since 1986.
Supporters argued that Oklahoma was losing jobs because companies shied from states without such laws, and that workers should be allowed to choose whether they wanted to support a union.
Opponents said requiring all workers to pay dues was fair because federal law mandates that unions represent all workers in a union shop, including nonmembers.
Less than 9 percent of Oklahoma workers are in jobs covered by union contracts.

HEADLINE: THE NEW YORK PRIMARY: THE CITY COMPTROLLER; 
With Berman Set to Concede, Thompson Seems to Be Victor

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
William C. Thompson Jr. appeared to have won the Democratic primary for city comptroller last night, edging out Herbert E. Berman in a tight and hard-fought race. 
 Although only a small percentage of electoral districts were reporting unofficial results late last night, Mr. Berman's staff conceded that his bid had failed, and said he had tried to call Mr. Thompson. 
 Mr. Thompson said that official results would not be available until today, but added, "It looks really good."
In a statement, Mr. Berman said: "We ran a great race. The focus now must be on the future and on rebuilding New York." The winner of the Democratic primary is almost certain to become comptroller because there will be no serious competition in November; no Republican is seeking the office.
The campaign ended with a last-minute push by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who recorded a message urging New Yorkers to vote for Mr. Berman, a longtime city councilman. The messages were delivered by telephone on Monday to about a quarter-million households, said Carolyn Daly, a spokeswoman for the Berman campaign.
The comptroller is likely to assume an increasingly important role in the city government, which is being buffeted fiscally by the weakening economy and the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster.
"The comptroller has an important role in issuing debt, which is going to be very important as we raise capital as we rebuild the city" said Charles Brecher, the research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a civic watchdog group. The comptroller also scrutinizes contracts, audits programs and manages pension funds.
Still, the candidates had trouble attracting voters' attention, and their contest became one of the season's most acrimonious.
Mr. Berman unleashed negative television advertisements and mailings criticizing Mr. Thompson's moral fitness for the job; Mr. Thompson responded with an advertisement suggesting that Mr. Berman is in the pocket of real estate developers.
Mr. Berman contended that Mr. Thompson, the former president of the Board of Education, turned a blind eye to problems with the school construction program, which is billions of dollars over budget. Mr. Thompson said that Mr. Berman, as chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, was also responsible for overseeing the program.
On the issues, there was little to differentiate the two men. Both said think the city should have a prudent budget, for example. And both vowed to invest pension-fund dollars in housing programs.
Mr. Thompson, who is black, was endorsed by many black leaders, including former Mayor David N. Dinkins and the Rev. Al Sharpton. A big majority of black voters -- about 80 percent -- supported Mr. Thompson in the primary, according to voter surveys conducted by Edison Media Research. A smaller percentage of white voters favored him.
Mr. Berman was endorsed by many city officials who had worked with him over the years, including former Mayor Edward I. Koch and Harrison J. Goldin, the former city comptroller. Mayoral voters who backed Peter F. Vallone, the City Council president, were also likely to choose Mr. Berman, according to the voter survey.

HEADLINE: THE NEW YORK PRIMARY: NASSAU COUNTY; 
Democrats In Nassau Nominate An Outsider

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER and ELISSA GOOTMAN

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., Sept. 25 

 BODY:
In an upset, Thomas R. Suozzi defeated his party leadership's candidate today and won the Democratic primary for Nassau County executive, bringing him a step closer to the helm of one of the state's wealthiest but most financially troubled counties.
 Mr. Suozzi, the four-term mayor of Glen Cove, decisively beat Thomas P. DiNapoli, a longtime assemblyman from Thomaston who received the party's backing in May and collected endorsements from labor unions and Democratic elected officials including New York's senior United States senator, Charles E. Schumer. 
 But Mr. Suozzi, running as an outsider, raised more money and campaigned more vigorously. Until the World Trade Center attack brought the race to a near-standstill, he used a dizzying series of appearances at train stations, supermarkets and festivals to stress his experience as an executive who had guided his city out of its own fiscal morass. 
In unofficial returns, with all of the election districts reporting, Mr. Suozzi had 54 percent of the vote, compared with 46 percent for Mr. DiNapoli.
Voter turnout, about 24 percent of enrolled Democrats, was higher than expected. There had been predictions that turnout would be low in the wake of the terrorist attack.
"I dedicate this victory to those thousands of heroes who carried us through during these past two weeks," Mr. Suozzi told a wildly cheering crowd of 500 supporters tonight at a catering hall in Carle Place, referring to the trade center rescue efforts.
"I will work harder and longer until we break the back of the machine politics in Nassau County," he said. "We will make Nassau County the best county in the country."
Mr. DiNapoli conceded shortly after 11 p.m., telling supporters who packed a Plainview catering hall that he had spoken with Mr. Suozzi and wished him well. Mr. DiNapoli said the large voter turnout made him proud. "I feel wonderful," he said. "I feel like the best people of this county lined up behind me."
For Mr. Suozzi (pronounced SWAH-zee), the victory represents more than a chance to face Bruce R. Bent, a multimillionaire financier and political newcomer nominated by the Republicans. The November election may make political history: this is considered the Democrats' best chance in decades to seize the office from a once-mighty Republican machine whose grip on this suburban Long Island county -- and its hundreds of patronage jobs and millions of dollars in contracts -- has weakened in the midst of the financial crisis.
If elected, Mr. Suozzi, 39, would be the first Democratic leader of the county since 1970, and only the second Democrat ever to hold the powerful position.
The county's financial woes so tarnished Thomas S. Gulotta, the Republican county executive since 1987, that even after he announced he would not seek re-election this year, he left a void no leading county Republicans were willing to fill. In the last county elections, in 1999, Democrats won control of the Nassau Legislature for the first time.
Though the Democratic primary -- which some nicknamed the battle of two Toms -- threatened to be fractious and bruising, it was ultimately bereft of personal attacks and deep philosophical schisms. Instead, voters had to focus on differences in the candidates' personalities and experience in making a decision.
Mr. Suozzi, the son and nephew of former Glen Cove mayors, had been running for the seat for two years. He raised more money than his opponent -- about $2 million to Mr. DiNapoli's $1.5 million -- and started spending it earlier to get his message out.
The message was simple: that Mr. Suozzi could straighten out Nassau County's finances because he had done it in Glen Cove. As mayor, he improved the city's finances and credit rating, raised taxes in his first year and revitalized the downtown and waterfront areas.
In the days leading up to the primary, Mr. Suozzi's campaign seemed to gain momentum. He won the endorsements of the editorial boards of both Newsday and The New York Times, and was endorsed by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- all moves that helped lift his campaign, Mr. Suozzi said tonight.
"Everything was against us -- the endorsements, the organization, even, for a period of time, the weather," Mr. Suozzi said in an interview. "We won this race because we had the better message. Both of us proved to people that politics doesn't have to be anything but an exchange of ideas."
"I have two goals in the next few days," he added. "One, to make sure the Democrats are together, and two, to start the Republicans for Suozzi Committee."
Mr. DiNapoli, 47, the son of middle-class Republicans, stressed his lifelong dedication to public service, his 15 years in the State Assembly and his ability to unite disparate factions. His allies said they had urged him to enter the race so he could use his relationships with state and federal government officials to help repair Nassau's budgetary woes.
In a brief interview after his concession speech, Mr. DiNapoli said he did not know what had gone wrong. "We haven't had a chance to look at the breakdown, so I really don't know what happened," he said. 
An aide to Mr. DiNapoli said the high turnout helped Mr. Suozzi, because while Mr. DiNapoli focused on the most dedicated Democratic voters, Mr. Suozzi appealed to party members who do not normally vote in primaries.
On the Republican side, even party officials acknowledge that their candidate will face an uphill battle, given the county's state of fiscal disarray after years of ironclad Republican rule.
When no leading Republicans came forward to replace Mr. Gulotta, that opened the door for Mr. Bent, 63, a political novice who received the backing of the famously hierarchical Republican Party in May, only after he had received the county Conservative Party's endorsement. Mr. Bent has vowed to do the job for a $1-a-year salary should he win.
"The message of our campaign is that career politicians have brought Nassau County to the brink of financial disaster and one more politician will push it over the brink," said Michael D. Dawidziak, Mr. Bent's campaign consultant, who said he considered both Democratic candidates to be political insiders.
"I think once this message gets out there, I think his numbers will bounce like a trampoline," Mr. Dawidziak said of Mr. Bent. "If you want to call that an uphill battle, O.K., but I love going uphill that fast."
At Mr. Suozzi's victory party tonight, there was no band, out of respect to the victims of the trade center attack. But from the lectern, the candidate sang a song his father, Joseph A. Suozzi, used when he ran unsuccessfully for county executive in 1958 (to the tune of the "Colonel Bogey March," the marching air whistled in the movie "The Bridge Over the River Kwai").
"Suozzi, you know he'll do his best," he sang. "Suozzi, he always passes the test. So remember, in November, to vote for Suozzi because he's the best."

New Jobs for the Displaced

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A partnership between New York City's labor unions and its business community to find jobs for people who used to work at the World Trade Center is already bearing fruit.
 After receiving letters and phone calls from business and labor leaders, companies throughout the New York area have promised to provide more than 2,000 jobs for janitors, secretaries, Windows on the World restaurant employees and other workers who lost their jobs when the trade center was destroyed. 
 Toys "R" Us has pledged more than 800 temporary holiday jobs and has said that in hiring for its new Times Square store it would give priority to former trade center workers. New York City's nonprofit hospitals have offered to make 500 positions available to displaced workers. And the Pfizer Corporation, promising that there will be many more to come, has already hired a dozen former trade center workers for posts including computer programmer, administrative assistant and maintenance worker.
"We think this is a great way to help in a time of crisis," said Michael D'Ambrose, an executive vice president at Toys "R" Us.
Employers with jobs to offer are asked to call a hot line, 212-558-2250. Former trade center workers who are looking for jobs should call a different number, 212-558-2261. STEVEN GREENHOUSE

Unions at Airlines Assail Management For Denying Benefits

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Labor-management relations in the airline industry, rocky before Sept. 11, have grown rancorous, with unions enraged at what they say are moves by several carriers to use the national emergency to deny pay or benefits to workers idled as air travel stalls.
 American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, said yesterday that the airline's finances had been hurt so badly by the terrorist attacks that it could not afford to pay severance benefits to the thousands of workers that it planned to lay off. 
 Union officials quickly criticized American, asserting that the least the airline could do after Congress approved a multibillion-dollar bailout was to make good on its commitments to its workers.
"It's outrageous that American would ask the workers to support them on getting this massive federal bailout and then turn around to slap the workers in the face by failing to honor its commitments," said Edward Wytkind, executive director of the transportation trades department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. 
Karen Watson, an American spokeswoman, insisted that the company was honoring its contract and was merely invoking an emergency clause that she said allowed the company to suspend certain commitments under extreme circumstances.
"The reason for using these provisions is because of the dire financial condition of the industry," Ms. Watson said. "We're furloughing 20,000 employees because of the 20 percent reduction in our flight schedule, which of course occurred suddenly. Right now the issue is the survival of the company."
Several union officials and airline workers, meanwhile, said that United Airlines, owned by the UAL Corporation, was leaving some workers in limbo by not calling them to work but not laying them off, either. US Airways, they added, was citing emergency conditions to override a no-furlough clause in certain union contracts.
Since the terror attacks, which briefly grounded all aircraft and have left airlines running reduced schedules of half-empty flights, the carriers have announced plans to eliminate nearly 80,000 jobs. Delta Air Lines has scheduled a news conference for today and it is expected to announce more than 10,000 layoffs.
At American, Ms. Watson, the spokeswoman, declined to say how much the airline would save by not making its severance payments; union officials estimated that tens of millions of dollars would be saved. The laid-off workers generally will qualify for unemployment insurance. American's plan to withhold severance benefits was first reported yesterday by The Los Angeles Times.
Some union officials said that they would ask Congress to enact a law requiring American to make good on its severance commitments as a condition for receiving its part of the $15 billion in cash and loan guarantees approved by Congress and signed by President Bush last week. 
Dissatisfied that the bailout bill did not provide any protections for airline workers, union officials also want Congress to enact an additional 52 weeks of unemployment insurance for laid-off aviation workers, above and beyond the 26 weeks that is typically provided. And they want Congress to guarantee at least 12 months of federally financed health insurance for all laid-off aviation workers.
On Monday, Donald J. Carty, American's chief executive, said that he would take no pay for the rest of the year and urged American employees to agree to voluntary cuts in pay.
Last year, according to the airline's proxy statement, Mr. Carty earned $772,500 in salary plus a bonus of $1,351,875.
Union officials complained that United was invoking an emergency clause, known as force majeure, for the month of October, citing it in telling many employees that they would have no work and no pay for at least several weeks next month, although those workers would not be officially laid off. 
While unhappy with this development, union officials voiced less anger at United's approach than American's, because they said United apparently was trying to weather October with as few long-term layoffs as possible.
Chris Brathwaite, a United spokesman, declined to discuss details of the airline's job reductions. 
Pat Friend, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said US Airways had invoked an emergency clause to skirt no-furlough provisions in the contract.
US Airways executives acknowledged that they were relying on the emergency clause. However, US Airways, which has announced plans to eliminate 11,000 jobs, said it would make good on its severance obligations .
In a statement issued Monday, US Airways said, "The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 have had a catastrophic effect on the airline industry, and US Airways now finds itself in the position of having to struggle for its very survival."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE BENEFITS; 
House Republican Leaders Balk at Any Help for Laid-Off Workers

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
House Republican leaders balked today at the idea of helping thousands of laid-off workers by extending unemployment compensation and health care benefits despite a commitment last Friday by Speaker J. Dennis Hastert to consider such legislation.
 "The model of thought there, and quite frankly, the model of thought that says we need to go out and extend unemployment benefits and health insurance benefits and so forth is not I think one that is commensurate with the American spirit here," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader. He said a higher priority was to pass an economic stimulus bill. 
 Representative Tom DeLay, the majority whip from Texas, seemed no more enthusiastic about the Democratic plan, which was first proposed last Friday when Congress approved the $15 billion airline industry bailout. The idea was rejected by Republicans in a late-night negotiation session. 
"Sometimes people jump out too quickly on an issue," Mr. DeLay said, referring to Democrats. "They want to develop an issue."
The idea of unemployment help has generated more interest from the White House, at least for now. President Bush plans to travel to Chicago on Thursday to thank airline workers, and some are hoping he will offer them some sort of assistance. At a breakfast meeting today, Democratic leaders said Mr. Bush told them he had directed the Department of Labor to review the administration's options.
"He acknowledged this was a problem," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader, who today introduced one of several bills to help laid-off workers.
John Feehery, Mr. Hastert's spokesman, reiterated that the speaker planned to keep his commitment to Democrats and "move forward on this in a bipartisan way." But, he added: "I'm not sure where it's going to go. I don't think a decision has been made."
As for the reluctance among some Republican leaders to move a workers' bill, Mr. Gephardt said they would face the same pressures as Democrats when laid-off employees ask them, "What about us?"
"I'm not sure in the end they won't have to move something," he said.
Immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the government ordered all airplanes grounded, a decision that left the airline industry in financial disarray. Since then, the airlines and aerospace companies have said they will lay off more than 100,000 workers. Ronald Reagan National Airport, adjacent to Washington, has been shuttered since the attack, putting thousands of airport workers there in limbo.
On Friday, Congress approved the bailout for the airline industry to help it recover. The bill included a provision allowing airline executives to keep collecting their large salaries, which angered Democrats. On Monday, the chairman of American Airlines, Donald J. Carty, said he would forgo his salary for the rest of the year and asked other executives and nonunion workers to volunteer to take pay cuts. This week, American announced it would not pay severance to the 20,000 workers it planned to let go.
Democrats were infuriated when Republicans refused to include a bill to help workers as part of the initial bailout bill, and criticized their own leaders for agreeing to move the legislation to the floor without an employee assistance measure.
A number of them were assuaged by a commitment made by Mr. Hastert that Congress would consider proposals addressing the issue. But many remained distrustful of the promise, and they now feel as if their suspicions were warranted.
"That's why we wanted to do it last week," said Representative George Miller of California, the senior Democrat on the House Education and the Work Force Committee, who opposed the bailout bill. "Of course, we got rolled. Once you give away what they want, why should they give you what you want."
"Our leadership needs to play tougher next time," Mr. Miller added.
Hoping to put pressure on Republicans, both Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Daschle said they planned to attach a workers' aid bill to legislation on aviation security. Mr. Daschle, as majority leader of the Senate, could do that easily. The idea, though, is opposed by Senate Republican leaders, who say it will only complicate passage of a bill that will make Americans feel safer on airplanes.
"We have indicated to the White House and to our Republican colleagues that it would be very difficult for us to pass the airline security bill without attaching some legislation that allows us to address the myriad of problems we're facing with unemployed workers," Mr. Daschle said. "We addressed airline problems last week. We've got to address employee problems very soon."

Fear of Flying
 Former President BILL CLINTON has not stopped flying since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: he left for Chicago on a United Airlines flight from La Guardia Airport on Monday. But former President JIMMY CARTER has canceled a trip to monitor the parliamentary elections in Bangladesh on Sunday. And Gov. JESSE VENTURA of Minnesota is keeping the body at home: he has called off a trade trip to China next month. 
 "Minnesota, like every other state in the country, must address the economic impact of these tragedies," he said. "Now is not the time for me to be out of the country for an extended period of time." His spokesman said that the decision was made without consulting the State Department, although a check of other governors found nine who had canceled or postponed foreign trips.

Out of Context
She would have been noticed if she had worn a swimsuit. The much-photographed HEIDI KLUM, who has appeared on the covers of Esquire, Mademoiselle and French Vogue this year, was among those who served lunch on Monday to law enforcement officials at Pier 92, a command post and refuge for rescue workers.
Not until yesterday did city officials spread the word that Ms. Klum had gone unrecognized in her jeans, denim shirt, American Red Cross apron and Office of Emergency Management cap.

Personal Nonappearances
There are talk-show guests who are canceling, and talk-show guests who are not. STANLEY TUCCI, the star of two films that were scheduled to open on Friday and that have been delayed ("Sidewalks of New York" until November; "Big Trouble" until next year) canceled an appearance on "Live With Regis and Kelly." But KEVIN COSTNER flew to New York from California for a Monday-night taping of the cable series "Inside the Actors Studio," on which the questioner is JAMES LIPTON, the dean of the Actors Studio Drama School at New School University.
Mr. Costner had a one-liner ready: "I've never before been on the dean's list."
But CATE BLANCHETT, who was to be the guest on "Inside the Actors Studio" next month, has taken herself off Dean Lipton's list.
"She is in England and is deeply concerned about flying," Mr. Lipton told the audience on Monday. Ms. Blanchett's spokeswoman said that it was so, and that besides, Ms. Blanchett was six months pregnant. She will still do some interviews to promote the BARRY LEVINSON film "Bandits," which is scheduled to open Oct. 12, when she would have been in New York. But she will do them over a satellite hookup from London.

Truth Is Stranger . . .
The musical -- which is the debut of HARRY CONNICK JR. as composer and lyricist -- is Zola relocated to post-World War II Louisiana, but CRAIG BIERKO was talking about the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. At a preview of "Thou Shalt Not" (an adaptation of Zola's "Therese Raquin,") at the Plymouth Theater yesterday, he said that he had landed in New York early in the morning of the 11th after a red-eye flight from Los Angeles and hurried home to take a nap before rehearsing.
He had slept for about an hour when the stage manager called to say that the rehearsal had been canceled, and why.
"I ran downstairs to my living room and opened the blinds and I saw one of the towers had gone down," Mr. Bierko said. "Couldn't believe what I saw. Still can't believe what I saw.
"Turned the television on and watched the tower coming down. I thought it was a videotape, the first tower coming down. But it was a live shot of the second tower coming down. I turned around and watched the second tower actually fall."

Jordan Makes Official What Most Expected

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
In the revised N.B.A. Encyclopedia released last winter, Michael Jordan wrote in his foreword about "a very strong connection between the present and the past."
 Jordan, the former player turned executive, added: "I also believe very strongly that the love of the game is what links the past and the future, and I am determined to make sure that the players of today do not forget that. That will be my assist." 
 Who knew back then that his words would spring to life once more, that he would be falling away after a jump shot, his right wrist slightly cocked, trudging up and down an N.B.A. court? Yesterday it happened. In an announcement that had been expected for some time, Jordan gave the Washington Wizards the go-ahead to include his name on their 2001-2 roster. 
Jordan, considered by many to be the greatest player in league history, signed a two-year contract with the Wizards, the team announced yesterday. He will earn $1 million for this coming season -- the veteran minimum exception for a 10-year player -- and said he would donate that money to relief and victim-assistance efforts for the terrorist attacks of Sept 11.
"Although I am energized by my impending return to the court, I am deeply saddened by the recent tragic events and my heart goes out to the victims and their families," Jordan said in a statement released by the team. "Out of deep respect for them, I will not participate in media interviews before the start of training camp on Oct. 1."
Just like that, Jordan -- who sat on a podium in Chicago in January 1999 to announce his second retirement -- was back for a second time. About to face off with Vince Carter and Kobe Bryant. At 38 years old. 
Jordan all but confirmed more than two weeks ago that he would play for the Wizards this season, ending his three-year retirement. The official announcement came yesterday, amid great interest in Washington, where the 19-63 Wizards of a season ago suddenly became re-energized and a potential threat in the Eastern Conference.
"Michael has always brought joy to basketball fans around the world," the N.B.A.'s commissioner, David Stern, said, "and in these difficult times, we can all use a little more joy in our lives."
To play again, Jordan had to relinquish both his ownership and executive positions with the Wizards. In compliance with league rules, he plans to divest his roughly 8 percent ownership with Lincoln Holdings, which includes his ownership position in the Wizards, the Washington Capitals and the MCI Center. Jordan will also resign as the Wizards' president of basketball operations, a position he has held since January 2000. 
As to the reasons for his returning, Jordan said: "I am returning as a player to the game I love because during the last year and a half, as a member of Washington Wizards' management, I enjoyed working with our players, and sharing my own experiences as a player. I feel there is no better way of teaching young players than to be on the court with them as a fellow player, not just in practice, but in actual N.B.A. games.
"While nothing can take away from the past, I am firmly focused on the future and the competitive challenge ahead of me."
Abe Pollin, the Washington Sports and Entertainment chairman and the franchise's patriarch, said the team's excitement at Jordan's return was tempered by the national mood in the aftermath of the attacks. "The greatest player in the history of the game is joining my team, and for that I am extremely honored and pleased," Pollin said. "Michael has expressed his wishes that we focus on the national events of today rather than basketball. I concur and will certainly honor his wishes."
Jordan was prepared to announce his decision Monday but put it off because of a sponsorship conflict between EA Sports, which manufactures a video game with Jordan's likeness, and Jordan's management team. The N.B.A., which has a separate licensing agreement with Jordan dating to 1992, helped resolve the issue. 
His decision changes the N.B.A. landscape in many ways. Wizards preseason games will suddenly attract a host of national news media, covering the team as if Jordan were a campaigning politician. NBC will also make changes in its N.B.A. programming, most likely beginning with Washington's visit to Chicago on Jan. 19 -- a game that will now most certainly be televised.
"We're excited that Michael is returning," said Dick Ebersol, the NBC Sports chairman. "It will be fun to watch the greatest player ever match up against the N.B.A.'s new generation of stars." 
He added, "Any possible scheduling changes will be considered and discussed with the N.B.A. in the next week to 10 days."
Ebersol said he did not believe Jordan's return would have any impact on the current negotiations between the N.B.A. and the network on a new television contract. Jordan will be approaching 40 when the new deal begins for the 2002-3 season. But many industry analysts say his marquee value can only help in rough economic times.
Jordan's financial impact will be felt in many ways. 
"At a time when there isn't a lot of good news, this is great news," said Brandon Steiner, the president of Steiner Marketing, which matches up individuals with companies for endorsements. "Because of the filter-down effect he brings to the marketplace, I always felt like I should write Michael a commission check.' 
The announcement caps a nearly yearlong quest for Jordan, who began playing basketball in January to lose weight. As his workouts intensified and it became clear in mid-April that he was interested in a comeback, Jordan retreated to his home in Chicago and began working out under the guidance of his longtime personal trainer, Tim Grover.
Pickup games were arranged over the next few months, first against college-level talent and then against N.B.A. all-stars. As the games grew more competitive -- Jordan sustained two cracked ribs and battled tendinitis for much of the summer -- the whispers gradually became proclamations. He could still play.
Jordan first retired in October 1993 after leading the Chicago Bulls to three titles. He attempted to play professional baseball, and spent time with the Birmingham Barons in the minor leagues. He then made his first comeback in March 1995 with a fax simply stating, "I'm back!"
He proceeded to lead the Bulls to three more titles and retired again in January 1999, shortly before the start of the lockout-shortened season. He said he was 99.9 percent certain that he would not return.
But he apparently held on to that one-tenth of 1 percent, gripping the slight window of opportunity the way he once palmed a basketball.
"I am especially excited about the Washington Wizards, and I'm convinced we have the foundation on which to build a playoff-contention team," Jordan said in the statement. "The opportunity to teach our young players and help them elevate their game to a higher level, and to thank the fans in Washington for their loyalty and support, strongly influenced my decision."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ADVISER; 
Clinton's Fiscal Chief Has the Ear Of Congress

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN and RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Needing advice about economic policy in the wake of the terrorist attacks, the Senate Finance Committee summoned the chairman of the Federal Reserve and a treasury secretary to a closed-door meeting this morning.
 The Fed chairman, of course, was Alan Greenspan. But the treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin, has been out of office for nearly two and a half years and is now chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup, one of the world's biggest banking companies. 
 Mr. Rubin is not only of a different political persuasion than the current occupant of the office, Paul H. O'Neill, he has also arguably been more influential in shaping a response to the country's mounting economic woes -- at least in Congress -- than anyone in the Bush administration. 
As treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, Mr. Rubin helped give Democrats a claim to being the party of budgetary responsibility, guided the world through several international financial crises and won the respect of investors on Wall Street and even Republicans on Capitol Hill. Along with Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Rubin is credited with helping to shape the economic policies that fueled the 1990's boom, though it began before he took office.
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Greenspan have worked together since early in the Clinton administration, when Mr. Rubin promised that the White House would not put political pressure on the Fed about interest rates; he also vowed that it would heed Mr. Greenspan's call and make reducing the federal budget deficit its top economic priority. The two then worked together to manage the Mexico debt crisis in 1995 and the global financial crisis a few years later.
In recent weeks they have teamed up again, appearing together twice on Capitol Hill to warn against rushing into legislation that carried a heavy long-term economic cost.
Flying to the Washington area from New York on Citigroup's corporate jet, Mr. Rubin has also shuttled in and out of other Congressional meetings, including a session last week with the House Ways and Means Committee.
In this crisis, Mr. Greenspan, as always, plays the role of economic sage to a Congress that invests considerable authority in him. Mr. Rubin has been cast by his party as a senior statesman at a time of national unity and the embodiment of Democrats' argument that they can manage the economy as well as Republicans. 
"Rubin's name has become synonymous with paying attention to economic fundamentals," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California. "You just mention his name -- Democrat or Republican -- and people know what you mean."
But just as Mr. Greenspan maintains a philosophical, if not political, agenda built around free markets and low taxes, Mr. Rubin is by no means above the fray concerning taxes and spending.
His push for fiscal restraint stems in large part from his Wall Street perspective that a happy bond market delivers low interest rates.
Even before the terrorist attacks, Mr. Rubin's was a leading voice among Democrats seeking to roll back some longer-term elements of the tax cut Mr. Bush signed into law in June, warning that it imperiled the nation's fiscal health and risked driving rates up.
Along with Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Rubin "threw a cold towel" on Republicans who sought a capital-gains tax cut after the attacks, said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Rubin declined to comment on his role in the current deliberations about how to deal with the economy. But it has not escaped the notice of Republicans or Democrats in Congress that he has often been more visible on Capitol Hill than Mr. O'Neill, whose reviews as treasury secretary have been mixed from both sides of the aisle.
"I'm a big Bob Rubin fan," said Jack Welch, the former chairman of the General Electric Company. "I like what he says generally. But we have to be sure we don't get into thinking only about what worked yesterday, and we desperately need to keep a bipartisan focus."
Some Republicans said Mr. Rubin's influence has limits. While saying he appreciated Mr. Rubin's role in the debate, Representative Phil English, Republican of Pennsylvania, said that Mr. Rubin was wrong to rule out further long-term tax cuts because they might drain future surpluses and push interest rates up.
"A long-term tax cut will have an impact on the budget, but it will also have a long-term impact on growth and jobs," Mr. English said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMY; 
CONGRESS GETS PLEA TO DROP TAX BENEFITS FOR INVESTORS AND WIDEN ECONOMIC RELIEF

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Influential advisers and key members of Congress expressed opposition today to two of the main Republican proposals for stimulating an already weakened economy as new figures suggested that the terrorist attacks would inflict heavy damage on jobs, spending and the business outlook. 
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, advised Congress against cutting the capital gains tax, the favored approach of many Republicans on Capitol Hill, or reducing corporate income taxes, the idea mentioned by the Bush administration. 
 Mr. Rubin, who served under President Bill Clinton, and Mr. Greenspan told a closed-door meeting of the Senate Finance Committee that those two types of tax cuts would not give the economy the kind of punch it might need to rebound quickly, senators and aides said later. Some senior Republicans said the chances of either proposal now making it into law had dimmed. 
Mr. Rubin's appearance on Capitol Hill today was his third meeting with lawmakers since the terrorist strikes, underscoring his unusual role as a Democratic shadow minister in shaping the debate over how to respond to the economy's troubles. In some ways, in fact, he has been more visible in Washington than the current treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill. Page B8. 
The economic news today was not encouraging. The Conference Board reported that in the 10 days this month before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, consumer confidence had registered its sharpest decline since the last recession. The drop suggested to analysts that the economy was flirting with a recession or was in one even before suffering from the fallout of the attacks.
Other figures showed a steep falloff last week in retail sales. And new estimates suggested that 100,000 people in New York might lose their jobs, at least temporarily, because of the devastation in Lower Manhattan and its effects on the city's industries. Wall Street firms prepared their employees for the likelihood of smaller bonuses, and perhaps layoffs.
On Capitol Hill, both parties struggled with how to balance increasing pressure to address the economy's deterioration with the possibility that economic stimulus already in the pipeline would be enough to support a rapid recovery. 
Congress continued to consider what other steps it might take, including providing a tax rebate to all or most workers, expanding the unemployment insurance program, increasing the minimum wage or bailing out needy industries. But both the administration and Congress seemed to heed Mr. Greenspan's repeated call not to rush into anything before the extent of the damage to the economy becomes clearer.
The Federal Reserve has already cut interest rates eight times this year and is expected to do so again next week. The tax cut signed into law by President Bush earlier this year will help, economists said, as will $40 billion in emergency spending passed by Congress after the attacks and a $15 billion package to bail out the airline industry and bolster airport security.
In their meeting with the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin recommended that any tax cuts be temporary and designed to give consumers and perhaps businesses a swift boost without creating long-term budget problems, according to accounts of the session from members of both parties.
The most obvious way to meet those criteria, members of Congress said, would be another tax rebate for individuals plus some breaks for businesses that invest in new equipment and factories.
Mr. Greenspan said any stimulus package would have to be sizable to be effective, perhaps as much as $100 billion, at the high end of what Congress has been considering, members of the committee said. In a public statement later, the Fed said Mr. Greenspan intended that figure to include the emergency spending that Congress has already approved for relief and rebuilding. By that benchmark, Mr. Greenspan seemed to be suggesting that further stimulus might have to amount to an additional $40 billion to $60 billion.
The chairman of the committee, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and its senior Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said after the meeting that they agreed with the general framework set out by Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin. Mr. Grassley said in an interview that he had reluctantly concluded that now was not the right time to press for a capital gains tax cut.
Asked about the administration's position, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said the need for new tax cuts and spending, their scale and composition "remain under review."
House Republicans said they had not given up on cutting the capital gains tax. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said that a capital gains cut was still under consideration and that the White House had made a strong case for reducing corporate tax rates.
In the days immediately after the attacks, many Republicans in Congress rallied around a capital gains cut as a way to bolster investment and restore Wall Street confidence. 
The Bush administration never embraced that plan. Instead, Mr. O'Neill and Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, have told lawmakers that they support permanent cuts in corporate tax rates, a step also favored by many corporations.
But, Mr. Greenspan, a Republican whose clout on Capitol Hill is unrivaled on economic issues, and Mr. Rubin, now a top executive of Citigroup who has re-emerged in the last week as a kind of eminence grise for the Democrats, teamed up today to steer the finance committee in a different direction. Mr. O'Neill declined an invitation to attend the session so he could be at the White House for a National Security Council meeting and a meeting with the Japanese prime minister.
The message from Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin, senators and their aides said, was that any tax cuts should be temporary, and that they not lead the financial markets to push up long-term interest rates out of fear that the government's long-term fiscal health would be put in jeopardy. Government budget analysts and private economists were scaling back their forecasts for the federal budget surplus in the coming year, saying it could be $25 billion to $50 billion instead of the $176 billion previously projected.
Mr. Greenspan restated his support for reducing or eliminating the capital gains tax in the long run, but he said it was not the best way to deal with the economy's short-term problems. Mr. Rubin said he opposed cutting the capital gains tax, but agreed that such a cut now would not give the economy the kind of immediate jolt that might be needed, people who were in the meeting said.
The committee discussed but did not decide on several other tax-cutting options. Among them was a tax rebate, which Democrats would like to cover all workers, even those at the low end of the income scale who did not qualify for the rebate checks sent out this summer under President Bush's tax cut. 
Another topic of discussion was speeding the schedule under which companies can write off the value of their investments in factories and equipment, which could encourage businesses to invest more.
"There was a general feeling in the room that, whatever it is, on both the consumption and investment side, if there is anything, it should be short term," Mr. Baucus said. 
Mr. Grassley agreed with Mr. Baucus's characterization, but said there were still divisions between the parties about what any additional short-term tax cuts would look like. He said Republicans would prefer that any further tax reductions for individuals work the same way as this summer's rebates, and go only to people who pay federal income taxes. 
Such an approach excludes about 34 million working people who are subject to the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare but do not earn enough money to pay any federal income taxes. Democrats said they wanted any tax cut to cover all working people.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: NARCOTICS; 
Afghanistan Remains a Major Drug Trader Despite Taliban Ban on Poppy Growing

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
The Taliban government in Afghanistan has earned tens of millions of dollars from the export of heroin and other narcotics since it proclaimed last year that it was ending opium poppy cultivation, American officials say. Cutting off this important source of revenue is part of the Bush administration's economic campaign against the regime, the officials said. 
 The Taliban won international acclaim in July 2000 when its leaders banned the growing of opium poppies. Many of the nation's impoverished farmers counted on the harvest to feed their families, and the Taliban used tax proceeds from it to buy arms. 
 United Nations inspectors who have toured the country say that poppy cultivation has, in fact, been largely eradicated in areas under the Taliban's control, a finding confirmed by American narcotics experts who visited Afghanistan in June. 
But the Taliban did not destroy existing stocks of narcotics. A United Nations panel noted in May that Afghan opium poppy production had leaped to 4,600 tons in 1999 from 2,500 tons in 1998, and was 3,100 tons in 2000 before the ban on cultivation, raising the question of whether the Taliban was stocking up.
American experts now aiding the Bush administration's effort to muster an international coalition against terrorism and the Taliban protectors of Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, say that enormous quantities of opium and of heroin itself have been hidden around the country, and have continued to be sold since the ban.
Before declaring an end to poppy cultivation, Afghanistan produced some 75 percent of the world's supply of opium, international narcotics experts said.
"The ban on poppy cultivation has been very effective in Taliban-controlled areas," one American official said. "But we believe the stockpile from last year is still funding the Taliban. Opium and heroin are a major source of the Taliban's income."
The Bush administration would now like to cut off that money.
"We will be using all instruments of our power against them, and one major area is their finances," a senior Defense Department official said. "Drugs are very important to that."
Another senior official familiar with the military planning said that targeting stockpiles of opium, the raw ingredient for heroin, and laboratories was difficult and not a principal aim of the military campaign. But he said that Washington has not ruled out military force. 
"It may be one of the hardest things to go after," he said. "It might be more efficient to use law enforcement and other instruments." 
In trying to fight Afghanistan's drug trade, the United States might win new cooperation from Iran, Russia and the central Asian states, which face mounting problems with addiction and narcotics crime.
The Taliban have relied on revenues from the drug trade for years and have used the proceeds to buy weapons to fight the Northern Alliance, the rebel group variously estimated to control 5 to 15 percent of Afghanistan's territory. 
At first, the Taliban was taxing poppy cultivation and charging fees for narcotics production, American officials say. A United Nations report estimated that the Taliban earned $15 million to $27 million annually from taxes levied on opium production, an estimate that did not include any proceeds from trading drugs. An American official estimated that the total annual revenue was $40 million to $50 million.
Then the Taliban announced an end to opium cultivation. But the narcotics trade flourished as drug traffickers continued to export opium and heroin. "The amount of heroin that has been seized has not changed," Mohammad S. Amirkhizi, a senior official at the United Nations Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention in Vienna, said in a telephone interview. "The amount of opium seized only shows a 30 percent decrease in Iran and not in other cases. That shows that stocks are still available."
A former American official said intelligence experts have never established a direct link between the trade and Mr. bin Laden. Two senior Congressional aides with access to intelligence reports said Mr. bin Laden does not actually traffic in drugs, but makes money off the heroin trade by hiring out his fighters to guard laboratories and escort drug convoys moving through Iran to Turkey, where often the opium base is processed into heroin. 
In recent days, there has been concern that the Taliban may escalate the drug war by increasing the export of drugs and suspending the ban on poppy cultivation. The price of opium within Afghanistan has plummeted, according to the United Nations Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention, which says the price for a kilo of opium in Afghanistan was $700 on Sept. 11. By Sept. 18, it was $180. By Sept. 24, the price had dropped to $90.
United Nations officials said the price decline may reflect problems in exporting drugs in a region that may soon be ringed with troops and combat aircraft. But another theory is that the price has dropped because the Taliban may end their ban on poppy growth in response to an American military strike or find they cannot enforce the ban as the planting season resumes in a few weeks.

HEADLINE: The Interrupted Primary 

 BODY:
New Yorkers finally completed the primary election yesterday that was interrupted by the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. For many, the very exercise of voting, going back to finish what was started, offered some comfort and pride. Another necessary piece of our democratic infrastructure remained intact, ready for probable runoff elections on Oct. 11 and a general election Nov. 6. 
 For two weeks now, New Yorkers have been telling one another that their world has changed. Nevertheless, the vast majority of those who went to vote yesterday said in exit polls that they were sticking to the candidates they supported before the World Trade Center attack. Education remained the biggest concern among the electorate on the Democratic side, followed by the economy. Terrorism and the need to rebuild Lower Manhattan ranked lower on the voters' list. 
 The two apparent runoff candidates for the Democratic nomination for mayor, Public Advocate Mark Green and the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, have different styles of leadership and very different agendas when it comes to rebuilding the city. In the 16 days before the anticipated runoff, Democrats will have to evaluate them in light of the new challenges that post-terrorist New York poses. Flexibility and firmness seem particularly important now. And all promises for expensive new programs should be viewed skeptically in light of the faltering economy and wounded tax base.
On the Republican side, Michael Bloomberg easily won the party's mayoral nomination and must now begin to define himself for the larger general electorate. Mr. Bloomberg has been describing himself as the man most likely to continue the legacy of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. That will be a more complicated pitch if Mr. Giuliani decides to somehow insert himself as a candidate. We hope the mayor drops the idea. An attempt to repeal the term-limits law and find a slot for him on the ballot would force a complicated and bitter debate, the last thing New York City needs at this time of crisis. The mayor's international reputation right now is too sterling, and the need for his attention over the next few months too great, to allow either to be diluted.
The city's election machinery tends to be creaky even in the best of times, and the fact that voters managed to cast their ballots was yet another example of adversity bringing out the best in New Yorkers. Mayor Giuliani helped by providing higher wages for poll workers. The city's Board of Elections deserves credit for scrambling to put together this emergency election in two short weeks despite a range of computer problems because of the attack in Lower Manhattan, where its offices were located.
Trying to vote and to run for public office while the city is in shock from an unprecedented tragedy has been difficult for everyone. Now, as New York City returns to life, its politicians must engage in a full public campaign that gives voters a chance to figure out who can best lead a different city.

HEADLINE: THE NEW YORK PRIMARY: THE OVERVIEW; 
FERRER AND GREEN HEAD FOR RUNOFF IN MAYORAL RACE

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Struggling to choose a new mayor precisely two weeks after a terrorist jet attack devastated the World Trade Center, New York City Democrats yesterday apparently extended the primary contest an additional 16 days by sending two candidates, Mark Green and Fernando Ferrer, into a runoff for their party's nomination, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls.
 There was no ambiguity on the Republican side: Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire communications entrepreneur, trounced his opponent, Herman Badillo, to become the Republican mayoral candidate in the general election on Nov. 6. 
 The outcome on the Democratic side -- with turnout as depressed as the spirits of many New Yorkers, on a gray day in which the smell of fire still hung in the downtown air -- appears to mean that a contest that had stopped midvote on Sept. 11 would continue through a runoff on Oct. 11. None of the Democrats appeared to win more than 40 percent, which would have eliminated the requirement for the second round of elections. 
As it was, the four Democrats had been awkwardly grappling with how to campaign, or whether to campaign at all, in a city that had been traumatized by the terrorist attack, which occurred less than three hours after the polls opened on the first primary day. They had been grappling with the increasing popularity of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as he has guided New York through this crisis, and with suggestions by Mr. Giuliani that he was looking for a way to circumvent the term limits law that had prevented him from running for a third term.
In a survey of voters leaving the polls yesterday, two-thirds of the Democrats declared that they approved of the way the Republican mayor was handling his job. And roughly 40 percent of the Democrats said that if a way were found to put Mr. Giuliani's name on the ballot in November -- and Mr. Giuliani's aides are looking for one -- they would vote for him over any of the Democrats who have spent the better part of the past four years preparing for this vote.
William C. Thompson won the Democratic nomination for city comptroller, defeating Herbert E. Berman, who conceded.
In apparently winning a spot in the runoff, Mr. Ferrer mobilized a growing Hispanic population in New York as he succeeded at assembling a coalition of black and Latino voters behind his attempt to become New York's first Puerto Rican mayor. More than half the black voters and almost three-quarters of Latino voters chose Mr. Ferrer, the survey found. Blacks and Hispanics made up nearly half the primary electorate, the survey said.
Mr. Ferrer, who has been the Bronx borough president for 14 years, faces another longtime fixture in New York government, Mr. Green, who is finishing his second term as the public advocate.
They defeated Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, according to the survey.
Mr. Ferrer, smiling broadly, sang along with Frank Sinatra to a recording of "New York, New York," as a crowd of supporters waved small American flags in front of him. Before declaring victory, he asked them to join him in a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.
Mr. Ferrer, who had run a campaign talking about his advocacy for "the other New York," spoke last night of bringing the city together, going so far as to praise Mr. Giuliani, who has been one of his favorite targets. "My friends, you can be sure of one thing: Together we are going to rebuild New York," he said. 
"The people of our city said something more with their votes today," Mr. Ferrer said. "They said that even as we recover from this tragedy, we must not forget that there are other pressing problems facing New Yorkers. Problems we must not ignore. The towers have crumbled. But our commitments have not. They remain strong."
Mr. Green took the lectern last night as Mr. Ferrer was talking, in a departure from usual political protocol, and in the midst of the 11 p.m. news. And he took clear aim at Mr. Ferrer's campaign theme about the "other New York," saying that the central theme of his campaign would be unity.
"That will be the basis of my campaign: We are one New York and one city," he declared.
"Our campaigns must be utterly focused on the future," he said. "We have to, and I am confident we will, avoid the kind of petty personal attacks that divert the public. The public demands and has the right for us to have a conversation about how we will rebuild New York."
Mr. Hevesi, in conceding last night, said that he had lost the race, at least in part, because "I made some mistakes, they came back to bite me, in this campaign, and we never recovered from it." He added, "I know we are really good in government; we weren't as good in politics."
Mr. Vallone declined to concede last night, noting that there were still votes left to be counted.
"New York is a city of five boroughs, not one," he said. "And the returns from the other four boroughs are not in yet, so this is not a concession speech." Noting what happened in Florida last year, he said with a grin, "Doesn't this city deserve to have every vote counted? I think so."
In a Green-Ferrer runoff, Mr. Green would appear to be in a strong position, though it remained to be seen if Mr. Ferrer's performance might result in what his aides have long predicted: galvanizing an unusually strong turnout among Hispanic and black voters. The survey of voters found that, given that choice, Mr. Green was favored by about half of all the Democrats who showed up yesterday, compared with 40 percent who supported Mr. Ferrer. The survey showed that Mr. Green is best positioned to pick up most of the votes that went to Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Vallone. Nearly 60 percent of Mr. Hevesi's supporters, and about 50 percent of Mr. Vallone's supporters, said they would support Mr. Green over Mr. Ferrer.
On the Republican side, Mr. Bloomberg, standing in front of an American flag, and in a room that included many of his high-priced political consultants, declared that the pause in campaigning that took place because of the attack on the World Trade Center was about to come to an end. And he argued that he was best suited, given his experience in business, to rebuild New York.
"My experience has prepared me for these rough and difficult days ahead," Mr. Bloomberg said. Mr. Badillo conceded about 11:30 last night.
In another sign of Mr. Giuliani's popularity, in the Republican primary there were indications that many voters had decided to write in a candidate. Those votes will not be tallied immediately, but it is most likely that the name most written in was Mr. Giuliani's.
The unofficial early results were slow in being reported last night, in part because the terrorist attack had damaged the computer system used by the Police Department to report the results. The Board of Elections said the official results for all races might not be completed before Sunday. 
The primary came on an intermittently rainy day in New York. Voters trickled to the polls along streets draped with American flags, and past memorials of candles and posters, some of which were streaked blurry by the rain.
The campaign headquarters last night -- usually a place of loud bands, balloons, banners, bustling bars, cheering and blaring television sets, at least on the winners' side -- were relatively sedate, reflecting these strange times. Mr. Bloomberg did not even rent a ballroom. Instead, he delivered a victory speech from his campaign headquarters on East 56th street. Rather than a platform filled with television cameras, there was only one, providing a feed to all interested television stations.
This was, in the context of New York's history, an unusually significant election even before the attack on Sept. 11. New Yorkers are electing virtually an entirely new city government -- mayor, public advocate, city comptroller and most of the City Council -- because the city's term limits law has forced an exodus of incumbents. And the election signaled, or so it seemed, the end of Mr. Giuliani's era in New York.
A Democratic runoff would take place over the next 16 days; the vote is on Oct. 11, a Thursday. Each of the Democrats would be allowed to spend an additional $2.6 million on hisr runoff campaign. 
In normal times, the fact that the Democratic primary has apparently come down to two candidates competing for a nomination that has historically been tantamount to winning the mayoralty itself would presage a fierce two weeks of campaigning. Democrats outnumber Republicans in New York by six to one, and Mr. Green last night described the eventual Democratic nominee as "the presumptive next mayor," a characterization that Mr. Bloomberg would no doubt dispute. 
But both Mr. Green and Mr. Ferrer have proven to be mild candidates already this year. And there will be resistance to the two of them changing their tone, assuming there is a runoff. Aides to both said it would be unseemly, during such bleak times, to engage in politics as usual.
Setting the table for a likely runoff, Mr. Green had already begun addressing how he would govern the city during this crisis, outlining ways to rebuild Lower Manhattan and improve security. It is a theme that he said he would stick to in the days ahead.
"Democrats and all voters should select the person who has the best leadership skills to unite and rebuild New York," Mr. Green said before the polls closed, sitting on a yellow couch in his suite on the 44th floor of the Sheraton Hotel, next to his wife, Deni, and his children, Jonah and Jenya. "That's urgent, and we have done so much to talk to the voters of New York that I am serene and confident."
Mr. Ferrer had not provided specific proposals for how he would govern the city under these newly changed circumstances. But he has emphasized that he would not abandon the central appeal of his campaign -- to represent the interests of New Yorkers who, he said, did not benefit from the good economic times under Mr. Giuliani. .
Mr. Green has a financial advantage in a runoff: he has already raised enough money to spend the maximum allowable in a runoff under the city's campaign finance law. By contrast, Mr. Ferrer would need, in the days ahead, to spend time raising money to be financially competitive with Mr. Green.
And Mr. Ferrer's promise to represent New Yorkers who did not benefit from the improvement in New York's fortunes over the past eight years was reflected in the economic standing of voters who supported him. Almost half the voters who said their annual income was $30,000 or less voted for Mr. Ferrer, according to the survey. Voters who made over $100,000 a year were divided between Mr. Vallone and Mr. Green.

How Voter Survey Was Conducted
The Election Day survey was based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting polls throughout New York City yesterday. Questionnaires were available in English or Spanish.
The poll was conducted by Edison Media Research of Edison, N.J.
The results are based on 1,097 Democratic primary voters and 205 Republican primary voters, in 40 randomly selected election districts across the city. 
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such surveys should differ by no more than plus or minus 4 percentage points for Democrats, and about 15 points for Republicans, from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all primary voters who turned out in New York City yesterday. 
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the survey.

HEADLINE: Campaigns In New Jersey Are Adapting To Attacks 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
The candidates for New Jersey governor are quickly adapting their campaigns to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, but in slightly different, if characteristic, ways.
 The candidates, Bret D. Schundler and James E. McGreevey, have both released advertisements acknowledging the attacks, the suffering of the victims and their families, and the sacrifices of rescue workers. Both have also come forward with modest proposals for improving New Jersey's defenses against terrorism and its readiness for future emergencies. 
 Mr. Schundler has been bolder in his response and, in the eyes of state officials who have criticized him, has moved too quickly. But if Mr. McGreevey has moved more cautiously, that, too, may have its risks. 
Today, Mr. McGreevey, the Democrat, called for the creation of an antiterrorism task force in the state attorney general's office and urged that the federal government take over airport security or allow states to step in to ensure the safety of airline passengers.
Among other things, Mr. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, said New Jersey should conduct a thorough review of its emergency management system and, at a minimum, add a physician to its emergency operations group so that the network of trauma centers and other hospitals could be kept better informed during a crisis.
Mr. McGreevey's remarks -- after a closed meeting with a predominantly Democratic group of business and hospital executives and former state and federal government officials -- came four days after Mr. Schundler, the Republican candidate and former mayor of Jersey City, released a more extensive proposal.
Mr. Schundler's eagerness to display leadership soon after the attack led to a damaging gaffe when he criticized aspects of New Jersey's response during an interview in which he described his own ideas. He later apologized, although he disputed the thrust of the resulting news article.
Mr. McGreevey, meanwhile, began running a TV commercial today in which he says that "for all of us," the Sept. 11 attacks are incomprehensible, but that "we're also seeing America at her best," because everyone is "coming together, united behind our president and our great nation." He assures viewers that "we'll meet this challenge" and "move forward, building our economy, improving our schools and making sure that Jersey's safe."
Mr. McGreevey's ad was produced by Greer, Margolis, Mitchell, Burns & Associates Inc. of Washington, along with Message and Media, a New Brunswick firm. The Greer, Margolis firm is also representing Mark R. Warner, the Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, the only other statewide race in the country this year. In a TV ad that began running Sept. 18, Mr. Warner makes a similar speech, seated, as is Mr. McGreevey, in front of an American flag.
"We've all been touched by this tragedy," Mr. Warner says. "But America shines through as we stand united in support of President Bush and our military." He adds that Virginians "must meet the challenges of the future: ensuring the safety of our people, building a strong economy and providing our children with the opportunity to succeed."
Mr. Schundler's campaign manager, Bill Pascoe, accused Mr. McGreevey today of lifting Mr. Warner's script. "I guess now we know that when Joe Biden came in to campaign for Jim McGreevey, he didn't just bring in campaign cash, he brought sage advice gleaned from years of experience on the campaign trail," he said, referring to Mr. Biden's 1988 campaign for president, in which he was caught plagiarizing a speech by a British politician.
A spokesman for Mr. McGreevey, Richard McGrath, said the resemblance between the ads was merely proof that "great minds think alike" and had nothing to do with the shared consulting firm. "Jim McGreevey was affected by this terrible tragedy in the same way as millions of Americans," he said. "So it shouldn't be surprising that his response was on a similar wavelength as other public leaders'."
Mr. Schundler has been saving what money he has raised by buying less-expensive newspaper ads. In a full-page ad today in The Star-Ledger of Newark and other newspapers, he wrote that New Jersey would play an important part in the struggle "to preserve freedom" and said its next governor must, too.
