HEADLINE: Surplus Up For Canada

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Canada's trade surplus rose slightly in November, but analysts said that a drop in both exports and imports, particularly with the United States, showed that the economic outlook remained grim.
Canada's merchandise trade surplus rose to $294 million Canadian ($255 million) in November, compared with a $147 million ($128 million) surplus in October, the Government said today. 
 Exports fell in November by $174 million ($151 million) to $11.6 billion ($10.1 billion), while imports fell by $325 million ($282 million) to $11.3 billion ($9.8 billion), the Government said.
Canada's economy, which relies heavily on exports, fell into recession in April 1990 and has been struggling to recover ever since.
Exports to the United States, which account for as much as three-quarters of total Canadian exports, fell for the second consecutive month in November, by $231 million ($200 million).

HEADLINE: Mystery Remains in Church Theft Case

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Jan. 17

 BODY:
For the Rev. Kenneth G. Murphy of the St. Aloysius Catholic parish in Great Neck, the assorted chalices, candleholders, cups and plates spread on a grimy evidence table today -- all stolen property that twinkled in solid gold and silver -- were bittersweet treasures.
Twenty separate pieces on the table had been taken in the dead of night on Nov. 14 from St. Aloysius, one of 500 churches and synagogues in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts that the police say may have been burglarized over the last 10 years by a 45-year-old Manhattan church organist and piano teacher who is now in a Nassau County jail awaiting trail. 
 If the police are right, few of the stolen artifacts will ever be recovered. Most have been sold, melted down, and resold for the value of their gold and silver.
So, for St. Aloysius, it was a blessing to recover some of the stolen treasure. But absent from the table was the artifact most dear to Father Murphy, the gold chalice inscribed with words of love and admiration, and given to him by his family in 1955, when he was ordained.
 
'Angry With Fate'
 "I am not angry at any man," he said quietly as he retreated from the television lights and cameras that had assembled around the display. "I am angry with fate."
Father Murphy, the associate pastor of his church, was among more than a dozen clergymen and lay officials of churches and synagogues for whom the meeting yesterday with the Nassau County Burglary Squad became a blend of lost and found and real-life crime.
They came to sort through the only artifacts -- 40 in all -- that have been recovered after the church burglary spree.
In custody is Oather James Blocker, who has so far been charged with only three burglaries: one at a church in Wayne, N.J., for which he has already served a 90-day jail sentence, and two others in the Long Island village of Woodbury.
 
Inquiries From Churches
 Mr. Blocker was arraigned in Hempstead on Jan. 3, and the police said he has confessed to 500 burglaries. Yesterday, Lewis Agresta, a Long Island lawyer hired by Mr. Blocker, denied the police assertions, saying, "I do not know of 500 confessions, or even 40."
The police said their investigation, which had been under way for four years, was aided by evidence provided by an unemployed New York City man in September who had been taken in by Mr. Blocker. The police said the man fled Mr. Blocker's Manhattan hotel room with several stolen religious articles, and he was later taken into police custody.
Since the Jan. 3 arrest, detectives here said, they have received more than 30 inquiries each day from law-enforcement agencies throughout the Northeast seeking links between Mr. Blocker and church burglaries in their areas.
Several of the clergymen and church officials fared better.
One was Sister Mary Laboure of the Holy Name of Jesus parish in Woodbury, one of the two Long Island churches Mr. Blocker has been charged with burglarizing. Sitting on the evidence table when she arrived were two Hummels -- ornate figurines made in Germany -- that were her personal property.
 
Little Satisfaction
 Still, while she said she was happy to find her own property, many chalices and other gold and silver articles that belonged to the church, and had been stolen, were nowhere to be found. "All of the church property is gone, and I can't say I am satisfied," she said.
"There has been a deep sense of being violated," said Rabbi Paul Siegel of the Temple Beth Abraham in Tarrytown, N.Y., another religious leader who was in the Burglary Squad offices yesterday. In October his temple was robbed of torah crowns, breast plates and other property, which, he said, was worth $50,000.
The only thing here for Rabbi Siegel to claim was a small silver lid to a kiddush cup, used to dispense wine. The lid was damaged, and even if it were not, "it will be of little use" to the temple without its cup, he said.
Detectives said they would try to recover more property but held out little hope.
"Most of it was taken to be melted down, and we have to think it has already been melted down," said Detective Lenny Miller, one of the county's principal investigators in the case. "We'll try, but I doubt we will find much more."

HEADLINE: Yes, Stay Strong. What's Strong?

 BODY:
Former Soviet technicians are offering to sell their science to the West; it's the latest evidence of the Red Menace crumbling before our eyes. But that raises a new question. If the Soviet threat is no longer a yardstick for measuring America's strength, how is that strength to be measured?
It's idle to speculate about potential enemies. Military planners take a more practical, quantitative approach. They examine how much of a threat future situations might pose. And wherever they look, the threats they see are far smaller and more diffuse than those so long posed by the Soviet Union. 
 The Persian Gulf war provides a timely benchmark. Iraq had one of the largest armies ever fielded by a third world country. To oppose it, America stretched to the limit its ability to project power halfway around the globe. Even so, the U.S.-led coalition won handily.
How many other Iraqs are out there? Foreseeably, none. China and India each have larger forces, but there is no reason to expect aggression from either, and in any case, both would be constrained by fear of internal breakup. Perhaps Iran could eventually become another Iraq. North Korea seems less a potential threat every day.
None of these states can challenge America's technological edge without a faster pace of modernization than even the Soviets could sustain. The U.S. can afford to keep up research and development without introducing new weapons as quickly as it has been doing.
What about lesser contingencies? Washington might be asked to contribute forces to international peacekeeping in civil wars. But it's hard to imagine ever needing more than a couple of brigades, whose cost would be measured in millions, not billions. Police actions to interdict narcotics traffickers or terrorists, as in Panama, require sophisticated but also relatively small forces.
How many of these contingencies should the U.S. be prepared to meet at once? A prudent planner might hedge by sizing conventional forces to counter, say, one and a quarter Iraqs. That would permit the Pentagon to slash its budget for conventional forces, now just under $250 billion a year, by at least $90 billion come 1996.
What's true about conventional contingencies is true for nuclear threats. The U.S. needs to be prepared to keep renegade states from acquiring nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. But the means for doing so are primarily diplomatic and economic, not military. The U.S. could safely halve the roughly $40 billion a year it spends on nuclear forces -- forces mainly aimed at countering a Soviet conventional attack in Europe. U.S. nuclear forces need have no other purpose than to deter the use of nuclear arms by others.
In short, there's neither conventional nor nuclear reason to waste billions on what Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, acknowledges "is no longer really a threat-based force." The Pentagon has so far failed to present a realistic reappraisal; Congress will have to do the job. Sensible citizens understand the need for America to remain strong; they also understand that to waste billions will make America weak.

HEADLINE: One China, and the Moment of Truth

BYLINE: By Morton I. Abramowitz; Morton I. Abramowitz, former Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
We are slowly approaching a moment of truth in the more than 40-year saga of Taiwan's status.
Beijing, Taipei and Washington agree on the unity of China. In the National Assembly election last month, the people of Taiwan voted for the status quo, for prudence and prosperity -- for not alienating Beijing but not embracing it either. Flawed or not, that election -- 75 percent voted for the ruling Nationalist Party -- was a skirmish, not the end of the affair. Events in Taiwan, China and elsewhere may well undermine the "unity of China," although we should not underestimate the ability of the Chinese to devise an arrangement between the two parties. 
 Taiwan's success has transformed the issue. Few of the new republics in the former Soviet Union have developed as good a claim to nationhood as Taiwan. It is beginning to challenge Japan for economic influence in Southeast Asia. And an extraordinary $80 billion in foreign exchange reserves, it spreads its largesse around the world. The income disparities with China and the political decline in Beijing have added to Taiwan's sense of pride and independence.
The breakaway republics in Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union highlight Taiwan's anomalous status and encourage supporters of independence in Taiwan, the U.S. and other countries to urge that the de facto separation from China become de jure. China's heavy-handedness in Tibet and Hong Kong are adding fuel to aspirations for an independent Taiwan.
Moreover, China has become a bad word in Washington and many other capitals. Voices in Congress and the U.S. media propose self-determination for Taiwan, if only to press China to end political repression. China's Government, devoid of moral standing at home and run by old men fearful of turmoil, is easy to detest.
The Governments in Beijing and Taipei are playing for time and encouraging contacts, hoping something will turn up. Trade, investment and other ties between the two countries are growing sharply, creating the basis for a peaceful settlement. Whether China would or could do much militarily if Taiwan declared independence is debatable: China would still worry about America's response. But to assume inaction by Beijing would be rash; it can raise tensions in ways not involving the direct use of force.
In the Shanghai Communique in 1971, the U.S. adopted in effect a "one China but not now" policy. Despite our insistence, China has persistently refused to agree to pledge not to use force to resolve the issue.
Despite China's rapid economic growth this past decade, the Government's days are probably numbered. Since the unity of China is an emotional issue, leaders struggling for power will not make concessions about it and risk being branded traitors.
Our one-China policy has served us well and remains prudent in this period of transition in China. We do not want to stoke xenophobia and risk hostilities when political change seems on the horizon. Let's see what emerges from the passing of China's old men and the decline, if not disintegration, of the Communist state.
Our one-China policy can be swept away by events, as were our policies in support of central governments in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. But today the unity issue is far less important to us than before, whatever China's position in Asia. We can live with Taiwan independence or one China. We remain an important player, but the choice is increasingly up to the people of Taiwan. For our part, we need to speak less about the unity of China and more about a peaceful resolution of the issue.

The Middle Riddle

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
It is typical of the mental gimcrackery that passes for a public philosophy these days that our rulers are suddenly frantic to grant boons to the middle class. And what is it, this middle class, which all statesmen from President to Congressional doorkeeper now yearn to pelt with blessings?
It is an abstraction, a fragment of a campaign slogan, a piety on a demagogue's tongue, an insoluble calculus problem for demographers, a verbal crutch for economists and political writers required by the cruel nature of their trades to sound eloquent while waiting for an idea to pull into the station. 
 To whom or what in this imponderable vagueness shall political sweets be given? (Ah, sweet tax breaks!) It is a mystery, and there will be high comedy for the next few months watching politicians argue about where to ladle out the gravy.
The term "middle class" used to summon up good thoughts about American society. "Middle class" went with words like "hard-working," "salt of the earth," "patriotic," and "backbone of America."
For a long time politicians took it for granted that there was indeed a middle class, that it was the American majority, and that it was the constituency that elected them. Not surprisingly, government in this age tended to be one glorious boon for this good, hard-working, salt-of-the-earth, patriotic group of people.
If there was once some validity to this vast human oversimplification it pretty well ended during the 1970's when the amazing wealth of post-World-War-II America began to evaporate. Now two incomes became necessary to maintain the family living standard; now, two fewer children; now, an extortionate rental instead of an own-your-own for $2,000 down and a 4 1/2 percent mortgage.
Termites seemed to be eating the standard of living. With this silent impoverishment came dizzying inflation. (Thanks to the Vietnam War and to Middle East war and oil politics.) This, along with the collapse of party politics and resulting corruption of the tax structure, left a scene where lip service was still paid to middle-class uprightness but the law said, "Every man for himself and Devil take the hindmost."
The Saturday Evening Post, classic tribune of the middle class, was dead. The magazine for whatever the middle class had become was Tax Shelter Digest.
The conclusive proof that the old-style middle class had passed over was the landslide election of the Great Communicator with his trickle-down philosophy for redistributing the wealth. Millions who must have once thought themselves middle-class obviously felt sufficiently risen by 1980 to require a President dedicated to the notion that making the rich richer would be a blessing to all.
Four years later when the rich were definitely richer, the Communicator's landslide re-election suggested that most of the old middle class -- "Couldn't have done it without you, folks!" -- felt as one with the rich.
Now, an unbrave new world: ruin, debt, unemployment, Japanophobia, Milkenism in the ashes, Buchanan amok, and whining, whining everywhere. And yet . . . out of the ruins . . . what is this we see being reborn? Is it the Phoenix? Is it the Great Communicator? Is it Mario Cuomo at last?
No. It is the middle class. Politicians galore declare it risen. The class that made America great is back! Something must be done for it quickly. And please, don't ask what has made it stop feeling as one with the rich and start feeling middle-class again. No ham-handed sarcasm with this splendid class. This is the class that votes, remember. Salt of the earth. Honest as the day is long. It votes. Remember that. Votes.
But how to tell who is middle-class, hence boon-deserving, and who not? There are telltale signs. A car telephone, for example, is not middle class. Has a secretary? Definitely not middle class. Drives a $30,000 German or Japanese car? Not middle class. Summer house? Nosirree. Gets by on one income? Not middle class.
Have to borrow Thursday night to make it to the pay window Friday? All right, middle class, provided they don't subscribe to Tax Shelter Digest.
My Jan. 11 column incorrectly described the Duesenberg as a car of German make. As many correspondents have pointed out with considerable wit and kindness, it was made in America. Sorry, car fans.

THE FOUR LITTLE DRAGONS
The Spread of Industrialization in East Asia.
By Ezra F. Vogel.
138 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $16.95. 
 THIS has been a tough year for free-marketeers in Washington, who find themselves trying to explain why the United States is practically the only major industrial power without a cohesive industrial policy. The recession that has hit the United States so dramatically is felt much less in Asia, home of the world's most booming economies. Without question, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other industrial powerhouses in the region have their share of economic woes -- many of them an echo of problems in the United States. But many of them also seem to share a skill that has all too often eluded American society: the ability to put government and industry to work at focusing national economies on high-growth, strategically vital industries.
In his latest and slimmest book on Asia, Ezra F. Vogel, the Henry Ford 2d Professor of Social Sciences at Harvard University, who has written extensively about Japan and China, tries to explain how government and industry have interacted in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, turning charity-case nations into business school case studies. "The Four Little Dragons" may be the quickest dose of reality yet for anyone left with a romantic vision of Asia. And while at times it suffers from superficiality and a strangely benevolent view of authoritarian regimes, it has a lot to say about how nations keep their eyes on the ball.
What makes the so-called four dragons such important topics of study these days is that, in the years leading up to the war in Vietnam, they were the dominoes supposedly waiting to fall. But while none of them became Communist, none of them chose capitalism either -- at least not in the American sense. Instead, they turned to various forms of the Japanese model -- what one Singapore official terms "capitalism with socialist characteristics."
Though American economists tend to lump the four dragons together as very similar economies, and by implication similar societies, Mr. Vogel is at his best when he describes what different economic animals they really are. He draws a picture of South Korea, for example, as a nation virtually obsessed by its competition with its onetime colonial ruler, Japan. Almost half a century after the end of World War II, he writes, the Korean relationship with the Japanese is "not 'love and hate' but 'respect and hate.' " Yet Korea, more than any other country in the region, has mimicked the Japanese system. It has set up replicas of each of the bureaucratic entities Japan has used to target industries; the Korean chaebol -- huge business conglomerates -- are closely patterned on the zaibatsu that Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and others established before the war (and that live on today, though with far less central control, through Japan's famous keiretsu system of interlocking ownership). Indeed, in work habits and dedication, the Koreans are so much like the Japanese that they scare Tokyo to death -- or at least they did until steps toward democratization in South Korea brought far higher wages and far less docile workers, and now far less competitive exports.
Taiwan, in contrast, is a land of entrepreneurs who are allowed a much freer hand than their Korean counterparts. There the secret is guanxi -- carefully nurtured connections -- and family businesses. Overarching these is the Taiwan regime. It has built an enormous infrastructure, including Government-run manufacturing parks that breed computer companies, chip makers and -- in the last few months -- an aerospace firm that bought 40 percent of McDonnell Douglas's commercial aircraft business. But the relationship between the entrepreneurs and the Government planners seems less direct, more elusive, in Taiwan than elsewhere, and Mr. Vogel's explanations of how it works are unsatisfying. At one point, raising the question of why Taiwan has been better able to penetrate the American market than most other third world countries, he concludes simply that "the people in resource-poor Taiwan were in general more eager than their counterparts in other parts of the world to respond to these opportunities."
The shortest treatment is given to the two most fascinating of the dragons: Singapore and Hong Kong, the tiny city-states that, emerging from British colonization and wartime ruin, have learned to live by their wits as the finance and manufacturing centers of the West in Asia. Few countries plan every facet of life the way Singapore does, and few could thrive under the imminent threat of economic extinction the way Hong Kong has been doing in the years before its reversion to China in 1997. What Mr. Vogel leaves out is much talk of the future: Does Singapore have the critical mass of talent to develop its own technology and industry, rather than relying on the United States and Japan? Does Hong Kong's economic vitality have long-term prospects under Beijing's thumb?
Trying to draw the experiences of these four vastly different cultures together, Mr. Vogel toys with theories about the dragons' (and Japan's) common ethos of "industrial neo-Confucianism," in which bureaucrats, "selected on the basis of merit, had a sense of responsibility for the overall social order, including the overall moral tone of the society." Perhaps so, but Confucius would probably have been taken aback by the moral tone of a Japan racked by influence-peddling scandals, or of a Taiwan and Hong Kong where corruption is rampant, or of a South Korea dominated by selfish, family-owned conglomerates. Fear, in fact, may be as good an explanation of Asia's success as Confucianism: South Korea's fear of Japan and the North, Taiwan's fear of Japan and China, Hong Kong's fear of Beijing, Singapore's fear of everyone bigger than itself. For each, industry has meant security.
One wishes "The Four Little Dragons" were a bit longer, and detailed not only economic success but also the price of that success to democratic values. South Korea's leadership brutally suppressed dissent, and Taiwan's was not much better. Even in modern Seoul, more than 1,000 political prisoners remain in jail, held by a democratically elected regime that still feels insecure, though its success over the Communist North is beyond question. When Singapore had an election a few months ago and the ruling party lost a handful of seats for the first time, the new generation of leaders began wondering aloud whether they had gone too far in creating a kinder, gentler regime. In short, what the four dragons often admire most about Japan is the facet that Americans admire least -- the control of a society by a single party that is supported by a business elite whose interests prevail in virtually every domestic battle.
Still, there are many lessons that Americans might learn from the four dragons. The most fundamental may be that a government that intervenes in an economy through industrial planning does not necessarily "pick winners" -- as the Bush Administration puts it every time it warns against tinkering with the invisible hand. Instead, such a government picks directions, strategic industries that everyone, from the Japanese to the Germans, seems capable of identifying. And in the industrial policies of the four dragons there is a shared sense of national purpose in building economic enterprises, a sense that even shop workers and bolt-tighteners seem to possess.
To compete in today's global economy, the United States will also have to develop a shared sense of economic goals, as it did during World War II and, in some industries, during the cold war. At least we have the advantage of knowing it can be done if we wish. For, as Mr. Vogel so capably demonstrates, several models of how to do it lie west across the Pacific.

HEADLINE: How to End the Abortion War

BYLINE: By Roger Rosenblatt; Roger Rosenblatt is editor-at-large for Life magazine and the regular essayist on the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour. This is an adaptation from his book "Life Itself," which will be published in March by Random House.

 BODY:
THE VEINS IN HIS forehead bulged so prominently they might have been blue worms that had worked their way under the surface of his skin. His eyes bulged, too, capillaries zigzagging from the pupils in all directions. His face was pulled tight about the jaw, which thrust forward like a snowplow attachment on the grille of a truck. From the flattened O of his mouth, the word "murderer" erupted in a regular rhythm, the repetition of the r's giving the word the sound of an outboard motor that failed to catch.
She, for her part, paced up and down directly in front of him, saying nothing. Instead, she held high a large cardboard sign on a stick, showing the cartoonish drawing of a bloody coat hanger over the caption, "Never again." Like his, her face was taut with fury, her lips pressed together so tightly they folded under and vanished. Whenever she drew close to him, she would deliberately lower the sign and turn it toward him, so that he would be yelling his "murderer" at the picture of the coat hanger. 
 For nearly 20 years these two have been at each other with all the hatred they can unearth. Sometimes the man is a woman, sometimes the woman a man. They are black, white, Hispanic, Asian; they make their homes in Missouri or New Jersey; they are teen-agers and pharmacists and college professors; Catholic, Baptist, Jew. They have exploded at each other on the steps of the Capitol in Washington, in front of abortion clinics, hospitals and politicians' homes, on village greens and the avenues of cities. Their rage is tireless; at every decision of the United States Supreme Court or of the President or of the state legislatures, it rises like a missile seeking only the heat of its counterpart.
This is where America is these days on the matter of abortion, or where it seems to be. In fact, it is very hard to tell how the country really feels about abortion, because those feelings are almost always displayed in political arenas. Most ordinary people do not speak of abortion. Friends who gladly debate other volatile issues -- political philosophy, war, race -- shy away from the subject. It is too private, too personal, too bound up with one's faith or spiritual identity. Give abortion five seconds of thought, and it quickly spirals down in the mind to the most basic questions about human life, to the mysteries of birth and our relationship with our souls.
We simply will not talk about it. We will march in demonstrations, shout and carry placards, but we will not talk about it. In the Presidential election of 1992, we will cast votes for a national leader based in part on his or her position on abortion. Still, we will not talk about it.
The oddity in this unnatural silence is that most of us actually know what we feel about abortion. But because those feelings are mixed and complicated, we have decided that they are intractable. I believe the opposite is true: that we are more prepared than we realize to reach a common, reasonable understanding on this subject, and if we were to vent our mixed feelings and begin to make use of them, a resolution would be at hand.
Seventy-three percent of Americans polled in 1990 were in favor of abortion rights. Seventy-seven percent polled also regard abortion as a kind of killing. (Forty-nine percent see abortion as outright murder, 28 percent solely as the taking of human life.) These figures represent the findings of the Harris and Gallup polls, respectively, and contain certain nuances of opinion within both attitudes. But the general conclusions are widely considered valid. In other words, most Americans are both for the choice of abortion as a principle and against abortion for themselves. One has to know nothing else to realize how conflicted a problem we have before and within us.
The fact that abortion entails conflict, however, does not mean that the country is bound to be locked in combat forever. In other contexts, living with conflict is not only normal to America, it is often the only way to function honestly. We are for both Federal assistance and states' autonomy; we are for both the First Amendment and normal standards of propriety; we are for both the rights of privacy and the needs of public health. Our most productive thinking usually contains an inner confession of mixed feelings. Our least productive thinking, a nebulous irritation resulting from a refusal to come to terms with disturbing and patently irreconcilable ideas.
Yet acknowledging and living with ambivalence is, in a way, what America was invented to do. To create a society in which abortion is permitted and its gravity appreciated is to create but another of the many useful frictions of a democratic society. Such a society does not devalue life by allowing abortion; it takes life with utmost seriousness and is, by the depth of its conflicts and by the richness of its difficulties, a reflection of life itself.
Why, then, are we stuck in political warfare on this issue? Why can we not make use of our ambivalence and move on?
The answer has to do with America's peculiar place in the history of abortion, and also with the country's special defining characteristics, both ancient and modern, with which abortion has collided. In the 4,000-year-old history extending from the Greeks and Romans through the Middle Ages and into the present, every civilization has taken abortion with utmost seriousness. Yet ours seems to be the only civilization to have engaged in an emotional and intellectual civil war over the issue.
There are several reasons for this. The more obvious include the general lack of consensus in the country since the mid-60's, which has promoted bitter divisions over many social issues -- race, crime, war and abortion, too. The sexual revolution of the 60's resulted in the heightened activity of people who declared themselves "pro-choice" and  "pro-life" -- misleading terms used here principally for convenience. The pro-life movement began in 1967, six years before Roe v. Wade. The women's movement, also revitalized during the 60's, gave an impetus for self-assertion to women on both sides of the abortion issue.
But there are less obvious reasons, central to America's special character, which have helped to make abortion an explosive issue in this country:
Religiosity. America is, and always has been, a religious country, even though it spreads its religiosity among many different religions. Perry Miller, the great historian of American religious thought, established that the New England colonists arrived with a ready-made religious mission, which they cultivated and sustained through all its manifestations, from charity to intolerance. The Virginia settlement, too, was energized by God's glory. Nothing changed in this attitude by the time the nation was invented. If anything, the creation of the United States of America made the desire to receive redemption in the New World more intense.
Yet individuals sought something in American religion that was different, more emotional than the religion practiced in England. One member of an early congregation explained that the reason he made the long journey to America was "I thought I should find feelings." This personalized sense of religion, which has endured to the present, has an odd but telling relationship with the national attitude toward religion. Officially, America is an a-religious country; the separation of church and state is so rooted in the democracy it has become a cliche. Yet that same separation has created and intensified a hidden national feeling about faith and God, a sort of secret, undercurrent religion, which, perhaps because of its subterranean nature, is often more deeply felt and volatile than that of countries with official or state religions.
The Catholic Church seems more steadily impassioned about abortion in America than anywhere else, even in a country like Poland -- so agitated, in fact, that it has entered into an unlikely, if not unholy, alliance with evangelical churches in the pro-life camp. In Catholic countries like Italy, France and Ireland, religion is often so fluidly mixed with social life that rules are bent more quietly, without our personal sort of moral upheaval.
Americans are moral worriers. We tend to treat every political dispute that arises as a test of our national soul. The smallest incident, like the burning of the flag, can bring our hidden religion to the surface. The largest and most complex moral problem, like abortion, can confound it for decades.
Individualism. Two basic and antithetical views of individualism have grown up with the country. Emerson, the evangelist of self-reliance and nonconformity, had a quasi-mystical sense of the value of the individual self. He described man as a self-sufficient microcosm: "The lightning which explodes and fashions planets, maker of planets and suns, is in him." Tocqueville had a more prosaic and practical view. He worried about the tendency of Americans to withdraw into themselves at the expense of the public good, confusing self-assertion with self-absorption.
Abortion hits both of these views of the individual head on, of course; but both views are open to antipodal interpretations. The Emersonian celebration of the individual may be shared by the pro-choice advocate who sees in individualism one's right to privacy. It may be seen equally by a pro-life advocate as a justification for taking an individual stance -- an anti-liberal stance to boot -- on a matter of conscience.
The idea of the independent individual may also be embraced by the pro-life position as the condition of life on which the unborn have a claim immediately after conception. Pro-life advocates see the pregnant woman as two individuals, each with an equal claim to the riches that American individualism offers.
Tocqueville's concern with individualism as selfishness is also available for adoption by both camps. The pro-life people claim that the pro-choice advocates are placing their individual rights above those of society; and one of the fundamental rights of American society is the right to life. Even the Supreme Court, when it passed Roe v. Wade, concluded that abortion "is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation."
To those who believe in abortion rights, the "public good" consists of a society in which people, collectively, have the right to privacy and individual choice. Their vision of an unselfish, unself-centered America is one in which the collective sustains its strength by encouraging the independence of those who comprise it. Logically, both camps rail against the individual imposing his or her individual views on society at large, each feeling the same, if opposite, passion about both what society and the individual ought to be. Passion on this subject has led to rage.
Optimism. The American characteristic of optimism, like that of individualism, is affected by abortion in contradictory ways. People favoring the pro-life position see optimism exactly as they read individual rights: Every American, born or unborn, is entitled to look forward to a state of infinite hope and progress. The process of birth is itself an optimistic activity.
Taking the opposite view, those favoring abortion rights interpret the ideas of hope and progress as a consequence of one's entitlement to free choice in all things, abortion definitely included. If the individual woman wishes to pursue her manifest destiny unencumbered by children she does not want, that is not only her business but her glory. The issue is national as well as personal. The pro-choice reasoning goes: The country may only reach its ideal goals if women, along with men, are allowed to achieve their highest potential as citizens, unburdened by limitations that are not of their own choosing.
Even the element of American "can-do" ingenuity applies. The invention of abortion, like other instruments of American optimism, supports both the pro-life and pro-choice stands. Hail the procedure for allowing women to realize full control over their invented selves. Or damn the procedure for destroying forever the possibility of a new life inventing itself. As with all else pertaining to this issue, one's moral position depends on the direction in which one is looking. Yet both directions are heaving with optimism, and both see life in America as the best of choices.
Sexuality. The connection of abortion with American attitudes toward sexuality is both economic and social. The American way with sex is directly related to the country's original desire to become a society of the middle class, and thus to cast off the extremes of luxury and poverty that characterized Europe and the Old World. The structure of English society, in particular, was something the new nation sought to avoid. Not for Puritan America was the rigid English class system, which not only fixed people into economically immobile slots but allowed and encouraged free-wheeling sexual behavior at both the highest and lowest strata.
At the top of the English classes was a self-indulgent minority rich enough to ignore middle-class moral codes and idle enough to spend their time seducing servants. At the opposite end of the system, the poor also felt free to do whatever they wished with their bodies, since the world offered them so little. The masses of urban poor, created by the Industrial Revolution, had little or no hope of bettering their lot. Many of them wallowed in a kind of sexual Pandemonium, producing babies wantonly and routinely engaging in rape and incest. Between the two class extremes stood the staunch English middle class, with its hands on its hips, outraged at the behavior both above and below them, but powerless to insist on, much less enforce, bourgeois values.
This was not to be the case in America, where bourgeois values were to become the standards and the moral engine of the country. Puritanism, a mere aberrant religion to the English, who were able to get rid of it in 1660 after a brief 18 years, was the force that dominated American social life for a century and a half. Since there has been a natural progression from Puritanism to Victorianism and from Victorianism to modern forms of fundamentalism in terms of social values, it may be said that the Puritans have really never loosened their headlock on American thinking. The Puritans offered a perfect context for America's desire to create a ruling middle class, which was to be known equally for infinite mobility (geographic, social, economic) and the severest forms of repression.
Abortion fits into such thinking more by what the issue implies than by what it is. In the 1800's and the early 1900's, Americans were able to live with abortion, even during periods of intense national prudery, as long as the practice was considered the exception that proved the rule. The rule was that abortion was legally and morally discouraged. Indeed, most every modern civilization has adopted that attitude, which, put simply, is an attitude of looking the other way in a difficult human situation, which often cannot and should not be avoided. For all its adamant middle-classedness, it was not uncomfortable for Americans to look the other way, either -- at least until recently.
When abortion was no longer allowed to be a private, albeit dangerous, business, however, especially during the sexual revolution of the 60's, America's basic middle-classedness asserted itself loudly. Who was having all these abortions? The upper classes, who were behaving irresponsibly, and the lower orders, who had nothing to lose. Abortion, in other words, was a sign of careless sexuality and was thus an offense to the bourgeois dream.
The complaint was, and is, that abortion contradicts middle-class values, which dictate the rules of sexual conduct. Abortion, it is assumed, is the practice of the socially irresponsible, those who defy the solid norms that keep America intact. When Roe v. Wade was ruled upon, it sent the harshest message to the American middle class, including those who did not oppose abortion themselves but did oppose the disruption of conformity and stability. If they -- certainly the middle-class majority -- did not object to Roe v. Wade specifically, they did very much object to the atmosphere of lawlessness or unruliness that they felt the law encouraged. Thus the outcry; thus the warfare.
THERE MAY BE one other reason for abortion's traumatic effect on the country in recent years. Since the end of the Second World War -- American society, not unlike modern Western societies in general, has shifted intellectually from a humanistic to a social science culture; that is, from a culture used to dealing with contrarieties to one that demands definite, provable answers. The nature of social science is that it tends not only to identify, but to create issues that must be solved. Often these issues are the most significant to the country's future -- civil rights, for example.
What social science thinking does not encourage is human sympathy. By that I do not mean the sentimental feeling that acknowledges another's pain or discomfort; I mean the intellectual sympathy that accepts another's views as both interesting and potentially valid, that deliberately goes to the heart of the thinking of the opposition and spends some time there. That sort of humanistic thinking may or may not be humane, but it does offer the opportunity to arrive at a humane understanding outside the realm and rules of politics. In a way, it is a literary sort of thinking, gone now from a post-literary age, a "reading" of events to determine layers of depth, complication and confusion and to learn to live with them.
Everything that has happened in the abortion debate has been within the polarities that social science thinking creates. The quest to determine when life begins is a typical exercise of social science -- the attempt to impose objective precision on a subjective area of speculation. Arguments over the mother's rights versus the rights of the unborn child are social science arguments, too. The social sciences are far more interested in rights than in how one arrives at what is right -- that is both their strength and weakness. Thus the abortion debate has been political from the start.
A good many pro-choice advocates, in fact, came to lament the political character of the abortion debate when it first began in the 60's. At that time, political thinking in America was largely and conventionally liberal. The liberals had the numbers; therefore they felt that they could set the national agenda without taking into account the valid feelings or objections of the conservative opposition. When, in the Presidential election of 1980, it became glaringly apparent that the feelings of the conservative opposition were not only valid but were politically ascendant, many liberals reconsidered the idea that abortion was purely a rights issue. They expressed appreciation of a more emotionally complicated attitude, one they realized that they shared themselves, however they might vote.
If the abortion debate had risen in a humanistic environment, it might never have achieved the definition and clarity of the Roe v. Wade decision, yet it might have moved toward a greater public consensus. One has to guess at such things through hindsight, of course. But in a world in which humanistic thought predominated, abortion might have been taken up more in its human terms and the debate might have focused more on such unscientific and apolitical components as human guilt, human choice and human mystery.
If we could find the way to retrieve this kind of conflicted thinking, and find a way to apply it to the country's needs, we might be on our way toward a common understanding on abortion, and perhaps toward a common good. Abortion requires us to think one way and another way simultaneously. Americans these days could make very good use of this bifurcated way of thinking.
This brings me back to the concern I voiced at the beginning: Americans are not speaking their true minds about abortion because their minds are in conflict. Yet living with conflict is normal in America, and our reluctance to do so openly in this matter, while understandable in an atmosphere of easy polarities, may help create a false image of our country in which we do not recognize ourselves. An America that declares abortion legal and says nothing more about it would be just as distorted as one that prohibited the practice. The ideal situation, in my view, would consist of a combination of laws, attitudes and actions that would go toward satisfying both the rights of citizens and the doubts held by most of them.
Achieving this goal is, I believe, within reach. I know how odd that must sound when one considers the violent explosions that have occurred in places like Wichita as recently as August of last year, or when one sees the pro-life and pro-choice camps amassing ammunition for this year's Presidential campaign. But for the ordinary private citizen, the elements of a reasonably satisfying resolution are already in place. I return to the fact that the great majority of Americans both favor abortion rights and disapprove of abortion. Were that conflict of thought to be openly expressed, and were certain social remedies to come from it, we would not find a middle of the road on this issue -- logically there is no middle of the road. But we might well establish a wider road, which would accommodate a broad range of beliefs and opinions and allow us to move on to more important social concerns.
What most Americans want to do with abortion is to permit but discourage it. Even those with the most pronounced political stands on the subject reveal this duality in the things they say; while making strong defenses of their positions, they nonetheless, if given time to work out their thoughts, allow for opposing views. I discovered this in a great many interviews over the past three years.
Pro-choice advocates are often surprised to hear themselves speak of the immorality of taking a life. Pro-life people are surprised to hear themselves defend individual rights, especially women's rights. And both sides might be surprised to learn how similar are their visions of a society that makes abortion less necessary through sex education, help for unwanted babies, programs to shore up disintegrating families and moral values and other forms of constructive community action. Such visions may appear Panglossian, but they have been realized before, and the effort is itself salutary.
If one combines that sense of social responsibility with the advocacy of individual rights, the permit but-discourage formula could work. By "discourage," I mean the implementation of social programs that help to create an atmosphere of discouragement. I do not mean ideas like parental consent or notification, already the law in some states, which, however well-intentioned, only whittle away at individual freedoms. The "discourage" part is the easier to find agreement on, of course, but when one places the "permit" question in the realm of respect for private values, even that may become more palatable.
Already 73 percent of America finds abortion acceptable. Even more may find it so if they can tolerate living in a country in which they may exercise the individual right not to have an abortion themselves or to argue against others having one, yet still go along with the majority who want the practice continued. The key element for all is to create social conditions in which abortion will be increasingly unnecessary. It is right that we have the choice, but it would be better if we did not have to make it.
Were this balance of thought and attitude to be expressed publicly, it might serve some of the country's wider purposes as well, especially these days when there is so much anguish over how we have lost our national identity and character. The character we lost, it seems to me, was one that exalted the individual for what the individual did for the community. It honored and embodied both privacy and selflessness. A balanced attitude on abortion would also do both. It would make a splendid irony if this most painful and troublesome issue could be converted into a building block for a renewed national pride based on good will.
For that to happen, the country's leaders -- Presidential candidates come to mind -- have to express themselves as well. As for Congress, it hardly seems too much to expect our representatives to say something representative about the issue. Should Roe v. Wade be overturned, as may well happen, the country could be blown apart. To leave the matter to the states would lead to mayhem, a balkanization of what ought to be standard American rights. Congress used to pass laws, remember? I think it is time for Congress to make a law like Roe v. Wade that fully protects abortion rights, but legislates the kind of community help, like sex education, that would diminish the practice.
Taking a stand against abortion while allowing for its existence can turn out to be a progressive philosophy. It both speaks for moral seriousness and moves in the direction of ameliorating conditions of ignorance, poverty, the social self-destruction of fragmented families and the loss of spiritual values in general. What started as a debate as to when life begins might lead to making life better.
The effort to reduce the necessity of abortion, then, is to choose life as wholeheartedly as it is to be "pro-life." By such an effort, one is choosing life for millions who do not want to be, who do not deserve to be, forever hobbled by an accident, a mistake or by miseducation. By such an effort, one is also choosing a different sort of life for the country as a whole -- a more sympathetic life in which we acknowledge, privileged and unprivileged alike, that we have the same doubts and mysteries and hopes for one another.
Earlier, I noted America's obsessive moral character, our tendency to treat every question that comes before us as a test of our national soul. The permit-but-discourage formula on abortion offers the chance to test our national soul by appealing to its basic egalitarian impulse. Were we once again to work actively toward creating a country where everyone had the same health care, the same sex education, the same opportunity for economic survival, the same sense of personal dignity and worth, we would see both fewer abortions and a more respectable America.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
For Actors, TV Can Upstage Broadway

BYLINE: By HILARY DE VRIES; Hilary de Vries writes about the performing arts for The Los Angeles Times and other publications.

 BODY:
This past Fall, when The Fox comedy series "Roc" had its premiere, the sitcom was regarded as something of a first for network television. Almost the entire cast, beginning with the star, Charles Dutton, had been hired from the 1990 Broadway production of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama "The Piano Lesson."
But "Roc" is only one of several series employing stage actors as regulars. While television and the New York theater have often borrowed each other's players, lately there seem to be more stage-trained actors than ever on television. Among those appearing on network shows are such theater veterans as Sam Waterston ("I'll Fly Away" on NBC), Angela Lansbury ("Murder, She Wrote" on CBS), Patti LuPone ("Life Goes On" on ABC), Swoosie Kurtz ("Sisters" on NBC), Barnard Hughes ("Blossom" on NBC) and the comedian and performance artist Ann Magnuson ("Anything but Love" on ABC). 
 As stage productions on and off Broadway get more scarce in the face of escalating costs and the recession, network series jobs -- with their regular paychecks and chance for greater payoffs should a show go into syndication -- glow ever brighter.
While the four actors interviewed here voiced regret over their departure from full-time theater careers, they all say it is the rare performer who can work exclusively on the stage today.
 
 
Jason Alexander
 In 1988, Mr. Alexander (below right, with Jerry Seinfeld) was handed his own network comedy series, "Everything's Relative." Six weeks later CBS canceled the show after less-than-stellar ratings and reviews. So three years ago, when the producers of the NBC sitcom "Seinfeld" asked Mr. Alexander to play the neurotic sidekick to Jerry Seinfeld, the actor says he "was a little wary of television and also a little concerned about playing a supporting role." What convinced Mr. Alexander, who had won a Tony Award for his performance in "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," to take a second chance "was the fact that the material was so good."
Also, he continues, "Doing television enables you to live very well -- and I am a slave to living well. But I didn't say yes to 'Seinfeld' in order to live well. I did it to raise my marketability in the film industry. "Would I leave the show for a 10-picture deal?" asks Mr. Alexander. "I would drop it like a rock.
"I'm not exanding my horizons as an actor in television," he says, "and it's easy to get glib as a performer." To keep his stage muscles tuned, Mr. Alexander takes acting lessons. "If I stay away from the stage for too long I will really get petrified of performing live," he says. "Doing TV, I could drop dead and all they'd have to say is, 'Hold the roll.' "
 
 
Ann Magnuson
 Although she is best known to TV audiences as Catherine, the high-strung editor on the ABC series "Anything but Love," Ms. Magnuson (at right) has one of the more eclectic resumes among actors working in network television. A performance artist whose material had political overtones, Ms. Magnuson has written and performed several one-woman shows, a critically acclaimed video, "Made for TV," a TV comedy special, "Vandemonium," and performed with several cult bands. She has also appeared in several films, including Susan Seidelman's "Making Mr. Right."
"Neo-vaudevillian? Info-tainer? Oh, I don't care what you call me, just call me," says the actress, who says she moved into television a few years ago "for money and clout -- the only two reasons anybody does television. Also, I didn't know where to go in my performance work." A regular paycheck, the actress says, "is a godsend if you're an actor and a miracle if you're an actress."
 Ms. Magnuson says that playing Catherine -- Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis's boss -- "gives me more to do than most movie parts I've read. And I don't have the pressure to be likable that Jamie and Richard have." While this may be the last season for "Anything but Love," the actress says that she would like to spin the character off "into my own television show -- sort of an updated 'That Girl' or a combination 'Carol Burnett' and 'A Current Affair.' "
 
 
Barnard Hughes
 Last season, when Mr. Hughes (below) was invited to play the jazz-playing, track-betting, girlfriend-squiring grandfather on the NBC sitcom "Blossom," the 76-year-old actor did not hesitate.
"I was delighted to play an old rogue and not fall into another of those cuddly grandpa roles," says Mr. Hughes. "I'm a very lucky older actor. I look at TV and I don't see as many white heads as one might have hoped."
 On television, he starred in the 1980's CBS series "The Cavanaughs" and appeared on "Lou Grant." Mr. Hughes is perhaps best known for his Tony Award-winning performance in the title role of the Broadway drama "Da," a role he later reprised in the film version. Two years ago, he appeared on Broadway in Craig Lucas's romantic comedy "Prelude to a Kiss."
"I commute, really," says Mr. Hughes, who spends part of each month at his home in New York. "You have to play both coasts nowadays. We've had these dips in the theater before, but this is more serious. Usually I get at least one play script sent to me each season, but this year, I haven't received one."
 Although he says that the "continuous employment" offered by a series "is nice," Mr. Hughes maintains a certain pragmatism toward the less rigorous artistic demands of television. "There is not a great delving required for these parts, and I try not to complicate it more than neccessary," he says. "Basically, I just think I'm on stage and let them take my picture."
 
Patti LuPone
 When Ms. LuPone (at left) last appeared on Broadway, in the 1987 revival of Cole Porter's musical "Anything Goes," she earned raves for her portrayal of Reno Sweeney, the nightclub singer-evangelist first played by Ethel Merman in 1934. Seven years earlier, Ms. LuPone had won a Tony for playing the egotistical Argentine leader Eva Peron in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical "Evita." Network TV might be the last place one would look for this intensely theatrical actress. But for the last three seasons, Ms. LuPone has played a middle-aged, middle-class mother of three (including a son with Down's syndrome) on ABC's "Life Goes On."
"The only difference I can discern is energy," says Ms. LuPone. "Once the curtain goes up on stage, it is relentless. Doing episodic television without a studio audience is very similar to a long technical dress rehearsal. It's a lot of stop and go."
Like many other actors, Ms. LuPone moved to Los Angeles to pursue television "because there is so little work in New York now, and an actor has to go where the work is." During a post-"Evita" drought, Ms. LuPone moved to London to take on the role of Fantine in "Les Miserables." Now that such theatrical options are rare, says Ms. LuPone, any stigma attached to a Tony winner working in television has disappeared.
"Today you look at a good script no matter where it comes from. And there are more roles for women in television than there are in film."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Signs of Hope For a Cultural City In Fiscal Distress

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

 BODY:
Yes, New York is in trouble. Yes, the city's spirit is down in the dumps. And yes, it's getting almost tiresome to hear everyone point to the city's cultural richness as one of the very few reasons to have any hope about New York's future. After all, since there's no money, the cultural institutions that make New York what it is can hardly be getting any better, right? By now it's a commonplace to observe that some museums and theater companies are struggling just to pay the electric bill.
True enough. But somehow in this time of recession, three of the city's greatest cultural institutions -- the Brooklyn Museum, Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall -- have managed to expand their reach and their range with superb new construction that enriches the city considerably. All three projects represent skillful mergings of private philanthropy and public funds, and if the seeds for them were sown in the prosperous 80's, the benefits are ours to reap in the troubled 90's. 
 The projects are rooms, not buildings, so let's not get carried away; this is not exactly a new Carnegie Hall we're talking about here. But the quality of all three spaces is such that it sends the message that the city's cultural institutions have put aside neither hope nor architectural standards -- that they know their futures must be played out here, not elsewhere, and that they intend to bequeath to future generations the strongest architectural presence they can.
One of these new spaces, the Walter Reade Theater, designed by the architect Lewis Davis of Davis, Brody & Associates, is part of an entirely new structure, the Rose Building at Lincoln Center. The other two new cultural spaces have been added to older buildings: the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Auditorium at the Brooklyn Museum, designed by Arata Isozaki and James Stewart Polshek, and the East Room and museum at Carnegie Hall, also designed by Mr. Polshek.
The 400-seat Cantor Auditorium for lectures, concerts and films is the architectural triumph of this trio. It is one of the few new halls in New York so good it is worth seeing empty; Mr. Isozaki and Mr. Polshek have crafted a spectacular space, at once crisp and comforting. Mr. Isozaki has always had a remarkable gift for imbuing simple geometric forms with great power, and so it is here at the Brooklyn Museum, where the softly undulating white plaster ceiling emanates a sense of being beneath the surface of the sea. Not literally, of course -- this is no Disneyland -- but more in the sense of an abstraction made vivid.
The walls of the auditorium are covered with a grid of oak panels, exquisitely matched; perforated stainless-steel panels, lined with sound-absorbing fabric, cover the rear wall and the front base of the stage, providing just the right counterpoint to the warmth of the oak.
The room is a masterly essay in balance. It is laser-sharp, yet warm and tranquil. Existing columns (the space is part of a large and undistinguished wing of the museum built in the 1970's), which could have been a liability, enhance the sense of balance further by punctuating the space, a soft rhythm playing against the sleek walls.
The Cantor Auditorium is the first portion of the Brooklyn Museum's ambitious master plan to be completed -- and with the exception of some gallery renovations and new storage areas, the only part of the master plan likely to be realized for a long time, economic realities being what they are. In this sense the new room is an occasion for wistfulness as much as joy, for its impeccable quality tells us what we -- rather than our children or grandchildren -- might have been able to see had this institution the wherewithal to build the sprawling additions designed by Mr. Isozaki and Mr. Polshek at any time in the near future.
The 268-seat Walter Reade Theater is the first permanent home the Film Society of Lincoln Center has ever had; until now it has been a tenant of Lincoln Center's other auditoriums. What the architect Lewis Davis has wrought here, if without quite the degree of finesse of the Cantor Auditorium, may well be the finest room in which to view films in New York, a space that brings the amenities and intimacy of a private screening room to the scale of a full-size theater. This soft and easy room is not, to be sure, anything like the great movie palaces of old; it is serene but not lushly decorated, and it will feel large only to a generation accustomed to watching movies in boxy little rooms in multi-plexes.
But surely the moviegoing experience has not been so pleasurable in New York since the Roxy disappeared. The Walter Reade doesn't awe, but it envelops, and everything here is in the service of film-watching. Visitors enter through a large foyer, the Frieda and Roy Furman Gallery, which also serves as an exhibition area; the auditorium itself is a calm, relaxing gray, with exceedingly comfortable seats and perfect sightlines. The screen is large, the sound ideal.
Some kind of soft-edged, warm modernism is obviously the mode of the moment for established cultural institutions, since it is present in the new public areas of Carnegie Hall as well. Carnegie Hall's new museum, endowed by Elihu and Susan Rose, is tucked into a space just east of the main auditorium, and it is a richly glowing room, paneled in mahogany accented with strips of brass. The walls are lined with glass display cases containing a handsome array of memorabilia of the hall, and on the floor is a colorful carpet with an abstract motif based on the shape of a grand piano. There is a vague attempt in some of the decorative motifs to echo the Viennese Secessionist style that Mr. Polshek introduced in new balcony railings and marquee added for the hall's renovation in 1986.
The room opens into what Carnegie officials have dubbed the East Room, a large reception area tucked into a lower floor of Carnegie Hall Tower, the Cesar Pelli-designed office building recently completed next door to the hall. Mr. Polshek's interior design is the same here, and together with the museum, this genial room now significantly improves the quality of public space open to concertgoers.
All three of these rooms were made possible only by complex public-private partnerships: in each case, a modest commitment of public money leveraged significant private philanthropy. In an age when the public purse is small and urgently pressed by greater social needs, philanthropy is the only way cultural institutions are likely to see any kind of physical improvements at all. But the public involvement in all these projects is nonetheless crucial, not only as seed money, but as a statement of the importance of the public realm.
These projects, small as they are, make a stab at improving the quality of life in New York, simply because they transform the public realm into something grander, more generous, more inviting. They are testaments to the certainty of cultural life in New York, to the belief in its future, and to the meaning of public places -- and as such, they imbue us with a sense of pride and a sense of possibility.

HEADLINE: Travels With Mom and Dad

BYLINE: By MARGOT SLADE; MARGOT SLADE is editor of the Education Life and Campus Life sections of The New York Times.

 BODY:
JUST picturing several days -- and nights -- spent in close proximity to the folks who raised us is enough to make most of us quickly realize that going on vacation with our parents is an idea whose time, if it ever came, has gone.
It's hardly a grownup thing to do anyway, especially in a country where growing up has long meant going away. Even returnees to the nest draw the line between living together (an economic necessity) and playing together (an emotional trial). 
 Parents themselves are likely to act skittish when faced with the prospect of a week with the adult kids. It's not that they don't love us anymore; it's just that, recalling what it was like to plan trips around restroom stops, they like us better at a distance.
That is why my parents regarded me as if I were a changeling when I announced the year before last that as their wedding anniversary gift we were going to the Grand Canyon on vacation. Together.
My husband saw nothing wrong with the proposal. But then he's British. Besides, the European way with holidays virtually dictates that traveling, like eating, is always en famille.
In my American-style nuclear family, however, the co-holiday habit never was ingrained, having fallen victim early on to one child with incurable wanderlust and a Lone Ranger approach to life, and another with an antipathy for waiting in lines and a yen for motel swimming pools.
Still, this time Mom and Dad were able to stop gaping only to start staring at the airline tickets and hotel confirmations as we explained that everything had been planned: We would go during the high school spring break, when Mom was off from teaching, a convenient time for the rest of us as well.
Everything had been paid for, insuring that there would be none of the polite wrangling over who pays for what, which can quickly degenerate into an "I am an adult" "You are also my child" tug-of-war.
Day One was ghastly. There we were, spending huge chunks of time ignoring the scenery while trying to divine whether my parents were enjoying themselves and, then, whether their enthusiastic responses could be believed. Or maybe they were trying to put us out of their misery when they insisted that watching a sunrise -- albeit over the Grand Canyon -- at 5 A.M. in subzero temperatures was truly the quasi-religious experience we meant it to be.
Day Two was great -- after, that is, we had awakened at 5, proclaimed the weather "brisk, but bracing," planned an itinerary chock-full of short hikes, long canyon views, ranger lectures and museum visits, broke for breakfast and then found ourselves warming hands at the cafeteria steam table in a sleep-deprived stupor.
AMID much laughter, and some chagrin, my parents admitted that they would enjoy themselves more if they could move at their own pace, as long as that pace included seven hours of sleep, while my husband and I realized that our folks could love us without being enamored of our vacation plans.
Any adult child who has traveled with parents will recognize these as the standard transitional phases of the family road show experience. First comes the "discovery phase," when parents prove that there is life before and after child-rearing. The discovery itself, however, can be more like shock therapy.
A woman I know, a medical writer in Rochester, found that her mother -- married at 15 and widowed at 62 -- had spent so many years deferring to her husband that she had no opinions of her own, not even about restaurant menu selections. To the daughter's "What would you like?" came the unvarying response, "Whatever you want."
"Sometimes I would insist that she choose something, anything," the daughter was saying the other day, "and she would always order the cheapest thing on the menu -- usually pork chops. Then I'd get annoyed and, yes, I admit it, I bullied her into ordering shrimp. She didn't want it, but she was so amenable, so accommodating, she ate it! I felt like dirt."
After two more trips with Mom, she knows better. "Let 'em eat pork chops," she tells me. "Who knows, maybe you'll find that your folks really like the stuff."
Another friend discovered that holidays with her husband's parents unnerved him but enlivened her. She carried on lengthy and enjoyable conversations with her in-laws during their week in Greece.
Actually, my friend was amazed just to find herself on vacation with her in-laws, since her husband -- their son -- canceled at the last minute, as he had to stay home and work.
"She should have stayed home, too," was the wisdom from the wife of a West Coast couple who insist that in-laws be outlawed on vacation. Being with in-laws is work, they explain, and they don't want to work on their vacation.
I suppose that, for some, their reasoning makes sense -- at least the psychologists I know say it does. Marion Lindblad-Goldberg, the director of the family therapy center at Philadelphia Child Guidance Center, says that adult children should go on vacation with their parents if they relate to each other as equals. If children are in a higher power position than their parents -- say the parents are elderly or the children are wealthy -- that's a go, too, since they've had their equals phase and simply moved on to a new one.
BUT when parents are in the higher power seat, a vacation for one is not a vacation for all: The children, no matter what their ages, are likely to spend the entire time acting as children -- trying to please their parents.
This, of course, raises a basic question: Why consider a family vacation in the first place?
Wanting to play a kind of familial Robin Hood, in which we children take from our coffers and give to those who gave us so much, is an acceptable answer, experts tell me. So is wanting the children or grandchildren to know one another or, when parents are doing the inviting, wanting to better understand the whole farflung brood, says Matti Gershenfeld, the president of the Couples Learning Center in suburban Philadelphia, who vacationed with an adult son -- and lived.
But if you're taking a family vacation "because you should," she says, then you shouldn't.
We weren't, so we did -- not just once, but twice, playing double jeopardy the second time around by hooking up with my parents and my husband's parents -- and with his three brothers, sister-in-law, niece, nephew, godparents, godchildren and girlfriends.
That was the vacation during which my parents, who generally stayed in the finest hotels when in foreign capitals, insisted that happiness really was a $28-a-night room in a French town whose name they could neither remember nor pronounce, as long as it had a clean bed and a shower nearby.
Maybe they were concerned about their children's level of holiday enjoyment. We suspected as much the first time around, when, three days into our Grand Canyon adventure, my parents announced that they were too tired to join us in a tour of town. Not so tired, however, that they couldn't have a snack at a luncheonette and then mosey over to a few shops, which is where we found them several hours later, strolling hand-in-hand.
"We thought you needed some time to yourselves," said Mom.
"We thought we needed some time to ourselves," said Dad.

At Home With a Zebra Table And a Skeleton Chair

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
William McCartyCooper used two kinds of period furnishings in the interiors he designed -- conservative (for his clients) and eccentric (for himself). Among the exotic objects in his Los Angeles home were chairs carved in the shape of an elephant and a human skeleton, plus a table with stuffed zebra legs.
On Saturday, these witty, some might say weird, items will be auctioned, along with 300 other furnishings from the McCarty-Cooper estate, at Christie's in New York in a sale estimated to bring as much as $3 million. 
 During the 1960's, the Miami-born designer became one of the most prominent decorators in London. He was adopted in 1972 by his companion, Douglas Cooper, the art historian of the Cubist period whose widely exhibited art collection was inherited by McCarty-Cooper in 1984. In the late 1980's, McCarty-Cooper moved to Los Angeles, where he died last May at the age of 53.
The most-discussed item in Christie's sale is the Russian-made skeleton chair. "It's bizarre but amusing, a caricature of a human skeleton that must be uncomfortable to sit on," said James Parker, curator of European sculpture and decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Mr. Parker said he remembered the chair from a 1980 auction at Christie's in London, where McCarty-Cooper bought it for $36,300, because he had never seen another like it. The chair is now estimated to bring only between $10,000 and $15,000.
Many of the sale's estimates are much lower than the prices paid by McCarty-Cooper. "The chair is an oddity not everyone would want to buy," explained William J. Iselin, who heads New York sales of European furniture at the auction house. "Under the circumstances and in the current economic climate, I would much rather have a conservative estimate."
Peter Schaffer, one of the owners of A La Vieille Russie, Russian art dealers in New York, said he had seen only one other such skeleton chair, at the Hermitage's Ethnographic Museum in St. Petersburg.
According to Brett Vinovich, the former West Coast correspondent for Connoisseur magazine who was a friend of McCarty-Cooper, "Billy hung a cowboy hat on the skeleton chair and used it as a valet in the corner of his bedroom. He loved telling the story of why it was made. It seems that a titled Russian aristocrat had it carved as a wedding gift for his former lover when she married another man."
Actually, all that is known about the chair's history is contained in a three-line dedication, from one man to another, handwritten in Cyrillic on the webbing under the seat. It reads: "From Nikanor Ivanovich Cheshchev to Nickolay Ivanovich Kolemin, 1838."
Almost as curious are the four elephant chairs, among the heftiest bergeres Christie's has auctioned in many years. Each weighs more than 150 pounds and was carved from a single block of wood. When the decorator bought them in 1985 from Herve Aaron, who heads the New York galleries of Didier Aaron, the Paris-based French furniture dealers, he was told they were 19th-century chairs. Now the dealer thinks they may be from the 20th century.
Mr. Aaron said that McCarty-Cooper, who created French 18th-century interiors for Didier Aaron briefly in the late 1970's, had an eye for both the simplest and most elegant objects. One, a Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann bed with a sunburstlike headboard, is expected to fetch as much as $90,000. "The use of the tiger print on that bed against the striped headboard makes you think you are in the middle of a jungle," Mr. Aaron said.
The Ruhlmann headboard, which came from Didier Aaron, and most of the score of pieces McCarty-Cooper bought from Anthony De Lorenzo, a Madison Avenue dealer in Art Deco furniture, were of Makassar ebony, a striped red and black wood.
"If it wasn't Makassar," Mr. De Lorenzo said, "McCarty-Cooper had a problem with it."
After looking at the zebra-legged table in Christie's catalogue, Bruce M. Newman, a dealer in exotic furniture who owns the Newel Art Galleries in New York, said, "Welcome back to El Morocco," referring to the zebra-skin-decorated Manhattan nightclub that was popular in the 1930's and 1940's. "That table isn't 19th century, as Christie's catalogue says -- it's pure 1930's."
Christie's was unable to identify the maker of the table, Howland Ward Ltd., whose name was inscribed on a label on the table. But Mr. Newman recognized the name as that of a London taxidermist, in business from about 1905 or 1910 to the 1960's.
Mr. Iselin of Christie's said it is difficult to date one-of-a-kind objects. "The specific date of the zebra table and whether it be 1890, 1910 or 1930 is not that important," he said. "The value of the table lies not in its antiquity, but in its unusual design."
Although he had resisted buying the skeleton chair twice in the past, Mr. Newman said he might succumb this time. "It's an extraordinary object," he said, "and there are plenty of decadent people who may want it -- including me."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Minority Developers;
Enlarging the Ranks of Home Builders

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
IN the plumbing business, Leslie Levi Jr. made his mark long ago. His company has been in business in Brooklyn for 41 years.
For 27 years, Raleigh W. Hall has been in the home-improvement business in Jamaica, Queens. And for 19 years Andrew Velez has been plying the general contractor's trade from an office in downtown Manhattan. 
 Too long, these minority construction men felt, to be working only on other people's jobs. They would like to do their own new-construction projects as owner-developers -- conceiving the plan, getting the financing and approvals, hiring the architect, managing the construction, handling the sales, taking the risks, earning the profit. But they lacked the size and experience as developers to qualify for the financing needed to make this possible.
"We have always been able to get the $200,000-to-$300,000 job," said Mr. Levi, the 63-year-old founder of Livel Mechanical & Equipment Corporation, which is at 1110 President Street in Brooklyn. "But the number of jobs we've had over $1 million you could count on the fingers of one hand, and still have a few fingers left over."
An attempt to correct that situation for small minority-run contracting companies is being made by the New York City Housing Partnership, the business-led nonprofit development organization that has been an intermediary between New York City and private builders in the construction of moderate- to middle-income for-sale housing since 1983. It established a Neighborhood Builders Program in 1988 to work with the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development to "bring minority contractors into the mainstream of the home-building industry," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Housing Partnership.
Three years later, 10 percent of the Housing Partnership's newly built affordable units are being done through the Neighborhood Building Program. About 200 two-family houses have been completed or are nearing completion in the hands of five minority builders in the program's first "cycle." A second cycle with six builders is getting under way. Construction financing has come from major banks -- Chase, Dime Savings of New York, National Westminster and Chemical.
ONE dividend of the program is that in this time of recession it has provided work for companies that might otherwise have been forced out of business.
"It's terrible out there now," said Mr. Velez, describing the competition that has developed for construction work. He and other small contractors tell of having to bid against major companies for work that the large companies would have ignored a few years ago.
Mr. Velez built 34 two-family houses at 169th Street and Prospect Avenue in the Morrisania section of the Bronx under the Partnership's program. "It came along at the right time," he said.
Another characteristic of these houses is that they tend to require a somewhat higher level of public subsidy to provide greater security for the lender. That leads to lower prices for the buyer and home-buying opportunities for a slightly lower income level of buyer. At one site in southeast Queens, the average income of two-family home buyers is expected to be about $25,000, said Ms. Wylde.
Results of the program are on view on Tompkins Avenue between Kosciusko and Pulaski Streets in Bedford-Stuyvesant, across the street from Mount Pisgah Baptist Church. There Mr. Levi has produced 19 two-family houses that sold for $139,000 to $142,500. Each buyers gets a renter in the upstairs apartment. Market rents range between $500 and $600 a month.
Since the actual cost of construction is about $220,000 a house, the public subsidy amounts to $80,000 a house (or $40,000 per unit). This is about $15,000 a unit greater than is usual in New York City's affordable-housing programs.
With his own crew, Mr. Levi built the foundations for full basements, the sidewalks and sewer and water-main connections, and the interior and underground plumbing and carpentry finishing. For the house itself he turned to the manufactured product of DeLuxe Homes of Pa., based in Berwick.
MANY of the other minority contractors are choosing a "stick-built" house rather than one built in a factory. But both products have found sales success. Construction financing for Mr. Levi's $4 million Tompkins Avenue project came from the Community Preservation Corporation; permanent loans to buyers came from Chase Manhattan Bank.
In the Jamaica section of Queens, Mr. Hall has sold 13 of the 14 two-family houses he built on two Linden Boulevard sites. His wife is the secretary-treasurer of the 27-year-old contracting firm. As in some other cases, the State of New York Mortgage Agency guaranteed a major fraction of his construction loan.
"If it hadn't been for this job I don't know whether we could have maintained our business this year," said Mr. Hall.
In the Bronx, Gerson Nieves, the 43-year-old president of Nidus Realty Corporation, completed 26 two-family houses under the Neighborhood Builders Program on East 155th Street between Melrose and Elton Avenues. He has been in the real-estate business for 17 years as a broker, appraiser, property manager, syndicator and rehabilitator of existing buildings.
In some cases the initial construction loan was made possible because a large creditworthy builder was ready to guarantee it. That role fell on more than one occasion to Fred Wilpon, co-owner of the New York Mets, chairman of Sterling Equities, one of the city's largest owner-builders, and chairman of the nonprofit development corporation that was set up to run the Neighborhood Builder Program.
Other veteran home builders have stood over the shoulders of minority companies as they did their first development project, ready to step in if matters went awry in construction or sales. Among these were W. Randy Lee, the Staten Island developer; the Hudson Companies of Brooklyn; Procida Construction of the Bronx and the Bluestone Organization of Queens.
THE ultimate beneficiaries are the home buyers themselves, who are purchasing a house for the first time. One of Mr. Levi's buyers was June Daniels, a school teacher who said she raised three children in "the projects" in Bedford-Stuyvesant and got tired of "living on the 16th floor."
"I was paying $600 a month in rent and it was going up," she said. She has been living in the new house with a relative as her renter since Christmas, she said. "It feels like home, really," she said. Her monthly costs are about the same as when she rented.
Sellers of new affordable homes are emphasizing the comparison with rental costs. The Hudson Companies, a major nonminority builder of affordable housing, is telling house shoppers at Sojourner Truth Homes, on DeKalb Avenue six blocks east of Mr. Levi's project, that they can get a two-family house for $160,000 and hold after-tax housing costs below $500 a month.
The actual figure is $487 a month, assuming the tenant pays $550 a month in rent, Hudson says. The buyer needs $14,800 for the purchase -- $8,000 as down payment and $6,800 in closing costs.
This is possible because 30-year mortgages can be obtained at 8.5 percent interest in the current market. The same house two years ago, when rates were 10.5 percent, would have cost $628 a month to carry. The drop of two percentage points in interest rates cuts $200 a month off debt payments.
The drop means that many more people can qualify for mortgages. The minimum income required for home buying has dropped by about $10,000 -- to $30,600 from $40,100 on the $160,000 house, for example -- said Alan R. Bell, a Hudson Companies partner. "We're selling briskly," Mr. Bell said.
As for the minority builders, they hope that one development will lead to others. Mr. Levi is in the predevelopment phase with 40 more houses in Brooklyn. The Tompkins Avenue houses, he said, "put us on the map."

New Rules To Figure Deductions

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
AS homeowners begin to prepare their 1991 tax returns they should take special note of new rules and forms if they have a home office, if they have an annual income of more than $100,000 or if they refinanced a mortgage last year.
Those who operate a home-based business or profession, for instance, will have to disclose far more when calculating allowable office expenses on a new form being tied to Schedule C. 
 The homeowner with an adjusted gross income in excess of $100,000 will face a change limiting the value of the time-honored deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes. And anyone who refinanced a home in 1991 to take advantage of bargain-level interest rates will discover that restrictions apply concerning the tax deductibility of costs associated with the refinancing.
Henry B. Holmes, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said the new form for home office deductions, No. 8829, is being introduced "because a lot of mistakes were being made."
But Paul Edwards of Santa Monica, Calif., co-author of "Working From Home," a book series on home offices, said the change was made because the number of taxpayers filing for home-office deductions rose from 6 million in 1980 to 22 million in 1990, making these deductions a more signficant source of lost revenues if inflated figures were being used.
Despite the added paperwork, Mr. Edwards said, it is more important than ever to take the deductions, since they are now less likely to trigger an audit. In the past, certain accountants had been reluctant to recommend claiming home-office deductions, suggesting they became "red flags" for an audit. "But with so many more people doing so, it's no longer a problem," Mr. Edwards said.
Moreover, he says the new form will make it even less profitable for the I.R.S. to single out these returns because there will be less opportunity for inflated estimates. Even renters working at home, he said, should find some advantages in filling out the new form.
Form 8829 requires homeowners to gather information they may never have needed before. But Julian Block, a tax attorney in Larchmont, N.Y., and author of "The Homeowner's Tax Guide" (Runzheimer, 1991), reminded taxpayers that this does not mean pre-existing rules have changed. To take any deductions, he said, the area or room must still have been used exclusively for business.
The only exceptions are areas used for storing inventory or if the business is home-based day care. In those instances, normal household activities like watching TV and dining can also take place in the rooms.
The new form will ask the taxpayer for precise calculations of the square footage used for business in relation to the square footage of the home, rather than simply the percentage used for business, as in the past. Day-care providers will have to allocate the percentage of time when the rooms are being used for business, in addition to the area.
The best way to calculate total square footage, say the experts, is to measure each room and add the figures. Total square footage may also be on file at the local tax assessor's office.
Robert D. Grossman Jr., a tax lawyer in Washington and former I.R.S. trial attorney, said that in an audit the I.R.S. might try to include unfinished areas like a basement or garage in the total square footage, since this would lower the relative percentage used for business. But since no definitive definitions exist, accountants recommend using the total area of the finished space.
Form 8829 will also require detailed reporting of the full amount being spent on mortgage interest, real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and utilities and may not permit certain deductions to be taken simply as a percentage of the whole, as in the past. Mr. Block said "you will have to figure it all out more carefully."
The form also asks for the calculations used in reaching the figure given for depreciation. This will require more precisely separating the value attributable to land from the dwelling, since land can never be depreciated. Mr. Grossman recommends getting a written estimate of land value from a local real estate agent. Another method is to allocate the same ratio as the one on the property tax bill -- say 1/3 or 1/4 of the total.
HAVING such documentation in your tax records, said Mr. Grossman, would provide confirmation, in an audit, of a rationale for the figure and "will look so much better than a wild guess."
Finally, Form 8829 requires calculations that will make it more difficult to avoid the limit on home office deductions that apply if certain minimum income levels have not been attained. But Mr. Block noted that any disqualified deductions can be added onto next year's expenses.
Homeowners with an adjusted gross income above $100,000 may find their deductions for mortgage interest and property reduced. Mr. Block provides as an example a tax return showing an adjusted gross income of $150,000. Adjusted gross income is the net figure after such things as contributions to a retirement account, alimony payments and qualified portions of the Social Security tax and health insurance premiums of the self-employed.
The example further assumes the taxpayer is itemizing the remaining deductions from adjusted gross income (which normally include mortgage interest, property and state or local income taxes) for an itemized total of $20,000. This amount must then be reduced by a sum equal to 3 percent of $50,000 (the amount over $100,00), which is $1,500, for a net itemized total of $18,500 ($20,000 less $1,500). This bites most deeply into mortgage interest and property taxes in that these items tend to dominate itemized deductions. A handful of deductions such as medical expenses are exempt from the reduction.
Anyone who refinanced a home during 1991 will find that points charges associated with refinancing will not be deductible right away. Rather, the deduction must be spread over the life of the loan. An exception is any points charges specifically associated with money being borrowed for renovations.
Lary S. Wolf, a tax attorney in Manhattan specializing in real estate, gave as an example a homeowner with an existing $80,000 loan who borrows $100,000 when refinancing to generate $20,000 extra for an updated kitchen. Only the points charges allocated to the $20,000 portion of the loan could be deducted immediately. No other expenses qualify. Payment of the points, he added, would also have had to be made from sources other than the money being borrowed.

Concert Opera Company Makes Debut

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHERMAN

 BODY:
THIS doesn't seem like the most propitious time to launch a new opera company, given the state of the economy, but Connecticut Concert Opera is about to do precisely that, introducing a four-event premiere season at the Centennial Theater in Simsbury. "The economy is certainly a concern," said the president of the ensemble, John Wadhams, "but our fund-raising results to date have been most encouraging, and I believe we'll achieve our objective after the first performances.
"Connecticut knows a lot about opera, thanks to major companies in Hartford and Stamford, and visits to eastern Connecticut by Sarah Caldwell's company from Boston. What Connecticut Concert Opera will do is to present some of the favorites originally written for smaller casts and smaller houses. The 400-seat Centennial Theater is just such a magnificent small opera house, so the experience our audiences will have there is one of intimacy and involvement with the performers, along with a chance to hear some of the best singing in Connecticut." 
 The new company, which is affiliated with Hartford Camerata Conservatory, is under the artistic direction of Toby Hall. The 1992 season, eventually including works of Mozart, Puccini, Menotti and a "Sondheim and Hammerstein Spectacular," will open at 8:15 P.M. on Friday (and next Sunday afternoon at 2:15) with Rossini's sparkling comedy "Italiana in Algeria."
The principals, including Mary Fox, Wayne Rivera and Yu Ping, are all seasoned professionals and, as the company title suggests, the performances will be given concert style, accompanied by Mr. Hall at the piano and sung in the original language, with supertitles offering abstracts (rather than full translations) of the arias and ensembles.
For more information about the company or Rossini reservations, call 561-2670.
Fully staged productions with orchestra scheduled by the Shubert Opera Company in New Haven include next weekend's "Elisir d'Amore" by Donizetti. The Metropolitan Opera soprano Betsy Norden and the tenor James Caputo (a native of Guilford) share top billing, with performances scheduled at 8 P.M. on Friday and at 2 P.M. the following Sunday at the Palace Theater.
The Shubert Performing Arts Center is including a Wednesday 7 P.M. dress rehearsal of the opera in its student series, one of the most comprehensive cycles in the state especially designed for young audiences. There is no admission charge, but entrance is subject to seating availability. Call 624-1825 for more details, or reservations for the weekend performances.
"Notes in Mid-Winter" is the title of a free series of recitals being presented this month at the New Canaan Library. This afternoon at 2 the Trio Fervore plays Shostakovich, Beethoven and Smetana, while next Sunday the baritone Richard Lalli, joined by the pianist William Braun, sings compositions ranging from Schubert to William Bolcom, with some Irish folksongs and American parlor ballads as well (966-8133).
Another vocal enticement is part of the "Musical Masterworks" series at the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme, the noted artists being the mezzo-soprano Brenda Boozer and the pianist Charles Wadsworth. The program at 5 P.M. on Saturday includes the Habanera from Bizet's "Carmen" and Ravel's "Scheherazade" song cycle (434-7862).
On the symphonic scene, Saturday is the big night, with no less than six orchestras in performance, but the New Haven Symphony has Tuesday evening to itself: at 8 P.M. in Woolsey Hall its music director, Michael Palmer, will conduct Mozart's Symphony No. 29, the "Variaciones Concertantes" of Alberto Ginastera and, with the guest soloist Robert Roux, Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 (776-1444).
At 8 P.M. on Saturday the Eastern Connecticut Symphony will be at the Garde Arts Center in New London, where its music director, Paul Phillips, will be introducing Carolyn Kalhorn, winner of the orchestra's 32d annual young artist competition, in Brahms's Violin Concerto. Also on the program are favorite works of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Richard Strauss (443-2876).
At that same hour in First Church of Christ Congregational, the Farmingdale Valley Symphony under John Eells tackles some novelties -- including an assortment of early pieces for brass and Spohr's Nocturne for Winds, Brass and Percussion -- before arriving at the more familiar pleasures of Schubert's Symphony No. 5 (677-9570).
At the Greater Bridgeport Symphony concert, at 8:30 P.M. on Saturday in Klein Memorial Auditorium, the group's music director, Gustav Meier, will yield the center of musical attention to Ralph Votapek. The American pianist, who sprang to international attention 30 years ago as the gold medalist of the first Van Cliburn Competition, takes on the marathon challenge of performing three Concertos in a single evening: the first of Brahms and Prokofiev, plus Gershwin's Second Rhapsody (576-0263).
The New Haven Symphony will return to Woolsey Hall at 8 P.M. on Saturday for the centerpiece concert in its Mozart Festival. The occasion is actually quite festive: the Bicentennial marked Mozart's death, while Saturday's program anticipates the anniversary of his birth, Jan. 27, with the Overture to "Don Giovanni," the Symphony No. 39 and the Violin Concerto No. 5, the last featuring Sergiu Luca as guest soloist (776-1444).
For Orchestra New England under James Sinclair, a Concerto Fest will begin at 8 P.M. on Saturday at Battell Chapel in New Haven, with the group's concertmaster, Raphael Ryger, stepping forward to take the lead in Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," while the ensemble's principal cellist, Steven Thomas, is featured in the G-major Concerto of Luigi Boccherini (934-8863).
Finally, Skitch Henderson will be the guest conductor of the Waterbury Symphony in an 8:15 P.M. pops program at Kennedy Auditorium, spotlighting music of John Williams and other master contributors to "The Sound of Hollywood" (574-4283).

HEADLINE: In a Courthouse, Co-ops on the Block

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
ON most Fridays, usually around noon, a small knot of people gathers around a scuffed, steel-gray office table in the rotunda of the New York State Supreme Court Building on Foley Square for what has become a fast-booming sideshow to the region's depressed real estate market: co-op foreclosure auctions.
The auctions should not be confused with foreclosures on troubled co-op sponsors, those developers who have converted apartment buildings into co-ops and are now, because of the weakness of the market, drowning in debt. 
 Rather, these are auctions of single co-op apartments whose owners, for a variety of reasons, but often because of layoffs or a problem with personal finances, have fallen hopelessly behind in their mortgage payments.
"I am hearing stories that are just terrible," said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives. "There are individuals, sometimes parents with children, who are losing everything."
"It seems to be a hard time for sponsors and a hard time for individuals," added Harold A. Lubell, a Manhattan lawyer who is an adjunct professor of real estate at Fordham Law School.
There are about 550,000 co-op apartments in New York City, about 80,000 condominium units and 669,000 one-family houses, according to the city's Department of Finance. The national foreclosure rate on one-family homes and condominiums, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, based in Washington, is 0.98 percent, and has been steadily increasing since the beginning of 1990.
But no one knows how many co-op units have been foreclosed since the recession began putting middle-class New Yorkers out of work and cutting their incomes.
Foreclosures on co-ops, as opposed to those on condominiums or houses, are business transactions made under the Federal Uniform Commercial Code rather than a court proceeding and, as such, are not tallied by court clerks or bar associations.
A foreclosure on a co-op apartment does not involve real property or even a title exchange. Rather, it involves shares in the co-op corporation that owns the building where the defaulting apartment buyer lives. With the shares goes a proprietary lease on the buyer's apartment, which the buyer loses when he surrenders his shares to the lender. Loans on co-ops are known as "share loans" or "end loans," although they are generically referred to as mortgages.
"They don't get registered like a deed," Ms. Rothman explained.
While lenders and others familiar with the co-op scene differ on the number of foreclosures, all agree that the rate is high and that it is likely to grow as New York sinks deeper into recession.
Frank L. Truglio, a former senior advertising executive who in the mid-80's earned more than $100,000 a year, is one of the many New Yorkers whose co-op has been foreclosed on in recent years. Foreclosure was scheduled for last Friday on his one-bedroom co-op apartment, 8-F, at the Brevard, a 14-year-old tower at 245 East 54th Street on the corner of Second Avenue.
"I'm a product of the recession," Mr. Truglio said, explaining that his company eliminated his job in November 1990 and that he has been unable to make his monthly loan payments to Citibank since then. "I've been trying to get back into the business, but I am told that I am overqualified."
Seven years ago, Mr. Truglio, who is 48 years old, borrowed $100,000 and put down $57,500 of his own money for the co-op unit. Until November 1990, he had kept up his loan payments to the lender and monthly maintenance payments to the co-op. He still owes the bank $75,000, plus $10,126 in back maintenance payments and assessments. The monthly charges on the apartment are $900.
"The people in the building don't know what is going on, but the maintenance people do," he said. "It is very obvious to them what my condition is. When they come in to do some work, they see that I had to sell off my furniture, and now all I have left is a folding chair and a table."
Mr. Truglio, who is divorced, said he thinks often about whether he will become homeless. "It is very scary, very emotional," he said. "I'm all wound up; I've been in the hospital over the whole thing. Never having been fired or let go, you don't react as fast as you should."
He added that he has tried to sell his apartment, dropping the price to as low as $140,000. "It doesn't matter what the price," he said. "I wasn't getting any traffic."
"If the bank does auction it off," he added, "I'm not sure I know what I'm going to do."
FORECLOSURES can be initiated against co-op apartment shareholders for falling behind on either their loan or maintenance payments, which the bank must pay when the unit's owner falls into arrears. This responsibility for making past-due maintenance payments gives banks an added incentive to foreclose quickly.
Steven L. Einig, a lawyer who has handled thousands of co-op foreclosures in the last six years on behalf of several New York lenders, said that banks usually foreclose when an owner is behind 60 to 90 days on loan or maintenance payments. "An auction might take place four to eight weeks later," he said.
A petition of bankruptcy by an apartment owner, however, can forestall the process, as it did for Mr. Truglio. Depending on the bankruptcy code section under which the owner files for protection from creditors, the delay can be as short as a few weeks or for a longer period while a new payment plan is arranged with the bank.
The auction for Mr. Truglio's apartment was scheduled to be held in the rotunda of the Supreme Court Building on Centre Street, where -- by tradition, not because it is part of any judicial proceedings -- all Manhattan co-op auctions are held. (In Queens, tradition dictates that the auctions be held, rain or shine, on the outdoor steps of the Supreme Court building.)
"I have never seen as many co-op auctions as I see now," said Norman Goodman, the Clerk of the Supreme Court in Manhattan "On Fridays, there is always a crowd around the auctioneer out there."
The auctions, which are advertised in the newspapers, have little in common with the better-known auctions of one-family houses and condominiums. Indeed, those who arrive at co-op auctions generally are baffled by the process and tend to ask questions more than make bids.
"Aren't there supposed to be paddles?" asked Jonathan M. Silver, who stopped by the courthouse to watch a Friday auction this month and half-expected to find a Sotheby's or Christie's atmosphere.
BUT there are no paddles here. Or chairs, either. In fact, co-op unit auctions in New York City are about as casual as sidewalk three-card monte games.
"Fifty-one thousand, nine hundred and eighty and sixteen cents!" barked the auctioneer, William Mannion.
"Do we hear another bid?"
A small crowd stared blankly.
"Going once! Twice! Third and final call . . ."
"Sold to the Dime!" Mr. Mannion said, slamming his hand down on his briefcase. "Congratulations."
The Dime, of course, is the Dime Savings Bank.
Mr. Einig said that about 80 percent of all properties that are put up for auction attract only the initial bid of the bank.
"What is happening is that people are looking for the deal of the century and when they don't find it they walk out," he said.
Douglas Bourie and Charles Hansen, however, found what they feel is a bargain co-op at auction. For $1 over the opening bid of $57,750, they bought a five-room apartment at Hudson View Gardens, a co-op at 116 Pinehurst Avenue in Washington Heights.
"I think I've gotten a very good price," Mr. Bourie said.
"Exceedingly reasonable," said the first vice president of the building's co-op corporation, Dr. Edgar C. Hanks.
 Mr. Mannion said he almost didn't accept the bid because it was only $1 over the opening bid. "You could be here all day upping $1 bids," he said. "But in this case there didn't appear to be any other bidders. Usually, I go up in $100 increments."
Mr. Bourie's purchase was the only one by a bidder in the rotunda on Jan. 10. Three other units didn't sell and went back to the bank. The sale of a fourth, at 11 Riverside Drive, which had attracted considerable interest, was canceled at the last minute when the owner showed up with a bankruptcy petition. The opening bid would have been $195,000.
"I talk to the real estate officers every day, and they tell me that every day they get keys in the mail," Mr. Mannion said, referring to owners who give up on paying their loans and move out of their apartments. . "I do not think it is going to slow down at all. All my clients tell me their files are growing, and I don't see any letup."
ALSO surrrendering apartments to lenders are investors who bought occupied rent-regulated units in converted buildings in the hope that they could sell them at big profits after their tenants left. With prices weaker and the spread between regulated rents and maintenance widening, many investors are giving up.
The only statistical information available about share-loan foreclosures comes from a survey of legal notices of The New York Times from October 1989 to November 1990 by Gateway Community Restoration, a nonprofit developer in Sunnyside, Queens. That survey showed 3,728 foreclosures in the five boroughs, but there are no earlier or later data available for comparisons.
Antonia Dosik, executive director of Gateway, said that most co-op shareholders are defaulting because they cannot afford both the loans on their shares and the monthly maintenance charges, which cover their portion of the cost of the building's own mortgage as well as taxes, services and utilities. Because of the dearth of data about co-op loans, it is impossible to say whether they are falling into foreclosure at a faster rate or in a greater proportion than mortgages on condominiums and one-family homes.
Ken R. Enos, an assistant director of owned real estate with the Dime Savings Bank in Manhattan, which has been a major writer of share loans, said that the percentage that has fallen into foreclosure is no greater than the percentage of defaulted condominium and house mortgages.
Mr. Enos also said that the number of foreclosed share loans at the Dime appears to have peaked. "Ours have stabilized some," he said.
Other real estate professionals who watch foreclosures, however, believe co-ops may be taking a greater battering than banks are letting on.
"They are definitely up," said Dorit Breger, the publisher of Foreclosure Update, a newsletter in New York that collects foreclosure figures from the legal advertisments in eight New York City publications.

Help for Home Buyers
 
Question: I am trying to buy a house in the city. I understand that there are programs to help first-time home buyers with mortgages. Is there a source for information on this kind of assistance? . . . Gurunath Pasumarty, Rego Park, Queens 

Answer: Yes. You might start with the State Mortgage Agency of New York. The agency, known as Sonny Mae, helps qualified low- and moderate-income families and individuals throughout the state to obtain low-cost mortgages.
The agency's regular mortgage program applies to one- to four-family homes and co-ops and condominiums. Currently, the down payments required range from 5 and 10 percent depending on the type of home being purchased. The current interest rate on 30-year mortgages is 8 percent. Sonny Mae mortgages are only for buyers who will occupy their homes.
A new Sonny Mae program is for first-time buyers of newly constructed homes. Among the requirements is that participants have household incomes of no more than 80 percent of the median income for their areas. There is also a ceiling on the purchase prices on homes but the required down payment can be as low as 2 percent in certain areas and the mortgage program will also provide $2,500 in closing costs.
You might also check with individual lenders, some of which provide assistance to first-time buyers.
More information on the loan programs can be obtained by calling the agency toll free at (800)382-HOME.
 
Right to a Lease
 
Question: I have shared a rent-stabilized apartment with a companion for almost 11 years. During this time I have occasionally asked that my named be added to the lease, but my requests have been denied. About five years ago, the building we live in was converted to a noneviction co-op. We stayed as renters.
In light of the Braschi decision, which granted domestic partners succession rights on leases, do I have any legal right to be added to the lease now? . . . Jack Rowen, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. According to Joseph D'Agosta, an assistant commissioner for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the rent-stabilization code that gives spouses the right to be added to leases does not extend to live-in companions as defined by the Braschi decision.
"The regulations were amended to accommodate Braschi, which pertains to succession rights," said Mr. D'Agosta, "but not the rules on adding spouses to leases."
Depending on the circumstances of your situation, Mr. D'Agosta said that you could be entitled to a renewal lease if your companion, the named tenant, leaves the apartment or dies.
The division's rent administration office is at Gertz Plaza, 93-31 Union Hall Street, Jamaica, N.Y. 11433
 
Replacing an Appliance
 
Question: I have lived in a rent-stabilized apartment for many years. The kitchen appliances are worn out and the landlord is willing to replace them. I would like the replacements to be the best on the market. Must I accept the ones he buys or can I buy my own appliances? . . . Harold Freed, Manhattan
 
Answer: You can buy your own only with the landlord's permission. The laws that cover rent-regulated tenants give them the right to working kitchen appliances. But landlords can repair appliances or replace them with used ones. If your landlord buys new appliances he is under no obligation to buy the ones you would select. If the appliance he puts in is new, he can add 1/40 of the cost to the rent. Most landlords prefer to replace appliances themselves because of the financial advantage. The rent increase is permanent and becomes part of the base in determining future rent increases.
If your landlord allows you to buy your own appliances and you move out of your apartment, you would either have to leave them behind or arrange to have them replaced with appliances that are acceptable to him.

HEADLINE: Englewood Considers A Longer School Year

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
WHILE most discussion about a longer school day and year remains in the abstract, Englewood schools are on their way to making the concept a reality. This month the district convened a committee of community and school representatives to investigate whether to extend the school year to a minimum of 200 days.
As in most school districts in New Jersey, Englewood's public schools are currently in session 180 days. The proposal would also lengthen the school day to at least seven hours from six and a quarter hours. 
 "I think it's fairly likely that we will go to a longer school year," said Dr. Michael Passow, president of the Parent-Teacher Organization at Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood and a former school board member. "Englewood's board and now more and more of its faculty are seeing that we have the possibility to be an educational leader in this country with the restructuring of how we're teaching."
For some time, Englewood school administrators have advocated the idea of a year-round educational program. But unlike most school districts around the country that remain open all year, the district is not motivated by the desire to relieve overcrowding.
"The driving force behind all of this is achievement," said William Trepicchio, Englewood's assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction. "We feel that for what it is the students ought to know before they leave high school, the quality that has to be behind that requires them to have more time in school."
The notion of a longer school year for New Jersey public schools received renewed attention with the release of the Quality Education Commission report this month. The commission, appointed by Gov. Jim Florio a year ago to identify educational requirements for the state in the year 2000 and beyond, called for extending the school year to 220 days and lengthening the school day itself. Such a move is estimated to cost up to $2 billion a year.
Supporters of the recommendation point out that the United States has one of the shortest school years in the industrialized world, and they argue that there must be a connection between American students' poor performance on international educational assessment tests and the amount of time they spend in school. The school year in Japan, for example, is more than 240 days long.
Americans seem to be increasingly in agreement. A Gallup poll last fall indicated that, for the first time, a majority of those sampled favored a longer school year.
 
Cost of Air-Conditioning Is a Factor
Englewood school officials say that it is too early to estimate the cost of their proposal, but that the principal expense would involve teacher salaries and air-conditioning. No time lines have been set, but given the need for contract renegotiations and building alterations, the earliest that Englewood schools could possibly run on a year-round calendar is thought to be the 1993-94 academic year.
The biggest stumbling block to instituting a longer school year is usually taxpayer unwillingness to pay for it. Englewood may have a slight advantage over most New Jersey school districts in this respect since it is one of the few districts in the state with appointed school boards and budgets approved by boards of school estimate instead of the voters.
One impetus for extending the school year is to have greater continuity in learning. By eliminating long summer vacations, educators hope to avoid weeks of review in September for students who seem to have forgotten everything they have learned.
But the curtailment of summer vacation, an ingrained American tradition, poses many additional questions. The committee will have to decide whether more time in school is worth sacrificing such mainstay middle-class activities as summer camp and summer family vacations, and the opportunity for students to work in the summer to help pay for college.
Proponents of a longer school year contend that the benefits of summer vacations are inconsequential if they lead to a long-term demise of the United States as an economic power. They also say that the vision of camping days and vacation trips is outmoded and that most American children now spend their summers on the streets or in front of television sets, waiting for their parents to return home from work.
 
More Immediate Problems Cited
 There has been no official reaction to the proposal from the Englewood Education Association, but the union's president, Kathleen Rimmer, said there were more immediate problems to address. Among the concerns she cited were poor heating and ventilation systems in school buildings and increasing class sizes.
"Teachers' initial reaction is we'd like to get things right for 10 months first before we think about making the school year 12 months," she said.
The move to a longer school year is also receiving support from Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of Englewood. A bill he introduced at the end of the last legislative session would establish a $30 million, three-year competitive grants program for schools that are interested in expanding the length of the school day and year.
"It just got to the stage that he thought people were talking about this one too much and not doing anything about it," said Larry McDonnell, Mr. Torricelli's press secretary.
The bill would require schools to be in session a minimum of seven hours a day, 200 days a year. Districts, except for poor ones, would have to raise 20 percent of the additional cost themselves, and the United States Department of Education would monitor the results.
 
Curbs on Holidays Urged
 "We hope that after three years we would have the evidence to say, see, it does cost more money but it works," Mr. McDonnell said.
Mr. Torricelli held a news conference at Dwight Morrow High School in December to unveil his bill. The news conference was attended by a number of students selected by the school administration, who praised it. Several told the Congressman they thought school should be longer and more rigorous, and one suggested eliminating some holidays as a start.
That viewpoint may not be universal.
"Many of us aren't too thrilled," said Kate Passow, an eighth grader, who is the daughter of the president of Dwight Morrow's parent-teacher group and who attended the news conference. "The good part is that we'd get a better education, but the down side is that we'd have to spend more time in school."
On one point she was adamant. "We're really not getting much out of school as it is now," she said. "The school has to be improved before we even extend the school year."
Englewood is trying to improve the quality of time currently spent in school. The high school is midway through a $600,000 three-year grant from the RJR Nabisco Foundation to reorganize what happens in the classroom so that students take a more active role in learning and teachers become more like coaches.
 
Debate Turns 'Nasty'
 Northern Highlands Regional High School in Allendale knows firsthand how hard it is to make even the slightest adjustment to the school day. After years of discussion, the district's Board of Education voted last week to switch from a seven-period day to an eight-period one, an action that will probably add about a half-hour to the school day.
James Ryan Jr., president of the board, said the move would enable students to take more electives.
But the teachers are threatening a lawsuit if they have to teach an extra class, and more than half of Northern Highlands' 694 students staged an all-day sit-in in the school auditorium to protest the possibility of having to take more courses.
"Things have gotten so nasty around the building in the last week or two with job actions and pressure on the students," said Dr. David Garrahan, the district's Superintendent of Schools. "But no one can really argue with what the board is doing. We have constantly heard from every major commission and panel that has studied American education in the last 10 years, and we're continually being compared unfavorably with graduates from European and Japanese high schools."

HEADLINE: Biotechnology Companies Find a Home In the State

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE biotechnology industry has found New Jersey. From bags of bugs to designer drugs, from cloned chrysanthemums to a substitute for human blood, an increasing number of New Jersey companies are creating and developing innovative products, using the sophisticated technology born of the biotechnology revolution.
State officials and industry experts say that after a somewhat slow start, New Jersey is now emerging as a major site for biotechnology businesses -- a multibillion-dollar industry that holds out the promise of solving some of mankind's most pressing environmental and medical problems. In addition, they say, the state's enhanced presence in the biotechnology market will aid the state's economy by creating new industry and jobs.
"We feel that New Jersey is becoming a leader in the biotech industry," said Brooke Hern, a spokesman for the State Department of Commerce and Economic Development. Mr. Hern said an informal survey of listings of biotechnology companies nationwide by the department had shown New Jersey to have 193 biotechnology companies -- second only to California with 365, and just ahead of Massachusetts with 183. 
 "Up until a few years ago, there wasn't even an industry code for biotechnology," Mr. Hern said, referring to the way officials classify specific industries for statistical purposes.
For purposes of the survey, Mr. Hern said, the biotechnology industry was broadly defined to include all companies involved in industrial microbiology, biology, chemistry or engineering that used genetic engineering, live microorganisms or cell cultures from other organisms to produce new products.
Industry experts are not quite as enthusiastic as state officials are about the state's relative ranking; most believe that Massachusetts still ranks ahead of New Jersey and that New Jersey is something of a late bloomer. Nevertheless, they say, in recent years New Jersey has established itself as a major source of management expertise, scientific talent and venture capital -- the three ingredients necessary for any budding biotechnology venture.
"New Jersey provides a nice opportunity for new bioscience firms because they can find quality people right outside their door," said Jack E. Stover, partner in charge of New Jersey high-technology practice in the Princeton office of Coopers & Lybrand, the consulting and accounting firm.
"It's a lot easier to steal someone from a Johnson & Johnson and bring them on board than it is to go to Boston or San Jose and then have to relocate them," he said.
In addition, he said, the pharmaceutical companies provide a "role model" for the smaller bioscience companies and often provide necessary capital through joint venture arrangements. And when that money runs out, Mr. Stover said, there is a vast amount of public and private money available in the area.
"We've got dozens of companies in New Jersey that have raised capital to continue their research and development efforts," he said.
The growing appeal of the state as a center for high technology, Mr. Stover said, "provides a huge opportunity for the future of New Jersey, especially as it relates to spawning and developing new technologies and new applications for those technologies."
J. Steven Burrill, international director for high technology in the San Francisco office of Ernst & Young, the consulting and accounting firm, said the biotechnology industry began in the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960's and early 70's. Spawned by advances in biology that gave scientists the ability to manipulate an organism's genetic code, the industry has grown steadily over 20 years.
"My estimate is that you're talking about a $50 billion industry before the end of the decade," Mr. Burrill said. "Only a handful" of biotechnology companies, he added, have gone bankrupt over the last 15 years.
"Almost every company has developed enough technology that there is always a way that they can get value out or merge with somebody," Mr. Burrill said.
Over the next several years, Mr. Burrill said, between 120 and 150 major products are expected to be approved by various regulatory agencies. To date, he said, only a few products have successfully navigated the arduous, expensive and time-consuming approval process and are actually being marketed.
One such product has been developed by Enzon Inc., a South Plainfield company that was founded by two Rutgers University professors in 1983. The product, called Adagen, is a drug that is used to treat victims of severe combined immunodeficiency disease, commonly referred to as "bubble boy" disease.
Victims of the disease are children whose bodies do not produce a necessary enzyme, said Glenn Kazo, vice president of corporate development for the company. Without the enzyme, Mr. Kazo said, the children's immune systems fail to develop, leaving them susceptible to infection and often forced to live in plastic "bubbles," isolated from others and the environment.
Though the ability to manufacture the enzyme has existed for some time, he said, it must be administered to patients in frequent doses because the body quickly flushes it out of the bloodstream. Frequent use of the enzyme, however, would cause severe side effects. In fact, Mr. Kazo said, the raw enzyme was so toxic that it was never developed for use.
 
'Like a Stealth Protein'
 Enzon's founders solved that problem in the late 1970's while still at Rutgers by attaching an inert substance -- polyethylene glycol -- to the enzyme molecule.
"It works by disguising the surface of the molecule," said Dr. Abraham Abuchowski, president and co-founder of the company, along with Dr. Frank F. Davis. "It's actually like a stealth protein," he said.
The resulting Adagen compound was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March 1990 and is now being supplied to 14 children who have the disease. Though the company makes no profit on the sale of the drug, the technology it has developed can be used to make other designer drugs, as they are commonly called in the industry.
In fact, the company recently entered into an agreement with the California-based Genlabs Technologies Inc. to develop a modified form of a Genlabs drug called GLQ223 for the treatment of AIDS.
Another potential use for the technology, Dr. Abuchowski said, is the production of hemoglobin -- the protein present in blood that is responsible for carrying oxygen.
 
Quest Has Taken Years
 "This is probably one of the most unique pharmaceutical products ever created," Dr. Abuchowski said. "People have been trying to make artificial blood for years."
The raw hemoglobin, which is obtained from cow blood and then "disguised" by attaching polyethylene glycol, could be used as a replacement for blood lost in an accident, during an operation or even by a soldier on a battlefield.
The semi-synthetic hemoglobin, Dr. Abuchowski said, is now being tested on animals and should be ready for testing on humans by the end of the year.
Another New Jersey company that has produced marketable products is the DNA Plant Technology Corporation in Cinnaminson, one of the largest biotechnology companies in the United States.
David Gilbert, DNA's manager of corporate communications, said the company had focused its research on five basic areas.
Using gene splicing techniques, Mr. Gilbert said, the company has been able to create new vegetables, including a snacking pepper that tastes like a sweet red bell pepper but is the size of a small jalapeno chili pepper.
The company has also developed a low-fat frying oil, a test kit to detect fungal diseases in grass, another test kit to detect petroleum contamination in soil and a biological additive that helps create "a higher quality artificial snow."
 
Long-Lived Chrysanthemum
 Mr. Gilbert said the company was also involved in a joint venture with a Dutch company to breed and market flowers with novel colors and patterns. One flower that the company has already created through genetic engineering is a white chrysanthemum with a long vase life.
The new flower should sell well, Mr. Gilbert said. "This particular chrysanthemum is known as 'Moneymaker' in the profession because of its very desirable agronomic characteristics," he said.
Indeed, experts say, the robust health of the biotechnology industry itself, particularly in the area of drug research, is based upon the same principle that motivates the creation of a white chrysanthemum.
"When you win, the win is enormous," said Bernard Tenenbaum, director of the George Rothman Institute of Entrepreneurial Studies at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison. "The biotech business is a waiting game. But the problems they're trying to solve are so big and so fundamental to society that the nurturing of the bioscience industry represents future investment returns on a tremendous scale."
 
A Magnet for Capital
The biotechnology industry, Mr. Tenenbaum said, has been a magnet for huge infusions of venture capital despite investor caution inspired by the current recession.
"There are lots of venture people who love this business," he said. "They might put a million or two million in for 30 percent of a company that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars."
The increasing number of new biotechnology companies in New Jersey, Mr. Tenenbaum said, while partly a result of investor interest, is also a result of the high concentration of pharmaceutical companies in the state. Occasionally, he said, the "research" portion of a drug company's "research and development" suddenly becomes a new biotechnology company.
One example, he said, is Celgene, a Warren-based biotechnology company that was created by the Celanese Corporation in 1986.
"Celgene makes bags of bugs," Mr. Tenenbaum said. "They make microbes that scrub pollutants."
 
Converting Hazardous Waste
 Dr. Thomas B. Lewis, vice president of the company, said that while Celgene did not produce bugs in the conventional sense, the company had developed a system that used live microorganisms to convert hazardous industrial waste into harmless byproducts.
"We have demonstrated a biological reactor system that converts methylene chloride, a suspected carcinogen, into carbon dioxide, water and salt," Dr. Lewis said, referring to a demonstration of the system conducted in cooperation with General Electric. About 400 million pounds of methylene chloride is produced and used by industry each year, D.r. Lewis said.
The microorganisms in Celgene's biological reactor system, he said, are naturally occurring ones that have been selected to degrade the man-made chemical efficiently.
The water produced by the system is so clean, Dr. Lewis said, that it could meet Federal drinking water standards.
 
Another Approach on Waste
 Another company that is using genetic engineering to treat hazardous waste is Envirogen in Lawrenceville. Unlike Celgene's biological reactor system, which treats hazardous waste before it leaves the factory, Envirogen's technology focuses on biologically degrading hazardous materials like chlorinated solvents and PCB's that have already entered the waste stream.
Roger J. Colley, president of the two-year-old company, said Envirogen, in addition to working with natural organisms that will be introduced for commercial application this year, was using the common bacteria E. coli as a living factory to create genetically modified microorganisms. Those microorganisms, he said, are specifically designed to biodegrade certain toxic chemicals that have been introduced into the environment.
The company, Mr. Colley said, like other young biotech companies in New Jersey and elsewhere, will spend a great deal of time, money and effort before it actually has a product it can sell.
"It's a slow, cautious process before we get to the use of these organisms in the field," he said. "We don't know whether it's two years or 10 years down the road."

HEADLINE: Communities Told to Improve Water Purity

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
NEW Federal and state standards for water quality are forcing local officials in Westchester to step up plans for expensive filtration plants or to search for alternative supplies. The mandates are also increasing demands for a regional approach to water management.
Westchester relies on the vast New York City reservoir system for 85 percent of its drinking water. Earlier this month, 11 municipalities in the county learned from state health authorities that their current treatment programs are inadequate and that new proposals to meet strict new standards of water purity must be submitted by March 31. 
 Communities have until June 1993 to put their plans into effect, seven years after amendments to the Safe Water Drinking Act were passed by Congress in 1986. The Federal law prompted the state to enact even tougher standards, later modified, which originally called for all surface water supplies to be filtered.
Some of the affected Westchester commmunities, like Irvington and Briarcliff, rely exclusively on the Croton Reservoir system, where water quality has steadily deteriorated. Although the Croton supply still meets Federal standards for safe drinking, state authorities are now requiring that every gallon of water be filtered.
Although New York City is building a $600 million water-filtration plant for the Croton Reservoir in the Bronx, that new system will handle only the part of the supply serving New York City residents.
Other Westchester communities, including Harrison and the town and village of Mamaroneck, draw their water from the Rye Lake section of the Kensico Reservoir, which state authorities ordered filtered.
Five other Westchester communities connect to the Catskill Reservoir above the Kensico Reservoir in northern Westchester, where the water, especially in springtime, is unusually muddy.
 
Date With Destiny Delayed
 Parts of Yorktown, Montrose, Cortlandt, Pleasantville and New Castle have learned that the increased turbidity in their supply will require them to develop alternatives to meet new water-purity standards or seek another supply.
Other Westchester communities, although escaping their neighbors' fate under the state guidelines released this month, realize that their date with a costly destiny has only been delayed. These communities, which draw their water from the Delaware and Catskill sections of the New York City Water Supply System, are waiting for the outcome of the city's current negotiations with upstate communities to set strict new rules for watershed protection.
The regulations, if enacted, would severely limit residential and commercial development in the 11-county watershed region, but the proposals have encountered bitter local opposition. If political considerations force these proposed regulations to be diluted, state officials have warned that their new regulations governing water purity will take effect.
New York City would then be required to filter the Delaware and Catskill Reservoirs, the largest part of its system, at an estimated construction cost of $6 billion and a yearly maintenance cost estimated at $600 million. The implications are dire, city officials agree. "We get 90 percent of our water from Delaware-Catskill, and protecting the watershed around that system is a crucial economic issue for New York City and the region," said Sanford Evans, deputy commissioner for public affairs with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. "This is no tree-hugger's fear."
James R. Covey, the associate director of the Bureau of Public Water Supply in the State Health Department, said his department hoped that the city would be better able to protect its remaining watershed area. "The Croton Reservoir is in a highly developed area," Mr. Covey said. "With major interstates and with large development complexes smack dab in the middle of the water supply, you must filter."
New York City still has a chance to avoid the same thing happening in the Delaware-Catskill watershed, Mr. Covey said. "We have required a long-term plan from them showing they have the resources available to meet our requirements. If the city can establish and enforce its criteria for watershed protection, it won't have to filter water from the Delaware-Catskill."
 
New Guidelines Under Consideration
 Environmental groups and some state and city officials are concerned that continued development in the Croton watershed will cause the raw water quality of the Croton to deteriorate rapidly, conditions they say are also occurring in other watershed areas. The Hudson Valley region in which the watershed is situated is one of the fastest-growing areas in the state, with planners predicting that by 2015 its population will have grown 20 percent from the 1988 level.
State law allows the discharge of treated sewage into the reservoir system, but the process for obtaining permits allows for many violations, environmental groups charge. Officials who monitor permits for the State Department of Environmental Conservation said the department is considering new guidelines to limit discharges.
"We don't make the laws; we are given the rules to work with," said Cesare J. Manfredi, environmental regional water engineer for the State Department of Environmental Conservation. "The law doesn't preclude the discharge of treated sewage."
While he acknowledged that permitted amounts are exceeded, Mr. Manfredi insisted that his department is able to track all major offenders.
A more worrisome danger, Mr. Manfredi said, is the growing presence of phosphorus in the reservoir system, a nutrient that he said contributes to excessive algae and weed growth, thus reducing the effectiveness of chlorine as a disinfectant. New regulations are being put into effect that require sewage treatment plants to limit phosphorus discharges, Mr. Manfredi said.
 
Rates Nearly Double
 Westchester officials said all these signs were hopeful but they are not optimistic. "We are concerned long-term with the apparent inevitability of expensive filtration plants," said Village Manager Steve McCabe of Irvington, who is overseeing the building of a new $4 million connection to the Delaware-Catskill reservoir system. "Who knows how long the Delaware and Catskill will last?" he asked.
A regional solution would have been less expensive for village residents, who are now paying water rates nearly double what they were two years ago, Mr. McCabe said. "Why didn't everybody get together?" he asked. "We did it with solid waste, but here, all we have is another Federal and state mandate with no money."
Town Supervisor Caroline Silverstone of Mamaroneck agreed. "A filtration plant will be incredibly expensive," she said, adding that a solution that could increase local water rates 50 percent was probably inevitable. Coliform bacteria have appeared in some area water samples, she said, referring to the bacteria resulting from untreated sewage. The discovery of the bacteria is a development that cannot be ignored, she said.
While the piecemeal approach being adopted by Westchester communities to protect their water supplies in response to state and Federal requirements is inefficient, Mrs. Silverstone said, appeals for county help have been ignored. "We have complained to Mr. O'Rourke," she said, "but we have only had a pro forma response."
 
'The Process Moves Very Slowly'
 Last week, Salvatore A. Celona, Director of the Westchester County Water Agency, defended his agency in coordinating water policy. "The municipalities are frustrated, and so are we," Mr. Celona said. "We have been cooperating, but the whole process moves very slowly."
Mr. Celona and members of his agency were expected to meet late last week with representatives from Yorktown, Somers and Cortlandt to discuss county cooperation in building a regional filtration plant for the three communities.
The county allocated $35,000 last week to hire Guastella Associates of Boston to review New York City's proposal to raise water rates for upstate consumers by an average 70 percent. The rate hike, the first proposed in 20 years, was submitted to the State Department of Environmental Conservation last fall. That department is to hold public hearings on the proposal, but no dates have been set.
Officials in many Westchester communities said last week that they had heard little opposition from residents about current and proposed water-rate hikes. In New Castle, the only community expected to have a new filtration plant on line before the state deadline in June next year, the $20 million plant will cost residents an additional $200 a year.
"It is very important that all municipalities drink filtered water if that's how you prevent disease," said Gerard Moershell, Commissioner of Public Works for New Castle. "Let's face it. People pay four or five times the cost of water to rent cable television each month. Let's get a proper perspective."
 
 
 
WATER RIGHTS AND THE LAW
 "Development Rights and Water-Body Protection, Legal Solutions," a conference sponsored by the Pace University School of Law and the Real Estate Law Society, will be held on Wednesday in the Moot Court Room at the law school.
The half-day conference will consider such issues as developers' rights and the Constitution, water-protection strategies under Federal and state law, Federal Clean Water Act mandates and their impact on state and local law, comprehensive planning and regulations at the county and local level and balancing interests through regional and statewide planning statutes.
The seminar, which begins at 8:30 A.M., costs $75 for each registrant. Checks payable to the Pace University School of Law should be sent to Mary Liscio, events coordinator at the Law School at 78 North Broadway, White Plains, N.Y. 10603. For more information, call 422-4262.

HEADLINE: Getting Blacks and Whites Together Under One Cultural Roof

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE yearly spotlight on the achievements of black Americans will shine in the county tomorrow, the official observance of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, and will beam throughout what the county has designated as African-American History Month next month. As in past years, the county's cultural calendar is filled with lectures, films and exhibitions planned by public and private organizations to pay tribute to the two national celebrations.
But who in the county will attend these events? Will black and white people share equally in their American heritage or will audiences be mostly black, as they have been in the past? 
 The question resonates with a larger issue as many of the county's white-run arts and cultural institutions increase their efforts to attract black and other minority visitors to their events. The relatively recent commitment by these institutions to broaden their audiences stems from a variety of economic and humanitarian concerns and has met with some success, notably by the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York in Purchase and by the Hartsdale-based New Orchestra of Westchester.
But more often, community and cultural leaders say, bringing together blacks and whites with common interests is like moving mountains, even when the purpose is enjoyment and celebration.
 
Advertising Is Not Enough
 While some say more advertising is needed to attract more diverse audiences, others say advertising is not enough and that only personal contact can break racial barriers.
Janet Langsam, executive director of the Council for the Arts in Westchester, said the council had begun "a much greater outreach," distributing its monthly newsletter, Artsnews, through newspapers and conducting two monthly cable television shows. The arts in particular "suffer from a wrongful image of elitism and exclusivity," Ms. Langsam said.
Advertising alone does not draw whites to events sponsored by blacks, even when the program honors a universally admired figure like Dr. King. Hal Fitzpatrick, chairman of the fourth yearly all-day King celebration being held at the County Center here tomorrow, said that neither newspaper ads, fliers to schools nor his remarks in interviews that everyone was welcome had brought more than a few "very bright and enlightened white people to the event in the past."
Mr. Fitzpatrick, vice president of the African-American Men of Westchester, which sponsors the event, said tomorrow's celebration would be "filled with activities on stage and off," including performances by Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, the Westchester Choral Society and others. Tickets for the event, scheduled from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., are $4; $2 for children and the elderly. For more information, call 949-9463.
 
Few Whites, but Few Blacks Either
 The county's official kickoff ceremonies for African-American History Month, held at the County Courthouse here each year, have also been well publicized, but few whites have attended. Judy Matson, the county's Director of Cultural Affairs, said that last year even the turnout by blacks was small.
Dr. Julius C. Ford, chairman of the Westchester County African-American Month Steering Committee, said there had been no special effort to attract support in either the black or white communities beyond publishing the month's calendar of events in the newspaper. He added, however, that black history "is everyone's business" and said he hoped that whites as well as blacks would attend this year's kickoff on Feb. 1 at 1 P.M. at the courthouse.
This year's keynote speaker, Dr. James Washington of the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan, will speak on "African Roots Explore New Worlds: Pre-Columbus to the Space Age," and local youth groups will perform. For more information, call 285-2934.
Ms. Matson, a member of the steering committee, said it was frustrating that a more racially mixed group did not attend such other county-sponsored events as the free summer concerts at the Kensico Dam Plaza or last June's all-day Mozart Marathon at the County Center. "You wonder how you can do things in a different way to bring the entire community to programs," Ms. Matson said.
 
Economic Incentives Begin
 Of the many who have asked that question, some have found the answer in multiculturalism. Now that the concept is "politically correct," more organizations feel entitled, if not expected, to provide programs that will appeal to a wider audience.
In order to qualify for a challenge grant from the Council for the Arts in Westchester several years ago, local arts groups had to show how they would work to diversify their staffs and boards of directors and also to serve minority groups better with their programming.
Twelve organizations received the grant, including the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers.
"It's a difficult line to walk," said Philip Verre, the museum's director. Mr. Verre said that while the museum was committed to addressing "the needs of the audience that is traditionally disenfranchised," including the black and Hispanic people in the museum's own neighborhood, he also said that democracy and quality must coincide.
"We must make what we have here more accessible, more comfortable and enjoyable," Mr. Verre said.
In order to "build bridges over the gaps" and to make newcomers to the museum feel at ease, Mr. Verre said, he invites community groups to hold events at the museum. The local chapters of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, a black group, and the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women's Clubs have held recent meetings at the museum. Also, Mr. Verre said, the museum sponsors drop-in art workshops on Saturdays for neighborhood children.
 
Black Women in Music Series
 The Performing Arts Center at SUNY Purchase, under the leadership of its director, Christopher Beach, has expanded its programming this season to include a series on black women in music as well as black dance and theater groups. Mr. Beach said his interest in attracting minority-group children, in particular, to the programs was "a response to a dramatically changing mix in the next generation."
In order to publicize the new programs, and to extend a welcoming hand beyond the traditional audience, the center gave a party last June. Virginia C. Reines, community relations director of the center, said 400 people, black and white, were invited to a performance by the dancer and choreographer Bill T. Jones, a supper and a tour of the center's four-theater complex. The new relationships forged at the party and in the many phone calls that followed led to a small but promising number of group sales for the season's opening concert by Queen Ida and Her Bon Temps Zydeco Band, Mrs. Reines said.
In addition, the Performing Arts Center made some important new friends who have taken their own friends and families to programs. Salina Wilson, the director of public affairs for Con Edison, said she had not known of the Performing Arts Center before the party, even while working in a previous job in Purchase. "Once I knew it was there -- boom! -- I became a subscriber, and I took my son there," Ms. Wilson said.
She also said the local chapter of the Coalition of 100 Black Women, a national group of which she is a member, had sponsored its own theater party at a September performance of Les Ballets Africains at the center.
 
Inspired by Leonard Bernstein
 Robert A. Carpenter, a member of African-American Men of Westchester, was also at the party last June, where he said he had had "a personal vision that I could make an impact on the minority youth." He had been inspired in his own youth by watching Leonard Bernstein's Concerts for Young People on television, he said, and now saw a chance "to expose kids to the length and breadth of the performing arts."
Working with Kathryn K. Wolfe, group sales director for the center, he arranged for 85 children and chaperons to attend a performance by the mime and magician Avner the Eccentric in November, after which the performer met with the group. Mr. Carpenter said he hoped to take the youngsters to see the dancer Kevin Wynn at the center next month and Sweet Honey in the Rock, an all-woman gospel group, in March.
Perhaps the most ambitious effort to unite the county's blacks and whites in an arts event is "Music America," the New Orchestra of Westchester's benefit concert for a consortium of 20 local community organizations, at the Performing Arts Center on Friday at 8 P.M. On the program is "Cry the Beloved Country," a concert theater piece derived from "Lost in the Stars," Kurt Weill's musical about apartheid in South Africa based on Alan Paton's novel "Cry the Beloved Country."
The Morgan State University Choir, based in Maryland, will perform the work with the orchestra and soloists under the baton of Paul Lustig Dunkel, the New Orchestra's music director. Also on the program will be Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue," with Terrence Wilson, a 16-year-old pianist from the Bronx, as soloist. (For more information about "Music America," call 682-3707.)
Originally, these works were to be performed only in the orchestra's regular Saturday night and Sunday afternoon subscription series, until Mary Luehrsen-Young, the orchestra's executive director, and officials at Pepsico, which is sponsoring the program, sat down to talk.
 
'We Are Mutually Cooperating'
 Ronald E. Harrison, vice president of community affairs at Pepsico, said he saw an opportunity for the company to observe King's birthday in a meaningful way and help community groups at the same time. Representatives of the 20 groups, selected for their efforts to promote "ethnic, racial and religious harmony and respect," Mr. Harrison said, have met many times to make plans, stuff envelopes and contribute what Ms. Luehrsen-Young called "sweat equity."
Many members of the racially mixed consortium said that aside from the money they hope to make at the event -- more than half the proceeds of the higher-priced tickets for the concert and a reception will go to the benefiting groups -- the project has been valuable in bringing together the organizations.
"Instead of being competitive, we are mutually cooperating and accomplishing our own goals as well," said Henry Hobbs, executive director of Human Development Services of Port Chester, a member of the consortium.
Many of those at Friday's concert will be attending a live performance of a symphony orchestra for the first time. Ms. Luehrsen-Young said this would be a good introduction for them, since the program "breaks down the mystique that symphony orchestras only play Mozart and Beethoven."
On the other hand, Ms. Luehrsen-Young added: "I don't want to do programming just because it attracts a certain audience. That's a short-term viewpoint and rather self-centered. American music and the American symphony orchestra represent so many diverse ethnic influences, and we need to keep our sights on that goal.
"Maybe we'll build an audience slower that way," she said, "but it will be for the right reasons."

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Hertz to New York: Pay More

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
When he founded the first rent-a-car company in 1927, John Hertz thought he could control the business from top to bottom by building the cars himself, and came up with a model called the "Drive-Ur-Self," complete with running boards and a windshield that opened for ventilation. But he eventually decided that buying the standard models built by other manufacturers was more practical.
Now, 65 years later, the current chairman of the Hertz Corporation, Frank A. Olson, is also trying to keep control, in his case over the company's losses in New York City. Mr. Olson's solution -- imposing charges that would shoo away Hertz's riskiest customers -- may last longer than the Drive-Ur-Self, but it is already taking him down a rough road. 
 On Friday, New York Attorney General Robert Abrams sued Hertz over its policy, initiated Jan. 2, of imposing surcharges on rentals by residents of four New York boroughs, including $56 a day for Bronx residents. (As it happens, Mr. Abrams is a former Bronx Borough President.)
Hertz said it had instituted the policy because of extensive third-party losses. New York's "vicarious liability" law allows people injured by rental cars to sue the company that owns them, and Hertz said it had paid out $45 million over three years.
"We buy an asset, a $15,000 car, and rent it to a customer," Mr. Olson said. "Then we are responsible for whatever he does with it. If he hits a school bus, we can pay out $30 million." Mr. Olson said Hertz could justify the new surcharges by showing state officials the figures on liability losses, but he said that no matter what, the company was free to set its own prices.
Prices are particularly important these days. Last year was a rough one for the rental car industry, with business travel way down because of the recession and the Persian Gulf war. "In the first quarter, people were afraid to go to the bathroom, let alone get on an airplane," Mr. Olson said. Hertz controls about 31 percent of the airport rental market, he said, but that was 31 percent of a rather small number.
Mr. Olson, who is 59 years old, has been Hertz's chairman since June 1980 and a director since 1974. From June until December 1987, he was chairman, president and chief executive of the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines and the parent at that time of Hertz. When Hertz was spun off at the very end of 1987 he went with it, and is one of the group of top executives that owns 20 percent of the company, which is based in Park Ridge, N.J.
While Hertz is not publicly traded -- Ford Motor owns 49 percent, Volvo of North America owns 26 percent and a German bank, Commerzbank, holds the other 5 percent -- Mr. Olson said with obvious pride that his company was the only one in the field with its own credit rating. His competitors rely on their corporate parents (generally auto makers) or, like Avis, have no public debt.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
A Cross-Atlantic Rate Play

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
This is an unusual time for the United States bond market. Short-term interest rates are near 20-year lows, while rates abroad are much higher. That's an environment in which nimble risk takers might make a profit on the spread. But it's also an environment that many corporte treasurers, who want to preserve capital while putting idle money to work, are not used to.
Given these circumstances, Robert N. Gordon, president of the Twenty-First Securities Corporation in New York, is seeking an opportunity for his American corporate customers with millions of dollars in cash on hand. Paribas Asset Management, the investment subsidary of the French bank, is looking for entree to more American customers. And both want to act quickly because the interest rate opportunity they see is not going to last long. 
 So they have joined forces. Twenty-First Securities is providing the introduction to customers and Paribas the investing expertise with a special bonus: It will guarantee the nervous corporate treasurer that there will be no loss on the original investment. The principal will be secure.
Sounds great. But selling this product is not as easy as it sounds, even though some corporate treasurers like the sound of the new scheme. For one thing, corporations can often be slow in opening up to new investment ideas. For example, it has taken years for many global companies to begin thinking artfully about hedging their foreign-exchange exposure abroad. Also, budget goals set internally often discourage any adventuresome investing of corporate funds.
"Most corporate treasury departments are risk adverse almost to a fault," said Ken Drucker, treasurer of the Sequa Corporation, a New York-based manufacturer of aerospace products.
The sentiment of some treasurers seemed to be summed up by Paul Willey of Dresser Industries in Dallas, the energy production and service company: "Even some of the best have gotten hammered in the past on sure-shot deals." Dresser does not plan to put any money into the plan.
The product being offered is investment in medium-term bonds, focusing on Europe, with all investments hedged back into dollars to avoid currency risk. There are good arguments for shifting funds in that direction.
Interest rates in Europe are twice or more what they are in America. Also, there is a strong likelihood that rates in Europe will begin to fall this year when the German Bundesbank eases credit, which would create capital gains to add to the interest rate return. In the United States, on the other hand, short-term interest rates are inching up from their recent lows. Those increases will steadily nibble away at principal.
To make this shift to Europe more palatable to corporate types, Paribas decided to offer the no-loss-of-principle guarantee. It is in effect as long as the money -- with a minimum investment of $15 million -- is left with Paribas for at least a year.
Such a guarantee does catch the eye. "Our clients," Mr. Gordon said, with a nod to Will Rogers, "are more concerned with the return of their money than the return on their money.".
But the guarantee is really nothing more than a sales lure. Neither Paribas nor Twenty-First Securities think it will have to be drawn on. A look at the European bond market -- and its prospects for the next year -- support that idea. Mr. Gordon calculated that interest rates on German bonds with a four-year maturity would have to rise about 1.85 percentage points before the loss on the purchase price of the bond would wipe out the interest earned.
"There would have to be an extraordinary mistake" for a loss of principal to occur, said Peter Reinemann, a vice president at Paribas. "We are running the fund in an extremely conservative way and it is extremely unlikely that you would have anything like that." Paribas is travelling the States looking for customers. So far, no one has bitten. Among the companies they have talked to, in additon to Dresser, are CSX, Bristol-Meyers, Walt Disney and Litton Industries.
"The product is good and the guarantee enhances it," Mr. Wiley of Dresser said. "It is hard to get into Europeann securities and this strategey is important if Americans are ready to do that," he said, agreeing that the investing environment for corporate treasurers in the United States is difficult at the moment with interest rates so low. "Treasurers became fairly numb earning a comfortable rate."
But despite all that, he wouldn't put money in the fund. "You are making a rate bet against the principal," he said, scarey territory for many corporate treasurers, even with a guarantee.
For Mr. Wiley, it's all moot anyway. Dresser corporate policy wouldn't allow it, since the company prefers buying its own bonds. "We like to make the call," he said.
But Mr. Drucker of Sequa sees it the other way. With the guarantee, the downside is not getting the 4 percent a company can earn in the United States with current Treasury or certificate of deposit yields. The upside is getting foreign denominated bond yields that are much higher. "From an intellectual point of view it seemed rather intriguing to me," he said.
Still, he won't invest either. He doesn't have the cash available just now.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life CENTRAL CITY, Colo.;
Charming His Way To a Second Gold Rush

BYLINE: By Mary Billard

 BODY:
Less than an hour's drive from the big city of Denver, this picturesque Victorian hamlet is so folksy that the nearest coffee shop -- a good 10 miles down the interstate -- keeps the mugs of its regulars conveniently hanging on one wall. You'll find no shopping malls here. You can't even buy milk or bread. But you might pick up some nice Gold Rush memorabilia at the Lost Gold Mine, where tourists can root around the hollows of a closed-down shaft.
This is not exactly the kind of boom town where a flashy Hawaiian developer might be prone to plant his next project. Yet it is here that Christopher Hemmeter expects to extract his next million -- mustering all his country-boy charms to convince the 336 year-round residents that his dreams of glittery casinos are their dreams, too. "I'm not an interloper," he says. 
 For two decades, Mr. Hemmeter dominated the Hawaii hotel scene, building mind-boggling mega-resorts that were compared to India's Taj Mahal long before gambling became part of Donald Trump's vernacular. His 1,600-room Westin Kauai has a 2.1 acre reflecting pool, a fountain with eight life-sized marble horses and 10 miles of waterways, explorable by gondola. One of its 14 elevators is inside a 100-foot cliff. And it wasn't even his biggest hotel.
But the Central City power brokers were not about to allow Mr. Hemmeter to run wild, even if they thought he could snap some life into the limp local economy and usher in a second Gold Rush.
Central City's zoning, designed to preserve the historic town, allows a building to be 53 feet tall, but not if it's also that wide. Mr. Hemmeter's first proposal was "too tall," said Alan Granruth, the historic preservation administrator for Central City and jazz festival director. Asked to elaborate, Mr. Granruth obliged: "It was just too tall."
After the rejection, Mr. Hemmeter, 52, showing true Western grit, settled in last winter to take time to appreciate the locals, or, as he puts it, "to learn their dreams."
His Colorado roots helped his understanding. Mr. Hemmeter attended the University of Colorado for a year and fondly remembers performing in Central City's Mine Shaft bar in his salad days as part of a singing group. Until a few years ago, he had a house on Aspen Mountain -- with its own elevator in a cliff. (He sold it in the late 80's for a reported $17 million to Ted Field, movie producer and heir of Marshall Field department store, who now has it on the market for $25 million.)
In Hawaii, Mr. Hemmeter had been Mr. Glitz. But he sold his Hawaiian hotel properties for a handsome profit in the late 80's -- pocketing $188 million here, $320 million there. He had been splitting his time between his Bel Air mansion and his Hawaiian retreat at Diamond Head (onetime asking price: $60 million). But his interest in Hawaii faded in early 1991, after losing a bid to develop a major portion of Honolulu's waterfront.
Meanwhile, voters in Colorado had approved limited gambling in Central City and two other towns. Seeing gambling as the one growth area in the hotel business, Los Angeles-based Hemmeter Partners soon bought a 10,000-square-foot parking lot in Central City for an unheard of $5 million and leased property from the gas station in neighboring Black Hawk. The plan was to build two $12 million casino-and-restaurant complexes.
Mr. Hemmeter arrived here last January selling his project and his personality. Known for his common, folksy touch, he is universally called Chris, even by his construction crews. "Chris? Great family. Good people," said Jerry Brown, one of the gas station owners. "It sounds real syrupy, but we're just real comfortable with him and the deal. Real comfortable."
The area needed Mr. Hemmeter as much as he needed them. Bruce Schmaltz, the former unpaid mayor of Central City, said the once grand town was "falling down around our ears." A change in gold mining economics around World War I had turned Central City from "the richest square mile on earth" in 1859 into a virtual ghost town, according to Dick Allen, City Councilman and owner of the Lost Gold Mine.
Gambling was seen as the salvation -- a way to preserve the town's Victorian heritage, while modernizing its antique water system and roads. The $1,000 licensing fees the city is collecting per gambling device or table annually is expected to push its budget from $230,000 in 1991 to $2.5 million this year, with an $800,000 surplus. Suffice it to say, the new water system has been built. And several 19th-century buildings like the Teller House hotel and the Toll Gate Saloon have been restored by private interests.
Mr. Schmaltz has stepped down as mayor to run businesses. His holdings? "A gift-and-rock shop, a T-shirt shop and the Dostal [Alley] Saloon & Gambling Emporium," laughs Mr. Schmaltz. "We are comfortable, very comfortable."
After months of meetings with the historic commission, Chris Hemmeter seems to have romanced the town. While one-fourth the size of the Westin's reflecting pool, his 30,000-square-foot casino here, for which ground-breaking began last week, will be four times larger than the biggest casino approved to date. "He came in with a 35-foot building," Mr. Granruth said. "We are very pleased."
The casinos, which are to open by June 1, will be named the Bullwhackers after the pioneers who drove across the Great Plains. "Bullwhackers. Bullwhackers," repeats Mr. Hemmetter, relishing the sound. He certainly seems to have the Western thing down.

ECONOMY
 
The Irrepressible Bull Market Keeps Roaring Along 

The air waves are filled with New Hampshire residents talking about how low their state's economy has sunk, but many other people seem to be betting that a recovery is not far away. Despite a shortage of good economic news, the stock market has defied gravity day after day. After soaring 60 points on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 12 more on Wednesday and, after a one-day breather, jumped to 3,264.98 on Friday, closing at its 10th record high in 15 sessions. If the explanations for the rises seemed flimsy, trading volume was solid. At least 200 million shares have been traded daily on the Big Board in every session since Dec. 27. Commentators had some difficulty in deciding why people are suddenly so bullish. But Peter G. Grennan of Shearson Lehman Brothers found a down-to-earth explanation for the sudden flow of cash to Wall Street: "The real nut came when depositors at the banks had to start accepting less than 4 percent."
 
 
Those Retailers Were Right
 
Retailers who were complaining last month about the weak holiday shopping season were not kidding. Retail sales, covering receipts at car dealers, gasoline stations, restaurants and appliance stores as well as Christmas shopping at the malls, fell four-tenths of 1 percent in December. And both of the two previous months were revised downward. For the year, retail sales rose only seven-tenths of 1 percent. It was the poorest annual performance since 1961. The overall picture is of consumers even more restrained than had previously been thought.
 
 
Salomon Was Not Alone
 
Salomon Brothers is in deep trouble for making illegal bids at Treasury auctions. But apparently almost everyone inflated customer orders when bidding for the debt of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Sallie Mae and two other Government-sponsored agencies. So the Securities and Exchange Commission imposed fines ranging up to $100,000 on 98 banks and securities firms. The penalties totaled about $5 million and saved both the S.E.C. and the companies the cost of lawsuits. The S.E.C. investigation found institutions with elaborate sets of phony records that would allow them to seek more than their share of debt securities so they could be assured of filling all orders. But lawyers for the companies asserted that, unlike the case involving Salomon, nobody was harmed by the inflated bids.
 
 
The End of an Oil Era?
 
Oil production in the United States fell sharply at the end of last year. Output was the lowest in 30 years in the fourth quarter and outside of Alaska it was the lowest since 1950. The director of finance for the American Petroleum Institute, Edward H. Murphy, said, "It's quite possible that the age of major domestic production is coming to an end." The decline was attributed in part to a drop in demand, related both to the recession and to the better gasoline mileage of recent-vintage vehicles. It also reflects increased use of natural gas. But the trend does not go far beyond the borders of the United States. Worldwide, demand for oil is growing, and exploration and production are increasing as well.
 
 
At Least Prices Aren't Soaring
 
The recession has had at least one positive side effect. Consumer prices rose just 3.1 percent last year, the smallest rise since 1986 and barely half the rate of increase in 1990. The Labor Department said the inflation picture in December was about the same as it had been for months. Consumer prices rose three-tenths of a percent after a gain of four-tenths of a percent in November.
 
 
Trucks, but Not Cars
 
All those shoppers who were thrifty in December did not rush to auto showrooms as the new year opened. Vehicle sales in the first 10 days of January slumped to an annual rate of 5.3 million, a dismal pace that was slower even than December's and than the beginning of last year, when war loomed in the Mideast. But there was one positive detail: Truck sales rose 6.7 percent in the latest period.
 
 
State of the Economy
 
Back from his foreign travels, President Bush ventured into New Hampshire to start his re-election campaign and to confront his domestic economic problems. "I probably have made mistakes in assessing the fact that the economy would recover," Mr. Bush said. He is aware of the economic decline, he asserted, while adding, "Maybe I haven't conveyed it as I should have." He indicated that he will outline his plans to address economic problems in his State of the Union address at the end of the month.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Citicorp, Think Rebound
 
Last year, it took more than mere mediocrity or even a stroke or two of bad luck for a company's stock to drop. Citicorp managed it, however, with huge loan losses, big employee cutbacks and rumors about management missteps. Bank stocks as a whole rose 67.3 percent in 1991; Citicorp fell 17.8 percent. But this week, Citicorp started to catch up with the rest of the pack. What news changed investors' minds about the nation's biggest banking company? Citicorp said it would lose as much as $150 million in the fourth quarter and $475 million for the full year. This announcement was no better than many analysts had predicted, but investors seemed elated that the news was not worse. And they apparently were cheered by predictions of profits in 1992. For the week, Citicorp's stock was up about 40 percent.
 
 
Some Sit Out the Super Bowl
 
The annual head shaking has begun about the stunning price of Super Bowl ads this year: $850,000 for 30 seconds. Certain prominent television advertisers, including Coca-Cola, have decided to sit this one out. Although CBS is offering package deals that combine the football game with spots in other game-day programs or in the Olympics, the network says it is confident that, as usual, all of the advertising time will eventually be sold -- and at the full price.
 
Air Space Subdivision
 
The Federal Communications Commission took the first steps toward clearing the air for new generations of wireless telephones. The move may ultimately allow a caller to find individuals anywhere in the world, no matter how far they wander off the beaten track. The F.C.C. proposed allowing the new technology to use some frequencies now reserved for police dispatching and utility companies. It also suggested that new customers could buy out existing frequency owners and underwrite their costs of moving to new frequencies.
 
 
Big Blue's Revenue Drops
 
I.B.M. reported a loss of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter because of a $3.4 billion accounting charge to pay for corporate cost-cutting. For the full year, the giant computer company lost $2.8 billion, in part because of an additional big write-off to pay for retirees' health-care benefits. But perhaps the most striking feature of the report was the company's decline in revenues: 6.1 percent, to $64.8 billion, for 1991. It was I.B.M.'s first year-to-year drop in revenue since 1946. Analysts said this provided stark evidence that the computer industry is no longer a rapidly growing business. In light of this reality, I.B.M. has been cutting its costs. The company said 29,000 jobs were eliminated last year, considerably higher than the goal of 20,000, but it still plans to cut an additional 20,000 jobs in 1992. Still, investors found enough to like in I.B.M.'s report on Friday that the company' stock rose 87.5 cents a share, to $96.375.
 
 
Macy's Stalls on Payments
 
Off and on for months there have been rumors that R. H. Macy & Company was not paying its suppliers. Now it is documented. In the wake of disappointing Christmas sales, the company said it would postpone payments until Jan. 25. Macy's said agreements with several banks required it to reduce its borrowing and thus it was short on cash. Some suppliers worried that a bankruptcy filing might be next, but the company insisted that it had no such intention.
 
 
Bad Outlook for B-Schoolers
 
The job outlook for men and women who will receive master's degrees in business administration this spring is not good. According to Northwestern University's annual survey of corporate recruiting plans, employers expect to hire 8 percent fewer people with M.B.A.'s this spring. Even in financial firms, where business has been great lately, many of the jobs will go to people laid off elsewhere rather than to newly minted M.B.A.'s. But the news apparently has not reached prospective students. Duke University's business school says applications have increased 83 percent this year compared with the comparable date a year earlier. This could make for a good case study on the market forces working on prospective M.B.A.'s.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Bright Spot in Trade
 
The United States trade deficit was only $3.57 billion in November, the lowest monthly deficit in nearly nine years. Export sales climbed to $37.46 billion in the month, exceeding the record that had been set only a month earlier. The improvement in the deficit was attributable in part to the sluggish American economy, which caused retailers and others to cut back on overseas orders. Imports dropped 5.5 percent in November, to $41.03 billion. In light of the unexpectedly low deficit in November, the trade imbalance for the entire year will almost certainly drop below $100 billion for the first time since 1983.
 
 
The 'Names' Duck at Lloyd's
 
After 300 years, Lloyd's of London has proposed putting a ceiling on members' exposure to losses. Before this, its investors, known as "names," faced unlimited liability. Lloyd's, which is famous for providing insurance for almost any request, experienced huge losses in the late 80's, and some names were said to have been ruined. Under the new plan, a levy of one-quarter of 1 percent will be imposed on all members' participation to create a fund to cover names' extraordinary losses.
 
 
Another Nibble at A.T.&T.
 
The "telegraph" is no more, and now the "American" in A.T.&T.'s full name is less absolute than it used to be. Under a deal reached last week, the company will take a 39 percent stake in a venture to build and operate a modern long-distance telephone system in Ukraine. It is the first significant stake for A.T.&T. in a long-distance network in a foreign nation, and it is one of the first big agreements involving a leading American company and a former republic since the Soviet Union was disbanded last month.

HEADLINE: USAir Discovers There Is Life After a Messy Merger

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
Since taking over USAir last year, Seth E. Schofield has won high marks for making the best of a bad hand. But it is still far from clear that the troubled carrier, the country's fourth-largest airline, will wind up a winner.
When Mr. Schofield was promoted to chief executive, replacing Edwin I. Colodny, USAir was hemorrhaging. A pair of ambitious mergers in the late 80's, with Pacific Southwest Airlines and Piedmont Aviation, produced a raft of problems. The carrier had also been battered, along with the rest of the industry, by the effects of the recession and the Persian Gulf war. 
 USAir continues to bleed, but at a much slower rate. Costs have been cut, through a mix of layoffs, deferred orders of new planes and the closing of overlapping facilities. Many of the money-losing routes in PSA's highly competitive West Coast market have been dropped.
And some of the roughest edges of the messy Piedmont merger have been smoothed out. No longer -- or, at least, not nearly so often -- is the carrier referred to as Useless Air because of problems with flight delays, lost luggage and surly employees.
Losses could drop this year to as little as $145 million, said Paul P. Karos, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. That is less than a third of 1991's estimated loss of $457 million. Moreover, the company, based here, is cushioned by a $1.5 billion cash reserve.
"They have been very prudent," said Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley. "They have been husbanding their financial resources through very difficult times."
Things are even stable enough these days for Mr. Schofield to embark on a new program of domestic growth and consolidation. Earlier this month, USAir got final approval to buy a slew of takeoff and landing slots at New York's La Guardia Airport from Continental Airlines. And it recently agreed to operate the Trump Shuttle in the coveted Boston-Washington corridor.
But what Mr. Schofield and his staff say they cannot afford to do is expand just as aggressively abroad, where the biggest growth in traffic is expected over the next decade.
"Quite frankly," said Randall Malin, executive vice president of marketing, "we were not in the position to compete with the carriers with deep pockets."
As the airline industry contracts, however, the biggest carriers are getting even bigger by developing abroad. American, United and Delta have all been busy buying up foreign routes. The problem now facing Mr. Schofield is that USAir is in danger of becoming just a domestic feeder line for these global giants.
To be sure, USAir has a few toeholds abroad, with some service to Europe and the Caribbean. It just spent $50 million to acquire a London-to-Philadelphia route from Trans World Airlines. Eventually, USAir can make up some of its disadvantages by forming alliances with such major overseas carriers as British Airways or Lufthansa -- a course that it is already pursuing.
Nonetheless, for better or worse, USAir is sticking largely to its domestic knitting, continuing, in particular, to repair the damage from its merger with Piedmont.
"They ended up with too many hubs," said Dan Kasper, a consultant on international aviation at Harbridge House, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. "They have to get that together."
USAir started out modestly as Allegheny Airlines, which built up a route system in the East. In 1972, the carrier made a big jump in size by acquiring Mohawk Airlines. When deregulation was introduced in 1978, the airline established a major hub in Pittsburgh and its fleet blanketed many Eastern markets. In 1979, it changed its name to USAir to reflect its wider reach, and in the late 80's, it made its biggest leap by acquiring PSA and Piedmont. The carrier now has 429 planes operating out of five hubs -- Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charlotte, N.C., and Indianapolis.
USAir had no choice about expanding, analysts say, given the consolidation that was dramatically changing the nature of the industry. But the major breakdowns in service that grew out of the Piedmont merger could have been avoided, they say.
USAir was aware of the huge problems that Northwest Airlines encountered when it quickly took over Republic Airlines in 1987. Confusion about that merger and resentment between the two employee groups led to months of turmoil and years of ill-feeling at Northwest.
USAir was determined to avoid such an upheaval. Among other things, it raised the wages and benefits of Piedmont employees to the higher union levels of USAir.
But in an effort to minimize confusion and duplication, it decided that Piedmont employees would have to adopt the work methods and operations of the parent. Many from Piedmont balked, however, at the more rigid and bureaucratic ways of the larger carrier, which formally took over Piedmont in August 1989.
The result was often chaos. Large numbers of canceled flights played havoc with USAir's schedule and passenger complaints soared over missed connections, misplaced baggage and hostile or nonexistent service.
In hindsight, said Mike Schwab, senior vice president of operations, there was a basic contradiction in USAir's approach to the merger. The idea to use a "mirror image" strategy, recasting Piedmont in USAir's mold, was at odds with the goal of bringing together the best of both companies.
But while some union leaders and employees are still upset at the way the merger was carried out, most have put aside their bitterness, Mr. Schwab said. Passenger complaints have dropped so sharply that the carrier had the lowest rate in the industry in October.
"The problems of the merger are behind us," Mr. Schwab said.
Meanwhile, the airline has also moved to cut down its overhead, laying off 3,800 employees and sharply cutting back its flights out of Dayton, Ohio, a Piedmont hub.
It also phased out many of the smaller cities it served on the West Coast since it took over PSA in 1988.
The retrenchment, said the 52-year-old Mr. Schofield, "got us down to the point where we felt comfortable that we had matched capacity with demand."
As for going global, Mr. Schofield says he is not worried that USAir has fallen behind.
"We want to go international," he said. "It's important to go, but only out of those cities and hubs that make sense for us. We don't believe going everywhere in Europe is the end all."
Meanwhile he proudly described the dominant position that the airline is building in the New York area.
Now that the agreement to buy 62 jet slots at La Guardia has been approved by the Federal bankruptcy court overseeing Continental's Chapter 11 reorganization, USAir departures there will rise to 30 percent of the airport total, from 21 percent. Added service will include 12 daily flights to Florida, five nonstops to Atlanta and five nonstops to Chicago's Midway airport.
USAir is also gearing up to revamp the Trump Shuttle, which it will begin to manage after a final agreement is signed. The carrier plans to buy the shuttle at the end of five years, when it has the right of first refusal.
USAir is expanding operations in Pittsburgh as well. A new terminal there will open in October, expanding its gates to 52, from 36.
"We still see a lot of growth in the U.S.," Mr. Malin said. "The question for the industry is whether it will grow at 2, 4 or 8 percent a year. We don't know the answer to that."
The recession, higher fares and general belt-tightening by companies have reduced the frequency of business trips but the long-term impact will not be known until the economy recovers, he said.
Because of USAir's strong cash position and growing ability to stem its losses, most analysts believe that the carrier is in fairly good shape.
"There is no near-term cash flow problem whatsoever," said Mr. Karos, the industry analyst for First Boston, who recently did a liquidity analysis of the airline.
He warned, however, that a crunch could come later this year. "If there has been no turn in the economy, if there is no turn in the industry, then Chapter 11 may have to be invoked," he said.
But even if USAir went into Chapter 11, Mr. Karos said, it would have the strength to reorganize and not be forced to liquidate, as Pan American and Eastern were.
Mr. Karos added that if the airline were able to limit its losses this year to under $250 million there would be little danger of having to seek bankruptcy protection. One hurdle the carrier has to overcome, he said, is to win concessions from its major unions.
Further cost-cutting will not be easy, however. USAir flights are shorter than most, averaging 457 miles compared with about 800 miles for other major carriers. "We land and take off often," Mr. Schofield said, a schedule that adds to fuel and labor expenses and makes USAir one of the highest-cost airlines in the business.
Given all these constraints, USAir must still find a way to grow fast enough to remain one of the industry's major players.
"We recognize that we cannot shrink our way into prosperity," Mr. Schofield said.
 
COMPETING WITH ITSELF
 When USAir announced a year ago that it would drop Dayton International Airport as a hub, some of the painful costs of the carrier's 1989 merger with Piedmont Aviation were made clear.
USAir said that it had lost $45 million in Dayton, long one of Piedmont's most successful hubs, in the 18 months before it sharply curtailed operations there. But what the carrier did not say was that the Piedmont takeover had left it with too many hubs and that, in this case, it wound up cannibalizing one of its own.
Roy Williams, now the director of aviation at Dayton, worked for USAir as head of airport relations at the time of the merger. He recalled that the carrier ran flights to both its Pittsburgh and Dayton hubs that were convenient for business travelers from such points as Toledo and Detroit. Since Pittsburgh, long a USAir hub, had more connections, traffic to Dayton eventually began to decline.
"They were competing with themselves," he said.
While the cutback was justified -- other carriers had established themselves in such nearby hubs as Cincinnati (Delta), Cleveland (Continental) and Detroit (Northwest) -- it greatly fed the anger of Piedmont employees who were absorbed in the merger, Mr. Williams said.
Dayton International has not been able to fill the gap left by USAir's dwindling presence even though such carriers as American and Northwest have added flights.
"We have our hopes," Mr. Williams said. Meanwhile, the airport plans to break even this year through an increase in landing fees.

HEADLINE: All About/Packaging;
Learning to Wrap Products in Less -- or Nothing at All

 BODY:
Packaging, that ubiquitous staple of modern life, is big business, adding as much as $70 billion a year to the nation's economy. It protects goods from being tampered with and from being battered during the journey from factory to store. It preserves food and helps sell the products within.
It also represents a new way for financially strapped local governments, which bear the cost of disposing of garbage, to cut their costs. A variety of state legislative initiatives would force manufacturers to be accountable for a package after it was sold and thereby cut down on what is the fastest-growing component of the garbage crisis, accounting for more than 30 percent of the nation's municipal solid waste. 
 "While states like New York can't afford teachers, police, shelters for the homeless and full-time subways, packaging manufacturers unthinkingly foist millions of dollars of expenses onto us all every day," said Allen Hershkowitz, a scientist at the National Resources Defense Council.
Redundant packaging, environmentalists argue, includes boxes, for perfume bottles say, that are in turn covered in plastic wrapping; single-serving foods that produce far more waste packaging per ounce of edibles than larger-sized servings, and compact disks sold in packages 10 times the volume of the disk itself.
 
'Date and Rate' Laws
How Much Can Be Recycled, and When
 One of the most watched of the state actions was a bill introduced in Massachusetts last yearproposing to ban by the mid-1990's any packaging that does not meet certain reuse or recycling standards. Although it died at the end of the year, environmentalists are now trying to revive it.
The bill, referred to in the industry as a "dates and rates" measure, was expected by many environmentalists to serve as a prototype in other states.
Specifically, it would have banned packaging by July 1, 1996, that could not be reused at least five times, 25 percent of whose raw materials are not recyclables or 25 percent of whose contents are not being recycled. The recycling requirement would increase to 35 percent by 1999 and 50 percent by 2000. The bill was passed by the House and had the support of Gov. William Weld, but it died in the Senate.
The bill was vigorously opposed by manufacturers and retailers of packaged goods, who argue that recycling mandates are impractical in places where recycling facilities do not exist or are very limited. Only one type of plastic, the material found in large soda bottles, is being commercially recycled now, so under the law, most plastic packaging would in effect be banned.
"Dates and rates will ban the safest and most effective food packaging," said Jeffrey Nedelman, vice president of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, one of the leading opponents of such measures. For example, he said, no good replacement exists for the plastic foam and clear wrap used to package meat. "Safeway tried going back to the cardboard that was used 20 years ago as an experiment in Oregon and it failed," Mr. Nedelman said. "The cardboard absorbs blood and sticks to the meat after it's been in the freezer."
Even so, supporters of the measure, led by the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, intend to try again in the legislature and plan to take the initiative to voters on the fall ballot if they fail. "We have the signatures, so if we don't have a legislative agreement by the end of May, we will go ahead," said Amy Perry, an official of Masspirg, as the group is known.
Meanwhile, similar bills are being filed in other states and at the Federal level. "We are looking at six states with serious dates and rates legislation this year," said Mr. Nedelman. He said it was unclear what would happen in Congress, but noted that Representative Al Swift, a Washington Democrat and the chairman of a key subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, had introduced a bill patterned on the Massachusetts proposal.
Another proposal making the rounds would establish a ratio between product and packaging. It would mandate that no more than a certain percentage of the total volume of an item -- N.R.D.C. favors 10 percent -- is package rather than the product itself.
 
Stores Can Help
Displaying Products In the Raw
 There is a precedent for making manufacturers and retailers responsible for disposal of packaging. In Germany, manufacturers are now required to collect and recycle the cartons used to ship products to stores. As time goes on, German retailers will have to allow customers to remove purchases from packages and leave the packages at the store.
Sensing similar trends in the United States, some manufacturers and retailers are already changing their packaging. McDonald's 1990 initiative to abandon foam polystyrene hamburger boxes in favor of a less bulky wrap of paper and flexible plastic is the most celebrated example.
Sears, Roebuck and Company is working with its suppliers to reduce packaging by 25 percent by the end of 1994. The company estimates the program will eliminate 1.5 million tons of packaging a year by the end of 1994 and save it $5 million a year.
In some stores, Sears is displaying its Craftsman brand hand tools like pliers and screwdrivers on racks without any packaging. Once the no-package program is expanded to 500 stores, the company said, it will eliminate 78 tons of plastic a year.
Wal-Mart Stores and the K-Mart Corporation had previous begun similar, though less extensive, packaging reduction programs.
 
A Design Problem
New Ways to Catch the Consumer's Eye
 At least initially, the trend could be a boon to package design firms.
"Most of our clients are now listing environmental friendliness as a design objective," said Richard Gerstman, managing partner of Gerstman and Meyers, a package design firm in New York. "A few years ago it did not even come up."
For example, he said, hardware that formerly had been sold in cardboard and plastic "blister packs" may now be displayed in boxes. A blister pack is typically split open to get at the material inside and then discarded. But a box might be used to store unused components and not go immediately into the trash.
Some consumer goods marketers are reluctant to simplify or reduce packaging because that is what does the final selling job on the store shelf. But Mr. Gerstman said they can get the product identification without a large billboard. In the past, he said, many bottled products also had cardboard outer containers. When the outer container was eliminated, he said, designers simply made the label on the bottle larger and more noticeable to attract the eye of shoppers.
 
 
COMPETING WITH ITSELF
 Recessions are bad for recycling programs. Last year, the demand for reclaimed materials dropped because manufacturers were making fewer products and because the price of the virgin raw materials slipped.
While materials made of recycled products are less expensive, manufacturers often prefer the virgin materials because, among other things, they are easier to source.
With mandatory recycling programs in place in many areas of the country, materials brokers said, glass, aluminum and plastic containers continue to pour into collection centers, regardless of demand. With excess supply chasing inadequate demand, prices took a beating.
According to Recycling Times, a publication of the National Solid Waste Management Association, prices for glass containers, aluminum beverage cans and plastic bottles fell to near record lows in 1991. By year-end green glass, which comes into the country carrying imported wines and beer, had no value at all, according to the newspaper's price survey.
The price paid by brokers for aluminum cans fell from almost 30 cents a pound at the beginning of the year to barely more than 20 cents by the end, according to the survey. The value of clear polyethylene terepthalate, which is used in large soda bottles, fell from almost 7 cents a pound to 1.2 cents.
Prices may firm up this year, brokers say, with the expected startup of new plants to process reclaimed materials.

HEADLINE: Coins

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:
For some people, coin collecting is a love, and for others it is a legacy. Often, a coin collection cherished by the original owner is passed on to heirs who have neither the interest nor the expertise to know what to do with all those old nickels and quarters.
The first thing to do is to figure out which of three different types of collections you've inherited. There's the true collection, one for which the collector spent hours poring through catalogues and browsing in coin shops, carefully selecting the best pieces he could afford. Such a collection can take years to build and is usually handsomely packaged and meticulously catalogued. It probably includes sales records for coins bought and sold and a list of each coin in the collection. 
 The second type is the collection built from the coins of everyday life. Usually all United States currency, the coins may have come from change in the grocery or delicatessen and probably show some wear and tear. But often some fine specimens show up in such a collection.
One collector, the owner of a coin laundry, built quite a good collection from the change boxes in his washers and dryers. Over the years, his careful attention to lint-covered coins paid off.
The third type of collection is the one most people are familiar with: a jar, sometimes huge, containing loose pocket change. Possibly a large part of the national debt is cloistered this way and perhaps a small part of the international balance of payments, as most leftover pesos and francs and marks from trips abroad go into this collection, too.
No matter which of the three types of collection is bequeathed, the same rule applies: Know what you have. For the last two types, it is best to go to a local coin dealer and buy "A Guidebook of United States Coins" by R. S. Yoeman, published annually by the Western Publishing Company. It is available by mail from Donovan Music and Toy Distributors, where it is listed as item No. 9051-92. The cost is $8.95, plus $3 shipping and handling, from the company at 732 Clinton Street, Waukesha, Wis. 53186; (800) 236-7123.
The guidebook is also referred to as the Red Book, and it shows the best price paid for each type of United States coin in the preceding year. This gives some indication of the value of each coin. In the front of the book is a chapter on grading coins. Although no one will become an expert simply by reading that chapter, one can become familiar with the grading system.
With the book in hand, go through the collection, assessing each coin's condition and then checking its approximate value. Take notes on each coin that seems valuable. Put the ones that are not valuable into a separate pile: no matter how common and battered a quarter may be, it's still worth 25 cents.
If you want to sell the coins that seem to have some additional value, take them to the coin dealer from whom you bought the Red Book. Ask what the dealer will offer, then take the coins to several other dealers. Take the best offer.
If the offers seem low compared with the Red Book values, don't feel that you are being cheated. The book price is the highest price paid for a particular coin. It does not mean that the same coin will sell for the same price again.
Also, the coin market is a little slow these days because of the recession and because coin collecting is not as popular as it was years ago. A dealer might have to hold your coins for some time before he can resell them. And a dealer may make no offer at all because he already has plenty of what you are selling. You can hold on to the coins until prices go up.
Finally, if your inheritance is a true collection, try getting in touch with the company that dealt with the collector. Usually the original collector will be well known in the small community of serious collectors.
Established dealers are usually listed in the Yellow Pages. Complaints about dealers may be on record at the Better Business Bureau. Also, the American Numismatic Association (818 North Cascade Avenue, Colorado Springs 80903; 719-632-2646) can tell you about any complaints it has received about specific dealers. But it will not recommend one dealer over another.
Established dealers may offer appraisal services. They may offer to buy the collection or sell it at auction, or they will suggest someone who might. The cost of an appraisal varies with the size of the collection and the location. In New York, a dealer's written appraisal of a small collection of fewer than 100 coins will probably cost $50 to $100.
Of course, after all this work with coins, you may find that you have been bitten by the collecting bug yourself.

HEADLINE: Guess We Just Don't Figure in U.S. Car Makers' Marketing Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While experts decide who to blame for the American auto industry's problems, I'd like to tell my story of trying to buy an American car. 
 I am a self-employed woman who likes to drive a five-speed, manual-transmission car. In December I went shopping to replace an eight-year-old Honda Accord (my second). Even though I have been happy with my Hondas, I was concerned about our national economy. So I decided to make a concerted effort to find an American equivalent. Surely, I reasoned, American marketing savvy would produce an American version of such a popular, top-selling five-speed car. Here's what happened:
My first stop was Ford, where the stick-shift options were a lower priced Escort or top-of-the-line Taurus, which had more "bells and whistles" than I wanted and cost $11,000 more than I wanted to spend. Ford's other moderate-priced cars didn't come with manual transmission.
Next stop, Pontiac. I liked the Grand Am and the price was right. It seemed like a good alternative to the Accord. But the salesman had no five-speed cars for me to road test. He offered to order one if I left a $300 deposit. "If you don't like it, all you'll lose is your $300," he explained.
Because the Grand Am really looked like a possibility, I pursued it further and went to another town where a Pontiac dealer had a car for me to test drive. The clutch was nice and smooth and the car handled well. However, General Motors redesigned the 1992 Grand Am and added a center console with a covered catch-all between the front seats. Every time I shifted gears my elbow hit the hard plastic cover that serves as an armrest. Nothing could be done about it.
The salesman noted that his wife, who is my height (5 foot 3), drives the 1991 Grand Am and would have the same problem with the '92 model I did. I suggested he inform G.M.'s powers-that-be that they redesigned themselves out of a customer, that they should be more sensitive to people like me. He said he wouldn't because they would only accuse him of not being able to make the sale.
Fourth stop Buick, because my son-in-law suggested I look at the Skylark. There I was told that Buick makes no cars at all with a stickshift.
Last stop Honda -- and my third five-speed Honda Accord. Now I drive it without feeling guilty. I really tried, but American car makers have not factored me into their marketing plans.

HEADLINE: No Cinderella Story for Russian Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a member of the three-author panel on Key Issues of Soviet Economic Reform at last week's American Economics Association meetings, I was taken aback by your news article "Russians Urged to Act Fast" (Business Day, Jan. 6) reporting agreement on questions concerning privatization and stabilization, and the type and amounts of aid required: full speed on the former, and a maximally open spigot on the latter. There was no such agreement. 
 Wanting rapid privatization is like opting for fraternity and liberty. The issue is how fast it can really proceed and if it cannot be fast, what this implies for economic policymaking.
Experience everywhere, including that of Margaret Thatcher, whose firm intentions are beyond doubt, and of Poland, demonstrates the many roadblocks, economic and political, privatization faces. Just imagine: how rapidly will buyers be found for most of the obsolete industrial dinosaurs in the former Soviet Union?
At the meetings I discussed the difficulties of land privatization in the former Soviet republics, a minor issue in Poland where collectivization had not occurred significantly.
For instance, there are few land records and assessments of quality variations without which farms cannot be subdivided equitably among families. Again, the massive size of the farms means that the heavy tractors designed for them will be unsuitable for the small farms resulting from the division of the cropland among the farm households. Cooperative use of the tractors, and eventual redesigning of new tractors, will be necessary: both will take careful planning, institution building and therefore time. Slogans will not suffice.
Equally, stabilization is now the crying need. The Russian budget deficit, fueling inflation, is 15 to 20 percent of its national income. But bringing it down to zero in three months, as early reports of advice to President Boris N. Yeltsin indicated, is surely not feasible. And if seriously attempted, it would create massive dislocation and unemployment: it would be like slamming the brakes in a car speeding at 100 miles per hour. Is this good advice?
The aid conference scheduled toward the end of the month in Washington will need to keep away from such follies. It will also need to focus on two salient political and economic realities:
* The infancy, at best, of the political culture of democracy and of the economic institutions of capitalism makes the former Soviet republics worthy recipients of technical assistance and unworthy candidates for large-scale financial aid. Megabuck plans, fashionable last year, are both costly and unsuitable to the task.
* A combination of the fear of lapse into anarchy and the presence of a multitude of missiles drives us toward assisting these countries. Why not tie, with delicacy but firmness, our aid into the destruction of these missiles? "Nukes for dollars," like debt relief for environment, is an idea whose time has come. It should unite both Democrats and Republicans behind an effort that otherwise lacks political appeal.

HEADLINE: Whose Welfare?;
The Poor, They Are Different, and in '92, Ever More Invisible

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H.

 BODY:
THE Democratic candidates for President, anxious to woo back the disaffected middle class, have all but abandoned their traditional role as champions of the disenfranchised.
It is almost an oversight, this eerie silence on the campaign trail about issues that affect the poor. But it is a telling omission for the party that had traditionally spoken for the disadvantaged, especially during a battle over whether states should cut entitlement programs to balance strained budgets. 
 In New Jersey, California, Michigan, Tennessee, Illinois, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, welfare programs have emerged as a popular cash cow for strapped treasuries. In some cases -- as in New Jersey -- the budget cuts have come attached to proposals designed to limit family size. In others, the reductions in general aid have slashed across the board.
But if these remarkable changes of direction have been the subject of heated debate in state capitals -- Jesse Jackson marched in Lansing, Mich., last week -- they have been largely ignored on the campaign trail.
Instead, wooing the middle class has become all the rage. They are angry and they vote. What Presidential candidate could resist?
None, apparently. The major candidates for President are campaigning during a protracted recession that pitched President Bush onto the political defensive as he made his first appearance in New Hampshire last week and has let the Democrats make their case.
But the candidates have built their campaigns around middle-class tax cuts, capital-gains tax cuts and universal health care programs designed to appeal to middle-class workers. Their consultants have searched out the code phrases that might turn off middle-class voters by suggesting that they favor welfare.
When Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas commiserates with New Hampshire voters about how the unemployment rolls there have been swollen by middle-class people, he gets approving nods and applause. When the Democratic contender is asked about the New Jersey welfare-cut proposal awaiting the signature of the Democratic Governor, Jim Florio, he equivocates, saying that he lacks specifics on the New Jersey plan.
 
'Compassion Fatigue'
 Even Senator Tom Harkin, the most outspoken defender of traditional Democratic values in the field, has only addressed poverty as a campaign issue in what one of his advisers described as "a thematic sense." Like the other candidates, he talks about child care and child-support enforcement, said Lorraine Voles, a Harkin campaign spokeswoman. But such questions are discussed far more often in the context of what Ms. Voles called the "middle-class squeeze."
In their messages for 1992, the candidates seem to have scrubbed poverty from their agendas. If they talk about the poor at all, it is to promote ideas like earned income-tax credits. Dependency is not in vogue.
"Polls are showing these guys that people are feeling a compassion fatigue," said Robert Borosage, an analyst for the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington who advised Mr. Jackson in 1988. "They're tired of the homeless, tired of poor people. In some sense, it's a great retreat to the conservative agenda."
Take the word "needy." It sometimes seems to have been effectively redefined to mean those who are considered to be otherwise capable of earning $50,000 or more a year.
 
Losing a Voice
 "Nobody's speaking for poor people," said Kevin Gray, an adviser to Senator Harkin in South Carolina.
And the candidates' staffs as much as admit it.
Paul Tsongas' "definition of liberalism is expanding the pie," said Peggy Connolly of Mr. Tsongas' staff.
"It doesn't come up a lot," said Steve Jarding, a spokesman for Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. "It is a campaign geared to a middle class pinched very hard in the 1980's. The haves got more and the have-nots got less, but the tax burden fell on the middle class."
It's a message that falls on receptive ears at campaign rallies, events that poor people may not have the motivation or the bus fare to attend. But, if anything, their plight is more desperate than it has been in years.
Last fall, the Census Bureau reported that the poverty rate rose sharply in 1990 and that declining incomes forced 2 million more people below the Federal poverty line -- $10,419 for a family of three. By the end of the year, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington policy research organization that specializes in poverty issues, reported that 40 states cut or froze benefits to families with children.
The five major Democratic contenders will have two opportunities to address such issues in Washington this week before the United States Conference of Mayors and Mr. Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.
It is an interesting dilemma for the Democrats, who are working assiduously to shed any Republican effort to tag them as tax-and-spend liberals. Michael S. Dukakis was never able to fully escape such a characterization.
The other problem is that, for ill or good, the problems of the poor have become inextricably bound up in the thorny question of race. David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard, garnered the majority of the white vote in the Louisiana governor's race by alluding frequently to undeserving welfare recipients.
During the last two Presidential elections, the Democrats were able to conveniently sidestep the whole matter by ceding the issue of the disadvantaged and the disenfranchised to Jesse Jackson.
"The unmentionable in all of this is race," said Mr. Borosage. "What this represents for Democrats is a kind of assumption that people think of poor people as African-American and Hispanic."
But, in a politically twisted way, there could be good news in the offing for the disenfranchised. Absent Mr. Jackson's overwhelmingly popular presence, white candidates will probably be more likely to lobby for black votes. And they will remain ever mindful that many blacks, too, are middle class.
And in the final analysis, candidates seem to realize that even many of the poor don't like to call themselves poor. "We all want to think we're middle class, even if we're not," said Andres Gonzalez, a former executive director of the Texas Mexican-American Democrats, which recently endorsed Governor Clinton.
It is not as if the candidates never come in contact with the needy. Last weekend, Bill Clinton toured a soup kitchen in Keene, N.H., while last Friday, Mr. Tsongas toured a Boston homeless shelter. But these often have the air of side trips.
Some advocates hope that poverty will return as a campaign issue when the campaigns leave the largely rural early primary states and travel to industrial ones.
"Frankly, it has more to do with the fact that the poor are not a powerful constituency," said Jennifer Vasiloff, the executive director of the Coalition on Human Needs, an antipoverty group based in Washington.
The candidates deny this. Helping the economy will help all income groups, they say. And the poor will reap their share of the benefit.
Mr. Borosage noted that organized labor and some other advocacy groups have already accepted this approach as pragmatic and the best way to win the general election. "A lot of the organized activists are prepared in fact to make that deal," he said. "But poor people aren't prepared to make that deal."

HEADLINE: Salvador Warily Prepares for War's Aftermath

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
AS though the civil war in El Salvador were dying a human death, faces from the whole course of the conflict seemed to flash before Government and rebel leaders as they made their ceremonious peace here last week. A Catholic Church human rights advocate sat at the treaty signing not far from a conservative businessman whose family was reputed to have financed paramilitary death squads. A few feet away, a retired Army colonel who has become one of the country's more garrulous right-wing politicians could look over at one of the guerrilla commanders whom he had once fought.
Across the ideological spectrum, no one save a few bewildered young guerrillas and a few more military officers acted as though there might have been anything they had lost. Dr. Charles Clements, an American physician who spent a year tending to rebel wounded on a strategic Salvadoran volcano, had a pleasant chat with one Salvadoran Army general; Jennifer Jean Casolo, an American religious worker who was once jailed by the Salvadoran security forces on charges of stockpiling weapons for the guerrillas, shook hands with another. The United States Ambassador to El Salvador, William G. Walker, wrapped an arm around Joaquin Villalobos, the guerrilla commander whom American officials had most despised, and talked about having lunch back in San Salvador one day soon. 
 Yet if the breadth of the celebration was startling after so many months of bitter, forced compromise, it also seemed to give way easily to sober considerations of what lay ahead. All of the conciliatory words between the rebel leadership and President Alfredo Cristiani suggested a gathering tolerance on both sides; they did not change any minds about what further reforms El Salvador should undertake or how. Even as the bloodletting was brought to a formal halt after 75,000 deaths, there was a sense among people who had participated or merely suffered in it that a far less violent struggle for political control would not necessarily be much less intense.
Along with the recognition that the war could not be won and had become a severe political liability to whomever was seen to perpetuate it, a confluence of changes helped stop the fighting. As the Bush Administration quietly abandoned the Reagan quest to vanquish a perceived Marxist threat, Congressional Democrats reduced American military aid. With the evaporation of Cuba's allies in Eastern Europe, the Salvadoran rebels began to distance themselves from Cuba's Government. And even before their election defeat in early 1990, Nicaragua's Sandinistas could no longer afford the Salvadorans uncompromising support. But while those shifts helped moderate Salvadoran politics, they did less to alter the economic inequalities and democratic failings that have always been the war's essential fuel.
There is little question that if fully implemented the treaty would bring many changes. Mr. Cristiani has long blamed the outbreak of war primarily on the repression -- much of it sponsored or carried out by his more radical allies -- that virtually shut off the possibility of legal politics to the democratic left. And as he has quietly allowed wider margins of press freedom and political activity, he has agreed to measures that should lift the remaining political restraints and halve the military's size to about 31,000 troops.
Nonetheless, some critics of the Government argued that the treaty would not end extremist violence, particularly from the right, the impunity of the military officer corps, or the corruption that has fed on more than $4 billion in United States aid over the last decade. Nor, as Mr. Villalobos hinted after the treaty was signed, would it necessarily keep the 6,000 or so armed rebels from responding in kind to any violence that might take place between the start of the formal cease-fire on Feb. 1 and the destruction of the insurgents' arms in late October.
The treaty promises land to peasants in rebel-held zones and the possibility of partial ownership for some workers in state enterprises that are to be privatized. It is also certain to give a new thrust to the economy, which has managed surprising growth over the last two years despite the war's enormous strain. By itself, however, the settlement does little to resolve a disparity of incomes that the war has left only more skewed, or to raise real wages that have fallen almost every year since 1980. Though many of El Salvador's rich have grown richer, only 46 of them paid taxes on income of more than $2,500, according to Christian Democratic Party figures.
How effectively or democratically the political party that emerges from the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front will pursue economic and social change can only be guessed. Several rebel officials said their party may not run a presidential candidate in the 1994 elections. Instead, they would back a coalition of leftist and centrist parties they hope will stretch as far as the liberal faction of the divided Christian Democrats.
Some analysts believe that the former guerrillas could become the country's most disciplined and organized political force almost instantly and still not far surpass the low levels of support they have received in opinion surveys.
 
Fragile Changes
 The rebels have always dismissed such polls as distorted by the fears that the war has so ingrained in Salvadorans. But it would not be at all surprising if they found that their most effective tactics were the sort of street demonstrations and civil disobedience that the military and rightists attacked violently a decade ago.
It may be the clearest measure of the fragility of change that both sides seized on the presence of foreign dignitaries at their peace-making to plead for help in verifying the agreements and rebuilding the country. Already, the United Nations is sending more than 1,000 military and police observers to monitor the treaty's implementation. The many pledges of help, however, seemed to add up to far less than the $1.8 billion that Mr. Cristiani said reconstruction would cost.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was among the guests in Mexico City unwilling to commit to any specific levels of aid, and there seemed to be an unusual degree of bipartisanship to his circumspection. "This is not an environment in which anyone in the Administration or Congress is thinking about making money available, because it is needed elsewhere," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs and supports reconstruction aid. "It has unfortunately become something of a national tradition that we are willing to spend billions to win a military conflict but withhold millions that would insure that peace is sustained."

HEADLINE: The World;
What Kind of Economy Would a Palestine Have?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

DATELINE: BEIT SAHUR, Israeli-Occupied West Bank

 BODY:
ISSA ABUAITAH and his 200 employees at the Jordan Plastics Company make mattresses, housewares and industrial containers in this village, a 10-minute drive from Jerusalem. The factory, wedged between stone houses, is no high-tech wonder: machines mixing polyurethane foam and quilting mattress covers get a lot of help from human hands. But Jordan Plastics competes successfully in Israeli markets because its products are well made and its labor costs are low. And just such enterprises, analysts have begun to say, represent the main chance for prosperity in an autonomous or independent Palestine.
The current negotiations over the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are still at only the earliest stage. Last week, announcements that two right-wing parties would leave Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's coalition in outrage that the Israeli leader would even consider autonomy, underscored how tentative the talks are. But if autonomy ever appeared likely, economic factors would soar in importance. Already, experts are looking at the possibilities, and many agree on one principle: The viability of an autonomous Palestinian economy would depend on keeping it open to the world in general, and to Israel in particular. 
 From 1948 to 1967, when Israeli occupation began, the West Bank was a poverty-ridden region of Jordan; Gaza, ruled by Egypt, was a patch of desert crowded with refugees. It is no wonder, says Howard Rosen of the International Institute of Economics in Washington, that two-thirds of the natural increase in population from 1952 to 1967 was offset by emigration.
Since 1967, Israel has spent little to develop the economic potential of Arabs in the territories. But just opening the borders allowed large numbers of Palestinians to commute to jobs in Israel, starting an economic boom that doubled average incomes by 1980. On the eve of the Arab uprising in 1987, one out of three wage earners was a commuter and their earnings constituted one-quarter of West Bank and Gaza income.
Whoever leads any future Palestinian entity will have strong political reasons to back away from the Israeli connection. But Palestinian economists may well have different advice. George Abed, an exile who heads the Welfare Association, a Palestinian development group in Geneva, says the number of workers "would eventually have to decline." But he acknowledges that many commuters' jobs could not soon be replaced. Nor do Palestinian economists think integration with Jordan would work. The West Bank and Jordanian economies are too similar to gain much from trade, says Hishan Awartani, an economist at Al Najah University in Nablus. "Heading east," he says, "is a myth."
However, if some Palestinian economists are reconciled to retaining links with Israel, they are determined to change the terms. The occupation, argues Osama Hamed, who teaches at Temple University in Philadelphia, has generated a "one-sided customs union" in which Israel buys selectively from Palestinians while requiring them to pay full tariffs on imports. In an analysis for the Institute for Social and Economic Policy in the Middle East at Harvard, he estimates that Israel skims one-fifth of West Bank income.
Israeli economists scoff at this figure. But Ezra Sadan, who heads a Government commission on the economic future of the territories, is scathing in his criticism of the way the territories are regulated. His recommendation to Israeli occupation forces would be not to lift a finger "to protect the Israeli market."
 
'Unbelievably Neglected'
 Plans for developing a Palestinian economy that have been drawn up privately by Arabs and Israelis turn out to be remarkably similar. Ephraim Ahiran, a Hebrew University economist, thinks the starting point should be a huge investment in roads, communications, housing and medical care. "The infrastructure," he says, "is unbelievably neglected." He agrees with Mr. Abed that $10 billion to $15 billion over a decade would be appropriate. Professor Ahiran says the money, presumably from gulf Arabs and the West, would create an "aid-led development boom" in which Palestinians could accumulate skills and capital.
Could an autonomous Palestinian economy succeed? The West Bank has little arable land and no natural resources, save the stone quarried to build houses in Israel. Gaza is isolated and overpopulated. And there is always an impulse to try short cuts. "All new states make the same three mistakes," quips Ephraim Kleiman, an economist at Hebrew University. "They inflate, they protect markets, they create bureaucracies. Israel is a prime example."
But the territories' intangible assets include an educated labor force and a natural base for tourism. Perhaps most important, many Palestinians who emigrated to the gulf and North America have proved their mettle in business. Even some in the West Bank are doing well. Dozens of shoe factories undercut Israeli prices. Haddad Ltd., a farm implement maker in Jenin, has used Italian designs to put rival Israeli plow manufacturers out of business. Mr. Abuaitah of Jordan Plastics seethes with impatience for a chance to invest in new product lines and compete in world markets. "The West Bank will be easy to develop," he says. "I'm not afraid."
In addition, Israel might well see a self-interest in making a Palestinian economy work. "For our own security," says Professor Sadan, "we have to keep them well fed." Professor Awartani, a cautious optimist on development, doubts that Israel will have to do much feeding. Some day soon, he says only half-jokingly, "Palestinians and Israelis will be jetting around on the same planes, selling to the same sheiks."

HEADLINE: Balancing Nature's Claims and International Free Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS a filling for sandwiches, tuna long ago gained a hallowed spot among the nation's favorite lunchtime staples.
But as the focus of a dispute between the United States and 30 other nations, the simple tuna sandwich is proving to be a far more complex emblem of an enormously risky change in the world's commerce, the linking of ecological concerns to international trade. 
 Earlier this month, efforts by American environmentalists to protect natural resources through trade restrictions were advanced considerably when a Federal District judge in San Francisco ruled that the Government must ban more than half the imports of yellowfin tuna to protect dolphins. Business leaders, though, called the decision a dangerous precedent that could prompt Mexico and the 29 other nations affected to counter with restrictions on American exports, or increase tensions in efforts by Mexico and the Bush Administration to reach a free trade agreement.
At a time when exports of American products are, arguably, the strongest sector of the United States economy, business leaders are concerned about either potential outcome. The Commerce Department reported last week that exports in November totaled $37.5 billion, a record, and the monthly trade deficit was $3.57 billion, the lowest in nine years.
"The dolphin issue has really brought things to a boil," said Abraham Katz, president of the United States Council for International Business, an affiliate of the International Chamber of Commerce that is based in New York. "American environmentalists are not only attacking Mexico, but the whole system of world trade to support their concept of sustainable economic development. It could easily prompt a backlash."
 
Trade vs. Commerce
 Before the fight over tuna, the world had used separate forums in its attempts to solve environmental and trade disputes. Businessmen turned to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 44-year-old treaty administered by an international agency in Geneva that has served to regulate world trade. Environmentalists established a tradition of acting on ecological problems with national laws and international treaties. The dispute over tuna illustrates what can happen when trade rules under GATT collide with ecological protections.
Because dolphins swim over schools of yellowfin tuna in the Pacific, thousands drown yearly in fishermen's nets. The Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed by Congress in 1972 to limit the slaughter in the American fleet to 20,500 dolphins a year and in 1988 a new amendment directed the Department of Commerce to ban imports of tuna from foreign fleets, including from Mexico, that had higher levels of dolphin kills.
In 1990, when the Department of Commerce finally barred imports from Mexico and four other countries, Mexico filed its own complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In October, a three-member GATT panel decided in Mexico's favor because, it said, dolphins were killed in foreign and international waters and the United States had no authority to extend its environmental laws to a sovereign nation.
On Jan. 9, Thelton E. Henderson, chief judge of the Federal District Court in San Francisco, ignored the GATT panel ruling and raised the prospect of greater tension when he decided that the Government must bar roughly half of the 266,000 metric tons of tuna imported in the United States. Judge Henderson determined that Mexico, Venezuela and Vanuatu, a group of islands in the southwest Pacific, were shipping outlawed tuna to the United States through 27 other countries in violation of United States law.
Such clashes are certain to increase as conservation groups become more aggressive and declining economic conditions in many regions of the world compel nations to step up their use of natural resources. In fact, economic desperation is beginning to erode some of the historic international environmental agreements.
Last month, Iceland announced it was withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission in June, a move clearly intended to enable Iceland's fishermen to resume commercial whaling. South Africa and several other southern African nations are pressing to change provisions in the 1973 treaty to protect endangered species in order to begin killing the region's last African elephants for ivory.
Alarmed that more nations may be prepared to roll back hard-fought gains on the environment, conservation groups now are looking to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a means for reducing ecological damage by rewriting its provisions. The United States and other governments agree that the GATT needs to examine the relationship between trade and environmental protection. But they also insist that the issue be excluded from negotiations on international trade, currently at a difficult stage.
Both sides are clearly aware that the idea of joining ecological ideals with trade is fraught with hazards. Economists have found that rising prosperity tends to reduce pollution by providing the means for paying for controls. Others worry that the cost of complying with the environmental standards of industrialized countries could lead to greater impoverishment and pollution in underdeveloped nations like Mexico.
"The one way out of this dilemma between free trade and the environment is to set uniformly high standards," said Hilary French, a senior researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group in Washington.
The 12 nations of the European Community are considering levying a tax on carbon dioxide and other byproducts of burning coal and oil to control gases believed by some scientists to cause global warming. But such a measure could make some European industries uncompetitive unless other nations followed. "In the world of trade, we're no longer the biggest player," said Mr. Katz of the United States Council for International Business. "It goes both ways now. Any of the environmental goals we press on other countries, there are some out there that can do the same thing to us."

Learning to Be Vicious Can Begin at Home

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
AFTER 10 days of almost daily reports of racially motivated attacks on children throughout the city by other young people, Mayor David N. Dinkins had nearly exhausted his supply of adjectives to describe the disgust and anger he felt.
Finally on Wednesday, on the occasion of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, the Mayor asked an audience at the Waldorf-Astoria, "Who taught our children to hate so thoroughly and so mercilessly?" 
 It is a question many New Yorkers are asking as the incidents continue. These almost surreal acts of violence and humiliation are a reminder of what child-education experts, civil libertarians and the clergy have been saying for years: that society has been failing in its duty to teach children not to hate.
Mr. Dinkins told the N.A.A.C.P. at the Waldorf Astoria that he found the crimes reprehensible. "But I cannot find it in my heart to blame children alone for these deeds," he said, adding that he was issuing a "loud wake-up call to the adults of our city."
"The problem of violence is best addressed not in the Mayor's office but in your office," he said. "Not in the Blue Room but in your children's room. Not in City Hall but in city schools and city streets."
The call comes none too soon, said Michael Meyers, who directs the New York Civil Rights Coalition. "It's becoming fashionable to hate," he said. "And since you're not going to be punished for being violent, it's become pedestrian, and commonplace and acceptable."
The current series of incidents began Jan. 6 when two black children, a 14-year-old boy and his sister, 12, were set upon by four whites as they walked to school. They robbed them, cut off some of the girl's hair and then smeared them with sneaker polish.
While the two children were not badly hurt physically, the ugly episode tore at their psyches. The boy said he felt he could no longer trust white people. His mother, Nellie Wilson, her heart breaking as her own anger welled up, tried to talk him out of rash judgments.
"If they hadn't put paint on them, I could have taken it. I would have been angry, but not like this," Mrs. Wilson said. "But the painting, the cutting the girl's hair and the racial slurs, that's the part that bothers me.
"This world is so vast, so big, big, big," she said, close to tears herself. "Why can't we get along?"
Several experts say the incidents also reflect a recession-fed tension in the increasingly multicultural society in overcrowded cities.
Most hate crimes, said Jack McDevitt, a sociologist at Northeastern University in Boston, are about turf. In an analysis of 452 bias crimes in the Boston area in the 1980's, he found that most involved someone walking, driving through or working in a neighborhood, or a family moving in. Almost a third of the perpetrators were white men under 30 years old.
"Sometimes these are people who are going through difficulties of their own," he said. "They might see violence in their own homes. If their father hits their mother, they have to think, well, my father loves my mother. So it becomes easier to beat up on someone who is black that they don't care for at all.
"In some ways, some of them may be looking for tacit approval at home," he continued. "They hear their parents say, 'The blacks are getting this, the blacks are taking this away from us,' so in some strange way they think they're doing what their parents want."
 
'Your Victim Is Down'
 Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, a psychiatrist at Harvard University Medical School who writes about racial conflict, agreed that economic hard times worsen things.
"Sometimes they're just looking for ways to let out their feelings of frustration and anger," he said. "Their momentary feelings of power they feel at the time when they attack each other. It's frequently a power trip -- your victim is down, at least at those moments."
Almost everyone agrees that children learn to hate from those around them. Stereotypes can be reinforced every day, whether by television programs that show minority characters in a negative light or by a teacher who regularly chooses not to call on certain children.
David Addams, who directs the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys and teaches a high school course called Civil Rights and Race Relations, said school integration has brought children of different races together so they can at least begin understanding each other. But he said that housing and jobs continue to separate them.
"When you go home at the end of the school day to a segregated community," he said, "and your parents have spent all day in a job market that may not be totally integrated -- like Wall Street, which is still mostly white, or a construction site which might be all people of color -- you may get messages that defeat all that you learned in school."
Abbie Cuellar was disillusioned at the end of her first year of teaching the civil rights and racial relations class at Park East High School in Manhattan. Most of her students were black and Puerto Rican, and many seldom met white people, except at stores or when job-hunting.
"They had an 'us against them' feeling," she said. "At first I thought, 'We're not doing anything here.' But at the end of the year, three kids gave speeches about how they learned through the class that they have to look at people as individuals."
The recent incidents have been hateful and poignant in their ability to hurt. But there is also some hope. More schools are adding courses on racism. And children themselves can demonstrate that once they understand the pain of someone's suffering, they will reach out to the wounded child.
At the Bowman School in Lexington, Mass., an entire class of fifth graders studying the Bill of Rights wrote letters to Nellie Wilson's children.
One of them, in round, neatly pencilled letters, read:
"Before I tell you how I feel I want to tell you that I wanted to write this letter and that no-one made me.
"I was shocked when I heard what happened to you. I don't see why anyone would or should hurt anyone just because of a different skin color. Even though I am white I am still mad. Why would anyone do this?
"Please don't lose faith! Casey Cross."

HEADLINE: SAUDIS PRESS U.S. FOR HELP IN OUSTER OF IRQA'S LEADER

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia is pressing the Bush Administration to organize a large covert action campaign in Iraq aimed at dividing Iraq's army and toppling Saddam Hussein, United States and allied officials say.
The Saudi initiative seeks an allied effort to supply arms and intelligence to Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, Shiite Muslim fighters in the south and Sunni Muslim opposition forces in central Iraq. The aim is to draw out and divide Mr. Hussein's last Republican Guard divisions protecting his strongholds around Baghdad and subject them to allied air assaults. 
 Saudi advocacy for a new and more aggressive campaign comes as the Bush Administration is considering new steps to support Iraqi rebel forces with allied military power and to exploit growing tensions in the Iraqi leadership in a manner that would hasten Mr. Hussein's downfall while leaving the formation of a successor government clearly in Iraqi hands.
 
Political Issue for Bush
 The White House remains deeply concerned that the Iraqi leader is still in power at the outset of a Presidential election year in which his survival has become a political issue. The ouster of Mr. Hussein before November's election would remove the shadow that the Iraqi leader casts over Mr. Bush's campaign and eliminate the possibility that Mr. Hussein could do harm to Mr. Bush's re-election effort through provocative statements emanating from Baghdad.
American and allied officials discussed those plans with a reporter because some believe that the disclosure will by itself instill confidence in Iraqi opposition forces, while others, who oppose some of the proposals, hoped that public knowledge would provoke a cautionary public or congressional response.
 
Fomenting a Coup
 Substantial military forces from the United States, Britain, France and Saudi Arabia remain in the Persian Gulf area. American military leaders, including Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have cautioned that any effort to dislodge Mr. Hussein from Baghdad would require a major new deployment, including ground combat forces, to the region, a prospect that would increase the political risks for President Bush in an election year.
It could not be learned whether Britain and France have been consulted about the new planning. But senior American and Saudi officials have discussed military and covert action options over the last 10 days.
The American planning effort focusing on taking more active measures to foment a coup represents a realization within the Bush Administration that stronger measures might be possible in coming months to take advantage of what Administration officials perceive as a weakening of support for Mr. Hussein brought about in part by sanctions that are strangling the Iraqi economy.
In the initial postwar period, the Administration relied principally on sanctions to weaken the Iraqi leader. But by last fall, Mr. Hussein's grip on power seemed to be strengthening and he appeared to be exploiting the humanitarian crisis in Iraq to break the international coalition against him.
Then, when intelligence reporting indicated a fracturing of unity in Mr. Hussein's inner circle, the White House began preparing for more aggressive steps to seize opportunities that might arise to topple Mr. Hussein, like a coup plot by military commanders.
In addition to the Saudi option of secretly arming guerrilla forces, a senior Bush Administration official said in an interview this week that the Administration has considered coordinating its efforts with Kurdish and Shiite forces inside Iraq to foment a coup for which Iraqi military commanders would seek allied support.
That Saudi-backed option would require a major allied air campaign over Iraq and possibly the reintroduction of American ground troops in the region. military officials said.
With Mr. Hussein's air force grounded since the end of the war, the use of air power to destroy Mr. Hussein's remaining tank divisions and helicopter fleet would be the key to his final defeat in the view of a number of military officials.
 
So Far, No Decision
 United States and allied officials interviewed over the last several weeks indicated that no decisions had been made and that no final package of options had been presented to President Bush. The anti-Saddam Hussein planning still is being coordinated by the so-called Deputies Committee, which includes senior officials from the Pentagon, the State Department, the C.I.A. and the National Security Council.
The senior official who discussed the possibility of aiding a coup attempt said that Kurdish guerrillas in the north and Shiite Muslim resistance forces in the south "can be a dimension of an approach" to attack Mr. Hussein's power base.
But he said the key to a successful overthrow of the Iraqi leader remained the defeat or neutralization of the five of seven Republican Guard divisions that are stationed in the greater Baghdad area to protect the Iraqi leader.
The official said that there must be a broad-based, national character to a successful opposition to Mr. Hussein, including participation by Kurds, Shiites and the minority Sunni Muslims of central Iraq who have long been the leadership class in the country.
 
Arms-Supply Network
 "Sooner or later, I am convinced that the people Saddam depends on will turn on him as a dead end," the official said.
President Bush, in his statement Thursday on the anniversary of the beginning of the war that reversed Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, praised "the efforts of thousands of brave Iraqis who are resisting Saddam's rule."
The senior official said the statement was part of a concerted American campaign to nurture and develop an Iraqi resistance that could figure into plans for the final demise of Mr. Hussein.
Among the covert action options that Saudi Arabia is promoting is the formation of arms-supply and guerrilla-warfare networks organized by allied intelligence services that could challenge poorly trained Iraqi Army units garrisoned in most of the rural areas of northern and southern Iraq.
 
Allied Air Power
 Saudi officials and Iraqi opposition leaders say that many Iraqi regulars would desert or defect in large numbers once they were challenged.
If guerrilla forces seized Iraqi territories, Mr. Hussein would be forced to either cede control of those areas to the resistance or send his best Republican Guard units out from Baghdad to crush the rebellion.
At that point, the rebels would be protected by allied air power, in the view of Saudi officials and some Iraqi opposition leaders.
The key to supporting such guerrilla operations would be to prevent Mr. Hussein's Republican Guard units from employing their attack helicopters and their three heavily armored divisions against a dedicated assault from allied-backed resistance groups.
"There has to be a combination of a major covert operation and a major air operation and then leave the rest to the Iraqi people," said a senior allied official who has been discussing strategy with Bush Administration aides involved in the planning.
 
Saudi Equipment Pledged
 Kurdish guerrillas already control much of northern Iraq. But the Kurdish leadership is divided over whether to launch a direct challenge to Mr. Hussein. Shiite resistance in the south is much less organized and not well understood by allied officials, but Shiite opposition leaders say they can step up their guerrilla activities if they have arms and support from Saudi Arabia and the United States.
Saudi Arabia is willing to equip Iraqi resistance forces with missiles that would be able to shoot down Iraqi helicopters and destroy armored vehicles, a senior allied official said.
In November, the Deputies Committee asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop military plans for an American response to any request for assistance from Iraqi military commanders plotting against Mr. Hussein.The White House request to the Joint Chiefs coincided with a letter Mr. Bush sent to Saudi Arabia's King Fahd pledging Mr. Bush's determination to achieve the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and to continue providing adequate military forces in the region to do that.
The letter, carried to the Saudi king by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, also was intended to smooth American-Saudi relations after a long summer of haggling over whether the Saudis would accept the storage of a large stockpile of American military equipment and ammunition as part of a new security arrangement in the Persian Gulf region. The storage issue has yet to be resolved.
The new round of American planning also was motivated by intelligence reports indicating growing disaffection with Mr. Hussein among Iraq's traditional ruling families and clans. At least one bloody rivalry had surfaced between Mr. Hussein's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal Hassan, and another close relative, Ali Hassan Majid, who presided over occupied Kuwait as Mr. Hussein's personal representative. Both relatives have held a series of key posts in Mr. Hussein's Government over the last decade.
In November, the Iraqi leader replaced Mr. Hassan as Defense Minister with Mr. Majid, setting off a gun battle between the security forces of the rival relatives, according to what was described by one official as a reliable "human intelligence" report received by the Central Intelligence Agency.
A Deputies Committee meeting on Dec. 12 examined the limitations in using United States military forces in supporting an indigenous challenge to Mr. Hussein's authority, and that review focused in part on the strong cautionary recommendation from General Powell that the success of any new United States military intervention in Iraq could not be assured without a large and combined effort by United States air and ground combat forces.
 
Powell's Diminished Role
 One official, describing the White House reaction to General Powell's report, said it was deemed the "wrong answer" because of its insistance that major ground combat forces would have to be committed. As a consequence, a subcommittee of the deputies has been meeting under National Security Council supervision since mid-December to consider and refine military and covert action options for Iraq, officials said.
General Powell's contribution to the continued policy discussion appears to have been diminished since the planning meetings have been pulled into the White House. But a one-star general from the Joint Chiefs of Staff attends each meeting, an Administration official said.
Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, has argued that the use of American air power to support rebel Iraqi military units could have the decisive effect of breaking the back of Mr. Hussein's core security force in Baghdad, an allied official said.
Saudi officials are said to have argued that ground combat forces are not needed to bring down Mr. Hussein if an effective guerrilla force can be armed and supported with allied air strikes against Iraq's top military units.
 
Chemical-Arms Training
 To some officials in the Administration, the risks of such a major operation outweigh the benefits. If United States military forces got bogged down in an Iraqi civil war, it would seriously tarnish the image the military achieved in the Persian Gulf war.
There are other unknowns. A senior American analyst said last week that Mr. Hussein's military forces continue to train on equipment that is associated with chemical warfare, indicating that a final showdown with Mr. Hussein might include the use of chemical weapons.
Yet some officials say Mr. Hussein is near the end of his tether and that his rule could shatter under greater pressure.
The Central Intelligence Agency, which had predicted that Mr. Hussein would not complete 1991 in office, today declines to estimate how long he can survive.
 
Effects of U.N. Sanctions
 There are several reasons for presuming he cannot survive indefinitely.
Iraq has been denied virtally all of its national income by United Nations sanctions for more than 18 months and continues to refuse to sell limited quantities of crude under United Nations supervision.
Iraqi Government expenditures indicate that its reserves are no longer adequate to supply more than essentials, like food and medicine, to military forces and key leadership groups. The rest of the country gets subsistance rations.
Though the Sunni Muslim core of the Iraqi leadership rallied to Mr. Hussein in March when minority Kurds and southern Shiites launched twin uprisings, that support is now fraying, senior American analysts say, as Mr. Hussein has reneged on pledges to undertake democratic reforms, purged possible rivals from his Cabinet and shown indifference to the human suffering of millions of Iraqis.

HEADLINE: HOSPITALS MAY GET ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON MEDICARE BILLS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
In an effort to discourage unnecessary health services and control costs, the Bush Administration plans to require hospitals to play a central role in arranging and billing for Medicare services, even when the services are performed outside a hospital.
A confidential memorandum summarizing new rules to be issued soon by the Government has been circulated at the Department of Health and Human Services. It says the rules will require hospitals to "assume financial responsibility" for many of the medical goods and services that elderly people receive as outpatients after leaving the hospital. The new requirement applies to laboratory work, X-rays, CAT scans, magnetic resonance imaging, scores of tests and the rental and purchase of medical equipment like wheelchairs. 
 Federal health officials say that changes requiring hospitals to "bundle" medical services into one bill will result in better-coordinated care for the elderly at lower cost. But for the 34 million Medicare beneficiaries, the new rules could mean less freedom in choosing where to go for outpatient services as hospitals direct them to particular clinics.
 
Alarm at Hospitals
 Hospital executives express alarm at the change, viewing it as a costly new administrative burden imposed by the Government.
The new rules reflect the policy of the Administration, supported by Congress, to bundle Medicare services together and pay for them as a package whenever possible. Medicare officials say that will help control health costs because hospitals will negotiate discounts in return for agreeing to send their patients to particular suppliers and clinics. Hospital officials say they are worried that such arrangements could be deemed anti-competitive or seen as kickbacks.
Federal health officials say the policy change can be made by regulation without any new laws. They have already revised the Medicare manual for hospitals to reflect the new policy.
In a speech this week to the American Nurses Association, Gail R. Wilensky, head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, explained her philosophy this way: "I want to bundle services and move away from a la carte fee-for-service medicine." She said the current system, which pays doctors and clinics separately for each additional service, gave them economic incentives to provide unneeded care.
In an interview, Dr. Wilensky said the final rules, to be issued this spring, could help beneficiaries by reducing the amounts they pay for outpatient services. The rules say beneficiaries "will not be billed as often for charges in excess" of the amounts recognized as reasonable by Medicare.
Outside suppliers that now bill patients or the Medicare program would bill the hospital. Under the rules, if a supplier improperly bills Medicare or if a hospital employee refers patients to a clinic that has no arrangement with the hospital, the Government may impose a fine of as much as $2,000 on the supplier or the hospital.
The new rules were prepared by Dr. Wilensky and Richard P. Kusserow, inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services. The inspector general would impose the penalties.
In a memorandum summarizing the rules, Dr. Wilensky and Mr. Kusserow said, "Hospitals would be required to assume financial liability for all items and services furnished by an outside entity to their outpatients, and the practice of 'unbundling' these services would be prohibited."
In theory, patients would retain the freedom to choose clinics and suppliers of outpatient services, but in practice hospitals would direct them to certain clinics with which the hospitals have made arrangements.
 
Worries About Antitrust Laws
 Hospital officials say that if they comply with the new rules, they will run the risk of violating antitrust laws because they will have to channel patients to certain suppliers. The United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, ruled in December 1990 that a hospital committed illegal "anticompetitive acts" by referring patients to an equipment supplier in which the hospital had invested.
Hospital executives and doctors also fear they may be accused of violating Medicare's antikickback statute. Under the Medicare law, it is a crime to solicit or accept remuneration in return for referring Medicare patients to a health-care provider or ordering products from a particular company.
Almost every hospital refers some patients elsewhere for specialized services. If, for example, an elderly person falls, bruises his head and then has blurred vision, he may go to the emergency room of a local hospital. After examining the patient, the emergency room doctor may send him to aradiologist to have a CAT scan to see whether there is any accumulation of blood or other fluid under the skull.
At present, the radiologist typically bills Medicare for the procedure. Under the new rules, the radiologist would send his bill to the hospital, and the hospital would file the claim with Medicare for payment under a fee schedule. If the Medicare reimbursement was significantly lower than the bill, the hospital could be forced to absorb the difference.
 
Acknowledging Losses
 In a preamble to the new rules, the Government acknowledges that "hospitals may not be able to fully recoup increased costs they incur as a result of bundling outpatient services." But for most hospitals, it says, the increase in costs should not be significant.
Joanne M. Judge, president of the Community Hospital of Lancaster, Pa., voiced the concern of many hospital officials and doctors. "I don't think Medicare will save any money at all," she said. "There will simply be a new layer of billing added to the process."
Martin A. Corry, director of Federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, which represents millions of Medicare beneficiaries, said the new rules could help patients by reducing the confusion of multiple billing. But he also expressed concern that if a hospital consistently steered patients to a few suppliers, it could reduce competition in the health-care market and result in higher prices.
Trade associations representing nearly all of the nation's 5,500 hospitals object to the new rules. Among the groups objecting are The American Hospital Association, the Catholic Health Association, the National Association of Public Hospitals and the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,400 hospitals owned by investors.
In a letter to Dr. Wilensky, they said the new rules "would make hospitals financially liable for services they do not provide and for costs they cannot control." The decision about where to send patients is made by doctors, not by hospital administrators, and hospitals have no control over where patients go after they are discharged, the letter said.
The Government rejects that argument. It says that hospitals have "the degree of control needed" because they can insist that doctors wanting hospital privileges comply with policies on the referral of patients.

HEADLINE: Mexicans Come to Work, but Find Dead Ends

SERIES: Without a Ladder: The Mexican Immigrants/First of two articles.

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Bordered by factories and docks, the Magnolia Park neighborhood has long been a beacon for generations of Mexican immigrants seeking sturdy homes and steady wages. Over time, most found jobs, assimilated and moved on to a better life.
But that is much less the case nowadays. The neighborhood is as much a place to stay poor as it is to start poor. Upward mobility among the 14 million people of Mexican descent in the United States -- the nation's fastest-growing major ethnic group -- is faltering, and on Magnolia Park's shady streets the signs of trouble are everywhere: high-school dropouts, teen-age mothers, families doubled and tripled up in bungalows, and day-laborers who gather at street corners hoping to sell their services. 
 Raul Jimenez, a 62-year-old machinist, remembers better days in Magnolia, as the neighborhood is commonly known. "I arrived on Saturday, rested on Sunday and found a machinist's job on Monday," he said. "That was 1956, and Magnolia was a place where people could work hard for good money."
 
A Bleaker Job Market
 The neighborhood's troubles started with the oil bust of the early 1980's and continued as the nation's labor market underwent vast changes, shifting more and more from a blue-collar, manufacturing base to high-technology and service industries. With the loss of those jobs went the traditional steppingstones that Mexican immigrants had long used to get ahead. Now, the immigrant networks that once helped new arrivals like Mr. Jimenez find factory work mostly lead nowhere.
Immigrants still receive lots of help from relatives and friends in finding work, but they usually end up in dead-end, low-paying service jobs -- cleaning offices, mowing lawns, baby-sitting or sewing. Because wages in Mexico are even worse, rapid growth in this sector of the economy keeps drawing people across the Rio Grande, both legally and illegally. And the ready availability of such jobs is enticing teen-agers to drop out of school, often to help support their families.
Hugo del Moral came to Magnolia five years ago. He had several years more education than Mr. Jimenez and substantially more work experience as a machinist. But working mostly at odd jobs, the closest he has come to a factory floor is the one he has swept as a janitor.
"It's been hard to keep our dignity sometimes, but we still have our hopes," said his wife, Maria.
 
Economy Down, Population Up
 The story is much the same in other big cities where people of Mexican descent are concentrated, in neighborhoods like East Los Angeles and the Pilsen area of Chicago. While the upheaval in the labor market hurt urban working-class neighborhoods of all ethnic or racial groups in the 1980's, because it occurred just as the Mexican-American population was exploding, the neighborhoods where they live suffered particularly.
During the 1980's the number of people of Mexican origin in this country grew at five times the rate of the national average. Nationwide, this group accounts for about two-thirds of the entire Hispanic population.
The surge in growth was mainly fueled by two factors. The first was a wave of immigration from Mexico that numbered at least 4 million in the decade when estimates of illegal aliens are included -- the largest such influx by any national group in American history and about 45 percent of the total of 9 million people who immigrated to the United States in the 1980's.
The second factor was a high birth rate. In Mexican neighborhoods like Magnolia, at least one out of every three residents is under the age of 16.
These numbers alone insure that the nation will have to be increasingly concerned with the future of people in places like Magnolia. At issue is whether America can still assimilate poor and unskilled immigrants and make them a source of economic vitality.
 
Neighborhood Declines
Immigrants Find Downward Mobility
 Most Mexican communities have so far avoided the tailspin that carried many black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods into a seemingly permanent state of economic despair. But locked in their own peculiar dynamic, the Mexican neighborhoods, too, have begun to fall.
If current trends continue, at the turn of the century young people of Mexican descent will be second only to young whites as the largest source of new entrants into the labor force. But some experts are pessimistic about the prospects for these young Mexican-Americans, fearing that many will be high school dropouts and young unwed mothers at a time when the country will need highly skilled workers to compete globally.
It was a different world when Mr. Jimenez, the machinist, came to Magnolia in the 1950's. Post-war industry was booming and factory jobs required little education. "I always found work," Mr. Jimenez said, his large gnarled fingers stained black by lubricating oil. "If I changed jobs, it was because I went for something better."
Although Mr. Jimenez and his wife have learned only a little English, their four children finished high school and three went to college. Such generational advances have not been unusual among Mexican immigrant families that arrived before 1982. Historically, the first-generation immigrant has begun the process of becoming an American and the second has completed it, making notable economic gains.
But leaders in many Mexican-American communities now worry that this pattern has been broken.
 
'Eyes No Longer Sparkle'
 "I can tell by looking in their eyes how long they've been here," said the Rev. Virgil Elizondo, rector of San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio. "They come sparkling with hope, and the first generation finds that hope rewarded." But he added: "Their children's eyes no longer sparkle. They have learned only to want jobs and money they can't have, and thus to be frustrated."
In many ways Magnolia, Houston's oldest Mexican neighborhood, is a profile in miniature of America's large and scattered population of Mexican descent.
Starting in 1916, refugees from the Mexican Revolution settled in Magnolia, a swampy area named for its big-blossomed trees, and helped build the Houston Ship Channel that borders it. Except during the Depression, it offered a stable home for those content with their industrial jobs and served as a stepping stone for immigrants with higher aspirations.
"Magnolia was the heart of all the colonias," said Mr. Jimenez, speaking in Spanish and using an old term for Mexican immigrant neighborhoods.
Magnolia still acts as a springboard for some. Austin High School, which serves the neighborhood, has an enrollment that is 94 percent Hispanic, and last year 68 percent of the graduating seniors went on to college. But only 400 seniors made it to graduation out of a class that began with 1,500 freshmen.
Across the country, dropout rates of 60 percent or more are common in schools with large numbers of Hispanic students. Many of the dropouts are teen-age parents. Every year in Magnolia out of a population of about 20,000, nearly 90 percent of whom are of Mexican descent there are about 400 new teen-age mothers.
 
The Signs Are Everywhere
 Signs of economic decay and diminished opportunities are everywhere. In the middle of a residential area sits an equipment yard for a once-thriving manufacturing plant. But now it is nothing more than rusting piles of metal and chest-high weeds. Nearby, the huge doors of a warehouse are open, revealing an abandoned interior.
Yet a certain degree of economic vitality is also visible. On the commercial streets are a new Taco Bell and several other fast-food restaurants as well as a new shopping center serving the low end of the retail market. They now coexist with dozens of old cantinas, small dark places where men drink beer with salt and have been known to draw pistols, and yerberias, crowded shops that sell herbal teas, statues of saints and sticks from ebony and mesquite trees -- accoutrements favored by spiritualist cults.
"There has been a two-part restructuring of the work force in Magnolia," said, Nestor P. Rodriguez, a sociologist at the University of Houston. "The old, industrial jobs disappeared, which caused many people to change work or retire or move cities. And at the same time low-wage service sector jobs boomed. The net effect is that you still have a lot of economic activity, but it is at the bottom of the ladder."
Despite the prohibition on hiring illegal aliens in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, several recent studies have shown that people continue to enter the country surreptitiously and readily find service-sector jobs by using false documents. Many of the low-wage jobs are also filled by former illegal alines who are among the 1.9 million Mexicans granted amnesty under the 1986 law.
"They may not earn much individually, but there are enough immigrants with two or three jobs to a household that they are keeping the neighborhood alive," said Mr. Rodriguez
 
Economy Changes
Different Workers In a Different World
 Magnolia's troubles can be traced to the Texas oil bust of 1982 to 1987, when plunging oil prices set in motion an economic collapse in Houston, the center of the industry, that some economists have compared in severity to the Great Depression. The empty office buildings and abandoned, half-built housing subdivisions appeared all the more jolting because the oil bust followed boom years that had made Houston among the most properous and fastest-growing cities in the country.
The changes in the local labor market brought on by the bust and the city's subsequent recovery are a stark version of what is happening more gradually nationwide. The number of jobs in manufacturing in Houston dropped from 163,200 in 1981 to a low of 74,000 in 1987. Since then the number of manufacturing jobs has risen to 176,400, but many are now in high-technology fields requiring skills that few immigrants have. Across the country the number of manufacturing jobs dropped by nearly 6 percent during the 1980's while the number of jobs in the service sector grew by more than 27 percent.
Roger Waldinger, a professor of sociology at the University of California-Los Angeles, found in a study that nearly 36 percent of the native born Hispanic workforce was employed in construction or manufacturing in Houston in 1980 but that by 1987 the number had dropped to 14 percent. Meanwhile, the proportion of Hispanic residents working in the service sector climbed to about 50 percent.
This tidal shift in employment helped bring a sudden end to a long period of upward mobility.
Gregory DeFreitas, an economist at Hofstra University on Long Island, said income for workers of Mexican origin across the nation rose from the 1950's through the 1970's. They were concentrated in areas experiencing robust growth, especially Texas, the Southwest and California. Meanwhile, blacks and Puerto Ricans increasingly suffered from the decline of manufacturing in the Midwest and the Northeast. In the 1970's family income for people of Mexican origin rose by 7 percent, compared with about 3 percent for whites and blacks.
But in the 1980's a national recession, the restructuring of the labor market and competition from new immigrants all took their toll. Mr. DeFreitas found that real family income for people of Mexican origin fell by more than 13 percent between 1979 and 1987. During that time, the earnings of whites remained comparably flat and those of blacks fell by almost 7 percent.
To make matters worse, having never recovered from the last recession, neighborhoods like Magnolia are now enduring another one, and some of the economic losses look permanent.
 
Numbers Rise
Old Job Networks Lead to Nowhere
 The oil bust also dealt a potentially long-lasting setback to the network built up over decades in Houston's Mexican neighborhoods that had helped thousands of people find work.
Such a network is typical of all immigrant communities, and access to it can determine an immigrant's success. But with manufacturing jobs scarce, the network in Magnolia is now leading mainly to dead ends.
"We came because my sister was here and we had friends here who told us that they would help us find work in the port, in the factories, with the oil companies," said Maria del Moral. Indeed, she and her husband, Hugo, a janitor, received plenty of help, but they were led to menial jobs.
Even when networks still connect to good jobs, they cannot serve their purpose if the job seekers are unqualified. The Flores Motors Company, for example, an auto-repair shop in Magnolia, has long been a stepping stone for a number of employees who went on to open busineses of their own. But these days the company's president, Roy Flores, is frustrated.
"I still have good jobs that'll feed a family," he said, "but I'm going to have to open my own school soon if I want to fill them. The Mexican people coming up these days just know old-fashioned technology, and the kids coming out of school here don't know any. Men will come in here who have been working in a body shop in Mexico and they won't have any idea what we're doing."
Although the good jobs that once propelled the upward mobility of Houston's Mexican-Americans are ever harder to find, the city continues to draw large numbers of immigrants in search of work, many of them crossing the border illegally and many now coming from Central America. Census figures show a 72 percent increase in the Hispanic population of the Houston area during the 1980's.
Driven by political turmoil or the kind of economic crisis that saw real per capita income in Mexico drop by more than half since 1982, the new arrivals readily accept low-paying service jobs that do not offer the wages, benefits, security or chances for advancement of the old manufacturing jobs.
Ana H., who spoke only on the condition that her full name not be used because she lives here illegally, said she had been able to get started in Magnolia because so many minimum-wage jobs were available.
For a time she lived in a small two-bedroom apartment that was home for as many as six adults, all working cleaning offices, washing dishes and doing other menial jobs. Now Ana has a job as a maid, has married a gardener and, she said, has no regrets about her move to America. "I didn't expect it to be easy here," she said. "But it is better than what I had."

HEADLINE: 1992 Campaign: Political Memo;
Using Ads to Cast Star of White House Series

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 18

 BODY:
Thanks to the Presidential advertising campaigns that began this week, television viewers here have been learning day and night about some tough yet compassionate men who can swim the butterfly, shake hands with construction workers, defend a hockey net and still find time to personally provide health care and a job to everyone in America, including the middle class.
Faced with such frequent messages from such caring individuals, many citizens here have done their best to forget the entire experience. It is still easy to find serious television viewers who cannot recall the name of a single Democratic candidate. Some people even claim they have not seen any of the advertisements. 
 But some of the state's voters are trying to sort out the advertisements. They realize that all the promises sound the same, and they do not expect the promises to be kept anyway, but they still hope the commercials will guide them in making a crucial decision for the Presidential primary on Feb. 18: Which of these guys would be the least painful to watch on television for four years?
"You might as well get someone who can give decent lip service on the tube," explained 24-year-old Brooks Fraser, an especially experienced viewer due to his job selling televisions at the Cookin' electronics store in Manchester.
This week's advertising has already inclined Mr. Fraser toward one candidate. Recently unemployed for six months, Mr. Fraser is as worried as anyone about the economy, but his choice is not based on economic policies. He could not immediately name the details of his candidate's economic program. In fact, he could not immediately name the candidate.
"He's the one with gray hair, says he has a comprehensive program -- what's his name?" Mr. Fraser said. "There's a phone number -- and he sits on a desk, maybe?" Mr. Fraser thought about it for a minute, gave up, and let another salesman at the store match the spot with the name: Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
"Yeah, he's the one, Clinton," Mr. Fraser said. "He looked like he'd be comfortable giving you what you want to hear."
That may not be the sort of deliberation that the Founding Fathers had in mind for choosing the President, but there are worse criteria. With candidates so well-trained to avoid the specific or the unpopular, voters can't be sure what Presidential policies they will have to suffer through, but they know they'll have to endure the President's talking head every night on television.
Mr. Clinton is doing well in the air war, partly because his advertisements have been on so often, but also because he seems more calmly authoritative than most television news announcers, both in his advertisements that run during newscasts and in his appearances on the programs.
On the Friday evening newscast here he was not even ruffled by newspaper reports on accusations that he had had extramarital affairs, accusations made by an Arkansas employee who was dismissed in 1988. The videotape showed the Governor hounded by reporters but serene as ever, smiling and patiently explaining that these were old and long-since discredited accusations.
Then he appeared live on the WMUR-TV newscast and was asked a question that many politicians would consider unfair: "Have you ever had an extramarital affair, Governor?" Mr. Clinton showed no indignation or unease. "Well," he replied with a Reaganesque chuckle, "if I had, I wouldn't tell you."
Mr. Clinton's advertisements flash newspaper headlines and show him with construction workers, but they mostly consist of him in an office talking directly to the camera. He makes general promises about the middle class and urges viewers to call for a copy of his plan.
The other candidates' advertisements seem more elaborately produced, which is always a risk. It invites comparisons with other commercials, and politicians can rarely match those happy actors selling beer and detergent.
The advertisements for Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska show him on a hockey rink, where he talks about trade. "Others guard their goal to keep our products out while we leave our net open," he says, and promises that the Japanese will "find out this President can play a little defense, too." His gaze might be a little too intense, and television viewers may have special reason to wonder what this Presidential goalie plans to keep out. Does a victory by the American team mean no more Sony Trinitrons?
The advertising for Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa shows him in shirtsleeves trying to rouse a crowd by shouting, "Let's have resource-based economics!" He has the exuberance of a good stump speaker, but when he waxes enthusiastic about new programs -- "I want to be known as the President that rebuilt America!" -- his passion can be disconcerting on the small screen, particularly to viewers who do not want to be known as the ones who paid for the renovation.
 
Beyond the Pretty Pictures
 The most noteworthy aspect of the spots for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts is what's missing: his voice. The reason seems obvious to anyone who has watched Mr. Tsongas be interviewed. Although he seems quite thoughtful, his message tends to get lost in his mushy diction. His advertising avoids this by relying on a narrator and a collage of scenes: mountains, assembly-line workers, Mr. Tsongas swimming laps. But the advertisements can leave even distracted viewers like Doreen Fontaine unsatisfied.
"Yes, Tsongas, I saw him swimming, but he didn't say too much from what I gathered," said Ms. Fontaine, a 50-year-old nurse from Londonderry. She said she hadn't really had time to pay attention to the advertisements or the candidates' interviews on television, but she was beginning to make up her mind.
"There was one that impressed me," she said. "I can't remember exactly what it was he wanted. I think it was for the working man and the economy, and something about health insurance. He seemed like he had confidence in what he was saying. He had a plan, I think. What was his name? Clinton. Is that one of the Democrats?"

HEADLINE: 1992 Campaign: Republicans;
Bush Campaign Scrambles to Put Forth a More Caring Candidate

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Racing to overcome a late start and an unexpected primary challenge, the Bush re-election forces have sent the President forth in a burst of appearances intended to show that he cares about the home front and understands the suffering of the recession.
The strategy seems intended to reap maximum political advantage from the State of the Union Message on Jan. 28, when the President will lay out his program for easing the problems he now so openly acknowledges. Indeed, some Republicans are already worrying that the White House has raised expectations for the State of the Union that it will be unable to meet. 
 In general, the Bush campaign still has a decidedly catch-up feel about it, reflecting a President whose poll ratings dropped with remarkable speed and whose plans presumed a far more leisurely stroll to re-election.
"It's a good team, but they're scrambling now," said Edward Rollins, who was campaign manager for President Ronald Reagan's re-election in 1984. "They've got a primary in five weeks that they didn't expect."
 
The Buchanan Challenge
 Bush strategists are essentially trying to retool the President, at a time when a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted Jan. 6-8 showed that two-thirds of the American people say he spends too much time on foreign affairs, 80 percent say the economy is in bad shape, and fewer than a fifth say Mr. Bush cares "a great deal" about the problems of people like them. The White House hopes to show that the leadership qualities the President demonstrated during the war in the Persian Gulf, when his popularity soared to historic levels, can be brought to bear on domestic problems.
The immediate audience for "Message: I care," as Mr. Bush put it this week, are the voters of New Hampshire. The state's Feb. 18 primary carries a huge risk of embarrassment for the White House because of the aggressive challenge from Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator. In recent weeks, Mr. Bush and his surrogates on the campaign trail, like Vice President Dan Quayle, have tried to defuse the potential for a protest vote in New Hampshire by persuading its residents that their concerns have already been heard.
"The message for New Hampshire is not necessarily a universal one," said one Republican strategist, "but it is generally applicable: that he cares and understands, that he's going to do something about it, that he does have an economic growth plan and that part of the problem is Congress."
 
Making Up for Lost Time
 Last week was an example of the concerned, domestic George Bush. He told farmers in Kansas City that he would "fight for American jobs, everywhere." He told New Hampshire residents that he understood the economy was "in a free fall," although, "maybe I haven't conveyed it as well as I should have." He spoke of his concern with race relations and urban ills in Atlanta.
Even as they recast the Presidential message for an election year, Mr. Bush's campaign advisers are struggling to assemble an organization and make up for months of lost time. Even without a primary challenge, Mr. Bush waited a very long time before beginning to organize for his re-election, many Republicans said. "We were about six months ahead of them in '84," said Mr. Rollins.
Mary Matalin, the campaign political director, said: "The organizational side is clicking right along. We know where to go and what to do." Referring to her Democratic counterparts, she added, "These other guys are still updating their Rolodexes."
 
Teeter-Skinner Team
 At the heart of the Bush re-election effort are Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman and principal strategist, and Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, both of whom have strong roots in Illinois politics and have known each other for years. In contrast to 1984, when James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, was widely seen as the dominant figure in the Reagan re-election drive, several Republicans close to the Bush campaign predicted that Mr. Skinner and Mr. Teeter would have a much more equal relationship.
Frederick V. Malek, with the title of campaign manager, will be the chief operating officer of the campaign, and Robert A. Mosbacher. holds the title of general campaign chairman. Mr. Mosbacher, who is leaving his position as Secretary of Commerce, is an old friend of Mr. Bush's and will function in a time-honored role in a Presidential campaign: "The guy who knows exactly how the President thinks, knows the President's friends, knows how the President will react in a situation -- the real peer," said one Republican strategist close to the campaign.
 
'Lacks a Common Touch'
 Some Republicans continue to worry about the top command of the Bush campaign for two reasons: as many of them put it, there is no Jim Baker and there is no Lee Atwater. Mr. Baker, now the Secretary of State, was the clear and acknowledged decision-maker in the 1988 campaign, these Republicans say. Mr. Atwater, who died of a malignant brain tumor last year, was the master strategist with a feel for the South, for popular culture in general and for no-holds-barred political combat.
"I think the campaign lacks a common touch," said Craig Shirley, a conservative consultant.
In recent weeks, the campaign has taken on the first of what is expected to be an expanding team of media consultants: Don Sipple, who handled Governor Pete Wilson's 1990 campaign and has a special expertise on California; Mike Murphy, who was the consultant for Gov. John Engler's upset victory in Michigan, and Alex Castellanos, who has handled several races in the South, including Senator Jesse Helms's 1984 and 1990 re-election campaigns in North Carolina.
Mr. Helms's 1990 campaign produced one of the more talked about commercials in recent years, featuring a pair of white hands crumpling a rejection letter while the announcer intoned, "You needed that job and you were the best qualified, but it had to go to a minority because of a racial quota." The commercial proceeded to denounce the civil rights bill then pending in Congress.
 
Veterans of '88 Campaign
 The Bush campaign also features such veterans of the 1988 campaign as Ms. Matalin, the political director; Rich Bond, a senior adviser; Charles Black, also a senior adviser, and James P. Pinkerton, whose title is counselor but who is expected to work closely on message. Mr. Pinkerton did much of the research on Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, which was used to such devastating effect in the 1988 campaign.
Noting the Presidential experience of most of the top operatives, Mr. Bond said: "We understand a couple of basic things about Presidential politics. First and foremost, we understand it's an elevator operation, and as quickly as you go up, you can just as quickly go down.
"A Democratic nominee is about to burst on the scene and be everything to everybody, and what our operation does is insure a proper picture of this nominee is conveyed to the American people."

HEADLINE: ULSTER'S WARFARE TAKES VARIED TOLL

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Down the block from Bedford Street, where 800 pounds of explosives blew a three-foot crater in the middle of the downtown area this month, a white-tie dinner and dance was held this week beneath the copper-covered dome of City Hall.
The Queen and the Princess of Romania were invited, along with the Lord Mayor of Belfast and a number of American businessmen. Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration and now publisher of Forbes magazine, was the guest of honor. And after a dinner of poached Irish salmon and roast beef, Eddie Haughey, a businessman who organized the affair, rose to say he had gathered them all together to "foster the good name of Northern Ireland." 
 There were too many misconceptions and misperceptions about Northern Ireland, Mr. Haughey declared. It was time, he said, "to show the world how we really are an industrious, educated, cultured, forward-thinking society, worthy of world attention as a center for investment."
But while most businessmen and government officials here agreed with the spirit of Mr. Haughey's message, and appreciated his convening such a festive evening, a lot of ordinary people on the streets of Belfast do not feel much like dancing these days.
 
Six Bombings in Six Weeks
 Over the last six weeks, the Irish Republican Army has set off six bombs in the city center as part of a continuing campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland. In addition to injuries, the attacks have cost millions of dollars in damage and have left people with jangled nerves.
[Early Saturday, the I.R.A. claimed responsibility for a roadside bombing in rural County Tyrone that killed seven workers and wounded seven others in a commuter van on Friday evening. The British Government said later that it would send 500 more troops to Northern Ireland to bolster security.]
The bombings have also snarled traffic into Belfast, with police officers in flak jackets and troops in battle gear stationed at checkpoints along roads leading into the city in an attempt to deter further bombings.
Politicians opposed to the I.R.A. are calling for even tougher security measures that include imposing curfews, issuing compulsory identity cards and sealing the border with the republic of Ireland, to the south.
"If they really wanted to show these visitors what is really happening in this city all they would have to do is take them for a walk to view the bomb damage around it," said Sammy Wilson, one of three members of the City Council who boycotted the dinner and dance at City Hall.
Along with fellow members of the Democratic Unionist Party, a mostly Protestant political organization, Mr. Wilson wants to see a much harder line taken with Irish republican militants.
Beyond the shadowy warfare between the rival paramilitary groups, which resulted in 94 deaths last year, the highest toll in nearly a decade, another battle is being waged in Belfast: a public relations campaign of images and impressions.
On the one side are the British, business owners and Northern Ireland officials who argue in brochures and press releases that life and commerce are becoming more and more normal in spite of "the troubles," as the 22-year-old conflict over Irish nationalism is euphemistically called both here in the north and in the south.
On the other side are the I.R.A. and some small, more militant supporting groups, whose bombs and bomb threats are intended to wreak havoc on the ordinary rhythms of life in the capital by interrupting commerce and making Belfast seem a city besieged.
 
Compensation Is Paid
 The economic damage toll has grown, too, something underlined by compensation payments made to bombed-out shopkeepers by the British Government. In the last nine months, the British have paid the equivalent of $41 million to businesses in Northern Ireland, a sum equal to what they spent for such payments for all of 1990.
Chris Thompson, whose sporting goods store in central Belfast was damaged by a bomb in November, says the recent attacks have taken the wind out of the weary capital. But like other businessmen, Mr. Thompson says he intends to carry on.
Three blocks away, Richard Traynor, who owns a photocopy shop, says that although he has been bombed three times in the last eight years, he has no plans to leave.
"What can you say?" Mr. Traynor said with a shrug. "This is Belfast." Then he added, "Besides, I've got a lease for another two years."

HEADLINE: Texas Governor Proves Adept in Her First Year

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 17

 BODY:
The day after Ann W. Richards was elected Governor of Texas in November 1990, she described politics in Texas as "a contact sport" and "not for the weak or the lily-livered."
While no one would accuse her of being docile in her year in office, Governor Richards has behaved more like a chess player than a linebacker. 
 She has made deals and compromises with other powerful politicians, and when she has resorted to head-on tackles, she has picked easy targets like the insurance industry or the operators of troubled nursing homes. Having campaigned as a no-nonsense reformer impatient with the good-old-boy system of Texas governance, in office she has shrewdly practiced the art of the possible.
And, as she begins her second year, Governor Richards seems very mindful of the limitations she faces.
In a news conference Thursday to mark her anniversary, she bemoaned court orders on legislative redistricting and school finance as well as the difficulties of taming the state bureaucracy and, most of all, the uncertainties of a souring economy.
"Texas is now very much vulnerable to the vagaries of the national economy," said Governor Richards, a Democrat. "We no longer have the insulation of cotton or cattle or oil. We are going to feel this recession very much."
When she entered office, Governor Richards said she counted on a rising economy to help Texas avoid tax increases. Asked Thursday how the recession would affect the state's fiscal prospects, she was unusually gloomy and uncertain, saying, "Well, I really don't know."
Just six months ago she faced the prospect of a $4.5 billion deficit in the 1992-93 biennial budget, and for the first time the idea of imposing a state income tax was receiving serious attention. She was saved that pain when John Sharp, the state Comptroller, came up with proposals for $4 billion in spending cuts, many of which were enacted.
The air of crisis helped her persuade the Democratic-controlled Legislature to narrowly approve a lottery, one of her chief campaign proposals, but even so the state adopted a $2.7 billion tax increase that included a revision of the state's major tax on businesses. Although the levy is not strictly an income tax, businesses that used to pay taxes only on their capital assets now pay either on assets or income, whichever is greater.
In a statement marking the Governor's first year in office, Fred Meyer, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, said she "campaigned against an income tax, promised in July there would not be an income tax, then signed Texas' first income tax into law in August."
 
Avoiding Political Disaster
 But so far Governor Richards has escaped the political disasters visited on other governors who have increased levies: The tax increase here affected businesses rather than individuals and Governor Richards has avoided being perceived as its author.
"Everyone knew there was going to have to be a tax increase when she came into office, just as everyone knew George Bush was going to have to go back on his 'no new taxes' pledge," said David Prindle, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin. "But she certainly put forth a consistent public face of being forced to accept something unwillingly, and she did it much more successfully than the President did with his tax increase."
Mr. Meyer said that the state is heading for "disaster of titanic proportions," and while such a claim may be partisan, a number of the Governor's fellow Democrats acknowledge that the fiscal crisis was merely postponed last summer and that another reckoning is due when the Legislature draws up the next two-year budget in 1993.
Looming over the state and its Governor is the unresolved question of how to equalize financing among school districts that vary widely in their ability to raise money from property taxes. Having already rejected two previous school finance plans, the Texas Supreme Court is considering challenges to a law enacted last year that boosts state spending and redistributes locally raised money among rich and poor school districts.
This law is expected to increase state spending by as much as $5 billion over the next four years, and there is still the possibility that the court will demand more.
Governor Richards displayed some of her trademark verbal ferocity Thursday when she accused the court of "inappropriate and capricious" behavior in continuing to ponder the case even as school districts are set to collect taxes under the new plan at the end of this month. "We are all mystified at this point," she said.
 
A 'New Texas'?
 Ann Richards, 58 years old, came to the Governor's office after eight years as State Treasurer by defeating a rancher and oilman, Clayton Williams, who strutted his nostalgia for Texas's myths. Last January, Governor Richards proclaimed her inauguration "the first day of the new Texas."
But, unlike other governors who have taken office determined to remake their states and who have immediately begun battles against the established powers -- the recently defeated Buddy Roemer of Louisiana being an example -- Governor Richards has operated within the constraints of political reality.
While she has not been able to enact all of the ambitious agenda she set out in her early days, she can point to some notable accomplishments. A package of measures to stabilize insurance rates and combat fraud is perhaps her clearest victory. She also has far more minority and female appointees than her predecessors had. But on the environment and on ethics in government she has bargained rather than battered and has accepted compromises.
Sometimes her methods have seemed more akin to the old Texas than the new one she proclaimed.
Republicans and news organizations accused her of violating the Texas Open Meetings Act when she plotted strategy with members of the powerful Legislative Budget Board at a private retreat on a virtually inaccessible coastal island last June, and at other key moments she has been caught operating behind closed doors.
Mary Beth Rogers, the Governor's chief of staff, said, "The Governor is certainly an outsider in terms of the industries that have traditionally tried to dominate this state government, but in terms of understanding how you make things happen in this very cumbersome legislative process, she's no outsider."
She added: "You don't always have to hit people over the head with a baseball bat to get things done. When you have the power of this office there are other ways you can effect change."

HEADLINE: Bush to Propose $500 Million Rise In Budget for Head Start Program

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
President Bush will propose an increase of more than 23 percent in Federal spending for preschool children in the Head Start program, and he will expand it to combat illiteracy and unemployment among parents of children enrolled in the program, Administration officials said today.
In his new budget request, to be submitted to Congress in 10 days, Mr. Bush will seek an increase of more than $500 million for the popular program, which now serves 621,000 children at a cost of $2.2 billion this year, the officials said. 
 The increase would be the largest since the creation of Head Start in 1965. But it is less than what supporters of the program, including many Democrats in Congress, say is needed to guarantee access to Head Start for all children eligible on the basis of family income. The Democrats and other advocates of the program would increase the Head Start budget by $1 billion a year, to reach a total of nearly $8 billion by the end of 1997.
 
Seeking to Expand Enrollment
 Wade F. Horn, the Federal Commissioner for Children, Youth and Families, said today that the extra money sought by Mr. Bush would permit more children from low-income families to enroll in Head Start. At present, he said, 60 percent of the eligible children enter school having had at least one year of Head Start.
In contrast to the estimates by Federal officials, Sarah M. Greene, executive director of the National Head Start Association, which represents parents and teachers of children in the program, said "1.4 million children eligible for Head Start are not being served" because the program reaches only 28 percent of the 2 million children eligible under Federal laws and regulations.
Mr. Bush is expected to announce some of his plans on Tuesday, when he visits a Head Start center in Catonsville, Md., outside Baltimore.
Nine out of 10 children in Head Start come from families with income below the official poverty level, which was $13,359 for a family of four in 1990. Children in Head Start receive instruction intended to foster their intellectual and emotional development. They also receive health-care services and well-balanced meals. Research has shown that children in Head Start perform better on preschool achievement tests than comparable children not enrolled in the program, and in later years they do better in school.
Mr. Horn said the Administration was shifting the emphasis of Head Start to make it "a two-generation program" that serves parents as well as children in low-income families. Thus, he said, the Government wants to have an adult literacy program in every Head Start center in the country by the end of this year. In addition, he said, Head Start centers offer job training and placement services for parents of Head Start children.
In his 1988 Presidential campaign, Mr. Bush said he would expand Head Start to reach all eligible 4-year-olds. He has not accomplished that goal, though the Head Start budget has increased 78 percent since he took office.
Enrollment in Head Start has increased by 171,000 children, or 38 percent, in the last three years.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Killer Seized Outside a New Jersey Mall

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPRING VALLEY, N.Y., Jan. 18

 BODY:
The strange prison-escape saga of the stockbroker murderer who frightened Connecticut and New York residents and set off a massive manhunt ended this afternoon in New Jersey, when the police captured the escaped convict, Frank Vandever, at a mall in Paramus.
After searching for him in Rockland County just north of the New Jersey border, Mr. Vandever, a transvestite who was convicted of murdering a client, was arrested as he walked toward a car that was stolen this morning from the very motel here where he had slipped away from F.B.I. agents two days earlier. 
 Mr. Vandever was arrested at 5:15 P.M. as he walked toward the car in the sprawling parking lot of the Garden State Plaza, roughly 10 miles from this Rockland County community where a report of his appearance at an Econolodge motel frightened residents and touched off the intensive search, the police said.
He stole the car at 7:30 this morning from a woman who lived at the Econolodge and who maintained a morning ritual of starting her car and then dashing inside while it warmed up, said Paul Kunar, an investigator for the New York State police. The police said they believed Mr. Vandever knew the woman's habit because he had been staying at the Econolodge.
A Paramus police officer, Kenneth Ehrenberg, spotted the car in the mall's parking lot at 4:10 P.M. When Mr. Vandever returned to the car, officers were waiting, and he surrendered without a struggle, Mr. Kunar said.
 
$70 Money Order
 The police had been combing the mall parking lot after Mr. Vandever was identified by clerks at a convenience store in Bergenfield, N.J.
Earlier today Mr. Vandever had appeared at a 7-Eleven store wearing a red flannel lumberjack's jacket and looking unkempt. He bought a $70 money order and left, said John J. Kindergan, the store's owner.
Minutes after he left, a police detective came into the store to warn them that Mr. Vandever might be in the area.
"He appeared very scruffy, not someone who had taken a shower in the morning," said Daniel King, the store's weekend clerk. He said the clerks who were on duty then recognized Mr. Vandever from the photographs that have been widely publicized in recent days and notified law enforcement officials.
The manhunt gained unusual notoriety after Mr. Vandever and the other escapee, Ronald Rutan, slipped through the bars and the high-technology fence of a maximum-security prison in Somers, Conn., on Dec. 31. They then terrorized a couple, stole their car and vanished for more than two weeks until F.B.I. agents caught up with them on Thursday in Rockland County, just north of New York City, only to lose Mr. Vandever again when he vaulted over a fence and disappeared once more.
Responding to a telephoned tip, agents had caught up with Mr. Vandever and the other escapee, Ronald Rutan, at the Econolodge. Mr. Rutan was arrested immediately. But when Mr. Vandever slipped away, local, state and Federal law-enforcement authorities set up a search involving bloodhounds, helicopters, roadblocks on the area's major highways and house-to-house searches.
The escape of Mr. Vandever and Mr. Rutan set off a political furor in Connecticut because of allegations that it would not have been possible before budget cuts left the prison staff reduced and dependent on a new technology in prison fences. Last year, under the administration of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., officials decided to reduce staffing of guard towers at the prison as part of his administration's budget-cutting moves.
The two men escaped by relying on two techniques, one as old as James Cagney movies and another so new that it caught prison officials off guard.
Mr. Rutan, who worked in the prison kitchen, slowly cut his way through the bars there, officials believe, in preparation for the escape. Then, between 7 and 10 P.M., when the security staff was reduced because of the holiday and the state's austerity budget, the two men slipped through the bars and worked on two 12-foot-high fences equipped with electronic motion detectors.
Officials have since said that they believe the fence was sensitive to any type of jarring, for example, if someone brushed against it or jumped onto it, but not to the approach used by the two men.
The police said they believe that one of the men held the fence tightly so as to reduce any motion, while the other snipped very carefully at the wires to avoid setting off any alarms.
After the escape, the two men first frightened people in the area of northern Connecticut near the prison in Somers, holding a couple hostage at knifepoint before tying them up and stealing their truck.
Then they preoccupied the people of Rockland County, N.Y., where they were discovered in midafternoon on Thursday after a tip to the F.B.I. from an unnamed Connecticut woman who said she had seen a segment about the pair on a syndicated television program, "Hard Copy."
After the tip, F.B.I. agents went to an Econolodge motel on Route 59 in Spring Valley, where the woman reported that she had seen the two escapees. According to an F.B.I. agent in charge of the search, Don Clark, the agents had not yet set up their stakeout when the two men returned to the Econolodge in the stolen truck. The F.B.I. agents identified themselves while the two men walked toward the room they had occupied for about 10 days. The two men began running in different directions.
Mr. Rutan was quickly captured. But Mr. Vandever vaulted over a fence behind the motel and disappeared.

HEADLINE: U.S. Human Rights Office Grows in Influence

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Patricia M. Derian, the first Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, has vivid memories of her early days in office. She recalls that she was often resented, ridiculed or ignored, and certainly not taken very seriously.
"After I had been there awhile, I invited all the other assistant secretaries to a meeting so that I could tell them what it was that I was there to do," she recalls. "It was one of those times when you're talking and people look away, extremely embarrassed at this naive display. They thought, this is going to be some little creampuff here." 
 That was in 1977. A decade and a half later, human rights has moved to the center of foreign policy debate in Washington, spurred by pressures from Congress and a voiciferous lobby of rights and relief organizations. The subject figures in all Congressional debates on foreign aid. Worldwide, few nations are finding that they can defy human rights scrutiny without diplomatic consequences.
Since 1981, Republican administrations have often been the target of criticism by human rights groups, which charge that Washington has been uneven or inconsistent in raising rights issues because of other policy considerations. Nonetheless, these administrations have drawn the major groups -- Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights -- into their consultations.
"We see assistant secretaries and desk officers all the time," said John G. Healey, head of Amnesty International in the United States. "Even if we don't get what we want, we're in the mix now. The relationships are warm. They seek, we give. They call, we help."
As Americans grow more critical of spending money on foreign aid in hard economic times and the ferment of the post-cold war world presents many new claims for attention, the human rights lobby can enhance its influence.
"I think one of the best examples of the influence of human rights groups in recent years is China," said Sidney Jones, executive director of Asia Watch. "By criticizing United States policy on China, the human rights organizations have been able to exert some pressure on China itself."
Over the last two years, Ms. Jones added, every time China seemed in danger of losing its preferred tariff status with the United States, it would respond to key debates in Congress by releasing some prisoners.
One of the most sustained campaigns in the waning years of the cold war was on behalf of Soviet Jews and other citizens whose rights were restricted in the former Soviet Union.
Robert Pastor, professor of political science at Emory University and former Latin American specialist at the National Security Council, says the emergence of democracies in the Western Hemisphere is a tribute to the success of rights campaigns.
"In human rights, we are really dealing with an international movement of great consequence," he said. "It would be hard to find a country in this hemisphere in which raised consciousness of human rights has not had any effect. Even in the most extreme case of Cuba, Fidel Castro has had to deal with the United Nations Human Rights Commission, and he has had to respond to questions posed not by the United States or the Cuban-American community but by Latin Americans."
Not all areas have high human-rights profiles. Many Africans see great needs on a continent where lately, most of the attention has been focused on South Africa. The world has not reacted to hundreds of thousands of Somalis facing starvation and death in factional warfare, said Rakiya Omaar, executive director of Africa Watch. Sudanese struggle to get a hearing for charges that their Islamic Government is brutally suppressing a rebellion in the Christian and animist south. country.
"In 30 years, human rights has been put on the agenda of the world by the pain of suffering people," Mr. Healey said. "Every group has the right to claim some kind of victory. There has been a change in the river of consciousness."

HEADLINE: A Family Gets Back on Track With Help From the Neediest

 BODY:
Time was, the Rosas had enough -- not a lot, but enough. Maria Rosa, 26 years old, remembers when she and her family could afford fresh vegetables and meat. That was more than a year ago. "My son is anemic. He is used to fresh food and we eat out of cans now." she said, glancing sadly at her husband.
Until early last year, her husband, Richard, worked regularly for various delivery companies, providing him with enough income to support his family. But he was laid off last February and was unable to find another job. Even though both had gone to night school and were certified building superintendents, they still had trouble finding steady work. 
 "We have gone from the stage of having little to nothing," Mr. Rosa said. "The recession has really hit us hard."
Mr. Rosa, 28, found a job as a truck driver just before Jan. 1, but the road to financial and emotional recovery will not be easy. He brings home about $270 a week. Their modest, one-bedroom apartment in Flushing, Queens, costs $730 a month, and there is barely any space for 4-year-old Richard Anthony to play.
 
Hope for the Future
 "We can't afford to send him to a day-care center," she said. "He stays home with me, we do everything together."
The situation has taken a toll on Mrs. Rosa's health and has put a strain on her marriage, bringing on bouts of depression and worries about her son. "We have no social life, we can't do anything," she said. "But the worst part is having to say no when he asks for a new toy or food. It's heartbreaking."
With the help of the Catholic Charities Diocese of Brooklyn and The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, the Rosas now have hope for the future. "I don't know where we would be without them," Mr. Rosa said. "I don't even want to think about it."
The Rosas were referred to the Catholic Charities Family Center by their priest at St. Michael's Cathedral in Flushing. Now they are able give their son "real food" to help keep him healthy, Mrs. Rosa said.
The Neediest Cases Fund gave them $731 in cash for their rent and some money to buy a turkey for Christmas. It also supplied them with emergency food packages and money for transportation, as well as counseling sessions once a week.
 
Starting Fresh
 The Neediest Cases helps thousands of New Yorkers get their lives back on track. The campaign's overhead is covered by the newspaper so that all contributions are distributed to seven charities that feed the hungry, clothe the poor and help families like the Rosas overcome long-term problems.
Now their main concern is to start fresh and begin a new life. "I want to go to college and become a psychologist," Mrs. Rosa said. "I want to help people."
Her husband also has higher expectations. "I'm just taking this job to pay the bills," he said. "But I'm going for my tractor-trailer license to put Maria through college."
The Rosas don't have much, but manage to find the time for other people. Recently they helped feed the homeless at St. Michael's Cathedral. "It was wonderful to be able to touch so many people with so little," Mrs. Rosa said. "Helping people as a family is special."

HEADLINE: The Minibus From Loneliness

 BODY:
"What would I do in Florida?" The answer Julia has in mind is plain: nothing. Since her parents emigrated from Poland in 1910, she has lived in Brooklyn. It is where she went to school, got her first job sewing ($3 a week), where she married, raised a family and bought her daughter a home. Julia, 90 years old and widowed, is mentally sharp and too vigorous to sit home all day, but she can no longer go out walking in the winter or at night. Julia hates to ask her grandchildren on Long Island for favors, and her daughter is now 70 and blind.
So every weekday, a minibus operated by the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged provides her with round-trip transportation to the Williamsburg Senior Center, where she enjoys a hot lunch, planned activities and the company of friends. The minibus, which serves senior citizens of all races and creeds, is just one of many programs for the elderly supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 Eighty-year-old Minnie knows how easily isolation can overtake those growing old. The onset of arthritis and a heart condition forced Minnie to become homebound, sadly alone with her memories. Now, with access to the minibus, an Irving Berlin song or a life story is readily shared with peers. "We tell each other what's on our hearts," Minnie explains. "Our children moved away. Both parents work today, so they have no time for us. They have a better life," Minnie adds, her voice brimming with pride. "We paved the way for them. But now we're very, very lonesome people."
For retirees who years ago decided to remain in the city, and who now have outlived spouses and friends, living alone in decayed neighborhoods has brought unanticipated sorrows and fears. The recession squeezes New York's oldest residents particularly hard, as purchasing power shrinks on fixed incomes and the interest on life savings declines.
Throughout this year, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund will rescue tens of thousands of the city's elderly from hunger and loneliness. Even a small donation can provide a wealth of comfort and care for the isolated and infirm. The holiday season is past but the 80th appeal continues. All who can are asked to help.
Tax-deductible contributions should be sent to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Post Office Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

HEADLINE: A Worthy War

BYLINE: By Stephen J. SolarzBy WASHINGTON; Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of New York, is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

 BODY:
The historical revisionists are already at work. Last year's triumph in the war against Iraq, they claim, has turned to ashes. We won the war only to lose the peace. But the naysayers who make this argument too cavalierly dismiss the strategic and diplomatic benefits produced by Operation Desert Storm.
To be sure, the fact that Saddam Hussein remains in power is deeply disturbing. But this hardly constitutes an argument against the war, particularly since he would still be comfortably ensconced in Iraq and Kuwait if we had not moved against him. 
 Perhaps the war's most significant achievement has been the extent to which we have substantially set back Iraq's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons. We now know that Iraq was far closer to developing them than was believed a year ago. Had we not been willing to use force, Saddam Hussein would undoubtedly have obtained a nuclear arsenal, with grave consequences for the region and the world.
But there were other benefits as well. By liberating Kuwait from the clutches of a Mesopotamian megalomaniac, we prevented Saddam Hussein from getting his hands on the economic jugular of the world. We demonstrated that powerful countries will no longer be permitted to take over weaker ones. And we opened the way for a Middle East peace process that has made it possible, for the first time in over 40 years, for Israel to negotiate directly with its Arab neighbors.
It is worth considering what the consequences would have been had we not been willing to use military power against Iraq. Based on Mr. Hussein's willingness to use other weapons of mass destruction, there is every reason to believe that, once he acquired nuclear weapons, he would have used them as well.
Moreover, after absorbing Kuwait, Mr. Hussein would have been in a position to dominate the entire Persian Gulf. At best, to prevent the other gulf dominoes from falling, we would have been obliged to maintain tens of thousands of American troops indefinitely in the culturally and climatically inhospitable Arabian Peninsula.
Furthermore, there would have been no peace process between Israel and the Arabs. The stability of the Arab countries willing to join us in opposing Iraq would have been badly shaken. And the stage would have been set for additional campaigns of conquest, in which the number of casualties inflicted by a nuclear-armed Iraq would have been infinitely greater than the number of those killed last year.
While reasonable people disagreed about whether sanctions would be sufficient to force Mr. Hussein out of Kuwait, it seems clear in retrospect that economic pressure alone would not have done the job. Even now, after we have destroyed much of his military machine and economic infrastructure, and with sanctions still in place, Mr. Hussein remains unregenerate and unrepentant. His refusal to comply with the cease-fire agreement is clear evidence that the continued application of sanctions would have been a formula for failure, rather than a strategy for success.
The opponents of war also told us we would get hopelessly bogged down in a desert war with massive American casualties. Yet we won the war in six weeks, with fewer than 150 American fatalities.
We were cautioned that the Arab masses would overthrow Arab governments courageous enough to oppose Iraq. Yet every one of our Arab partners is more stable today than if Mr. Hussein had gotten away with the annexation of Kuwait.
We were warned that a war would divert tens of billions of dollars from pressing problems at home. Yet virtually the entire cost of the war was paid by our coalition partners and other friendly countries.
We may not have accomplished everything we hoped to, but there can be little doubt that the gulf and the world are far more congenial to American interests and values than they would have been had we acquiesced in Saddam Hussein's brutal aggression against Kuwait.

Bush's Crucial Decision

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
Nothing else President Bush does this year is likely to matter as much, in human terms, as how he answers Israel's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees. He will be deciding on the chance for peace in the Middle East.
The critical question is whether the President ties any guarantees to an end of Israel's massive current settlement drive in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. If he does not, Palestinians will see his decision as a signal that Israel can and will go on taking what they consider to be their land. 
 At that point it would be politically difficult, perhaps impossible, for the Palestinian negotiators to remain in the talks on autonomy in the occupied territories. The hope of peace, present since the two sides began talking to each other in Madrid, would be over.
Failure of the negotiations would in turn have grim consequences for Soviet immigrants here, whose support is the stated purpose of the loan guarantees. Ephraim Sneh, a retired Brigadier General who was the military governor of the West Bank and is now one of the rising younger figures in the Labor Party, explained why.
"To absorb the Soviet Jews properly we have to develop industry," Mr. Sneh said. "That requires foreign investment. But it will not come while we are in the quagmire of the conflict with the Palestinians -- while we are the only Western democracy that occupies another people.
"The key to social and economic progress is peace with the Palestinians. And nothing is more against the hope of peace than the settlements."
The head of the Jewish Agency, Simcha Dinitz, agreed that Israel should focus on absorbing Soviet immigrants rather than settling among Palestinians. But he said it would be wrong for the President to condition loan guarantees.
"If you want to punish us for the settlements," Mr. Dinitz said, "do it some other way. Don't punish the immigrants."
That will not be an easy argument for Mr. Bush to resist in an election year. But if he really cares about peace and about the Soviet immigrants, as he does, he will resist it. For there is no question of punishment. The question is how to clear the path for peace by stopping settlements, and the only way at hand is to condition the loan guarantees.
How Mr. Bush does it is important. If he were to say flatly that there will be no guarantees unless and until there is a freeze on settlements, Prime Minister Shamir might well reject the guarantees, denounce American "colonialism" and redouble settlements -- however terrible the cost to Israel.
The better course is the one reportedly being discussed. That is to approve $2 billion for one year, with any amount spent by Israel on settlements to be deducted from future guarantees. Thus if Israel spent $600 million in 1992, it would get a guarantee of $1.4 billion in 1993.
But that will work only if the United States rigorously monitors what Israel spends on housing, roads and other infrastructure in the territories. Israel has promised in the past not to use U.S. aid money in the territories -- and then simply use the aid to free up Israeli funds for settlements.
If American policy is sensitively explained, I think most Israelis would understand and accept it. After all, the United States is not obligated to grant Israeli requests against what it deems to be its own interest. Mr. Sneh said:
"I don't need America to tell me settlements are wrong. But since money is fungible, I can understand if Mr. Bush declines to be the treasurer of Gush Emunim." Gush Emunim are the zealous vanguard of the settler movement.
Moreover, many Israelis are beginning to resent what the settlement policy costs them. Projects to relieve major highway bottlenecks in Israel proper have just been cut so that West Bank roads for settlers -- who are 3 percent of Israelis -- can be improved. In new settlements there is a teacher for five or six children, in Jerusalem 1 for 40 children.
President Bush should tell Israel: We are sympathetic with the great humanitarian enterprise of making a place for immigrants. We will help. But we do not want our help to be used in a way that destroys the chance for peace: the chance to build a better, safer, more prosperous Israel.

After 10 Years, an All-New Montero

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
ACCORDING to conventional wisdom, the Japanese like to copy things American, but that is not always so. They take good ideas where they find them, and this time the nice notion comes from England.
The vehicle in question is Mitsubishi's Montero, a fancy sport-utility wagon that looks like nothing so much as the British Range Rover and that carries the upscale effort to nearly the same extreme. 
 Mitsubishi has been sending the Montero to America for a decade, but the model that made its debut in showrooms this month is the first complete redesign in all that time, and it reflects the evolution of what was once considered a simple workhorse, a vehicle that could climb mountains and cut through forests. A vehicle, in short, that could go anywhere but the country club.
Sport-utility models now account for about 6.5 percent of the automobile and light-truck market, and the number of entries has continued to climb as more buyers have been lured by their off-road abilities and cargo capacity. In 1983, there were seven such offerings. Today, there are 20.
All the same, most people never take these things off the highway. Image is, in part, what Montero and the other contenders are all about, and that is easy to understand. You really don't want to plunk down $30,000 or so, and then rush off to the brambles.
For '92, Montero comes in four flavors, plain, RS, LS and SR, and prices range from a base of about $18,000 to the $27,885 sticker of the top-of-the-line tester, an SR done up in dark green metallic paint and tan leather.
The body has been rounded a bit, although aerodynamics are not the Montero's long suit, and silver vinyl has been added as lower-body cladding to protect against dings and scrapes. Aluminum wheels carry huge and aggressive tires, and there is a mix of blackout trim and brightwork, including chrome bumpers.
All Monteros come with four doors, and the new model is longer, wider and taller than its predecessor. But the body is not all that has been redesigned. A new V6, similar to those in the 3000GT and in Mitsubishi's recently introduced Diamante sedan, powers a new four-wheel-drive system, and the antilock brakes have been made compatible with all modes, no matter how many wheels are driving the vehicle.
The 3-liter engine, mounted longitudinally, puts out 151 horsepower, and the LS and SR models accommodate it with standard four-speed automatic transmissions, while lesser Monteros have standard five-speed sticks. A separate lever allows the driver to shift into four-wheel drive at any speed up to 62 m.p.h.
Inside, the Montero lives up to its billing as a luxury cruiser. The SR's tilt wheel was wrapped in leather, and both front buckets were of the "suspension" type for extra cushioning. There was full power equipment, including a one-touch down feature for the driver's window and buttons for the truck-style sideview mirrors.
The dash includes full instrumentation, and a center pod lets you know inside and outside temperatures as well as altitude and compass direction. It also incorporates an inclinometer to show the position of the vehicle relative to the ground. A lighted diagram in the instrument panel takes the guesswork out of four-wheel drive, indicating which wheels are doing the work.
A large, electrically operated sunroof is mounted midships over the rear seat, a bench that folds forward to increase cargo room. With the seat in its upright position, the Montero can carry 44.8 cubic feet of luggage, camping gear or what have you. Folded, the space increases to 96.6 cubic feet.
One reason there is so much room is the location of the full-sized spare, which hangs outside the rear hatch. But that location also creates one of the Montero's few problems, covering a goodly chunk of the back window. Combined with the blockage posed by the rear seat's headrests and the rear window's wiper, it means the driver can see very little out the back.
Another problem, and one that seems endemic to sports-utility vehicles, stems from the Montero's height and huge tires. On the highway, it wanders annoyingly and requires constant correction.
Still, this is a friendly vehicle, one that cruises easily at more than the legal limit, and it is put together well and comfortable. Electronically controlled shock absorbers offer three settings of firmness, and there is more travel in the suspension than there used to be. On the road, that translates into a quiet and solid ride. And there is no question that you have a lot of machinery under you; this thing weighs more than two tons.
Given that, the fuel economy ratings are understandable. City mileage averages 15 per gallon, and the highway figure is only three better. The tank is relatively large, however, holding a bit more than 24 gallons, so you can travel a good long way in the wild.
It goes without saying that gas is no problem when you're headed for the country club.

HEADLINE: SAUDIS PRESS U.S. FOR HELP IN OUSTER OF IRAQ'S LEADER

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia is pressing the Bush Administration to organize a large covert action campaign in Iraq aimed at dividing Iraq's army and toppling Saddam Hussein, United States and allied officials say.
 The Saudi initiative seeks an allied effort to supply arms and intelligence to Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, Shiite Muslim fighters in the south and Sunni Muslim opposition forces in central Iraq. The aim is to draw out and divide Mr. Hussein's last Republican Guard divisions protecting his strongholds around Baghdad and subject them to allied air assaults. 
Saudi advocacy for a new and more aggressive campaign comes as the Bush Administration is considering new steps to support Iraqi rebel forces with allied military power and to exploit growing tensions in the Iraqi leadership in a manner that would hasten Mr. Hussein's downfall while leaving the formation of a successor government clearly in Iraqi hands.
 
Political Issue for Bush
 The White House remains deeply concerned that the Iraqi leader is still in power at the outset of a Presidential election year in which his survival has become a political issue. The ouster of Mr. Hussein before November's election would remove the shadow that the Iraqi leader casts over Mr. Bush's campaign and eliminate the possibility that Mr. Hussein could do harm to Mr. Bush's re-election effort through provocative statements emanating from Baghdad.
 American and allied officials discussed those plans with a reporter because some believe that the disclosure will by itself instill confidence in Iraqi opposition forces, while others, who oppose some of the proposals, hoped that public knowledge would provoke a cautionary public or congressional response.
 
Fomenting a Coup
 Substantial military forces from the United States, Britain, France and Saudi Arabia remain in the Persian Gulf area. American military leaders, including Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have cautioned that any effort to dislodge Mr. Hussein from Baghdad would require a major new deployment, including ground combat forces, to the region, a prospect that would increase the political risks for President Bush in an election year.
 It could not be learned whether Britain and France have been consulted about the new planning. But senior American and Saudi officials have discussed military and covert action options over the last 10 days.
 The American planning effort focusing on taking more active measures to foment a coup represents a realization within the Bush Administration that stronger measures might be possible in coming months to take advantage of what Administration officials perceive as a weakening of support for Mr. Hussein brought about in part by sanctions that are strangling the Iraqi economy.
 In the initial postwar period, the Administration relied principally on sanctions to weaken the Iraqi leader. But by last fall, Mr. Hussein's grip on power seemed to be strengthening and he appeared to be exploiting the humanitarian crisis in Iraq to break the international coalition against him.
 Then, when intelligence reporting indicated a fracturing of unity in Mr. Hussein's inner circle, the White House began preparing for more aggressive steps to seize opportunities that might arise to topple Mr. Hussein, like a coup plot by military commanders.
 In addition to the Saudi option of secretly arming guerrilla forces, a senior Bush Administration official said in an interview this week that the Administration has considered coordinating its efforts with Kurdish and Shiite forces inside Iraq to foment a coup for which Iraqi military commanders would seek allied support.
That Saudi-backed option would require a major allied air campaign over Iraq and possibly the reintroduction of American ground troops in the region. military officials said.
 With Mr. Hussein's air force grounded since the end of the war, the use of air power to destroy Mr. Hussein's remaining tank divisions and helicopter fleet would be the key to his final defeat in the view of a number of military officials.
 
So Far, No Decision
 United States and allied officials interviewed over the last several weeks indicated that no decisions had been made and that no final package of options had been presented to President Bush. The anti-Saddam Hussein planning still is being coordinated by the so-called Deputies Committee, which includes senior officials from the Pentagon, the State Department, the C.I.A. and the National Security Council.
 The senior official who discussed the possibility of aiding a coup attempt said that Kurdish guerrillas in the north and Shiite Muslim resistance forces in the south "can be a dimension of an approach" to attack Mr. Hussein's power base.
 But he said the key to a successful overthrow of the Iraqi leader remained the defeat or neutralization of the five of seven Republican Guard divisions that are stationed in the greater Baghdad area to protect the Iraqi leader.
 The official said that there must be a broad-based, national character to a successful opposition to Mr. Hussein, including participation by Kurds, Shiites and the minority Sunni Muslims of central Iraq who have long been the leadership class in the country.
 
Arms-Supply Network
 "Sooner or later, I am convinced that the people Saddam depends on will turn on him as a dead end," the official said.
 President Bush, in his statement Thursday on the anniversary of the beginning of the war that reversed Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, praised "the efforts of thousands of brave Iraqis who are resisting Saddam's rule."
 The senior official said the statement was part of a concerted American campaign to nurture and develop an Iraqi resistance that could figure into plans for the final demise of Mr. Hussein.
 Among the covert action options that Saudi Arabia is promoting is the formation of arms-supply and guerrilla-warfare networks organized by allied intelligence services that could challenge poorly trained Iraqi Army units garrisoned in most of the rural areas of northern and southern Iraq.
 
Allied Air Power
 Saudi officials and Iraqi opposition leaders say that many Iraqi regulars would desert or defect in large numbers once they were challenged.
 If guerrilla forces seized Iraqi territories, Mr. Hussein would be forced to either cede control of those areas to the resistance or send his best Republican Guard units out from Baghdad to crush the rebellion.
 At that point, the rebels would be protected by allied air power, in the view of Saudi officials and some Iraqi opposition leaders.
 The key to supporting such guerrilla operations would be to prevent Mr. Hussein's Republican Guard units from employing their attack helicopters and their three heavily armored divisions against a dedicated assault from allied-backed resistance groups.
 "There has to be a combination of a major covert operation and a major air operation and then leave the rest to the Iraqi people," said a senior allied official who has been discussing strategy with Bush Administration aides involved in the planning.
 
Saudi Equipment Pledged
 Kurdish guerrillas already control much of northern Iraq. But the Kurdish leadership is divided over whether to launch a direct challenge to Mr. Hussein. Shiite resistance in the south is much less organized and not well understood by allied officials, but Shiite opposition leaders say they can step up their guerrilla activities if they have arms and support from Saudi Arabia and the United States.
 Saudi Arabia is willing to equip Iraqi resistance forces with missiles that would be able to shoot down Iraqi helicopters and destroy armored vehicles, a senior allied official said.
 In November, the Deputies Committee asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop military plans for an American response to any request for assistance from Iraqi military commanders plotting against Mr. Hussein.The White House request to the Joint Chiefs coincided with a letter Mr. Bush sent to Saudi Arabia's King Fahd pledging Mr. Bush's determination to achieve the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and to continue providing adequate military forces in the region to do that.
 The letter, carried to the Saudi king by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, also was intended to smooth American-Saudi relations after a long summer of haggling over whether the Saudis would accept the storage of a large stockpile of American military equipment and ammunition as part of a new security arrangement in the Persian Gulf region. The storage issue has yet to be resolved.
 The new round of American planning also was motivated by intelligence reports indicating growing disaffection with Mr. Hussein among Iraq's traditional ruling families and clans. At least one bloody rivalry had surfaced between Mr. Hussein's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal Hassan, and another close relative, Ali Hassan Majid, who presided over occupied Kuwait as Mr. Hussein's personal representative. Both relatives have held a series of key posts in Mr. Hussein's Government over the last decade.
 In November, the Iraqi leader replaced Mr. Hassan as Defense Minister with Mr. Majid, setting off a gun battle between the security forces of the rival relatives, according to what was described by one official as a reliable "human intelligence" report received by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 A Deputies Committee meeting on Dec. 12 examined the limitations in using United States military forces in supporting an indigenous challenge to Mr. Hussein's authority, and that review focused in part on the strong cautionary recommendation from General Powell that the success of any new United States military intervention in Iraq could not be assured without a large and combined effort by United States air and ground combat forces.
 
Powell's Diminished Role
 One official, describing the White House reaction to General Powell's report, said it was deemed the "wrong answer" because of its insistance that major ground combat forces would have to be committed. As a consequence, a subcommittee of the deputies has been meeting under National Security Council supervision since mid-December to consider and refine military and covert action options for Iraq, officials said.
 General Powell's contribution to the continued policy discussion appears to have been diminished since the planning meetings have been pulled into the White House. But a one-star general from the Joint Chiefs of Staff attends each meeting, an Administration official said.
 Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, has argued that the use of American air power to support rebel Iraqi military units could have the decisive effect of breaking the back of Mr. Hussein's core security force in Baghdad, an allied official said.
 Saudi officials are said to have argued that ground combat forces are not needed to bring down Mr. Hussein if an effective guerrilla force can be armed and supported with allied air strikes against Iraq's top military units.
 
Chemical-Arms Training
 To some officials in the Administration, the risks of such a major operation outweigh the benefits. If United States military forces got bogged down in an Iraqi civil war, it would seriously tarnish the image the military achieved in the Persian Gulf war.
 There are other unknowns. A senior American analyst said last week that Mr. Hussein's military forces continue to train on equipment that is associated with chemical warfare, indicating that a final showdown with Mr. Hussein might include the use of chemical weapons.
 Yet some officials say Mr. Hussein is near the end of his tether and that his rule could shatter under greater pressure.
 The Central Intelligence Agency, which had predicted that Mr. Hussein would not complete 1991 in office, today declines to estimate how long he can survive.
 
Effects of U.N. Sanctions
 There are several reasons for presuming he cannot survive indefinitely.
 Iraq has been denied virtally all of its national income by United Nations sanctions for more than 18 months and continues to refuse to sell limited quantities of crude under United Nations supervision.
 Iraqi Government expenditures indicate that its reserves are no longer adequate to supply more than essentials, like food and medicine, to military forces and key leadership groups. The rest of the country gets subsistance rations.
 Though the Sunni Muslim core of the Iraqi leadership rallied to Mr. Hussein in March when minority Kurds and southern Shiites launched twin uprisings, that support is now fraying, senior American analysts say, as Mr. Hussein has reneged on pledges to undertake democratic reforms, purged possible rivals from his Cabinet and shown indifference to the human suffering of millions of Iraqis.

HEADLINE: A Worthy War

BYLINE: By Stephen J. Solarz; Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of New
York, is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The historical revisionists are already at work. Last year's triumph in the war against Iraq, they claim, has turned to ashes. We won the war only to lose the peace. But the naysayers who make this argument too cavalierly dismiss the strategic and diplomatic benefits produced by Operation Desert Storm.
 To be sure, the fact that Saddam Hussein remains in power is deeply disturbing. But this hardly constitutes an argument against the war, particularly since he would still be comfortably ensconced in Iraq and Kuwait if we had not moved against him. 
Perhaps the war's most significant achievement has been the extent to which we have substantially set back Iraq's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons. We now know that Iraq was far closer to developing them than was believed a year ago. Had we not been willing to use force, Saddam Hussein would undoubtedly have obtained a nuclear arsenal, with grave consequences for the region and the world.
 But there were other benefits as well. By liberating Kuwait from the clutches of a Mesopotamian megalomaniac, we prevented Saddam Hussein from getting his hands on the economic jugular of the world. We demonstrated that powerful countries will no longer be permitted to take over weaker ones. And we opened the way for a Middle East peace process that has made it possible, for the first time in over 40 years, for Israel to negotiate directly with its Arab neighbors.
 It is worth considering what the consequences would have been had we not been willing to use military power against Iraq. Based on Mr. Hussein's willingness to use other weapons of mass destruction, there is every reason to believe that, once he acquired nuclear weapons, he would have used them as well.
 Moreover, after absorbing Kuwait, Mr. Hussein would have been in a position to dominate the entire Persian Gulf. At best, to prevent the other gulf dominoes from falling, we would have been obliged to maintain tens of thousands of American troops indefinitely in the culturally and climatically inhospitable Arabian Peninsula.
 Furthermore, there would have been no peace process between Israel and the Arabs. The stability of the Arab countries willing to join us in opposing Iraq would have been badly shaken. And the stage would have been set for additional campaigns of conquest, in which the number of casualties inflicted by a nuclear-armed Iraq would have been infinitely greater than the number of those killed last year.
 While reasonable people disagreed about whether sanctions would be sufficient to force Mr. Hussein out of Kuwait, it seems clear in retrospect that economic pressure alone would not have done the job. Even now, after we have destroyed much of his military machine and economic infrastructure, and with sanctions still in place, Mr. Hussein remains unregenerate and unrepentant. His refusal to comply with the cease-fire agreement is clear evidence that the continued application of sanctions would have been a formula for failure, rather than a strategy for success.
 The opponents of war also told us we would get hopelessly bogged down in a desert war with massive American casualties. Yet we won the war in six weeks, with fewer than 150 American fatalities.
 We were cautioned that the Arab masses would overthrow Arab governments courageous enough to oppose Iraq. Yet every one of our Arab partners is more stable today than if Mr. Hussein had gotten away with the annexation of Kuwait.
 We were warned that a war would divert tens of billions of dollars from pressing problems at home. Yet virtually the entire cost of the war was paid by our coalition partners and other friendly countries.
 We may not have accomplished everything we hoped to, but there can be little doubt that the gulf and the world are far more congenial to American interests and values than they would have been had we acquiesced in Saddam Hussein's brutal aggression against Kuwait.

Little Relief Seen for Connecticut Hotels

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE new year is not expected to bring much relief to Connecticut's beleaguered hotels. Since 1989, the industry has been battered by the loss or contraction of corporations within the state, by a general cutback in business travel, a decline in tourism and the brute force of the recession in New England.
"In most cases Connecticut hotels are doing as poorly as last year or worse," said Ronald Balmer, director of the Connecticut Hotel-Motel Association in Hartford. "They are hunkering down and cutting back. General managers are doing middle level-tasks. Some properties are closing entire floors and some are in the hands of lenders." 
 The Bank of New England had at least 10 troubled Connecticut hotels in its portfolio when it was taken over by the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group last July. Concerned that publicity would further devalue the hotels, Fleet/Norstar declined to identify them.
From the consumer's point of view, nothing has changed except that hotel rates are lower and hotel personnel more attentive. "The banks continue to operate them through management companies," Mr. Balmer said.
At the end of the third quarter of 1991 the average occupancy rate statewide was 59.2 percent, and the average daily room rent was $67.39. The Hartford region was worst, with an average occupancy of 48 percent. Fairfield County did best, with 67 percent. The break-even point is around 72 percent.
The number of hotel rooms in Connecticut has shrunk from 30,000 in 1989, when the figure included projections for new construction, to around 25,000. Mr. Balmer noted that construction was canceled, and Hartford lost 700 rooms when the Parkview Hilton was demolished in 1990 and the Summit Hotel closed in 1991.
Overbuilding in the 1980's produced an indigestible glut, and in a small state easily bypassed by travelers on the way to Massachusetts, Rhode Island or New York, competition for customers has become intense.
Spending money to make money is the catch phrase. The Hartford Sheraton and the Stamford Marriott are pouring more than $5 million each into renovating lobbies, meeting rooms, ballrooms, guest rooms and restaurants and are upgrading services to attract business. "Either you keep improving or you lose market share," said Carl Candels, director of the Hartford Hotel Association.
Brian Connelly, manager of the 400-room Sheraton, Hartford's largest hotel, predicts that the city will continue to lose hotel contracts until a site for a Hartford Convention Center is selected and a proposed 700-room hotel is built.
"We don't have enough rooms to handle regional meetings," he said. "The business has moved to Springfield, Boston and New York." The Providence Convention Center, opening in 1993, will add to the competition.
Occupancy at the Sheraton was 54 percent in 1991, and the average room rate dropped from $150 to $100. In recent weeks it has managed to lure the Hartford Graduate Center account away from the Holiday Inn, and a Pratt & Whitney group from the Radisson, both in nearby Cromwell. The 500-room Sheraton in Stamford, according to Hans Jaspers, its manager, "had a rough year." He would not disclose occupancy figures.
"One of our biggest losses was U.P.S.," he said, referring to United Parcel Service. "They took 40,000 room nights out of the city when they moved to Atlanta.".
"Stamford is a secondary market for New York," said Barbara Seiter, director of the Stamford Visitors and Convention Bureau. "Associations and companies look to us for a better price with proximity to Manhattan. Our average room rate is $70, compared to $150 and up in New York."
Stamford's largest hotel is the Marriott, with 510 rooms and seven suites. Opened in 1977 and expanded in 1986, it has fared better than the Sheraton, the Radisson Tara and the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, the city's other major hotels. Adly Kitmitto, the manager, estimates the weekday occupancy rate at around 75 percent, but weekends are slow.
Marriott's holdings in the state include full-service hotels in Trumbull, Rocky Hill and Farmington; Courtyard Inns in Windsor, Norwalk and Wallingford; Residence Inns in Shelton, Hartford, Meriden and New Haven; and a Fairfield Inn, the company's budget hotel, in Windsor Locks.
Paul Cerullo, regional director of marketing, says that the Residence and Courtyard Inns, priced below the average of $100 for the full-service hotels, are the company's fastest-growing divisions.
WHEN a hotel fails, it usually takes about 20 months for a new management company to turn it around. Early in 1991 the Ramada Inn in New Britain was taken over by the Northeast Savings Bank of Hartford. The bank hired Lodging Unlimited of Westchester, Pa., a 20-year-old management company specializing in distressed hotels, to operate the 119-room inn.
"The Ramada is in a marginal location with little hotel activity, and the recession aggravated its problems," said Michael Nocula, who was installed as manager. "We are in the final stages of a $500,000 refurbishing inside and out, and we have initiated a marketing blitz in an area covering Hartford, Waterbury, New Haven and Stamford."
Room rents were lowered from $60 to $40, but occupancy remains just above 40 percent.
The bank took over the Ramada from Donald Wallace, who bought it from his former partner, Simon Konover, chairman of Konover Associates, a West Hartford development firm. The Konover Hotel Corporation, a subsidiary, owns in various partnerships the Sheraton at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, the Mystic Hilton, the Sheraton in Norwich, the Ramadas in Hartford and Wethersfield, and The Inn (formerly Holiday Inn) in Plainville.
"We are not doing well, but we will hold on to what we have," Mr. Konover said. "There is no market for selling."
Next month a new gambling casino operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians will open in Ledyard, creating what may be a shortage of hotel rooms there. The Pequots expect daily attendance of 5,000 to 7,000 people, and Vivian Stanley of the Southeastern Connecticut Tourism District notes that "there are just 3,200 rooms in the area."
Acknowledged to be the state's premier tourist destination, the district contains Mystic Seaport, the Marinelife Aquarium, the Groton submarine base, the Coast Guard Academy, historic New London, Thames River recreational boating and now the casino. A Mystic Coast Coalition has been formed by business and civic leaders and the Pequot Indians to develop a unified marketing strategy.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 9, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 19 about hotels in Connecticut misstated Pratt & Whitney's relationship with the Radisson and Sheraton chains. James W. Walsh, a Pratt & Whitney spokesman, said his company tried to spread its business among as many hotels as possible; it has not moved its account from one to another.

HEADLINE: Odyssey Ends for 'Raft of the Medusa'

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
IN the summers of 1988 and 1989 Peggy Hill Rosenkranz halted her career in entertainment law and dabbled in producing theater in Southampton.
By 1990, theatergoers wondered what Mrs. Rosenkranz would come up with next. She had already put on a Pulitzer Prize-winning play near a pond in Agawam Park and a musical tryout at the Southampton Cultural Center. 
 What Mrs. Rosenkranz came up with was a tough play involving a support group for people with AIDS. It represented a cross-section of New York City, with white, black, Hispanic, gay, straight, bisexual, married, single, blue-collar and professional members.
 
Cast of Encounter Session
 The play was "Raft of the Medusa" by Joe Pintauro, a well-known playwright from the East End. The title is taken from the painting by Theodore Gericault that hangs in the Louvre. Its vision of shipwreck survivors provides a multilevel metaphor for the play's concerns.
A teen-age girl, a well-known actor and a hearing- and speech-impaired homeless woman on drugs are among those in an encounter session. Other characters include the ghost of an AIDS casualty who was a rabbinical student and a therapist who is modeled after John Haigney, head of the Long Island Association for AIDS Care.
"As soon as I read the script," Mrs. Rosenkranz recalled, "I was so moved and affected that I felt it was important that it have an effect on people. I realized this would be my third production."
But there was a hitch. "This was not a play for a summer weekend in Southampton," she said. "It had to be produced in New York."
But a play that was presumed unlikely by its producer and playwright for a summer weekend in the Hamptons and that garnered respectable reviews and wide press comment failed to adapt to the winter season in New York and closed last Sunday.
At a closing-night gathering in Mrs. Rosenkranz's apartment on Park Avenue, the guests, among them the playwright, his agent, cast members, the casting director, the press agent and the ushers, were, as Mr. Pintauro put it, "trying to figure it all out."
 
Sorting Out Reactions
 "Theories are floating around, and I don't know which I subscribe to," Mrs. Rosenkranz said. In conversations, the producer and writer repeatedly heard acknowledgments like, "Thank you for the opportunity," and, "I'm very proud to have worked on this play.' "
The guests' reactions to the closing included "sort of surprising" and "incomprehensible, shocking and traumatic." Theories for the closing encompassed resistance to the subject and bad timing. January is an off month in the theater.
There also were unanswerable questions, including, "Did the Magic Johnson publicity go against us?" and, "Are people feeling too vulnerable, too threatened?"
Some guests commented on the failure of gay organizations to respond to offers of discounts and free tickets. Mr. Pintauro said one inevitable reason was that "people were not buying tickets."
"It's all about money," he said.
"If the economics were such that we could have run 8 to 10 weeks without suffering devastating losses," Mrs. Rosenkranz said, "the play ultimately would have found an audience through word of mouth.
"But if you sink, you sink fast. You may expect to lose a lot the first week, but you hope to build up to break even, which would have been $40,000 a week, by the time the reserve was used up.
"But we never grew, and the losses were massive, over $30,000 a week. With a maximum gross of $88,000 a week, we started at $6,000 and never did more than $12,000."
To keep the show going, in its final week Mrs. Rosenkranz contributed an additional $10,000. "If we had just gotten in the ballpark of taking in $26,000 or $28,000," she said, "we could have tried to raise additional money. But we stayed at a low level."
"Raft" opened at the Minetta Lane Theater in Greenwich Village on Dec. 17. It closed after 9 previews and 30 performances.
Mr. Pintauro wrote "Raft" in his Victorian house on John Street in Sag Harbor. "It was as if it had touched an uncertain nerve and released a lot of the pent-up emotions that everybody has been sitting with," he said.
The play, he added, intends to confront "the monumentality of the catastrophe and the suffocating silence of helplessness, the experience of the horror of facing grief and anger, instead of cowering in fear, and then saying, 'Let's go on with honor.' "
Explaining her motivation to produce the play, Mrs. Rosenkranz said: "I had all the information and I had all the contacts. And I said, 'I'm the only one who can produce this and if I don't, it will never be produced.'
"I didn't know how to do it. So I learned how to do it, everything connected with producing commercially in New York City. But everyone told me, 'You have no idea how difficult it is to produce Off Broadway to begin with. You have no star. And this is a serious topic that's going to be a turnoff.'
"All theaters were putting us at the bottom of the list. Everything was difficult. Not a step along the way was easy. So I guess I had the passion and the tenacity."
Mrs. Rosenkranz spent most of the summer of 1990 in TriBeCa, where in mid-July she presented 15 showcase performances of "Raft" at the Home for Contemporary Theater and Art. "By the third week," she said, "people were lined up in the streets, unable to get in."
Swept away by the play's theatrical power, social significance, turnaway crowds and what Mr. Pintauro called "explosive, immense" audience reactions, Mrs. Rosenkranz was determined to take "Raft" to Off Broadway.
She turned into a commercial producer for real, hiring other lawyers to draw up a limited partnership and negotiate options; interviewing managers, press agents, representatives of advertising agencies and casting directors; searching for a theater and luring investors, 12 in all, none of them friends from Southampton.
Finally, $400,000, the cost of the Off Broadway production, was raised, in contrast to the $7,000 cost of what Mrs. Rosenkranz called the "showcase on a shoestring."
For 20 years, Mrs. Rosenkranz has been spending summers in Southampton with her husband, Robert, an investment banker. They have a son, Nicholas, 21 years old, who was assistant director of Mr. Pintauro's play, and a daughter, Stephanie, 17. The family has owned a home on South Main Street for nine years.
Mrs. Rosenkranz earned a degree from the Columbia University Law School and studied acting at the Herbert Berghof studio in Manhattan. Although she has practiced corporate law and worked on criminal cases in the State Court of Appeals, it was through entertainment law that she balanced her practical and theatrical inclinations.
"You do a contract," she said, "and then you go to the opening night, which is much more interesting than negotiating for a shopping mall."
Although the reviews were mixed at best and Mr. Pintauro's writing was generally criticized as pat, overwrought and manipulative, enough strong adjectives, mostly "powerful," were extracted for advertising, even from negative notices. In The New York Times, Mel Gussow described the play as a "microcosmic crisis clinic, airing aspects of a tragedy and entreating the audience into an act of empathy."
Mr. Pintauro, a priest who turned to writing advertising copy and then poetry, novels and plays, bought a house in North Haven in 1960 for $9,000. Ten years later, after publishing several volumes of poetry, he purchased his current home, with a carriage house next to it, for "much more," he said.
Although many Off Broadway theaters have performed his plays, Mr. Pintauro is associated with the Circle Repertory as a company playwright, which means that his works are developed in a laboratory series. The theater presented his "Snow Orchid," with Peter Boyle and Olympia Dukakis, in 1982, and "Beside Herself," with William Hurt, in 1989.
"Wild Blue," eight one-acters by Mr. Pintauro that were seen in New York in 1987, opened in San Francisco the night before "Raft" closed. His unfinished "The Dead Boy" was recently read at the Royal Court In London. It is "just as startling and controversial" as "Raft," Mr. Pintauro said, adding that it was about a sex scandal involving a priest and a boy.
Referring to those who react to AIDS with apathy, as with people being locked in a refrigerator, Mr. Pintauro said "Raft" was "a cannon blast at that refrigerator door."
As to whether Mrs. Rosenkranz will again risk commercial producing, she said: "I think so. It's not possible to put this much effort into a project and just give up. People tell me it was not a failure. And now I have the skill."

Despite the Doldrums, Downtown Bustles

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
WHILE construction of new office buildings approaches a standstill in this city's downtown, the center city remains abuzz with new public works and developer-government collaborations.
Among projects in contruction or planning are a subway system and stations, a concert hall, a convention center, museums and public amenities. Planning for most of them has been going on for years and their arrival seems unrelated to the current softness in the real estate market. 
 "Just because office space is overbuilt does not mean that nothing else needs to happen," said a developer, Michael Barker, co-managing partner of Barker Patrinely Group of Houston. "As the space that is now vacant fills up, more people are going to come downtown to work and live."
He plans to start construction next fall on two office buildings -- one of them for the municipal government -- totaling 858,000 square feet, a 426-room hotel, 326 residential units and a 100,000-square-foot Japanese American National Museum on land leased from the city in the Little Tokyo district.
Both the overbuilt office market and the publicly sponsored projects can be traced to the same source: a continuing effort by local government to turn a formerly drab area into what one official describes as "a world-class, 24-hour city." This has been a pet project of Mayor Tom Bradley, abetted by the powerful Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency, which oversees central city.
One of the most flamboyant efforts is the planned $110 million Walt Disney Concert Hall on a site owned by Los Angeles County, near the existing Los Angeles Music Center. Construction of the 2,450-seat concert hall, to be the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, was spearheaded by a $50 million contribution by Lillian Disney, widow of Walt Disney; promoters are soliciting private contributions to make up the rest.
The sculptural design by Frank O. Gehry, the Santa Monica architect, has won high praise from architectural critics. The project was recently approved by the Los Angeles City Council and construction is expected to start in the fall.
Another high-profile effort is the $14 million facelift of downtown's oldest park, Pershing Square. The 7.5-acre plaza is an eyesore of cracked concrete that has rankled the owners of surrounding office buildings.
The proposed redesign by the Mexican architect Ricardo Legoretta and the landscape architect Laurie Olin of Philadelphia promises a fountain with a 120-foot obelisk, a performance stage and ample planting for a park now occupied by transients and drug dealers. Work is to start next month.
In a novel arrangement, surrounding building owners will pay for $8 million of the costs through an elective tax district; the redevelopment agency is contributing the rest. The project won approval this month.
Another visible symbol of government-sponsored construction downtown is the million-square-foot expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center. The drum-shaped building was designed by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners of New York.
The $300 million project, which has spurred the construction of 1,500 new hotel rooms, is currently under construction, with completion expected in 1993.
Most ambitious, however, is the intent to re-establish downtown as the linchpin in a regional rail system. The first leg of the Metro Rail subway system is due in June 1993. Three new commuter lines to the suburbs start operating in the fall.
"This is the renaissance of downtown as a transportation hub," said Elizabeth Harrison, vice president of Catellus Development Corporation. The company, formerly known as Santa Fe Pacific Realty, plans to renovate Union Station and to start construction later this year on a 500,000-square-foot building to be occupied entirely by the offices of the Regional Transportation District, a local transit authority.
DESPITE all these projects, downtown Los Angeles still appears unfinished to some urban planners, who have criticized the city for being "unfriendly" to pedestrians. The newer sections of the financial district are dominated by high-rise buildings, set back from the street and surrounded by empty plazas. One local architect has described the area scornfully as "a 1960's-style downtown built in the 1980's."
Downtown needs "connections" to link business, government, industrial and residential areas, said Rob Maguire 3d, co-managing partner of Maguire Thomas Partners, the most active office developer in the area. "You really need to get a pedestrian network of urban spaces," he said.
Maguire Thomas Partners recently contributed one such connection to the city: an outdoor stairway at the base of its 73-story First Interstate World Center. The steps offer a rare pedestrian link between Bunker Hill and the rest of downtown.
A few blocks away, city officials plan another such link: the reconstruction of a turn-of-the-century funicular railroad called Angel's Flight to carry passengers 70 vertical feet between Bunker Hill and lower-level streets. The officials would like to start the reconstruction by mid-year.
Pedestrian activity has also become a goal for the redevelopment agency, which did much in the 1960's and '70's to promote high-rise development in the area.
One attempt is to build wide sidewalks and plant trees on Hope Street, and remake it as a pedestrian corridor traversing the financial district and ending at the Los Angeles Central Library. The pyramidal building, designed by Bertram Goodhue in 1930, is undergoing a $154 million renovation and expansion.
Construction of the pedestrian corridor is to start next month and be paid for by the redevelopment agency.
Developers and leasing agents are sober but not sour about the office market. Vacancy rates were 25 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Cushman & Wakefield of California. Much of that vacancy represents nearly 7 million square feet of space completed last year or expected in 1992, inundating a market of about 26 million square feet.
Despite poor publicity about commercial real estate, tenants surprised observers by absorbing 1.5 million square feet last year downtown, where absorption of 1 million square feet is considered successful.
Robert A. Ortiz, executive vice president of Cushman Realty Corporation, attributed the brisk leasing to an influx of law firms, international banks and Asian trading companies. Still, landlords have deeply discounted their rents to $24 to $27 in new buildings, almost as low as suburban rates, which run around $23 to $25. Downtown rents peaked in the early 1980's in the high-$30 range.
Although many of the current rents fall beneath the "pro formas" that developers and their lenders originally envisioned for this city's newest crop of buildings, "landlords must sign those deals anyway," Mr. Maguire, the developer, said.
Some naysayers appear ready to consign downtown to the same limbo of perpetual softness where Houston, Denver and Phoenix already dwell. But Mr. Maguire dismissed comparisons. "You don't have the problems of regional overbuilding, as do those cities," he said.
He observed that other office markets in Los Angeles County, including those in Santa Monica and Burbank, are restricted by lack of land, by no-growth zoning or by balky local governments. In the future, tenants requiring several floors may have to settle in downtown Los Angeles.
The "one positive note" about the current soft market, Mr. Maguire says, is that there is "absolutely" no financing available for speculative projects, and possibly none even for those with significant pre-leasing.
"EVERYBODY has been battered so hard that lenders are going back to prudent underwriting standards," and allow the tenants to catch up with the rising flood of space, Mr. Maguire said.
Notwithstanding the high vacancy rates, the recent spate of office construction has brought some new interest to a formerly undistinguished skyline.
Among the recent buildings are 777 Tower by Cesar Pelli of New Haven; First Interstate World Center by Pei Cobb Freed; Sanwa Bank Plaza by Albert C. Martin & Associates of Los Angeles; 550 South Hope by Kohn Pedersen Fox of New York, the 801 Tower by The Architects Collaborative of Cambridge, Mass., and the Gas Company Tower by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

Despite Doldrums, Downtown Los Angeles Bustles

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
While construction of new office buildings approaches a standstill in this city's downtown, the center city remains abuzz with new public works and developer-government collaborations.
Among projects in contruction or planning are a subway system and stations, a concert hall, a convention center, museums and public amenities. 
 Planning for most of the projects has been going on for years and their arrival seems unrelated to the current softness in the real estate market.
"Just because office space is overbuilt does not mean that nothing else needs to happen," said a developer, Michael Barker, co-managing partner of Barker Patrinely Group of Houston. "As the space that is now vacant fills up, more people are going to come downtown to work and live."
He plans to start construction next fall on two office buildings -- one of them for the municipal government -- totaling 858,000 square feet, a 426-room hotel, 326 residential units and a 100,000-square-foot Japanese American National Museum on land leased from the city in the Little Tokyo district.
Both the overbuilt office market and the publicly sponsored projects can be traced to the same source: a continuing effort by local government to turn a formerly drab area into what one official describes as "a world-class, 24-hour city." This has been a pet project of Mayor Tom Bradley, abetted by the powerful Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency, which oversees all development in the central city.
One of the most flamboyant efforts is the planned $110 million Walt Disney Concert Hall on a site owned by Los Angeles County, near the existing Los Angeles Music Center. Construction of the 2,450-seat concert hall, to be the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, was spearheaded by a $50 million contribution by Lillian Disney, widow of Walt Disney; promoters are soliciting private contributions to make up the rest.
The sculptural design by Frank O. Gehry, the Santa Monica architect, has won high praise from architectural critics. The project was recently approved by the Los Angeles City Council and construction is expected to start in the fall.
Another high-profile effort is the $14 million facelift of downtown's oldest park, Pershing Square, a 7.5-acre eyesore plaza of cracked concrete that has rankled the owners of surrounding office buildings. The proposed redesign by the Mexican architect Ricardo Legoretta and the landscape architect Laurie Olin of Philadelphia promises to bring a fountain with a 120-foot obelisk, a performance stage and ample planting to a park now occupied by transients and drug dealers. Work is to start next month.
In a novel arrangement, surrounding building owners will pay for $8 million of the costs through an elective tax district; the redevelopment agency is contributing the rest. The project won approval this month.
Another visible symbol of government-sponsored construction downtown is the million-square-foot expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center, a drum-shaped building designed by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners of New York. The $300 million project, which has spurred the construction of 1,500 new hotel rooms, is under construction, with completion expected in 1993.
Most ambitious, however, is the intent to re-establish downtown as the linchpin in a regional rail system. The first leg of the Metro Rail subway system is due in June 1993. Three new commuter lines to the suburbs start operating in the fall.
"This is the renaissance of downtown as a transportation hub," said Elizabeth Harrison, vice president of Catellus Development Corporation.
The company, formerly known as Santa Fe Pacific Realty, plans to renovate Union Station and to start construction later this year on a 500,000-square-foot building to be occupied entirely by the offices of the Regional Transportation District, a local transit authority.
Despite all these projects, downtown Los Angeles still appears unfinished to some urban planners, who have criticized the city for being "unfriendly" to pedestrians. The newer sections of the financial district are dominated by high-rise buildings, set back from the street and surrounded by empty plazas. One local architect has described the area scornfully as "a 1960's-style downtown built in the 1980's."
Downtown needs "connections" to link business, government, industrial and residential areas, said Rob Maguire 3d, co-managing partner of Maguire Thomas Partners, the most active office developer in the area. "You really need to get a pedestrian network of urban spaces," he said.
Maguire Thomas Partners recently contributed one such connection to the city: an outdoor stairway at the base of its 73-story First Interstate World Center. The steps offer a rare pedestrian link between Bunker Hill and the rest of downtown.
A few blocks away, city officials plan another such link: the reconstruction of a turn-of-the-century funicular railroad called Angel's Flight to carry passengers 70 vertical feet between Bunker Hill and lower-level streets. The officials would like to start the reconstruction by mid-year.
Pedestrian activity has also become a goal for the redevelopment agency, which did much in the 1960's and '70's to promote high-rise development in the area.
One attempt is to build wide sidewalks and plant trees on Hope Street, and remake the street as a pedestrian corridor traversing the financial district and ending at the Los Angeles Central Library. The pyramidal building, designed by Bertram Goodhue in 1930, is undergoing a $154 million renovation and expansion.
Construction of the pedestrian corridor is to start next month and be paid for by the redevelopment agency.
Developers and leasing agents are sober but not sour about the office market. Vacancy rates were 25 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Cushman & Wakefield of California. Much of that vacancy represents nearly 7 million square feet of space completed last year or expected in 1992, inundating a market of about 26 million square feet.
Despite poor publicity about commercial real estate, tenants surprised observers by absorbing 1.5 million square feet last year downtown, where absorption of 1 million square feet is considered successful.
Robert A. Ortiz, executive vice president of Cushman Realty Corporation, attributed the brisk leasing to an influx of law firms, international banks and Asian trading companies. Still, landlords have deeply discounted their rents to $24 to $27 in new buildings, almost as low as suburban rates, which run around $23 to $25. Downtown rents peaked in the early 1980's in the high-$30 range.
Although many of the current rents fall beneath the "pro formas" that developers and their lenders originally envisioned for this city's newest crop of buildings, "landlords must sign those deals anyway," Mr. Maguire, the developer, said.
Some naysayers appear ready to consign downtown to the same limbo of perpetual softness where Houston, Denver and Phoenix already dwell. But Mr. Maguire dismissed comparisons between Los Angeles and those cities. "You don't have the problems of regional overbuilding, as do those cities," he said.
He observed that other office markets in Los Angeles County, including those in Santa Monica and Burbank, are restricted by lack of land, by no-growth zoning or by balky local governments. In the future, tenants requiring several floors may have to settle in downtown Los Angeles.
The "one positive note" about the current soft market, Mr. Maguire says, is that there is "absolutely" no financing available for speculative projects, and possibly none even for those with significant pre-leasing.
"Everybody has been battered so hard that lenders are going back to prudent underwriting standards," and allow the tenants to catch up with the rising flood of space, Mr. Maguire said.
Notwithstanding the high vacancy rates, the recent spate of office construction has brought some new interest to a formerly undistinguished skyline.
Among the recent buildings are 777 Tower by Cesar Pelli of New Haven; First Interstate World Center by Pei Cobb Freed; Sanwa Bank Plaza by Albert C. Martin & Associates of Los Angeles; 550 South Hope by Kohn Pedersen Fox of New York, the 801 Tower by The Architects Collaborative of Cambridge, Mass., and the Gas Company Tower by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

HEADLINE: ENVIRONMENT LAWS FACE A STIFF TEST FROM LANDOWNERS

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Angry about regulations that control the use of their land, mining and timber companies, developers, farmers and other rural landowners have organized a movement that represents the strongest challenge to date to the nation's principal environmental laws.
In the most successful tactic they have discovered so far, the movement's lawyers have been filing lawsuits for the last two years in a little-known Federal court in Washington, the United States Claims Court. Arguing that the rapid increase of environmental regulations in the last 20 years has restricted their right to use their own property, the landowners say such restrictions are tantamount to a "taking" of land. They argue that just like landowners whose property is seized for roads, bridges, parks or other public purposes, they are entitled to just compensation as provided by the Fifth Amendment.
 
Backing in Congress
 The Supreme Court is considering one such case from South Carolina, and a proposal to require the Government to compensate landowners affected by environmental regulations was approved by the Senate last summer and is pending in the House. That proposal has vigorous support in the White House, which has also proposed legislation to make Federal agencies pay judgments in such cases from their own budgets, making officials accountable for the effect of the regulations. 
 The nation's troubled economy and broad job losses across rural America in the timber industry, mining and agriculture are souring the mood for environmental restrictions and adding fuel to the movement behind the lawsuits.
"Congress never envisioned that the Endangered Species Act would be used by the preservationists to eliminate jobs and people's homes, and push people around the way it has," said Charles Cushman, the executive director of the National Inholders Association, a group based in Battle Ground, Wash., that represents owners of private property in Federal parks and preserves.
 
Raising Cost of Enforcement
 David Howard, a resident of Bleecker, N.Y., who is chairman of the Alliance for America, a national coalition of property owner groups in 44 states, agreed. "What you're seeing is people all over the country that are reaching the point of desperation," he said. "The Government issues more and more regulations, and we're losing local control over our land."
But environmental leaders say the lawsuits could cripple the Government's ability to enforce its basic environmental laws by making them too expensive to enforce. They say the real intention of the movement is to eliminate three decades of environmental protections that are broadly supported by the American public.
"For those of us who are deeply interested in preserving open spaces, this idea of compensation could be ruinous," said Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "The courts appear to be whittling away at the existing structure of environmental protections, and there is a noticeable change in sentiment about environmental safeguards here in the Senate."
The idea of compensating property owners for losses caused by environmental restrictions was developed in 1985 by Richard A. Epstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago who wrote "Takings, Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain" (Harvard University Press, 1985). In 1988 President Ronald Reagan signed an executive order based on the book that required agencies to review regulations for their effects on private property.
But environmental lawyers say such a legal strategy has been used before in efforts to thwart social changes. Southern slave owners in the 19th century, for example, argued that the Fifth Amendment protected them from demands to free their slaves, and similar arguments were made in the 1930's by industry groups seeking to set aside minimum wage laws, occupational health statutes and child labor laws.
"Historically, claims that the right to property existed in the Constitution have been used to try and prevent a whole panoply of social reforms and health laws," said Albert H. Meyerhoff, senior lawyer in San Francisco for the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the country's most influential environmental groups. "What's different now is there is an emergence of a new interpretation of property rights law. It presents an extremely serious threat to much of the environmental reform legislation that has been enacted over the last 30 years."
 
Movement Gains Influence
 Indeed, to an extent that has dismayed environmental advocates, the attack on government regulations is gaining influence in the White House, Congress and the courts.
Legislation to give the Attorney General new authority to review and veto Federal regulations for their effect on property rights passed the Senate last summer and is pending in the House.
Representative Jimmy Hayes, Democrat of Louisiana, gained 170 co-sponsors in the House for another proposal to allow all but the most ecologically valuable wetlands to be developed and require the Government to compensate owners prevented from using their land.
"What's driving it is the utter comtempt people now have for the arrogance the Government and the major environmental groups exhibit when it comes to protecting land," Mr. Hayes said. "If they don't believe this issue is red-hot everywhere, tell them to hold a meeting in any town in America."
 
'All the Elements in Place'
 Environmental lawyers who have monitored the movement said they agreed with Mr. Hayes that the movement was widespread. "What we have now are all the elements in place for a major change in how the Government applies its environmental laws," said Erik J. Meyers, general counsel of the Environmental Law Institute in Washington.
That is especially true in an array of legal cases making their way through the Federal courts, and the Supreme Court will consider several such cases this year. By far the most widely watched case will test South Carolina's authority to protect sensitive beaches on barrier islands from development against a property owner's right to seek compensation for two seaside lots he purchased for nearly $1 million but was not allowed to develop.
Legal experts, though, said the case might not produce a precedent because the property owner, David H. Lucas, had not yet exhausted all his legal remedies.
Far more important to the development of new interpretations of property rights law, say lawyers in the field, may be decisions this year from the Claims Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
 
Most Cases in Decade
 The Claims Court clerk said 52 cases involving allegations of the taking of property were filed last year, the most in at least a decade. The nearly 200 property-taking lawsuits pending in the Claims Court include cases in which property owners challenged the Government's authority to clean up toxic wastes, regulate grazing and water rights, buy land for national parks, restrict mining in wild areas and set aside private land to protect wetlands.
The Claims Court, which was set up specifically to consider such property cases not involving injury claims, and the appellate court are dominated by conservative judges appointed in the last 11 years. In recent months they have ruled that landowners affected by environmental regulations are entitled to compensation.
Late last year, in the largest judgment of its kind, the Government was directed by the two courts to pay a coal company in Wyoming more than $150 million because the Department of Interior barred mining in a protected area. The company, Whitney Benefits, argued in the Claims Court that its coal holdings had been rendered worthless by the restriction. The ruling, upheld by the appellate court, was the strongest legal challenge ever to the Interior Department's authority to regulate strip mining.
The Government appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, but in a telling indication of the direction the newly conservative Court may take, the Court declined to take up the case, allowing the ruling to stand.
The Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit is also considering two decisions by Loren A. Smith, the Chief Judge of the Claims Court, who was appointed in 1985 by President Reagan. In 1990, Judge Smith ruled that a New Jersey developer and a Florida limestone company were owed millions of dollars by the Government because the Army Corps of Engineers refused them permits to destroy wetlands.
In the first case, Loveladies Harbor Inc., a development company in Long Beach, N.J., was barred in 1982 by the Corps of Engineers from building houses on 12.5 acres of wetland. The wetland was the last undeveloped portion of a 250-acre parcel the company bought in 1956 for $300,000. Judge Smith awarded the company $2.68 million plus interest from 1982 because he viewed the restrictions as a taking of private property.
In the second case, Florida Rock Industries was prevented from mining limestone on 98 of 1,560 acres west of Miami that it had purchased in 1972. In 1980, the Corps of Engineers ordered the company to stop mining because of concern that the activity would pollute ground water. Judge Smith said evidence presented by the company indicated that mining would not pollute water and awarded the company slightly more than $1 million plus interest for the 98 acres.
Both judgments were appealed by the Justice Department, which argued that neither company was eligible for compensation because the regulatory actions were legal and served a public purpose by safeguarding valuable natural resources. In an interview, Barry M. Hartman, the Acting Assistant Attorney General who heads the Environment and Natural Resources Division, criticized Judge Smith and other Claims Court judges for departing from Supreme Court precedents.
Mr. Hartman said that in the Loveladies Harbor and the Florida Rock cases, Judge Smith ruled that a taking of property had occurred even though the Government's action had only partly diminished the land's value. He said the Justice Department was concerned about the rulings because of the growing cost of claims and the potential for even larger judgments.
In an interview, Judge Smith defended his decisions and said he was not interested in establishing new law. "As trial judges, we try to follow the law as laid down by the Supreme Court and by the Federal Circuit," said Judge Smith, who was a member of President Reagan's transition team in 1981. "I call them as I see them. It may produce a result that some don't like, but I'm not a zealot."

HEADLINE: Aristide Insists on Overhaul of the Haitian Army

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, whose elected Government was overthrown in a coup on Sept. 30, insisted today that there could be no settlement of the Haitian political crisis without the removal of the army chief and a thorough reorganization of the military.
President Aristide, a populist priest who won Haiti's first genuinely democratic election 13 months ago with more than two-thirds of the vote, was also guarded in accepting the view of the Organization of American States that naming a new Prime Minister would constitute a political solution to the Haitian crisis. 
 Any immediate changes in the status of the army and its chief, Gen. Raoul Cedras, are not part of that political agreement. General Cedras, who said that the President was ousted because he had become a threat to democracy, apparently raised no objections to the O.A.S. political formula that would allow Father Aristide to return.
Today, President Aristide said in an interview that General Cedras had the choice of going to jail or leaving the country before democracy could be restored. But he said ordinary soldiers would be granted amnesty. He accused the military of narcotics trafficking and corruption and called the general and his associates killers responsible for 1,500 to 2,000 deaths and the forced exile of 10,000 political refugees.
"I repeat, political refugees," he said, emphasizing that he rejected the view of United States officials that many Haitians flee for economic reasons.
Diplomats close to the negotiations with President Aristide say that army leaders do not disagree fundamentally that the modernization of the armed forces is important. They would ultimately also accept the creation of a separate unpoliticized police force, which President Aristide is demanding, the diplomats say.
This would take considerable time, they said. Insistence on restructuring the military at the same time that the Aristide Government is restored could prevent a quick settlement.
On Jan. 8, the O.A.S. announced that all parties including President Aristide had accepted Rene Theodore as a new Prime Pinister. Like the President, Mr. Theodore, the leader of the Haitian Communist Party, spent years in exile during the regimes of Francois Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude. American diplomats regard Mr. Theodore as a moderate willing to embrace democracy and a free-market economy. His selection is subject to ratification by the Haitian Parliament.
Today, in an interview in Washington, where he is waiting to meet with Mr. Theodore and a parliamentary delegation, President Aristide said he was not in a position to accept Mr. Theodore as Prime Minister until the two could discuss a future government.
"I have met him only four times in my life, and spoken to him once on the telephone," said President Aristide, speaking in English.
While awaiting Mr. Theodore, who has delayed his trip to Washington for further discussions in Haiti, the exiled President has met with the O.A.S. Secretary General, Joao Clementa Baena Soares, and other officials.
President Aristide, who has been living in Caracas, Venezuela, since the Sept. 30 coup, sidestepped a question about which Americans he hoped to see on his visit here. Many of his supporters are critical of the United States, saying it could be more active in punishing the coup leaders, some of whom are reported to have American bank accounts and visas that allow them to visit this country frequently.
President Aristide would say only that many Haitians would like the United States to tighten its economic embargo on Haiti so that the military would feel the pinch more. But he praised President Bush and his Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, for supporting economic sanctions and his return from exile.
President Aristide said today that despite his misgivings about the military, he remained confident that in "only a few days" there could be a political agreement to clear the way for his return.

HEADLINE: Despite Polls, Mulroney Bid Seems Likely

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has turned setback into advantage before. In 1984, when he first sought to become Prime Minister of Canada, his Progressive Conservative Party was 14 percentage points behind the Liberals in opinion polls. In 1988, six months before his second-term victory, the Tories were 25 points behind.
Canada's next elections are not likely before the fall of 1993. Still, the Tories today are supported by only 16 percent of those surveyed, the lowest voter-approval rating for any governing party in this country. 
 Although Mr. Mulroney's public standing is in tatters, reflecting severe economic reverses and sharp divisions over a strategy for keeping Canada together, the longest-serving Conservative Prime Minister in this century seems determined to seek a third term. A recent shake-up of his Ottawa office, including the appointment of a new chief of staff, an ebullient former advertising man named Hugh Segal, who is well grounded in the party's grass roots, has reinforced this expectation.
Mr. Segal a bluff, witty man who calls himself a "Red Tory" -- roughly equivalent to a moderate Republican in the United States -- has a resume indicating electoral success: He helped a former Premier of Ontario, Bill Davis, win three straight election victories in that province. In a recent interview, Mr. Segal, who is 41 years old, spoke of helping the country get a "glimpse of the Prime Minister's soul and what he genuinely believes in" as the way to build support.
 
Naming New Advisers
 In trying to brush up his image, Mr. Mulroney has tapped other new sources of advice: younger Conservative loyalists, a former Foreign Service officer and a former top Montreal journalist. He is making these unorthodox moves when even the most ardent and optimistic Tories are hard put to find reasons for optimism.
A recent cartoon in The Globe & Mail of Toronto showed a monk at a miracle-monitoring center reading a headline saying "New Chief of Staff Hopes to Restore Mulroney's Popularity" and then urging a fellow monk to "Keep an eye on this one."
Hardly a day goes by without some news of layoffs as the country staggers through one of the deepest recessions in its history. More than 10 percent of the national work force remains unemployed. An economic recovery, which started the middle of 1991, has stalled, according to latest government statistics, largely reflecting conditions in the United States. About 80 percent of Canada's exports and 1.5 million Canadian jobs depend on the American market.
The Government has also had little success in reaching a national consensus on the constitutional changes needed to keep French-speaking Quebec from voting itself out of Canada.
 
Image of Disarray
 Last month an influential Quebec senator, Claude Castonguay, abruptly resigned as co-leader of a Parliament committee examining constitutional proposals. He gave ill health as the reason, but his departure reinforced a public impression of governmental disarray. Adding to this sense of floundering is widely reported in-fighting between the Constitutional Affairs Minister, Joe Clark, a former Canadian Prime Minister, and other top advisers to Mr. Mulroney.
Mr. Mulroney, who is 52, does have the advantage of time, at least 18 months, before he has to face the electorate. He is counting on the economy turning up well before then, presumably putting voters in a better frame of mind. His hopes could be well founded. Interest rates have sharply fallen, as in the United States, and inflation is running at an annual rate of less than 2 percent. Sensing better times ahead, the Toronto Stock Exchange has been enjoying a bull market, along with stocks in New York.
And there is some optimism among international experts. The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development projects that Canada will lead the industrial world in growth this year and next and will achieve the second-lowest inflation rate, after Japan.
Mr. Mulroney is counting on credible progress in resolving the constitutional crisis. One of the points he makes is the linkage between the constitutional issues and the economy. Should the country break up, many economists believe, the economic consequences would be dire for all of Canada, and Quebec would end up the big loser.

BABY'S DEATH RAISES QUESTIONS
A 5-month-old Harlem boy who had been badly burned more than a month ago died early Friday at New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center. The case has become the focus of an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney and the New York City Medical Examiner, who said that the child was abused and that they were also looking into the possibility that mistreatment at the hospital contributed to the child's death. A spokesman from the medical examiner's office said the autopsy showed that a feeding tube had been misplaced in the boy, puncturing his heart. B3. 

AIRLINES CHALLENGE LAW ON DETAINEES
Saying they are being forced to run what amounts to private jails in airport motels, an organization representing all the major overseas air carriers plans to file a lawsuit seeking to end a policy that requires them to house foreign detainees. As a result of the policy, established by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, hundreds of aliens have been held for months at a time at the expense of the airlines that brought them here.

A MOST UNLIKELY FAMILY FILM
"Juice," the latest film to stir fears of teen-age violence at urban theaters, seems an unlikely fare for a Sunday family outing.

WHAT OBSESSES NEW YORKERS ALWAYS HAS
For nearly four centuries, New Yorkers have been obsessed by race. Ethnic and racial violence continues to strike an even more visceral chord as the threshold of indignation rises with each horrific crime. The historic resonance of these conflicts may be comforting to some people because, after all, the city survived earlier episodes when tensions brought on by the integration of ethnic groups gave way to violence.

ESCAPEE ON THE RUN
The escaped murderer who was captured at a New Jersey mall on Saturday told the police that he eluded their widespread search in Rockland County by sleeping in the woods near the center of the police activity, dropping pepper to distract police dogs and using "survivalist" techniques. The police now believe that he and another convict who escaped from a maximum-security prison in Connecticut on Dec. 31 robbed four 7-Eleven stores in Bergen County, N.J., during the 10 days they stayed at an Econo Lodge in Spring Valley, N.Y.

ANTI-GAY BIAS SEEN IN AGENT'S SLAYING
A United States Customs inspector was killed on Dec. 28 when his car was rammed and run off the road in Nassau County because his assailant believed he was gay, the police said yesterday after charging a man with manslaughter. The Nassau County Police Department has not yet officially classified the death as a bias-related homicide. But an advocate for gay and lesbian rights said that the case has all the markings of a bias homicide. "In the gay experience, this kind of harassment and violence is so common," said Matt Foreman, executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Task Force. B5.

HEADLINE: 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Harkin Assails Competition In New Hampshire Debate

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 19

 BODY:
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa attacked several of his rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination tonight in an attempt to give fresh impetus to his faltering campaign.
In a two-hour debate on WMUR, the state's only network affiliate, and on the cable network C-Span, Mr. Harkin accused Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas of imposing unfair taxes on "the little guy" and asserted that Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska had failed to protect American manufacturing jobs. New Hampshire's primary, the first in the nation, takes place Feb. 18, and all five of the principal Democratic candidates joined the debate. 
 Mr. Harkin is running fifth in the most recent poll, taken by The Boston Globe from Jan. 13 to 15 and published today. It represented more bad news for the Iowan, who has already suffered the defection of several major trade unions whose support he had sought for his liberal candidacy. Party strategists say that he must finish no worse than third to retain a realistic chance of nomination.
The Globe poll, which included 400 Democratic and independent voters who said they planned to vote in the Democratic primary, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points, the paper said.
Mr. Clinton finished first with 29 percent, with former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts second at 17 percent and Mr. Kerrey third at 16 percent. Although little known nationally, Mr. Tsongas has benefited from coming from a neighboring state. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California had 7 percent and Mr. Harkin finished last with 3 percent.
The Democratic Presidential campaign is only now getting started in earnest, however, with the candidates beginning to draw sizable crowds, and many voters remain unfamiliar with the candidates. More than one voter in four surveyed by The Globe -- 26 percent -- described himself or herself as undecided, and if past New Hampshire races are any guide, many of those who say they have made up their minds will change them before the voting takes place.
Still, Mr. Harkin clearly felt the need to make an impact tonight.
He drew attention to a sales tax increase imposed in Arkansas during Mr. Clinton's term and asked, "If that's what he has done in Arkansas, what's he going to do as President -- stick it to the little guy again?" Mr. Clinton replied with a criticism of Mr. Harkin's vote for a Senatorial raise.
 
A Problem With Names
 A bit later, the Iowan clashed with Mr. Kerrey. He misidentified the Senator from Nebraska as "Senator Kennedy," to which Mr. Kerrey responded, "that's not the only thing you're confused about." Mr. Harkin said Mr. Kerrey should have voted against extending to President Bush special "fast track" authority to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
Drawing attention to Mr. Kerrey's new television commercials here, which show him as a hockey goalie defending American jobs in trade negotiations, Mr. Harkin said, "Last summer, you let the puck go by."
All the candidates blamed President Bush for the recession that has punished New Hampshire with particular severity, and all promised vigorous remedies, inluding tax cuts of various types. Mr. Brown, for example, said he would eliminate all Federal taxes except a flat-rate tax of 13 or 14 percent for everyone with minimal deductions.
The candidates' comments on crime, which with economics and education formed the subject matter of the debate, showed the scars of 1988, when Mr. Bush used what he contended was Michael S. Dukakis's softness on crime against him. Not all of the Democrats backed capital punishment, but several did, and all were careful to call for tougher law enforcement to make the streets safe.
 
Reply From Clinton
 The moderator of the debate, Cokie Roberts, a special correspondent for ABC News and a commentator for National Public Radio, raised with Mr. Clinton the possibility that if he were the nominee the Republicans would eventually find a woman who would lend credibility to repeated charges that he had been unfaithful to his wife, Hillary. He said he had run for office 17 times in 17 years, and insisted that any lurking scandals would have surfaced during those campaigns, adding, "I think the American people are sick and tired of that kind of negative politics."
"I'm the only real Democrat in the race," Mr. Harkin said in an aggressive closing statement. His television commercials in the state have only been running since Friday, and his aides are hopeful that they, plus his debate performance, will enable him to catch his rivals.
The candidates squabbled once again over a tax cut for the middle class, with Mr. Clinton asserting that it was essential to both long- and short-term economic growth. Mr. Harkin, who argues that such proposals would provide little help to most Americans, went on the attack at that point, focusing on Mr. Clinton's record on taxes in Arkansas.
Echoing his recent advertising campaign, Mr. Clinton argued that the Washington elites were out of touch with average Americans and "just don't get it."
 
Criticism for White House
 Mr. Tsongas also criticized the idea of a tax cut for the middle class, asserting that the idea was "coming from the media consultants and the polling people." The former Senator argued that a cut in the tax on capital gains, aimed at encouraging long-term investment, was a critical way of spurring long-term economic growth.
Mr. Brown seemed to be trying to broaden his message tonight. His notion of replacing the current income tax system with a flat tax was immediately criticized by Mr. Harkin. The Iowan criticized the concept as regressive and said it sounded "like something proposed by the Flat Earth Society."
In the midst of the intramural disputes, the candidates occasionally took some shots at the White House. Mr. Clinton asserted that the nation had "for 10 long years" suffered under an Administration that refused to deal with racial divisions. "We need a President who says, 'We've got to end the politics of race in this country,' " the Governor said.
Mr. Tsongas scoffed at Mr. Bush as a President who had "spent more time talking about crime than any President in history and done less about it."

HEADLINE: Charge Against Mayor Strikes Chord in Birmingham

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Jan. 18

 BODY:
As Mayor Richard Arrington was resisting a Federal grand jury's investigation of corruption charges here this week, and being cited for contempt in the process he used the confrontation to try once again to attract national attention to his view that the Justice Department unfairly singles out black officials.
Letters went out from the Mayor's office to a host of local and national organizations inviting them to participate in a hearing here next month into "the selective prosecution and harassment of black leadership." 
 Mayor Arrington, 50 years old, who became the city's first black mayor in 1979, said he hoped the meeting might provoke the interest of Congress in an investigation of its own.
But locally, his accusations have already struck responsive chords. Mr. Arrington's supporters accept them, and even some of his longtime political opponents lament the way the charges echo the days of Birmingham's racial divisions at the height of the civil rights struggles of the 1960's.
 
Hanging On to Logs
 Mayor Arrington's current battle involves his refusal to turn over appointment logs to investigators looking into charges of kickbacks on city contracts. But over the years, the Mayor has been investigated more than a dozen times, he says, and he has become a leading voice among those asserting that black officials are singled out.
His complaint was taken up by others in the 1980's, as investigations and indictments of black officials seemed to arise in disproportionate numbers. Frank Donaldson, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, has denied a racial motivation in his investigations of the Mayor.
Many investigations of black officials here and elsewhere have faltered quietly or bombed loudly, but there have also been notable convictions. One was that of former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington, on drug charges.
In the 1991 investigation of vote selling in the South Carolina Legislature, some of those convicted were black, but several others were white, a fact that some people, including Mr. Arrington, concede makes it more difficult for him to build support for his accusations.
"I don't think there is as much public receptivity to my charges in light of these events," said Mayor Arrington in an interview on Friday. "But that doesn't change the validity of the charges or the fact that there is a double standard when it comes to the investigations of black officials and white officials."
Milton Morris, a political scientist and vice president for research at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research organization focusing on issues affecting black people, said that so far there was little or no firm evidence that race has been a factor in Federal investigations of black elected officials. But he said there was ample evidence of the disproportionate effect that even the hint of wrongdoing has on them.
"The tragedy is that black elected officials are a relatively small but highly visible part of the population of elected officials," said Mr. Morris. "I have no evidence to support the claim that there is a deliberate and venal attempt to target them, but what happens is that any allegation simply stands out more prominently and with each allegation credibility is undermined that much more."
But some like Natalie Davis, a political scientist at Birmingham Southern College who operates a political polling firm, said Mr. Arrington's reputation generally for honesty would add credibility to his efforts.
 
15 Inquiries in Career
 Just four months ago Mr. Arrington won election to a fourth term with 63 percent of the vote in a city that is more than 65 percent black. As with most of his past re-election campaigns, he got more than 95 percent of the black vote, Ms. Davis said, and barely 15 percent of the white vote.
That kind of electoral one-sidedness has dogged Mr. Arrington's political career even as he has managed to maintain a reasonably strong economic base in the city. Throughout that time, he said, there have been no fewer than 15 investigations and attempts to snare him in inquiries directed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Through a 1989 Freedom of Information Act filing, Mr. Arrington has documented some of his assertions that Federal officials have shown an inordinate interest in him. On other occasions he has produced affidavits from other targets of Federal investigations who said they were asked by investigators to work under cover in implicating Mr. Arrington.
"They usually go after people who are vulnerable and facing other charges such as tax charges and they squeeze them," the Mayor said.
It is for that reason, he said, that he refused to release five years of his office appointment logs. With such a list, he said, investigators would have a wealth of names of people who could be intimidated.
According to Mr. Arrington, his lawyers and court papers in the current investigation, the Mayor is said to have entered into a kickback arrangement with an Atlanta architect, Tarlee Brown, who had done city contract work and who had been a business partner of Mr. Arrington's. Mr. Brown, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges and has been cooperating with investigators, first made the accusations last September in connection with a fraud case against a city consultant.
Mr. Donaldson, the United States Attorney, has refused to comment specifically on the investigation. But he and his aides have filed civil suits against Mr. Arrington charging slander over his accusations of racially motivated investigations.
Mr. Arrington and his aides concede that the investigation and the prospect that he may be jailed for contempt have hurt him in his dealings with the city's mostly white business community. Ms. Davis said the marginal support among this group is most affected by the investigation and the accusations of racism. They reason, she said, that where there is smoke there is fire.
David Vann, a lawyer and a former Birmingham mayor, said blacks in the city were almost uniformly behind Mr. Arrington while whites were split over the accusations. The result, Mr. Vann said, was a kind of "racial polarization."
Betty Bock, who is white and who is the president of the integrated Five Points South Neighborhood Association, said: "I am inclined to view this investigation of the Mayor as a fishing expedition. But I have real concern about hearing the word 'racism' bandied about. We have a history in terms of race relations, and we have worked very hard to overcome that image and made significant strides. This only serves to hurt our image."
Linda Coleman, a black member of the City Council, said support for the Mayor remained strong among blacks.
"He'll have all the support he needs to run the city from a jail cell if he has to," Mrs. Coleman said at a community meeting intended to bring out support for Mr. Arrington.

HEADLINE: From Pulpits, Talk to Calm Racial Tensions

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
From the majestic pulpit of Riverside Church, the Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes Jr. scanned the diverse faces that showed his congregation to be one of the city's most racially mixed. He urged them to look at one another.
"We are not integrated because we are shoulder-to-shoulder," he declared to the hundreds of worshipers. "We are integrated because we are heart-to-heart." 
 It was a bittersweet point of pride, coming after a spate of racial attacks and retaliations that had spread across the city in the fortnight preceding the observance of the birth of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Yesterday, causes and cures for the racial tension were discussed in pulpits and pews, making many New Yorkers confront the uneasy realization that the dream of the civil rights leader remains elusive.
 
Appeals to Parents and Schools
 Dr. Forbes encouraged his congregation to attend social-issues discussions, including one on race relations, after the services.
Other clerics, like the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d of Abyssinian Baptist Church, encouraged parents to impart values of understanding and self-respect to their children and urged schools to develop a curriculum of inclusion that highlights the contributions of minority groups. And speaking at a ceremony commemorating the civil rights leader at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Mayor David N. Dinkins again exhorted parents to pay attention to their children.
At St. Patrick's Cathedral, John Cardinal O'Connor used the bias attacks as a jumping-off point for a denunciation of what he saw as a greater evil, abortion, postulating that Dr. King would have sided with abortion opponents.
Even as church leaders spent the day denouncing racial violence, however, the list of bias incidents grew. Hours before the congregations gathered, the police said, about a half-dozen black men surrounded a 29-year-old white Brooklyn resident in Williamsburg and asked, "White boy, what are you doing here?" before punching him in the chest and stealing his wallet.
And on Long Island, a suspect was charged yesterday in the Dec. 28 death of a man who police say was run off the road because his assailant believed he was gay.
The more recent attacks have led to retaliations, among them last week's reported rape of a 15-year-old white Brooklyn girl, an attack that the police have classified as a bias crime. At St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic Church in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn, residents of the teen-age girl's community were reminded by the pastor that the bias attacks echoed the biblical violence between Cain and Abel.
Speaking of more recent transgressions, the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, stood before the congregation and tempered his outrage against the girl's rape with exhortations that vigilantism would only heighten tensions. He urged people to "keep a lid on" their anger and set an example of tolerance to their children. "Remember, racism starts at the dinner table and in the living room," he said.
 
Fears of Retaliation
 Other fears of retaliation were voiced in the Bronx at a congregation of Albanian immigrants and their children. In the two Bronx attacks in which black and Hispanic youths had their faces smeared with white paint, the assailants claimed to be members of a neighborhood group of Albanian street toughs, prompting fear of retaliations and discrimination against the close knit immigrant community.
"In our codes of law and rules, we can discriminate against no religion, no race and no people," said the Rev. Rock Mirdita, pastor of Our Lady of Good Counsel Church in the Bronx. "We have to live in love and peace beyond the family circles." Befitting a church whose neighbors are mostly black and Hispanic, he drove home his point by urging the parishioners to follow the example set by Dr. King and Mother Teresa, who is Albanian, in their quests for peace.
The church's teen-age parishioners have been feeling a bit unsettled since the attacks, for fear of being attacked in retaliation of a crime they vigorously denounced.
"I feel like it's not right," said Debra Dediavanovic, 12 years old. "But I will not consider myself an Albanian because I'm not about to walk down the street and get beat up."
A mile or so to the west, the mother of one of the victims of racial violence led a group of about 100 black, Hispanic and some white residents of Williamsbridge in a march past the sites of attacks on the Bronx schoolchildren. Diane Figueroa stood with the group on the grassy strip of land where her son Bryan, 12, was attacked last week.
"I want to take back the community," she said. "This is not about black or white, because violence is violence and racism is racism."
Spurred by the attack on her son, Ms. Figueroa said she wanted to sponsor dialogues among teen-agers from different ethnic groups so that children could begin to understand each other better.
Discussions ran on after services at Riverside Church, where the congregation prides itself on its history of social activism.
"We got to tune in, one human being to another," said George Bynoe, who is black. He said he would like to invite David Duke, the former Nazi and Klansman who is running for president, to come speak at the church.
"Let's deal with it out in the open," he said. "He's just saying what a lot of people think."
 
Economic Justice
 Racial hatred, Mr. Butts said in an interview after services at the Harlem church, feeds on ignorance. He added that racial justice must be accompanied by economic justice in communities reeling from the recession that has heightened competition for jobs and government funds.
Mr. Dinkins, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, said parents played an important role in that reconciliation. "Though it is easy to blame our culture of violence, what about the people who should be standing between that culture and our children, shielding them and teaching them right from wrong?" he asked. "It is sad to say but our children are dying for our attention."
Earlier in the day at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Cardinal O'Connor condemned the bias attacks but said they were dwarfed by the greater violence spawned by a lack of moral values.
Invoking Dr. King's writings, Cardinal O'Connor said Dr. King would have opposed abortion as the product of an unjust law imposed by the majority against a minority. "The minority," the Cardinal said, "being the unborn infants who are destroyed each year."

HEADLINE: 1992 CAMPAIGN: TV Critic's Notebook;
Sound Bites Are Tuned Out, And Clearer Images Emerge

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The producers of last night's two-hour get-together of contending Democrats on C-Span evidently learned something from NBC's 90-minute sound-bite festival last month. Instead of trying to squeeze a few words from all the suspects on every subject in the world, Cokie Roberts, presiding, focused on three big domestic matters: the economy, education and crime. She pressed the candidates politely if not always successfully for direct answers without trying to upstage them.
Although viewers may have been left with only a fuzzy notion of the specific proposals to which most laid claim, differences of message and of personality did come through. To be sure, the candidates were united in their put-downs of President Bush for getting the country into its present predicament, three of them spoke of their young daughters and all celebrated their superior compassion. But along the way they began to turn themselves into distinctive figures. 
 This time the cast is now reduced to five. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, the most obviously distinctive, is gone. Contrary to the conventions of the television mystery, the most obstreperous character was not the first to vanish. Edmund G. Brown Jr., who in the first debate got into a fight with his host, Tom Brokaw, over his insistence on soliciting contributions on camera, ended last night's program by reading from a fund-raising solicitation. Ms. Roberts complimented him on saving 29 cents per letter.
Mr. Brown, former Governor of California, has been much joked about, but he does not seem to mind being considered, as Ms. Roberts reported, "Governor Moonbeam." He returns to politics with the reputation of something of a flower child in a time warp and with a commercial that he delivers in response to just about every question: Political corruption, a kowtowing to big contributors, is at the heart of the nation's troubles, and his opponents are all part of it.
His main proposal last night, a flat 13 percent tax to replace the present income tax, had the same pure or simple quality. Whatever one's response to such an approach, there is no mixing up Mr. Brown with anybody else.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa seemed equally determined to set himself apart from "these fellows right here." Three of them, he accused, had in one way or another supported Reaganomics (omitting Mr. Brown, who has not been in office for almost a decade). Wagging a finger smack at the audience, he announced, "I'm the only real Democrat in this race." He also produced again a dollar bill, maybe the same one he displayed the first time around, to show how little the middle-class tax cut proposed by Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, whom Senator Harkin went after with particular bite, would mean to the little man.
Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, too, carried a prop. Three times he held up a pamphlet that bore his name, titled "A Call to Economic Arms." He pleaded guilty to not being a movie star ("Even my dog knows that," he cracked.), and his hangdog look conforms to his sober message. Like Mr. Brown, he has a single big truth: the need to halt America's economic decline. He makes a gloomy messiah. If you are in any doubt which one he is, look for the man with the worried expression.
Senator Kerrey did not mention Vietnam last night. Possibly in deference to criticisms of his dependence on his heroic war record, he made an effort to establish himself in some other way. Mr. Kerrey kept referring to his proposal for national health insurance, to which none of his competitors seemed to take exception. He also apparently has an industrial policy and a plan for restructuring the Federal Government. "I know how to do that!" he declared. That is more than any viewer can know; for television purposes, Senator Kerrey is mostly distinguished for energy of expression and remains a bit hard to place.
As the apparent front-runner, Governor Clinton is assuming the statesman's role. He does less picking on the others, rising only occasionally to the barbs of Senators Kerrey and Harkin, and last night he found a way to bring his accomplishments in Arkansas into almost every answer to Ms. Roberts's questions. The sure mark of the man who thinks he is ahead, he is already talking about bringing people together.

HEADLINE: Minority College Attendance Rose in Late 80's, Report Says

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The proportion of minority students of college age attending colleges and universities increased in the second half of the 1980's but remained below the proportion of whites attending such institutions, according to a report made public by the American Council on Education today.
The overall increase of minority participation in colleges was attributed to more aggressive recruitment by colleges and universities. 
 The study showed that of black high school graduates 18 to 24 years old, 33 percent were attending college in 1990, up from 26.1 percent in 1985. Though most of that increase was among black women, participation rates by black men increased 7.4 percent between 1988 and 1990, reversing a general decline over the previous eight years.
Of white high school graduates, 39.4 percent were attending college in 1990, up from 34.4 percent in 1985.
Hispanic participation rates rose slightly to 29 percent in 1990, from 26.1 percent in 1985.
 
Minority Gain Outpaced Whites
 Figures for Asian-American and American Indian students were unavailable because survey samples were too small.
The study, "The Tenth Annual Status Report on Minorities in Higher Education," examines the educational progress of black, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian students through high school graduation rates, college enrollment and degree attainment. The American Council on Education, which represents 1,800 two- and four-year colleges and universities, based the report on data from the Census Bureau.
"We're seeing an increase in the last two years of more aggressive efforts on the part of some colleges and universities to recruit minorities," said Deborah J. Carter, assistant director of the education council's Office of Minorities in Higher Education and an author of the report. "But we have not seen the gap in the participating between minority students and white students decline," she said.
Nonetheless, the report found that more minority students were enrolling in college between 1988 and 1990. Overall enrollment grew by 5.1 percent, to 13.7 million in 1990. In those two years enrollment rose 3.8 percent for white students, 8.2 percent for African-American, 11.5 percent for Hispanic, 11.7 percent for Asian-American and 10.8 percent for American Indian students.
But the study warned the minority gains could be reversed by the recession, along with rises in tuition costs, caps on college enrollment and declines in Federal education grants. "We would be wrong to look at the numbers, see progress, and conclude that recruitment and retention programs on behalf of underserved groups are no longer necessary," said Robert H. Atwell, president of the council.
Of particular concern is the declining number of Hispanic high school graduates. The high school graduation rates for Hispanic students dropped from 62.9 percent in 1985 to 54.5 percent in 1990.
In the same period, high school graduation rates for whites remained relatively constant, standing at 83.6 percent in 1985 and 82.5 percent in 1990. Rates for African-American students improved, going from 75.6 percent in 1985 to 77 percent in 1990.
Alfredo de los Santos Jr., vice chancellor of educational development at Maricopa Community Colleges in Tempe, Ariz., said the isolation of Hispanic students in poor urban schools would produce "deep social problems."
Copies of the report are available for $10.50 each, prepaid, from the Publications Department, American Council on Education, 1 Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. 20036.

HEADLINE: California Leader Explains Speech Mix-Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 19

 BODY:
Gov. Pete Wilson blamed himself and his press office today for the confusion surrounding the existence and identity of three men he referred to in his State of the State Message.
In a rare Sunday news conference, the Republican Governor introduced three men he said were the people he used in his Jan. 8 speech as examples of Californians who had been harmed by the recession. The introductions came days after published reports in which Wilson staff members said the three workers did not actually exist but were composites. 
 "They are not allegorical, they are quite real," Mr. Wilson said after introducing Shad Murphy, a carpenter, Concepcion Meza, a farm worker, and Wesley C. Seastrom, a businessman. "They are not composites. They are representative. There are thousands like them."
Mr. Wilson said the problem resulted from a misunderstanding between him and his spokesmen when The San Jose Mercury News asked about the carpenter. The Governor said all three men were representative of others who were having problems. From that, Mr. Wilson said, his staff wrongly told reporters the men he used in the speech were composites instead of real people.
The publicity, including national television reports, clearly embarrassed Mr. Wilson, who said, "There was a massive failure of communication internally."

HEADLINE: Albany Faces Hard Choices In Cash Quest

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 19

 BODY:
As Gov. Mario M. Cuomo prepares to unveil his financial plan for the coming year, New York finds itself at the brink of fiscal chaos that has at its heart an intractable dispute over how to wring savings from the state's surging Medicaid and welfare budgets.
More than just an academic pursuit by sharp-penciled accountants, the conflict in Albany reflects a national debate over how states should control costs while the recession is simultaneously driving up welfare caseloads and constricting tax revenues. 
 The desperate search for cash has left all states with devil's choices as they struggle to brake the runaway growth of social-services programs.
 
Eligibility Standards
 Should they tighten eligibility standards and reduce benefits, as Republicans in the State Senate have proposed, thus relegating many welfare and Medicaid recipients to homeless shelters, hospital emergency rooms and prisons, at a greater eventual cost to the state? Or should they cut reimbursement rates for health-care providers, as the Assembly Democrats want, potentially sounding the death knell for struggling hospitals that still provide much of the primary care for the poor?
In his State of the State address two weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo, whose approach falls somewhere between those two polar opposites, challenged the Legislature to revise the state's Medicaid and welfare policies without abandoning its commitment to a tightly woven safety net.
But once the Governor translates that high-minded charge into a budget proposal, which he is to deliver to the Legislature on Tuesday, few expect the negotiations to go smoothly. "This is going to be an all-out war," Mr. Cuomo predicted last week.
 
Compromise Is Elusive
 For nearly three months, Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders have struggled in vain to fashion a compromise. Their failure doomed any chance of crafting an unusual multiyear financial plan, which would have closed both the $875 million gap in this year's $30 billion budget and the $4 billion gap projected for the fiscal year that begins on April 1. Mr. Cuomo cited the collapse of budget talks last month as the only reason he would not run for President.
The battlefield in Albany has taken the form of a broad menu of proposed budget cuts, with the Republican-led Senate trying to pare the welfare rolls and restrict services, the Democratic-led Assembly preferring to cut compensation for health-care providers, and Mr. Cuomo endorsing a more balanced approach.
The Senate Republicans, arguing that deep cuts are needed to bring the state budget into permanent balance, have called for the elimination of emergency assistance programs that provide cash to poor families threatened with eviction to the streets. They also would reduce by 20 percent the welfare grant known as Home Relief, which largely benefits single adults and childless couples, and would terminate Home Relief for employable adults after 60 days.
The Assembly Democrats, meanwhile, would not only extend a temporary tax on hospital and nursing-home revenues that was imposed in 1990 but would also nearly double it for a total added cost of $310 million for health-care providers.
Gary Gambuti, president of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, which has the largest caseload of Medicaid and uninsured patients in the state, said such measures would force him to cut the services that most benefit the poor, like outpatient clinics and emergency rooms. "You can't cut out things that pay you money and keep things that don't pay you money," he said.
 
Long-Term Care
 The area that seems to be receiving the least attention is the part of the Medicaid budget that has grown the fastest -- long-term care. Despite the stereotype of Medicaid as a program primarily for the poor, two-thirds of its recipients in New York are elderly or disabled.
The cost of providing long-term care in nursing homes and at home now accounts for 42 percent of all Medicaid expenditures in the state. Those costs have grown by 82 percent in the last five years, a period in which all Medicaid costs have risen by 65 percent.
"There has been a history with long-term care of not really going after cost containment," said Barry T. Berberich, the long-term care director in the State Social Services Department. "One reason obviously is the constituency, which is largely the frail elderly."
Various proposals have been floated to offer tax incentives for the purchase of long-term care insurance, to prevent New Yorkers from qualifying for Medicaid after shielding assets in trusts, and to lower the amount of jointly held assets -- currently $66,000 -- that a spouse can keep while still qualifying a husband or wife for Medicaid.
But the only change in long-term care getting serious consideration is placing a cap on Medicaid reimbursement for personal-care services. It would restrict the number of hours that homebound patients could receive assistance with cleaning, cooking and other nonmedical services.
The quest in Albany for a semblance of balance is complicated not only by a divided Legislature but by the politics of a volatile election year.
The Senate Republicans sense that they have a winning issue in pushing for deep cuts in welfare and Medicaid programs. Their constituents in upstate New York and the suburbs of New York City see ballooning welfare costs as the leading threat to property tax rates and state aid to schools.
Senator Dean G. Skelos, Republican of Rockville Centre, L.I., played on those fears in a December letter to his constituents. The Governor "and his New York City allies in the Legislature," Mr. Skelos wrote, "want us to leave welfare cheats and Medicaid thieves alone, at your expense, contributing to higher property taxes and a declining educational system."
 
Racial Fears
 In rejecting the most severe Republican cuts, the state's Democrats have suggested that the Republicans are pandering to the racial fears of their mostly white constituents. Mr. Cuomo has suggested that the New York Republican strategy is a direct descendant of President Bush's use of Willie Horton in the 1988 campaign. "I think Republicans are doing it all over the country," he said.
The Republicans, who have traditionally sought to protect business interests, also want to support their constituents in the health-care industry. They are particularly concerned that provider cuts would force heavy layoffs in the midst of the recession.
The power relationship between the Senate Republicans and the health-care industry is vividly reflected in financial contributions. Last year, the Senate Republican Campaign Committee received $164,250 from political action committees representing medical, hospital and insurance interests, according to financial disclosure reports. The Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee received $55,400.
 
Different Concerns
 The Assembly Democrats, meanwhile, have different concerns. Their political power flows from New York City, which is home to 63 percent of the state's 2.5 billion Medicaid recipients and 66 percent of its 1.4 billion welfare recipients.
If the state cuts Medicaid and welfare by tossing people off the rolls, the greatest financial impact will be felt in New York City, where local government may have to care for many of those cut loose.
Yet, without significant progress in containing Medicaid costs this year, there is little chance the Legislature will consider Mr. Cuomo's proposal for the state to assume the local share of Medicaid costs. Even though the Cuomo proposal would require the city to cede personal income tax revenues to the state, Mr. Cuomo calculates that the plan would save the city more than $1 billion a year by the end of the decade.
 
Same Political Pressures
 Pressure for action has built in Albany as other states have enacted cuts once unthinkable in New York, which has one of the most generous entitlement programs in the country.
Last week, the New Jersey Legislature sent a bill to Gov. Jim Florio that would cut off additional benefits to welfare mothers who continue to have children. Michigan last year eliminated its welfare program for single adults and childless couples. California cut welfare benefits to mothers with dependent children by nearly 5 percent last year.
California and Michigan, unlike New York, have Republican Governors, and New Jersey has a newly elected Republican Legislature with veto-proof majorities in both houses. But New York Democrats are feeling the same political pressures that have prompted action in those states.
New York voters sent strong signals in recent elections that they would tolerate neither new taxes nor business as usual from their legislators this year.
Thus, the budget that Mr. Cuomo proposes on Tuesday is not expected to include major tax increases. But it will have to address a gap of at least $4 billion in a budget of about $30 billion for the coming fiscal year.
Much of that gap was created by unexpected growth in the state's Medicaid program, which will spend more than $12 billion this fiscal year in Federal, state and county funds.
Mr. Cuomo's Budget Division expected the state's share of Medicaid spending to grow by 3 percent in the current fiscal year but now believes it could grow by 18 percent. The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, has projected growth of 25 percent.
Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, said the state's inability to control Medicaid costs is the factor most to blame for increases in local property taxes of up to 25 percent in some counties last year. Meanwhile, Medicaid now devours 14 percent of the state's revenues, up from 8 percent when Mr. Cuomo took office in 1983.
There is little disagreement in Albany that spending on Medicaid and welfare must be curtailed. In their unsuccessful negotiations to close this year's budget gap, the Governor, Mr. Marino and Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin agreed that the state should produce savings of $1.1 billion from the Medicaid and welfare area.
When the negotiations stalled over the mix of cuts, the three parties had agreed to cuts totaling between $700 million and $800 million, according to participants on all sides.
 
Agreements Reached
 Among the agreements were proposals to continue the hospital tax, to require photo identification cards for Medicaid recipients and to limit Medicaid coverage for podiatry.
There also were agreements in principle to limit Medicaid services available to Home Relief recipients, require Medicaid recipients to make co-payments for treatment, and cap personal-care services. But the talks disintegrated when negotiators could not agree on which Medicaid services would be limited for Home Relief recipients, how large the co-payments would be, and how many hours of personal care would be allowed.
Many of the negotiators believe there is enough room for compromise to craft a quick agreement. But that will occur only when political posturing takes a back seat to real progress, they said.
"This can get done relatively quickly if all the parties would come to the table willing to get it done," said Michael J. Dowling, Mr. Cuomo's director of health, education and human services. "You could get it done in two hours, to be frank with you."

HEADLINE: 1992 CAMPAIGN: Congress;
With Ingredients for Revolt, Illinois May Lead Way in Anti-Incumbent Vote

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 19

 BODY:
If the American public's general unhappiness with Congress is going to cost individual lawmakers their jobs, the March 17 primary in once insurgent-proof Illinois will be the first place it shows.
The national anti-incumbent mood has already compelled unaccustomed campaigning by veterans here. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, chafes at hiring "handlers" who remind him to boast of accomplishments like getting money for expressway repairs. But he takes the advice, adding grimly, "When I decided to run, I decided to win." 
 Around the country, scholars, politicians and polls all detect serious risks for Congressional incumbents. Unhappiness with legislative stalemate and unsolved national problems seems to focus on Congress. The House bank scandal and the Senate hearings on Justice Clarence Thomas deepened popular dissatisfaction and spurred talk of term limits.
 
Ingredients for Revolt
 "The ingredients are there for a substantial revolt," said Thomas Mann, an expert on Congress at the Brookings Institution in Washington. He said he would not be surprised to see 30 to 40 House incumbents defeated. In 1990, although average winning margins fell for both Republicans and Democrats, apparently for the first time in history, only 16 incumbents were beaten.
The Illinois primary is the first of the year with significant challenges to incumbents. The economy here encourages such political disrespect, which the no longer formidable Democratic organization once would have squelched or disdained. Illinois has 9.3 percent unemployment, rising local taxes and sharp cuts in state services and aid to localities.
In this atmosphere, challengers blame Congress and political action committees for almost everything. A former alderman, Dick Simpson, told neighbors at a coffee meeting Wednesday that there was no national health insurance because of heavy medical industry contributions to his opponent: Mr. Rostenkowski.
 
Rostenkowski's Recession
 For good measure, he said the powerful Democrat was "significantly responsible for the recession" because of tax legislation and said his foe's voting record was "a little to the left of Attila the Hun."
Al Hofeld, a millionaire product-liability lawyer who never ran for office before deciding last fall to challenge Senator Alan J. Dixon this year, spends heavily on television advertisements. They portray his foe as a "career politician" typical of senators who "sell yourself to the special interests and tap-dance around the issues."
Nationally, polls suggest a host of problems for incumbents. A Gallup Poll conducted Jan. 3 through 9 for USA Today and the Cable News Network found only 43 percent of the public saying most members of Congress deserve re-election. A New York Times/CBS News Poll last October found 57 percent saying that half or more of all members of Congress were "financially corrupt."
Don Foley, the staff chief for the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, warned that while the move may not necessarily be "anti-incumbent," it is plainly "anti-status quo." He said incumbents must now be able to articulate what they have done and what they would do if re-elected. " 'Experience, seniority' -- those are words that once had some cachet at the polls," he said, but no longer.
 
Seizing the Issues
 Mr. Dixon's response to the opposition of Mr. Hofeld and another foe, Carol Mosely Braun, illustrates the Foley prescription. The Senator's latest television commercial depicts him as a leading advocate of national health insurance, although he has not had a major role on the issue in the Senate.
Campaigning before the state A.F.L.-C.I. on Thursday, he said he had fought the Mexican free trade legislation. He asserted that he had "led the fight in the Senate" for extended unemployment benefits, although there, too, his role has not been a prominent one.
The race plainly has him worried, although he contended in a brief interview that he did not see any evidence of an anti-incumbent mood. "My support is holding firm," he said. Mr. Dixon will rely on a record of getting things done for Illinois and on the political ties he has developed in winning every election he has contested since 1949.
 
Campaigning in the Cold
 Mr. Rostenkowski, running in a reshaped district, 60 percent of whose voters are new to him, may have to break a light sweat in his campaign. But he has more real clout to boast of than does Mr. Dixon. And Mr. Rostenkowski has, in Mr. Simpson, a less formidable, underfinanced opponent, who campaigns at "el" stations in subzero weather to become known.
At a rare high school visit last week -- he explains that neighborhood groups just have not invited him much before -- the chairman enjoyed himself, offering blunt advice like "hit the books." One boy said he wanted a career in politics, so Mr. Rostenkowski advised him to work for a candidate he likes.
At a neighborhood meeting over an unwelcome relocation of a social security office, he smiled broadly and said, "Social Security, that's my jurisdiction," making it clear the move would be stopped.
Known in Washington as an earnest, deal-making chairman more interested in passing bills than scoring political points, and more friendly with President Bush than some Democrats like, Mr. Rostenkowski got his House seat when Mayor Richard J. Daley gave it to him in 1958. If he does not hold it this year, anti-incumbency will be shown to amount to a political earthquake.
 
May Send a Warning
 A defeat for Mr. Dixon would be an only slightly lesser upheaval. But even if the two of them survive their primaries comfortably, Illinois could still send a message to Capitol Hill, for at least three other Representatives face plausible primary challenges.
Representative Philip M. Crane, a Republican, is being pressed hard northwest of here as he seeks a 12th term. Gary J. Skoien, who was a high-ranking aide to former Gov. James R. Thompson, is challenging Mr. Crane as an absentee House member with little real connection to the district.
Two other incumbents, both Democrats, are facing real tests. Alderman Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther, is running against Representative Charles Hayes, who argues that his opponents also include city leaders who oppose him as a labor supporter.
Representative Gus Savage is being opposed for a third time by Mel Reynolds, a Rhodes Scholar and businessman. The changing shape of the district, with its suburban, largely white population increasing from 14 to 35 percent, may hurt Mr. Savage.
Mr. Savage is being questioned by new constituents about past remarks attacking whites. Mr. Reynolds, who is black like Mr. Savage, has a clear shot against him this time. In 1990, the opposition to Mr. Savage was divided and the Representative got most of his 52 percent in the primary from black voters of Chicago's South Side.
In Illinois, more of the incumbents are Democratic. They have the tougher contests. But Republicans might face comparable attacks elsewhere.
Spencer Abraham, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, contends that complete Democratic control of the House makes it hard to blame Republicans for its failings. "I don't think anti-incumbency alone will defeat Republican incumbents unless there is something else added on," he said.
The nation's attitude toward Congress generally is only one piece of the individual elections of 435 Representatives and 35 Senators, of course. By November, the economy or a strong Presidential campaign may preserve vulnerable incumbents of one party or the other and redistricting still has hundreds of House careers to shape.
But on March 17, Illinois will offer the first returns on whether incumbency, usually a tremendous political asset, is becoming a liability.

HEADLINE: Generational Chasm Leads to Cultural Turmoil for Young Mexicans in U.S.

SERIES: Without a Ladder: The Mexican Immigrants -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Imelda H.'s temper flares when she talks about her upbringing in Magnolia Park, the oldest Mexican neighborhood in Houston and a place rife with confused identities.
"We could never get stuff like pizza at home, just Mexican foods," said Imelda, who is 15 years old and who spoke only on the condition that her last name not be used. "My mother would give me these silly dresses to wear to school, not jeans. No jewelry. No makeup. And they'd always say, 'Stick with the Mexican kids. Don't talk to the Anglos. They'll boss you.' " 
 Her parents, who came to Houston 12 years ago, repeatedly told Imelda that she could not date boys until after her 15th birthday, an occasion to be celebrated by the quinceanera, a traditional coming out party for girls. On that day, she was told, she would wear a frilly dress ordered by catalogue from Mexico and dance her first dance, with her father.
The day after her quinceanera, Imelda told her parents that she was pregnant and that she was moving in with her boyfriend's family. That night, her boyfriend's mother, a third-generation Mexican-American, served the young couple plain boiled white rice.
"I had never eaten rice like that because my mother made it Mexican style," Imelda said. "When I ate that white rice at his house that night, I felt like an American. I was free."
 
A Different Identity
 In Magnolia and other predominantly Mexican communities across the country, large numbers of young people are being brought up in an atmosphere of cultural turmoil far different from that experienced by previous generations of immigrants from other lands. As a result, Magnolia's identity is neither wholly Mexican nor wholly American but something in between and ever-changing.
The tension is perhaps most visible in families, traditionally the source of strength for Mexican immigrants. Today, they are being pulled apart.
"Parents don't know nothing," said Gina Benavides, a 17-year-old in Magnolia who has dyed her hair blond, wears a Bart Simpson T-shirt and speaks English without a trace of an accent. "A lot of them don't even speak English. So how are they going to know what their kids are doing? And face it, their kids are doing everything."
For one thing, they are increasingly dropping out of high school, finding their role models on the streets rather than in the classrooms, where only a small fraction of their teachers are Hispanic. For another, teen-age girls in the neighborhood are becoming pregnant in record numbers. Ms. Benavides is one of them, and she has also dropped out of school.
At the same time their parents, finding life here hard but still better than the ones left behind, are bewildered by their children's failings.
"When families fail, it has something to do with what happens to them after they get here," said Sylvia Garcia, Houston director of Avance, a nonprofit agency based in San Antonio that helps immigrant women. "They come here full of ambition, and how soon they lose hope depends on how quickly they get hurt. They get hurt by teachers, bureaucrats and bosses who they can't understand. And sometimes the parents get hurt by their own children, who they can't understand."
 
Plans to Go Back
 In some ways this is simply a contemporary version of the historic immigrant experience in America in which young generations trying to assimilate shun the old-country customs of their parents.
But what is happening in Magnolia differs from that historic phenomenon. One reason is geography. Simple proximity to Mexico has meant that many parents have kept close ties to their home country and continue to practice its traditions because, in many cases, they expect to go back one day.
In addition, while most European and Asian immigration has occurred in clearly defined waves, the movement of people across the Rio Grande has been an almost continual stream. The steady flow has meant that no matter how quickly young people learn English and American ways, their community retains the status of an immigrant, Spanish-speaking minority group.
All this is taking place as economic prospects for the children of Mexican immigrants have dimmed.
For more than 80 years Magnolia -- a swampy area named for its big-blossomed trees and rarely referred to by its official name, Magnolia Park -- helped generations of Mexican immigrants find their way into the economic mainstream by working in factories and warehouses, on docks and at construction sites. But as has happened across the country, many of these stepping-stone jobs disappeared in the 1980's even as low-paying, insecure jobs in the service sector multiplied.
The ready availability of menial work has proved a magnet for large numbers of immigrants from Mexico and Central America who find that life on the minimum wage here is an improvement. Many teen-agers in Magnolia, and neighborhoods like it, are also drawn to these jobs, often leaving school to help support their families.
In these jobs, today's immigrant children see little prospect for the upward mobility so vital to the immigrant experience of the past, and many of them end up learning the culture of inner city poverty with its welfare dependency, drugs and teen-age sex.
 
Divided Neighborhood
Old and Young Face Changing Attitudes
 Adapting to a new culture is "one of the biggest and most unpredictable factors" in determining what happens to teen-agers of Mexican origin, said Jorge Carrillo, a psychologist at the Chicano Family Center in Houston. "Both the parents and the kids have to be able to handle both cultures and a lot of changing attitudes or they run into problems."
Adding to these difficulties are the sharp divisions between recent immigrants and native Mexican-Americans, whom the immigrants sometimes call "chicanos." The two groups may speak different languages, eat different food, listen to different music and have different political interests.
The contrasts seem to be most obvious to the young.
"The Spanish-speaking kids, they wear like khaki pants and plain shirts to school because I guess they don't got the money," said Joe Rocha, 16 years old, "and so they get mad at us because English-speaking kids come to school dressed nice, baggy jeans and high tops, you know. It used to be we'd fight about it a lot."
It is the fate of teen-agers like Joe Rocha, Imelda H. and Gina Benavides that most concern urban sociologists and other experts. In the United States, nearly a third of the population of Mexican origin, which totals about 14 million people, is younger than 16, compared with less than a fifth of the non-Hispanic population. These young people will soon make up the fastest-growing segment of the labor force.
But many adults in Magnolia say that the problems of the young are worsening.
Magnolia is becoming a distribution point in the drug trade, and drug use is beginning to rise, law enforcement officials say. Nearly three-quarters of the students entering high school as freshmen in Magnolia drop out before graduation. And from 1984 to 1988, Houston Health Department statistics show, the birth rate among Hispanic teen-agers was nearly three times that of whites and as much as 15 percent higher than that of black teen-agers.
 
Advancement Stops
 While Hispanic people make up about 28 percent of the city's population, Hispanic families account for more than half of the recipients of the Woman and Infant Children program, a federally financed food subsidy.
The faces behind these statistics are not just those of newly arrived immigrants. A study published this year at the University of Texas at Austin found that a long trend of educational advancement from one Mexican-American generation to the next has stopped. Those of the second generation, for example, were more likely to have attended college than those of the third generation today.
"It seems that as they faced economic hardship in the 1980's, second-generation parents were less willing or less able to emphasize education for their children than immigrant parents," said Frank D. Bean, a sociologist at the University of Texas who co-wrote the study. "It is discouraging news for the future, because the educational gap is growing between Mexican-Americans and Anglos.
One student in Magnolia, Richard Cantu, 15 years old, has repeatedly debated whether to leave school. "My two good friends decided to hang it up," he said, "and they got jobs. It's easy to get work if you want to be flipping burgers and doing stuff like that. Now these dudes have got money and good clothes. They come around and say school is for nerds."
 
Split Generations
Traditions Fade For Teen-Agers
 If the young of Magnolia have lost touch with their traditions, the parents seem equally cut off from their children.
Araceli Grimaldo, 30, embodies the kind of optimism found among many immigrant parents. Although her husband has never earned more than $300 a week and often much less in the eight years he has been here, she said, "My four children are going to college and, after them, me, too."
Yet even though her children are still young, ages 3 to 9, she is already worried that she is losing touch. "My oldest boy is totally American," she said in Spanish. "His culture is American. His food is American. He speaks English, reads English, writes English."
Mrs. Grimaldo is now learning English herself, partly out of concern for how her children will grow up. "When children get into trouble, I think it is because of a lack of communication in the family," she said.
Rather than adapt to the new world around them, some parents retreat further into their own culture when they face problems with their children.
"My daughters have never gone out of the house alone, or without an adult escort, even if that means I have to go to their parties with them," said Marielena Regalado, 44, whose three daughters are 13 to 17 years old.
"Maybe I am little strict," she said, "and they made me admit the other day these were Mexican rules. I told them that in Mexico they would even have more freedom because we were from a small town and everyone knew each other and everyone was the same. Here there are so many different races, so many different types of people. It frightens me what could happen to them."
Ramon Villagomez, a 46-year-old lawyer who arrived in Magnolia when he was 10 and eventually moved out, said he now understands the young of today. "When I came here," he said, "I knew exactly who I was, a Mexican, and I knew exactly where I was, in heaven."
"Back in Magnolia," he added, "I couldn't understand the Chicano kids who complained about how badly the Anglos treated them and how they had to live in a crummy neighborhood. I was just amazed to have a refrigerator. But now I can see what happens. When kids assimilate, they can't figure out who they are."
 
Substantial Hurdles
Students Are Forced To Protest for Help
 Even for those teen-agers who stay in school, the odds against success can be formidable. Schools in the Mexican-immigrant neighborhoods are often inferior, and parental involvement is limited by the language barrier.
Arguing that they wanted a school as good as the ones in Houston's white neighborhoods, 1,000 students at Austin High School in Magnolia walked out in protest in October 1989.
One leader of the student demonstration, Maccario Garcia, then a 17-year-old senior, said later, "We had to do something because our parents couldn't." School officials eventually acceded to many of the protesters' demands, including removal of the principal. Since then the Enron Corporation, a Houston-based natural gas and pipeline company, has begun a partnership with the school to finance a dropout-prevention program.
Some of the barriers to parental involvement have been removed with the hiring of Spanish-speaking administrative staff and counselors. Still, the new principal, Rogelio H. Torres, said he sees too much "complacency" among parents. "So many people in this community are so much better off than they were before they immigrated that they don't understand what's happening to their kids," he said.
"When a 17 year-old makes it to 10th grade," he continued, "that's more education than anyone they know ever had, and so they think it is okay for them to drop out and take a minimum-wage job. They just don't seem to see that their children are ending on the losing end of a society divided between the haves and the have-nothings."

HEADLINE: Beijing Journal;
Crime Is Up in China, and So Is the Public's Rage

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Chinese prisons tend to be short of food and long on lice, beatings, and coffin-sized punishment cells. Felons can be executed immediately after the most perfunctory of trials, even for nonviolent offenses like embezzlement, and criminals' families are sometimes billed a few cents for the cost of the bullet used to execute their loved ones.
In China many people have strong feelings about these conditions. They complain that the authorities coddle criminals. 
 "Most folks would like to see harsher punishments," a young, college-educated Chinese business executive said the other day. "We despise those criminals. They might as well shoot them all, or at least lock them up for a long, long time."
This anger at common criminals -- which does not extend to political prisoners who now endure sentences in the same horrific prisons -- seems to reflect a deep frustration with rising crime rates and the increasing brazenness of China's thieves.
 
Frightening Crime Wave
 By American or European standards, China seems a remarkably safe place. But for some Chinese, particularly older people who remember the 1950's when "New China" seemed to have largely triumphed over ordinary crime, the nation is in the midst of a frightening crime wave.
Guns and drugs, rarely used in the past, are now making a comeback. And criminals are also forming gangs that increasingly turn to violence.
In some parts of China, highway robbers have made a comeback and occasionally prey on trains and buses in remote areas. These robbers, typically armed with knives and occasionally guns, steal money from passengers and then disappear into the countryside.
In 1990, the last year for which figures are available, 7,579 cases of highway robbery were reported.
Wang Yuhai and 11 others from a village in coastal Fujian Province armed themselves with explosives and knives and last year operated as a gang of pirates. They robbed four boats and killed 12 fishermen before being caught. A few weeks ago, a court sentenced Mr. Wang and six others in the gang to death.
 
1,000 a Year Executed
 More than 1,000 people are believed to be executed each year -- with a bullet in the back of the head -- for crimes that include murder, rape, and embezzlement. Virtually no one in China seems to be against capital punishment.
"Ordinary people think that the courts aren't strict enough with those criminals," said a young woman who is normally outspoken on behalf of human rights. "And unless prisons are pretty bad, the criminals won't mind going there."
Many people say that one reason why the police are not more effective in combating criminals is that they sometimes have links with them. In Beijing, for example, one officer in the Public Security Bureau has a sideline business as a pimp in one of Beijing's most lavish Western-managed hotels.
Another such cooperative venture came to light recently in a town in Jiangxi Province in central China. A restaurateur arranged for his waitresses to seduce customers on the premises. Then he would summon the local police, who would burst into the room and catch the couple in bed together.
The police would fine the man sums ranging from less than $100 to more than $900, depending on much he was carrying. After the customer had dressed and rushed off, the funds were divided among the police, the restaurateur and the waitresses. A Chinese newspaper reported recently that the scheme had been uncovered and that the local police officers were under arrest.
The total number of officially recorded criminal cases rose from 530,000 in 1978, on the eve of China's opening and economic reforms, to 2.2 million in 1990. These numbers may not mean much, partly because there are some rural townships that have populations of tens of thousands but not a single police officer to whom a crime could be reported. Yet even officials generally acknowledge that crime is rising, particularly among juveniles.
"It can be said that the current situation is rather grim, and we should be highly alarmed by this," Yu Lei, Deputy Minister of Public Security, said in an interview published recently in a Chinese magazine.
Police officials refused to be interviewed on the subject, perhaps because of the Government's embarrassment at the rising crime rates. Still, there is little doubt that China has less crime than the United States, and in particular fewer crimes of violence.
In Beijing, the most common crimes include theft and burglary. Indeed, burglary is so rampant that now it is very common for apartment owners to install iron grates outside their wooden doors.
Violent attacks are rare, but after a few taxi drivers were murdered in the capital, all taxis must now be equipped with an iron grill separating the front seat from the back.
Most Chinese believe that the rising crime rates are linked to the reform policies in the 1980's. Totalitarian controls were eased, a money culture emerged, people spent less time eyeing their neighbors, and society became far more mobile. Tens of millions of peasants now live or work in cities without official permission, and they account for many of the nation's thieves, robbers and prostitutes.

HEADLINE: How to Aid Russians Is Debated

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The breakup of the Soviet Union and Russia's swift embrace of radical economic reform have shifted the debate from whether the West should aid the former Soviet republics to how and on what terms.
At issue, according to some of the nation's leading economists, is finding the best way to bring vanquished cold war enemies into the camp of peaceful, prosperous capitalist democracies and avoiding anarchy, an authoritarian backlash and mass emigration. 
 A two-day, 60-nation meeting on aid will start in Washington on Wednesday. Officials from the United States, which has been wary of providing blanket assurances, and officials from Germany and other European countries, who have been urging a larger American role, will likely focus on the urgent problem of getting food, fuel and medical assistance to the hungry Russians this winter.
 
Long-Term Issues
 But their economic advisers are apt to zero in on the far more controversial issue of longer-term economic aid. Aid, other than the humanitarian variety, was not in the cards until recently because the Government of Mikhail S. Gorbachev was neither democratically elected nor committed to a rapid transition to a market economy.
On one side of the debate are mostly conservative economists, including Charles Wolf, the dean of the Rand Graduate School; Judy Shelton, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and once President Reagan's chief economic adviser.
 
Emphasis on Private Help
 This camp favors sending technical advisers, opening Western markets to exports of the new commonwealth of republics and helping the Russians dismantle their nuclear arsenal. But they maintain that virtually all the resources for restructuring and rebuilding the Russian economy should come from private foreign investors and from scaling back the former Soviet military.
"Private loans are the way to go, said Allan Meltzer at Carnegie Mellon University. "People with a stake in the system will make it work."
Mr. Wolf, of Rand, said, "Government-to-government aid is a political transaction, not a market transaction."
On the other side are mostly followers of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, who pleaded for Western aid to Germany after World War I. They include Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, who is the top Western economic adviser to the Government of Boris N. Yeltsin and the architect of reforms in Poland; Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist of the World Bank; Prof. Stanley Fischer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who preceded Mr. Summers at the World Bank, and Robert D. Hormats, an international economist who is a vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs.
This group argues that as much as $30 billion in financial assistance a year for several years may be needed to sustain Russia and other republics that pursue an I.M.F.-approved program to end the current financial crisis and to "privatize, marketize and monetize" their economies. The aid would cover nonessential imports and a fund to support the value of the ruble.
Such aid, the economists say, is a bargain compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars that the United States and other Western countries have been spending each year on the military against the perceived Soviet threat.
"The Russians have made a well-conceived start on the process of reform that is worthy of moral and financial support," said Mr. Summers of the World Bank. "Neither a debt deal nor provision of food relief are likely to assist in the task of stabilization and structural reform."
The Bush Administration, which has opened the door to multilateral financial assistance by sanctioning membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for Russia and five other republics, has not made any bilateral aid commitments beyond $1.8 billion in food credits to be used in the next few months.
 
Divergent Views
 The current debate reflects sharply divergent views of economic development, the role of government and the efficacy of foreign aid.
The conservatives, by and large, believe that the basic problem is not lack of resources in Russia but the absence of basic institutions -- property rights, a commercial code, sound money -- without which markets cannot function. They maintain that money from abroad would be wasted, stolen or, even worse, dampen the spontaneous growth of the private sector by bolstering the old bureaucracy. They cite as an example Africa, which after 30 years of foreign aid is far poorer.
The liberals, on the other hand, believe that aid can buy confidence and time for reforms to work. They point to Korea in the 50's, Europe after World War II and Mexico at the start of the 90's as examples of how foreign aid -- tied to strict conditions -- can play a vital and positive economic role.
"The Marshall Plan did not rebuild Europe," said Bradford deLong, an economic historian at Harvard University. "It worked because it pushed European governments toward policies that turned out to be very good for economic growth, such as free trade and private enterprise."
 
Role for Government
 The liberals also believe that government has a vital role to play in the former Soviet Union, namely in stabilizing an economy engulfed by hyperinflation, falling production and collapsing trade between republics. They argue that it is naive to expect Western institutions to take root in a collapsing economy.
Mr. Meltzer, Mr. Feldstein and other critics of largesse argue that Russia could raise plenty of cash for imports by selling some of its oil or mineral assets. Mr. Wolf also believes that official statistics, which do not measure the underground economy, are inflating the degree of economic distress.
Aid supporters doubt that asset sales could be organized quickly enough. "Russia has the resources to undertake economic reforms without external help," said Andrei Vavilov, a deputy to Yegor Gaidar, the head of the Yeltsin economic team. "But the reforms would be much more painful."
The point of sending money, Mr. Sachs of Harvard has emphasized repeatedly, is to buy time for reformers by easing the squeeze on living standards and instilling foreign confidence in the reforms.
But some think the aid would be wasted. "Giving the Russians money is a dreadful mistake," said Marshall Goldman, a Soviet expert on the faculty at Wellesley College. "This is not a dormant market system like Poland. We should not provide money until they have made major institutional changes."
Proponents of aid argue that such pessimism amounts to a self-fulfilling prophecy. "If this Government fails, there's absolutely no guarantee that we would be left with anything that we'd want to support," said Mr. Fischer of M.I.T. "This Government needs our help."
Besides, argues Mr. Summers of the World Bank, Russia's long-term growth potential is brighter than most people think. Relative to its low per-capita income -- half of Korea's and about the same as Mexico's -- Russia has a well-educated work force and lots of natural resources.
"The experience of Russian workers who get jobs immediately in Poland despite high unemployment there demonstrates that the work force is highly motivated," Mr. Summers said.
The biggest worry, though, is that aid will actually retard reform by giving struggling governments an easy way out.
"Even though the revolution of 1989 is two years old, the investment climate in Eastern Europe is by no means auspicious," said Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute. He notes, for example, that despite $10 billion in outside funds for Eastern Europe, the selloff of large and medium state companies has been painfully slow.
Sending the Russian Government lots of money could ease the pressure to downsize the military, argues Mr. Feldstein, the former Reagan adviser. "The idea of giving our former enemies aid without asking them to lay down their arms is a mistake, " he said. "The number of armies has increased dramatically and the military risks have gone up."
Advocates of aid respond by pointing out that aid would be tied to strict conditions that, if unmet, would mean a cutoff in funds. "There are all kinds of ways of doing it," said Anne Krueger, a development economist at Duke University and a former World Bank chief economist. "It has been done. It's not that hard."
Indeed, an I.M.F. team, which has been in Moscow since last Tuesday, is scheduled to issue a preliminary report around Jan. 25.
"At this point, no comprehensive stabilization and structural adjustment package has been negotiated," said one World Bank official, who spoke on the condition of not being named.
If the Yeltsin Government survives, and if the I.M.F. can hammer out an agreement with Mr. Yeltsin's economists with some chance of success, some loans will almost certainly be made, though not perhaps they will not be as generous as the Russians are hoping, officials at the World Bank and the I.M.F. said.
"There's a high risk in providing assistance that the assistance will be wasted, but it's probably worth the gamble," said Mr. Hormats of Goldman, Sachs, expressing perhaps better than anyone else who was interviewed what many are thinking.

HEADLINE: Scholarships for Jobless Engineers

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE, L.I., Jan. 17

 BODY:
In 1961, in the heady aftermath of Sputnik, in the age of the missile gap, some of the region's largest military contractors banded together to set up a school on the edge of an airfield here to train a new generation of engineers and scientists.
But three decades later, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and cuts in American defense spending, thousands of engineers who designed the planes, and missiles and electronic systems of modern warfare have been thrown out of work. 
 So last week the school, the Farmingdale campus of Polytechnic University, scrambling for both students and a new mission, began a novel advertising campaign: offering scholarships to laid-off engineers -- half off the regular tuition -- to attend to graduate school and retool. And their children will be offered the same discount to attend as undergraduates.
"This is not totally altruistic, I'll admit it" said Dr. Ernest Racz, provost of the Farmingdale campus, who came up with the idea after watching the collapse of some of Long Island's major defense contractors and seeing student enrollment fall almost in half over the last decade.
He said that the future of both the school and the defense-dependent Long Island economy hinged on whether engineers brought up in the safe cocoon of the defense industry can -- just like commissars of the old Soviet Union -- learn the management and technical skills needed to compete in global markets.
"We can no longer manufacture without paying attention to costs and quality," said Dr. Racz, a professor of management. "We can no longer get into a contract and redesign and redesign and add the costs into the contract."
The school was founded on 25 acres of land donated in 1961 by Republic Aviation, a few feet from an airport control tower in a flat expanse of Long Island known as "the cradle of the aviation industry."
Republic, once a huge manufacturer of military jets, and other military contractors like the Grumman Corporation -- which donated a building -- subsidized the tuition of employees who were sent to the school to improve their skills and get advanced degrees to meet the demands of Government contracts.
But in 1987, Republic, by then a subsidiary of Fairchild Industries, closed its operation on Long Island. Since then Grumman has laid off 9,000 people, about a third of its work force, and other contractors have reduced or closed their Long Island operations, as longstanding Government contracts dried up.
Over all, employment in durable goods industries on Long Island, mainly military work, has fallen by a third, or 42,000 since 1986, and is now below the level recorded as far back as 1975.
And while no one knows precisely how many of the 17,390 engineers counted in the last Government survey in 1988 are now out of work, estimates range into the thousands, with many, like Joseph Paris, out of work for a year or more.
 
Laid Off After 21 Years
 When Mr. Paris, an electrical engineer, was laid off by the Harris Corporation's Syosset office in July 1990, as a program manager working on weapon systems for F-14 and F-18 jets, after 21 years with the company, he was not at all surprised.
He had watched, he said, as a work force of nearly 3,000 dwindled to 700. "It wasn't that much of a shock because I knew that business had gone down tremendously," he said. "Most of the contracts finished up and the Government stopped buying additional equipment."
After 18 months of unemployment, Mr. Paris, who is 46 years old, said that "it is getting a bit difficult" to meet the payments on his house in Massapequa and support his three sons on his savings and severance pay.
He is trying to start his own business -- manufacturing an electronic system he developed to detect leaks on industrial roofs -- but he still shoots off his resume at the slightest prospect of a job within commuting distance and has begun to look for jobs in other parts of the country.
 
A Show of Faith
 In the fall, Mr. Paris took two courses at the Farmingdale campus without charge or credit toward a degree. It was the first stage of the effort organized by Dr. Racz to help unemployed engineers and scientists and to "show our faith in Long Island's technological future."
With almost no publicity, only a brief mention in a local newspaper, the program attracted 24 scientists and engineers who had lost their jobs, most of whom are still unemployed today. They brushed up on computer and management skills, shifting from designing hardware to programming software. Mr. Paris is trying to figure out how to set up his company and make it work.
Now the school is taking the program one step further, offering its new Long Island Technology Renaissance Scholarship to graduate students in engineering, computers or management who live on Long Island and are unemployed heads of households. Registration begins Tuesday morning.
The scholarship will cut the cost of a full-time student's tuition from $13,600, to $6,800, and if combined with other loans or scholarships could allow some students to attend with no cash outlay, school officials said.
Dr. Racz said it was too early to tell whether the new program would increase revenues by attracting more students or end up costing money. He said some of the school's current 407 undergraduates and 359 graduate students would probably qualify for the scholarship. Filling empty seats in most classes would not increase costs, but some additional laboratory sessions might have to be added, Dr. Racz said.
Despite declining enrollment and an unfulfilled pledge of $10 million by Robert Maxwell, the publishing executive who was found dead on his yacht in November, the school, previously known as Brooklyn Polytech, has a $55 million budget and is not operating at a deficit, school officials said.
Dr. Racz's idea is to draw in older engineers, teach them new specialities, and at the same time draw them away from the "old culture" to the latest in quality control, cost accounting practices, and management.
"What needs to happen is a turn around of attitude within the engineer ranks," he said.
This ties in to the high-tech dreams of Long Island planners, who recognize that the Island's high labor and utility costs make it unlikely that ordinary manufacturers will replace the declining defense industry.
"We are talking about thoughtware industries that require thinking, brainpower, and a high level of sophisticated training," said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist with the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "Retraining will set the stage for renewed economic growth."

HEADLINE: Recession Puts a Harsh Spotlight On Hefty Pay of Top Executives

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The heft of an executive's pay packet used to be a matter of only passing interest outside the corporate community. The highest-paid executives, ranked in business magazines each spring, were seasonal celebrities at best, envied by their peers, attacked by corporate gadflies.
Yet, suddenly, executive pay has become a national issue. The slumping economy, layoffs, an election year and President Bush's decision to take a retinue of highly paid executives on his recent trip to Japan, where company chiefs are paid far less, have focused a harsh spotlight on corporate pay. 
 "Executive pay is the real hot-button issue for institutional investors," said James E. Heard, president of Institutional Shareholder Services, an adviser to big investors. "It's typical of what's wrong with American management and why the U.S. is not more competitive economically."
The multimillion-dollar paychecks of executives, critics say, are to the ailing American economy what Imelda Marcos's 3,000 pairs of shoes were to the troubles of the Philippines -- a powerful symbol and a symptom of deeper problems. Among the executives whose salary and stock options critics like to point to are Steven J. Ross and N. J. Nicholas Jr., co-chief executives of Time Warner, who together made $99.6 million in 1990; Paul B. Fireman of Reebok International, $33.3 million; Leon C. Hirsch of U.S. Surgical, $15 million; Rand V. Araskog of ITT, $11.5 million, and Michael D. Eisner of Walt Disney, $11.2 million.
The justification for high executive pay is that some corporate leaders deserve their rewards as much as sports and entertainment stars do. And most management experts agree that some chief executives deserve astronomical pay, especially if they start a company or save one. Mr. Eisner, for example, is often cited in the savior category for his tenure as chief executive of the Walt Disney Company.
But skeptics say the genuine corporate superstars are few. And big investors, management consultants and economists say the real issues are that the high pay of executives too often bears no relation to the performance of the companies they run and that the pay levels are set by board members and compensation advisers hand-picked by the chief executives.
The criticism of executive pay points to a larger issue: American corporations are too often managed by executives who are not directly accountable to shareholders but to the directors whom they typically select. That lack of accountability, the critics say, makes American companies insular and less competitive internationally.
 
Congressional Proposals
 There are already bills before Congress that would change the way executive pay is determined or restrict it. Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, has proposed opening the pay-setting process to shareholder votes. A more radical bill from Representative Martin O. Sabo, Democrat of Minnesota, would increase taxes on any company that chooses to pay its executives more than 25 times the company's lowest-paid worker. Senate hearings on executive pay are scheduled for later this month.
Most experts say the Congressional efforts are helpful in bringing national attention to the issue, but pressure from large institutional shareholders, the main owners of Corporate America, is the more appropriate way to change the way executives are paid and companies are run.
Some big investors, like the California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest public pension fund in America, with assets of $68 billion, are now meeting with the chief executives of selected companies about their pay policies.
The gap between executive pay and performance will likely be highlighted in the next few months, when the results for 1991 are sent to shareholders in proxy statements.
Last year, corporate profits fell an estimated 21 percent, and starting in October, worker cutbacks reached a rate of 2,600 a day. But because interest rates fell and money flowed into the stock market, corporate share prices rose 26 percent over the year. And a big chunk of executive pay in the United States comes in the form of share grants and stock options, the right to purchase shares at a given price over a few years' time. How the noncash compensation is valued is a subject of debate, and executives like Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas of Time Warner say estimates of their pay are greatly overstated as a result.
Still the sharp rise in the stock market last year will mean a big jump in total compensation for executives during tough times. According to an estimate by Stephen O'Byrne of Towers Perrin, a consulting firm, the stock market surge last year means a gain of $2.63 million for the average chief executive in the 100 largest corporations in America, based on the appreciation of shares and options they held at the start of 1991. That gain comes on top of the average cash payment at $1.3 million each for these chief executives, assuming that cash pay will remain about the same as in 1990.
 
'A Very Big Target'
 In short, chief executives on average could triple their basic salaries, to nearly $4 million, simply because of the stock market. To be sure, executives may not have cashed in those shares and options last year. But it is a big gain all the same.
"These chief executives are giving all their critics a very big target," said Robert A. G. Monks, president of Institutional Shareholder Partners, an advisory service for big investors.
There have been a couple of successful assaults on pay policies in recent months. In September, for example, the ITT Corporation announced that it would change the way it compensates senior executives to link pay more closely to corporate performance, including the stock price. The shift followed protests from the United Shareholders Association, an advocacy group, and the California pension fund over the $11.5 million Mr. Araskog received in pay in 1990, even though the company had a lackluster year.
Earlier this month, the UAL Corporation yielded to pressure and announced that it would fully disclose details of how its cash and stock payments to executives were determined and what outside compensation consultant was hired.
The change came after pressure from United Shareholders and others because the company's chief executive, Stephen M. Wolf, profited handsomely in 1990, mainly from selling stock and exercising options in the brief period when talks of a buyout for United Airlines, UAL's principal subsidiary, pushed up the price of UAL shares. The deal fell through, the stock plummeted and UAL's profits were down 70 percent for the year, but Mr. Wolf sold stock and options he had accumulated over the previous few years and pocketed $14.7 million in 1990.
United Shareholders plans to press other companies to open their executive pay policies through increased public disclosure. "More sunshine on the process of how pay is set puts their feet to the fire," said Ralph Whitworth, president of United Shareholders, "because the process to a large degree drives the formula."
One provision sought by shareholders' groups and institutional investors is that executives should not be able to exercise their stock options unless the company's share price has risen a set amount, usually 25 percent or more, over five years, insuring that rewards are linked to long-term performance and not swings in the stock market.
 
Outpace Foreign Executives
 The executives in charge of America's largest companies are more highly paid than their counterparts overseas. During 1990, Graef Crystal, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, estimates that chief executives of America's biggest companies typically made $3.2 million. In contrast, big-company chief executives in Britain made $1.1 million; in Germany, $800,000, and in Japan, $525,000.
The gaps are partly explained by different business practices and cultures. In Japan, for example, one reason for the modest paychecks is that there is so little labor mobility, because job-hopping is deemed unacceptable behavior. In addition, Japanese chiefs are given costly club memberships and other rewards that are lavish by any standard.
 
Stock Is the Key
 But much of the gap between executive pay in the United States and most other nations is explained by the American practice of showering executives with stock options, which cost companies very little because of accounting conventions in the United States. Of the $3.2 million typical pay in 1990, half the total was the estimated value of noncash compensation like stock options.
"Stock options are way too cheap for American companies, and they have been given out like crazy," Mr. Crystal said. The accounting treatment of stock options is being examined by Congress and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the rule-making body for the accounting profession.
Whatever the reasons, executive pay soared in recent years while the inflation-adjusted wages of manufacturing workers declined by roughly 10 percent in the last decade. The income gap between top executives and workers has doubled over the last 15 years.
"Just as the 1980's were the decade of conspicuous consumption, it was also the decade of conspicuous compensation for executives," said Paula Hans Todd, a principal of Towers Perrin. "But the pressures for some kind of restraint are building, and we're going to see the effects."

HEADLINE: Rohatyn Warns Albany on Credit Dangers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 19

 BODY:
New York state and its local governments could lose access to some credit markets if state officials do not reach an agreement quickly on a budget, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation warned today.
"If there isn't a budget agreement pretty soon in Albany and the state gets downgraded again, I think the people should understand that they're not just talking about an increase in interest rates, but of possible real problems with market access," Felix G. Rohatyn, the corporation chairman, said. 
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is scheduled to unveil his proposed budget, for the state fiscal year that begins April 1, on Tuesday.
In the last two weeks, two leading Wall Street firms have dropped the ratings on some state bonds.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
In Selloff, Some See Opportunity

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Despite risks that long-term interest rates could rise further in coming weeks, many portfolio managers and analysts contend that the sharp selloff in the bond market over the last two weeks represents an opportunity to buy.
Long- and short-term interest rates are now higher than they were on Dec. 19, the day before the Federal Reserve Board startled and delighted the financial markets with its bold 1 percent cut in the discount rate. 
 Rates could go higher still in coming weeks, analysts said, especially if factors that have preyed on the bond market since the start of the New Year persist.
Dealing with a huge volume of new corporate debt securities has created technical problems for investment banks that deal in both corporate and government securities, and will continue to do so as long as there is a heavy load of new issues.
 
Washington Policy Worries
 Worries about Washington's policy answers to the nation's economic problems will linger until scores of trial balloons are burst and the concrete outlines of a fiscal package emerges.
Finally, market participants need to look beyond recent statements of several Fed policy makers and reassure themselves that the central bank has not moved to the sidelines of the economic-recovery game.
"I am still a little bit concerned," that rates could go higher, said Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and monetary economist at Lehman Brothers. "My guess is that sentiment will remain negative between now and the end of the month."
But Mr. Slifer and others insist that those risks are ephemeral. Of more lasting consequence, they argue, are the fact that the economy remains weak and is unlikely to rebound strongly and the prospect that inflation will remain low. Those fundamentals form the cornerstone of their case that rates will move lower and that buying bonds now makes sense.
 
Time to Invest?
 "The fact that rates have backed up by 25 basis points or so is an opportunity to put some money to work," said William H. Gross, a managing director at the Pacific Investment Management Company, a Newport Beach, Calif., concern with more than $32 billion in fixed-income assets under management. "And I am not so sure that in this type of rate environment you want to wait."
Mike Niedermeyer, a senior vice president and head of the fixed-income department at Wells Fargo Bank, said, "We think we are near the lows for this cycle." But he added that "bond yields will fall below 7 percent" before those levels are reached.
The case against a quick, strong recovery is persuasive, analysts contend.
Soundings from early January show the Fed's discount rate cut did nothing to stimulate auto sales. Nor did the cut do much to improve the public's confidence, as shown in the results of the University of Michigan's midmonth sounding of consumer attitudes. And the barrage of cuts in short-term interest rates over the last six months have thus far failed to generate stronger growth in the money supply.
 
Consumers in a Funk
 Without a rise in car sales, economists say it is difficult to imagine that manufacturing output, dead in the water at year-end, will accelerate. And sales of cars and most other items are unlikely to perk up if consumers stay in a funk.
"Industrial commodity prices show no signs of lifting, and consumer sentiment and comfort indexes show no signs of improving as a result of the discount rate cut," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist of C. J. Lawrence Inc. "I liked bonds when they were yielding under 7.40 percent. And I like them even more at 7.60 percent," their current level.
Recent statements by a number of Fed governors, including John P. LaWare and Wayne D. Angell, strongly suggest that further cuts in short-term rates would do little to help bolster the economy.
The comments have troubled analysts, but many consider the remarks a smokescreen.
"I would be surprised if Mr. Greenspan wants to make a move before Congress comes back into session," said Stuart G. Hoffman, vice president and senior economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh. "But I don't think he will wait for four or five months to see what Congress is going to do, particularly if the data show the economy is contracting in the first quarter, as it now appears."
"If money supply growth languishes at the bottom end of the Fed's target growth range and the employment reports continue to be weak, then he will be on the move."
 
Markets Closed Today
 With fixed-income markets closed today in observance of the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and with little substantive economic information expected this week, analysts said trading activity would probably be thin and price movements erratic.
"This is a trading market, not a position market," said Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a New York financial consulting firm. "That means you need to take smaller positions and be quicker about getting in and out of them."
The only report with the potential to generate any real interest for market participants is housing data for December, which are expected to be released on Wednesday.
The message from the residential construction figures is likely to be mixed, said Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
The good news is that housing starts and building permits probably rebounded in December, reversing a big decline in November. But if his projected 1.8 percent increase in housing starts is accurate, the increase will still leave total housing starts at 150,000 dwellings below the 1.16 million units started in 1975, the previous all-time low.
"Barring a December miracle," Mr. Jones wrote in the firm's weekly Comments on Credit, "housing starts slumped to record lows during 1991."

HEADLINE: More Suppliers Helping Stores Push the Goods

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Not very long ago, a West Coast drugstore chain told Brown & Haley, maker of fancy chocolates, that the chainwould probably stop selling boxed chocolates because they were not profitable.
The news did not surprise Mark T. Haley, president of the Tacoma, Wash., candy company founded by his grandfather. 
 He and manufacturers of everything from ink pens to vacuum cleaners are finding that stores are quickly eliminating from their shelves almost any merchandise that does not contribute to their bottom line because every penny counts in the highly promotional retail environment.
 
Aiding the Retailer
 Faced with the loss of the Pay'n Save chain, one of his largest accounts, Mr. Haley jumped in and did what more and more suppliers find themselves doing: He came up with a plan to help the retailer make a profit.
All around the country, manufacturers are scrambling to establish such "partnerships" with their most important customers, hoping to insure outlets for their goods. In today's sour retail climate, merchants are less inclined to spend their own money and employee time to fuss with new displays and promotions.
That has left suppliers like Brown & Haley, Wrangler jeans and Bic pens to prove they can make their goods sell.
In Mr. Haley's case, he persuaded Pay'n Save to try a marketing program he devised based on consumer research. His company pitched in with a catchy, sexy print advertising campaign. The ads thrust Brown & Haley chocolates into the class of fine European candies with phrases like "the one the Swiss aren't neutral about" and "enough to melt an English stiff upper lip."
 
Taste Tests and Promotions
 The ads are backed up by in-store taste tests and promotions, while a retinue of Brown & Haley-supplied clerks tend to displays and stock the shelves.
In short, Brown & Haley has assumed many of the retail functions needed to persuade shoppers to buy its chocolates.
Although taking on marketing and inventory tasks adds to suppliers' costs, several said the ultimate result -- selling more of their products faster -- was well worth the extra expense. While they cannot say specifically that the programs have yet increased sales, even during the crucial holiday season, manufacturers say the programs have definitely increased their volume over all.
"The more important we are to our retailers, the less they can afford to get rid of us," Mr. Haley explained. "It's called job security."
The results of his strategy are yet to be seen, but at least the 125-store Pay'n Save chain is still carrying his products.
"The balance of power has shifted to the retailer more than ever before because the leveraged buyouts and consolidation in the retail industry have left fewer stores than ever before," said Adam Hanft, president of Slater Hanft Martin, a New York advertising agency. He and other retailing experts say they have recently started helping more clients plan in-store marketing strategies.
 
Changes in Industry
 "It's not as if manufacturers have the ability anymore to play one retailer off against the other," he added. "There just aren't enough left."
More manufacturers are taking on merchandising and inventory management responsibilities as beleaguered retailers, battered by changes in the industry and weakened by the recession, foist more of their functions onto their suppliers.
In the last two years, Retail Planning Associates, a consulting company in Columbus, Ohio, has added several manufacturers to its roster of retail clients. For the first time, manufacturers like Wrangler, Owens-Corningand Black & Decker are seeking the consulting firm's advice on everything from inventory management to display gimmicks to enhance sales of their products -- sales they once counted on retailers to create.
"Many manufacturers are feeling as though their products are not being effectively presented at the retail level because of the financial and creative constraints many retailers are under," said Randall E. Gebhardt, senior partner at Retail Planning Associates. "There's a perception that retailers simply aren't doing a good job of selling things."
Mr. Gebhardt said several merchandising systems designed by manufacturers had helped his customers increase sales. When those display strategies are coupled with a computer system that automatically generates orders by monitoring sales off the shelf so that a store never has to be out of stock on items that sell well, retailers' profit margins increase and manufacturers sell more products, he said.
 
Wrangler's New Program
 Wrangler has begun the Wrangler Partners Program, a five-part retail service program for key customers. Under the program, Wrangler participates in advertising and displaying its products, while keeping an eye on inventories to make sure its retailers are never out of stock and that the mix of its products in a store produces the maximum amount of sales.
Its partnerships allow Wrangler a peek into the mind of the shopper. By seeing precisely what is selling and what is not, a manufacturer can better tailor rates of production.
"For the first time, we're doing our planning and forecasting based on consumer demands instead of retailers' orders, which really takes us directly to the source," said Brian Goldberg, vice president of retail services at Wrangler. "It makes both us and the retailer much more efficient because we have the right merchandise at the right time in the right place."
Retail Planning Associates is also developing an in-store merchandising system for Wrangler that attempts to distinguish its clothing from that made by other manufacturers and sold in the same area. For instance, consultants say placing goods in wooden racks instead of on the standard chrome ones will enhance the perception of Wrangler clothing.
 
Free Etched Pen
 Gary Prushansky, Bic's director of marketing, said the company's extended relationship with retailers allowed both to keep costs as low as possible, so Bic pens and lighters can be sold at a lower price with a higher margin. Through computer links to key accounts, Bic knows precisely what is selling and can replenish stock within a few days as opposed to weeks. The quicker it restocks its customers, the more products it can sell.
Bic also works with its retail customers on promotions and marketing plans. For example, it recently began selling a lighter package that included a free pen etched with the name of the store where the lighter was sold. Shoppers are also likely to notice that Bic pens and lighters are in stock, instead of going into a store only to find their favorite Bic products are sold out.
"We didn't do anything like that five years ago," Mr. Prushansky said. "It was more that the manufacturer solely looked to do what was good for the manufacturer and the retailer did what was good for the retailer. Now we understand that we can both benefit more from partnership."
While manufacturers generally welcome the opportunity to more directly influence the sale of their products, many retail experts worry that store operators are abdicating too many of their functions to their suppliers. They say that by thrusting traditional retail responsibilities onto manufacturers, retailers are reducing themselves to landlords, merely renting out floor and shelf space instead of marketing the merchandise they stock.
"Once again, the retailer is relinquishing another piece of his sovereignty," said Marvin J. Rothenberg, head of a Fairlawn, N.J., retail consulting firm that bears his name.
The danger in drawing vendors into store operations, he said, is that once manufacturers realize that they are doing many of the tasks once assigned to retailers, they may be tempted to bypass their customers and set up competing stores.
But most manufacturers say starting and sustaining a retail operation is too risky a prospect. The changes in distribution and in-store marketing of goods has given them the best of both worlds: They do market research and inventory and stocking chores, but the retailers ultimately assume the risk.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
For Relief, Try Thatcher

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Nasty business is going on between the United States and Western Europe, and it could seriously damage this week's multi-nation conference in Washington on relief aid to the republics of the former Soviet Union.
What Euro-American parties need is a bold idea to overcome mutual suspicions about burden- and power-sharing and political credit-grabbing. They need someone of international stature such as a Margaret Thatcher or Helmut Schmidt to coordinate emergency efforts all believe essential. At a minimum, the conference should set up a high-powered executive committee to do the job. 
 Bush Administration officials are not even considering such ideas. Fearful now of European sensibilities, they are focusing on the small and practical goals of creating working groups to better coordinate short-term aid and of squeezing money from the Persian Gulf states and Japan.
But the working group idea is too small and is certainly inadequate to contain European-American power struggles and grievances. Nor can it begin to meet the herculean task of giving fragile new democracies a chance to survive their winter trials.
Tensions within the West were to be expected. The cold war's end had to mean a decline in American influence and a weightier Western Europe, especially a more assertive Germany. But the tensions are turning into mutual recriminations about motives and self-dealing, and they are tumbling out of control.
The continuing tug-of-war over NATO's future and the resistance of many West European states to reducing farm subsidies frame the disturbing story. Europeans accuse Americans of trying to keep a stranglehold over Continental affairs, even as U.S. forces depart. Americans charge Europeans with ingratitude for past sacrifices. President Bush, responding to European foot-dragging on free trade, blames them for bringing down an "Iron Curtain" of protectionism.
Germany has been generous toward the remnants of the former Soviet empire and deserves full credit. But it has acted in its own interests as well by paying Moscow to remove Soviet troops from German soil. And German leaders do not give fair credit to Washington for its aid efforts. Adding up just emergency relief last year, America's contribution about equaled Germany's. German leaders stir up dangerous and unjustified anti-American feelings by claiming otherwise.
France has been equally troublesome, as usual. French leaders complain about a U.S. proposal to use NATO personnel and computers to manage the collection and delivery of food and medicine to the ex-Soviet states. Paris calls it an American scheme to manufacture chores for a U.S.-led NATO that has outlived its usefulness. But the fact is that the European Community staff now overseeing national contributions to Russia and others is totally overwhelmed, and NATO's logistical capabilities are unmatched. France helps no one, least of all the starving, by standing in the way of such practical solutions.
The Bush Administration, to be sure, did not help matters by announcing the aid conference without the necessary consultations. That only fed suspicions about Americans trying to take credit where Europeans merited at least equal share.
Administration officials know they made a mistake. But they overcompensate now by making the conference an overly modest affair. They are right not to transform the meeting into a massive cash-pledging affair to stabilize the ex-Soviet economies. That larger enterprise must await some semblance of economic order in the republics, though donors -- especially the U.S. -- should increase emergency aid. The U.S. aims too low in seeking only working groups for food, medicine, housing, energy and technical aid.
The task is far too big, complicated and urgent for anything less than a new international staff, backed by NATO logistical support and headed by someone with the clout to insure that cooperation is more than a word. As things now stand, no one has a workable picture of who is doing what, let alone what should be done.
To clear the Euro-American air and get the job done, Mr. Bush can afford to give the necessary authority to a European leader or a European-led committee. And Europeans might be ready to stop their sniping and show they can lead.

American Film Magazine Sees the End

 BODY:
American Film magazine, which once aspired to gain a broad audience with serious, gossip-free articles about movies and television, has ceased publication after failing to reverse a decline in circulation.
Last week, the bimonthly's list of about 58,000 subscribers and other assets were sold to Entertainment Weekly, a more mass-appeal competitor of American Film's, for an undisclosed sum. 
 The final issue of American Film, available at some newsstands, has Armand Assante, the star of the soon-to-be released film "Mambo Kings," on the cover, along with long articles about the movie "Naked Lunch" and the director Pedro Almodovar.
 
Flashy Competitors
 Executives at BPI Communications L.P., American Film's parent company, said the magazine's sober approach to film did not draw enough readers to make it attractive to advertisers.
In recent years, the magazine's position was further eroded by stiff competition from more flashy and gossipy new publications like Premiere and Movieline, which appeal to a much broader audience.
Those problems were compounded by the recession, which has hit the magazine industry hard; last week, the Publishers Information Bureau reported that last year's decline in magazine advertising pages was the worst in 30 years. Two other magazines, Connoisseur and New York Woman, also closed recently because of dwindling advertising.
"American Film had its own unique niche, but it had been losing money for years," said Ann Haire, BPI's senior vice president and general manager of circulation in New York. "It never had enough circulation to compete for major consumer-type advertisers."
American Film's paid circulation averaged about 90,000 in the first six months of 1991, the most recent period available, down from a high of 135,000 in the mid-1980's, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reports. By comparison, Premiere had a circulation of about 490,000, and Entertainment Weekly's circulation exceeded 600,000.
Several former editors contend that BPI hastened the demise of American Film by cutting its budget, while trying to make its editorial content more competitive with other movie magazines.
American Film was founded in 1975 by the nonprofit American Film Institute in Washington. All members of the institute received a free subscription.
The magazine tried to approach film as art, the former editors said, without writing in a style that would be limited to graduate students. Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis and William Kennedy were among the contributors in earlier years. Its lists of the 10 best unproduced screenplays attracted widespread attention in Hollywood.
"We were trying to appeal to an upscale audience," said Peter Biskind, the editor in chief from 1981 to 1987, who is now executive editor at Premiere in New York. "We were trying to shoot for the Atlantic Monthly-Harper's crowd."
 
Sale of American Film
 The magazine was sold to BPI in 1988 as that company was expanding into entertainment and advertising trade publishing. BPI also publishes The Hollywood Reporter and Adweek magazine.
Executives at Entertainment Weekly said they were talking with the American Film Institute about the possibility of co-sponsoring its Los Angeles Film Festival and offering free memberships in the institute as an incentive to Entertainment Weekly subscribers.

HEADLINE: How Kennedy Viewed the Vietnam Conflict

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The theme of the Oliver Stone film "J.F.K." is that President John F. Kennedy planned to withdraw from Vietnam and that to prevent this, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and possibly people close to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson conspired to assassinate him. Most of this is palpable nonsense, but as Kennedy's Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, the officer responsible for Vietnam, I can testify that the first point is essentially true and correct.
On numerous occasions President Kennedy told me that he was determined not to let Vietnam become an American war. He agreed to have Americans serve as advisers, and he also authorized American pilots training Vietnamese to fly T-28's to do the actual flying -- covertly -- in bombing missions inside South Vietnam. But he refused every suggestion to send American combat forces. 
 Once, at that time, you reported in a small front-page box that some American major general was visiting Vietnam. The President called me at home and in decidedly purple language took me to task for letting an American general visit Vietnam. "Remember Laos," he said on this and other occasions; the United States, he said, must keep a low profile in Vietnam so we can negotiate its neutralization as we had in Laos.
When he paused for breath, I pointed out that I had no authority to deny a general permission to visit Vietnam -- in fact, I had not even known about the trip. "Oh," said the President and slammed down the phone without even saying goodbye. That afternoon a National Security Action Memorandum came out saying that no officer of flag or general rank could visit Vietnam without the written permission of the Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs.
When Kennedy took office, Laos was the hot spot, and the departing President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, warned Kennedy he might have to fight there. If so, Eisenhower said, he would support the decision. Over the next few weeks Kennedy made several hawkish public statements. But after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba, he changed his attitude. He told several people, including Richard Nixon, that since "the American people do not want to use troops to remove a Communist regime only 90 miles away, how can I ask them to use troops to remove one 9,000 miles away?"
Shortly after the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy sent W. Averell Harriman to head the Geneva negotiations on Laos. Harriman was fond of saying that he got the instructions for six months of negotiations in a five-minute telephone conversation. "All these people want me to go for a military solution in Laos," Kennedy told Harriman, "but that is impossible. What I want you to do is find a political solution."
When South Vietnam asked for more aid in 1961, Kennedy sent Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor and Walt W. Rostow to Vietnam to investigate. They recommended not only an increase in aid and advisers, but also 10,000 U.S. combat troops. Kennedy approved of the aid and advisers but refused to send troops. According to Roswell Gilpatric, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, even sending advisers was done reluctantly.
President Kennedy is sometimes quoted as citing the so-called domino theory that if South Vietnam fell, the rest of Southeast Asia would follow. But the quote is taken out of context. It was in answer to a question not about troops or fighting but about why Kennedy continued to send Vietnam economic and military aid.
Arthur Schlesinger Jr., in his book "Robert Kennedy and His Times," documents other episodes showing President Kennedy's determination not to let Vietnam become an American war. One was when Gen. Douglas MacArthur told him it would be foolish to fight again in Asia and that the problem should be solved at the diplomatic table. Later General Taylor said that MacArthur's views made "a hell of an impression on the President . . . so that whenever he'd get this military advice from the Joint Chiefs or from me or anyone else, he'd say, 'Well, now, you gentlemen, you go back and convince General MacArthur, then I'll be convinced.' "
Referring to the recommendation that Taylor and Rostow made to send troops, Taylor said: "The last thing he [Kennedy] wanted was to put in our ground forces. . . . I don't recall anyone who was strongly against [the recommendation], except one man and that was the President."
In a press conference in March 1962, Kennedy said that sending combat troops would be "a basic change . . . which calls for a constitutional decision, [and] of course I would go to the Congress."
In July 1962 Kennedy ordered Defense Secretary Robert McNamara to start planning for the phased withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from Vietnam, but it was not until May 1963 that the Pentagon produced a plan. Before his tragic death in an airplane crash, John McNaughton, Assistant Secretary of Defense for international affairs, said he understood President Kennedy wanted to close out Vietnam by 1965, "whether it was in good shape or bad."
The historical record, in sum, is clear: President Kennedy was determined not to let Vietnam become an American war -- that is, he was determined not to send U.S. combat troops (as opposed to advisers) to fight in Vietnam nor to bomb North Vietnam. This does not prove he would have withdrawn completely, including the 16,500 advisers. However, the record is clear that he had laid the groundwork for doing so. Shortly before his death, he took the first step by ordering the first 1,000 advisers home.

HEADLINE: Apathy Is Seen Greeting Agony Of the Homeless

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
A decade after homeless and destitute people began flooding city streets, religious leaders say they fear that Americans are beginning to turn away from the outstretched hands, numbed by the severity of the problem and confused about how to respond.
The compassion that in the 1980's led to shelters, soup kitchens and other private efforts to help the victims of bad economic times has not disappeared, they say, but some fear that it is in danger of being overwhelmed. 
 According to the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, Americans are divided over whether the pervasiveness of homelessness has dulled the country's concern. But younger respondents, those who came of age in the 1980's, were more likely to say that homelessness no longer upsets people.
A large proportion of people taking part in the survey said they considered homelessness a problem that government could address.
 
A Shared Ambivalence
 While warning that resignation to the plight of the desperately poor could have a broad impact on the nation's values in the future, many of the spiritual leaders see the danger as arising not from callousness, but from a sense of powerlessness. And on a personal level they acknowledge that they share some of the same ambivalence.
"The daily encounters harden many of us to some degree," said the Rev. Joan B. Campbell of New York City, executive director of the National Council of Churches. "You do walk past. I've often said, 'What is this doing to me?' "
Similar sentiments were expressed by Sister Mary Rose McGeady of New York, president of Covenant House, the refuge for runaway adolescents. "The terrible agony of it all hits me constantly," she said. "Do you give money or don't you? Are you turning away the Christ who stands in front of you in rags, or are you becoming an accomplice in someone's self-destruction?"
Robert Coles, the author and child psychiatrist who lectures on literature and ethics at Harvard University, said the topic of responding to the destitute had spurred some of the sharpest conflicts in discussions of the subject by students there.
The Times/CBS News Poll showed striking differences in the views of people in various age groups. In the survey, 55 percent of respondents 18 to 29 years old said most people had become so used to seeing the homeless that they were no longer upset by the sight. Of those questioned who were 30 to 44 years old, 45 percent assessed the public's mood in that way, as did 41 percent of those 45 to 64 years old, and 30 percent of respondents over 64.
While the survey cannot be construed as showing that acceptance of homelessness is growing, religious leaders expressed that concern in interviews conducted last week.
The persistence of homelessness and poverty on the streets is having "a very insidious effect," warned Bishop Paul Moore. Before retiring in 1989 as Episcopal bishop of New York, he led an effort to press officials for more aid.
Like other religious leaders, Bishop Moore emphasized the importance of the work that privately organized groups do for the homeless and the hungry, but he insisted that even the best charitable efforts could not substitute for effective government action.
"As for what people should do, I favor an intensive drive to get Presidential candidates to take notice of the issue," he said. "There's been little in any of the speeches I've heard."
In fact, seven out of 10 people who responded to the Times/CBS News Poll say that homelessness is "something the government can do a lot about" rather than a problem "beyond the government's control." That view was given by respondents across the political spectrum: 65 percent of Republicans, 70 percent of independents and 75 percent of Democrats. Fifty-nine percent of people who identified themselves as conservatives said so, as well as 75 percent of moderates and 84 percent of liberals.
The survey also showed that nearly six in 10 Americans now say they are seeing the homeless in their own communities or on their way to work rather than encountering them only through television or reading. This is a significant change since 1986, when the Times/CBS News Poll first asked the question. Then, nearly 6 in 10 respondents said homelessness was something they read about or saw on television.
The new nationwide telephone poll of 1,376 adults was conducted Jan. 6 to Jan. 8 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
Indifference May Lie Ahead
 The question of whether what has been a considerable reservoir of sympathy for the homeless will give way to indifference or even anger as Americans steel themselves against constant pleas for help is the opposite of the concern that Michael Harrington raised more than three decades ago in "The Other America."
Mr. Harrington began that book, which is frequently credited as an inspiration for the anti-poverty campaigns of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, by arguing that poverty persisted in America because it had become "invisible." The poor were concentrated in rural areas or inner-city neighborhoods that many people seldom visited and poverty was further disguised by the availability of inexpensive decent clothing, according to that argument.
Now people begging for money often stand several to a block in major cities and in great numbers in bus and train stations. One response has been the measures taken by cities like New York, Atlanta and Santa Barbara, Calif., to restrict begging, prohibit sleeping in public areas or oust homeless people encamped in train or bus stations.
A 1987 survey by the Urban Institute said there were 500,000 to 600,000 people homeless on any given night nationwide. Martha Burt of the institute added that in the course of a year perhaps twice as many people find themselves homeless at some time.
Elfreda Harris, 28 years old, who participated in the Times/CBS News Poll and who agreed to be interviewed, said she recently returned to Prattville, Ala., after four years in Chicago. When she first moved to Chicago, she said, "I'd reach into my pocket, and before long I'd just walk on by -- just got used to the fact."
Another of the religious leaders interviewed, the Rev. Spencer C. Gibbs, the newly appointed General Presbyter for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in New York City, said that in walking about a mile and a half in Manhattan recently, "I counted upwards of 33-34 black men on one side of the street begging for loose change. As a black man, it makes me depressed."
He asked: "What effect does this have on the young black children, especially males, who repeatedly see black men on the streets shabbily dressed and apparently unable to provide for themselves?"
One religious leader who doubts that Americans are coming to accept the plight of the homeless is the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who said that he thought "America is too good a nation to let such a problem go unsolved." He said he believed that churches, businesses and non-governmental groups could meet their needs "if everyone were willing to provide a meal or two or a few hours of work." But he also said, "Someone in government has got to start thinking again of government-sponsored work projects."
Others argued that just as Americans were growing discouraged by the ambiguities behind giving money to destitute people, efforts to solve such problems through private voluntarism would end in frustration unless supplemented with political pressure for new government initiatives on housing, poverty and employment.
The Rev. Thomas J. Harvey, executive director of the national coordinating office for Catholic Charities programs, expressed frustration that many religious groups were being forced to assume the role of "safety net."
The number of volunteers working in Catholic Charities programs has gone from 23,000 in 1980 to almost 200,000 a decade later, Father Harvey said, but this should not be viewed as a satisfactory solution.
"I favor encouraging voluntarism, but it's no substitute for social policy," he said. "I don't think people are into burnout, they're into frustration, because we haven't had a domestic agenda utilizing the best bipartisan thinking."

HEADLINE: Aristide Insists on Overhaul of the Haitian Army

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, whose elected Government was overthrown in a coup on Sept. 30, insisted today that there could be no settlement of the Haitian political crisis without the removal of the army chief and a thorough reorganization of the military.
President Aristide, a populist priest who won Haiti's first genuinely democratic election 13 months ago with more than two-thirds of the vote, was also guarded in accepting the view of the Organization of American States that naming a new Prime Minister would constitute a political solution to the Haitian crisis. 
 Any immediate changes in the status of the army and its chief, Gen. Raoul Cedras, are not part of that political agreement. General Cedras, who said that the President was ousted because he had become a threat to democracy, apparently raised no objections to the O.A.S. political formula that would allow Father Aristide to return.
Today, President Aristide said in an interview that General Cedras had the choice of going to jail or leaving the country before democracy could be restored. But he said ordinary soldiers would be granted amnesty. He accused the military of narcotics trafficking and corruption and called the general and his associates killers responsible for 1,500 to 2,000 deaths and the forced exile of 10,000 political refugees.
"I repeat, political refugees," he said, emphasizing that he rejected the view of United States officials that many Haitians flee for economic reasons.
Diplomats close to the negotiations with President Aristide say that army leaders do not disagree fundamentally that the modernization of the armed forces is important. They would ultimately also accept the creation of a separate unpoliticized police force, which President Aristide is demanding, the diplomats say.
This would take considerable time, they said. Insistence on restructuring the military at the same time that the Aristide Government is restored could prevent a quick settlement.
On Jan. 8, the O.A.S. announced that all parties including President Aristide had accepted Rene Theodore as a new Prime Pinister. Like the President, Mr. Theodore, the leader of the Haitian Communist Party, spent years in exile during the regimes of Francois Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude. American diplomats regard Mr. Theodore as a moderate willing to embrace democracy and a free-market economy. His selection is subject to ratification by the Haitian Parliament.
Today, in an interview in Washington, where he is waiting to meet with Mr. Theodore and a parliamentary delegation, President Aristide said he was not in a position to accept Mr. Theodore as Prime Minister until the two could discuss a future government.
"I have met him only four times in my life, and spoken to him once on the telephone," said President Aristide, speaking in English.
While awaiting Mr. Theodore, who has delayed his trip to Washington for further discussions in Haiti, the exiled President has met with the O.A.S. Secretary General, Joao Clementa Baena Soares, and other officials.
President Aristide, who has been living in Caracas, Venezuela, since the Sept. 30 coup, sidestepped a question about which Americans he hoped to see on his visit here. Many of his supporters are critical of the United States, saying it could be more active in punishing the coup leaders, some of whom are reported to have American bank accounts and visas that allow them to visit this country frequently.
President Aristide would say only that many Haitians would like the United States to tighten its economic embargo on Haiti so that the military would feel the pinch more. But he praised President Bush and his Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, for supporting economic sanctions and his return from exile.
President Aristide said today that despite his misgivings about the military, he remained confident that in "only a few days" there could be a political agreement to clear the way for his return.

HEADLINE: Citicorp's Passage: A Humbling Change - A special report.;
After Losing Luster at Home, Citicorp Seeks Future Abroad

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company and America's flagship in overseas markets, finds itself in an unfamiliar role -- that of banking's stumbling giant.
 After a bitter period of losses, layoffs, cost cutting and slower growth in many American markets, Citicorp is hoping that rapid growth and high profits overseas will enable it to rebuild its financial strength and stature. 
When it emerges from its difficult and humbling passage -- by the end of this year, its executives hope -- Citicorp will still be the banking leader in businesses like credit cards and services for a few hundred global corporate giants. But it will be far behind several other banks that are using their financial strength to build large interstate branch networks with a broad base of American consumers and medium-sized corporate customers.
 
A Different Approach
 The emphasis on foreign business is a reminder that Citicorp still dares to be different. While many American banks have cut back their foreign activities, Citicorp is aggressively exporting credit cards and other consumer banking products to Latin America and Europe and Asia. The bank's position as the leading banker of the world's largest corporations remains important but will be a smaller part of its business in the future.
 Citicorp has corporate offices in more than 90 countries, more than any other banking company, but for all its sweep and stature, it has never been a standout at making money. In five years, only once has Citicorp made enough money to cover dividend payments to its shareholders. And only once in seven years has Citibank, its primary subsidiary, met its profit goal.
 Tomorrow, Citicorp, with $224 billion in assets, will announce the details of its 1991 results, which it said last week would be a loss of $450 million to $475 million. The results reflect continued high loan losses, which totaled more than $5 billion for the year, up from $2.9 billion in 1990 and $1.9 billion in 1989.
 With loan losses high and the American economy mired in recession, Citicorp and its 52-year-old chairman, John S. Reed, find themselves sweating over where to cut expenses. Citicorp executives still dream of pioneering new businesses, but the stark reality is that its problems are so severe that Federal regulators have pressured the bank to shore up its finances by eliminating its dividend, halting further expansion and finding ways to cut costs by $1.7 billion, or nearly 16 percent in a two-year period ending this year.
 "This is a dramatic change at Citicorp, but there really is not much else they could do," said James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a securities firm specializing in bank stocks. "With consumers in a mood to pay down debts and the corporate banking business in a slump, they cannot count on growing their way out of this problem like they have in the past."
 Even in the highly profitable credit card business, where Citicorp has been the leader since it boldly mailed 20 million cards throughout the country in 1977, the competition is growing stronger. As companies like Sears, Roebuck and American Telephone and Telegraph join the competition with large banks, profit margins are shrinking.
 The last decade at Citicorp, including its final years under the leadership of Walter B. Wriston and Mr. Reed's seven years at the helm, shows a willingness to take risks that produced failure and success -- both on a large scale.
 In the late 1980's, loans to third world countries cost Citibank $4 billion -- a painful wound that might have been a motive for the company to seek a quick recovery by embracing the commercial real estate business with its high profits and high risks. But losses on loans for commercial real estate projects in the last few years have wiped out the $600 million profit of the company's credit card business in 1990, while problems with loans to help finance corporate takeovers have eliminated the fat profits expected in that part of its corporate lending.
 
Bank's Survival Is Questioned
 More than a year ago, Citicorp did not have enough capital, and some experts questioned whether the company or Mr. Reed's job would survive the recession. The financial markets seem to have concluded that Citicorp, at least, will survive, as the company's stock price has increased from $8.50 on Dec. 20, its lowest level in more than a decade, to $14.625 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Mr. Reed declined to be interviewed for this article, but in talks with stock analysts and investors he has insisted that Citicorp will survive and that he is the best person to lead it. His plan calls for Citicorp to cut costs drastically so that the company earns a profit and rebuilds the capital cushion it needs to absorb unexpected losses.
 Signaling the company's emphasis on foreign consumers, Mr. Reed recently expanded the top management committee of the bank to include an officer for global consumer banking, and he plans to bring in an outsider to oversee commercial lending in Japan, Europe and North America.
 The strategy is to cut costs enough by the end of this year to widen the margin between the bank's revenues, which are projected to reach $16 billion, and expenses, which the bank is trying to cut to $9 billion, from $10.7 billion. That $7 billion margin, which amounts to 40 percent of the bank's projected revenues, will be used mostly to soak up the heavy cost of bad loans.
 "We clearly have gotten into more, or at least our fair share of problems," Mr. Reed said recently. One example: In the breathless takeover frenzy of the late 1980's, Citibank loaned Robert Campeau hundreds of millions of dollars for his ill-fated takeover of several American department store chains, including Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus and Federated.
 "It was not our best moment when we financed Campeau," Mr. Reed later said in the Harvard Business Review. "I would suggest that if your customer goes bankrupt within one year of a deal, then the deal was not good business for you."
 The lending mistakes have led Mr. Reed -- a banker who never made a loan but rose through the ranks as a strategic planner and developer of Citicorp's consumer business -- to pay more attention to corporate lending. To oversee the restoration of the bank's health and maintain Citicorp's leading position in the highly competitive corporate lending and finance business in Japan, Europe and North America, Mr. Reed is expected to announce the hiring of H. Onno Ruding, a former Dutch Finance Minister and top official in the International Monetary Fund. Citicorp is also looking for a chief credit officer.
 One of Mr. Ruding's jobs will be to improve lending practices to correct Citicorp's horrendous record of the past few years. At the end of September, Citicorp reported that 24.4 percent of its loans for commercial real estate projects were badly troubled, while data compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation show a 14.4 percent rate for all the nation's largest banks. About 25.8 percent of Citicorp's loans to highly indebted companies were badly troubled, compared with 11.3 percent for all large banks.
 But trying to change the ingrained lending and spending habits of decades will also mean changing Citicorp's culture. Among the practices to be changed are profligate spending on technology. Salomon Brothers estimated that Citicorp had spent up to $1.5 billion annually in this area, including such brash efforts as making its own automated teller machines. At one point it even considered making its own word processors. That kind of money is about what the Hewlett-Packard Company spent last year on research and development.
 "Citicorp recognized earlier than others that technology could provide them with a competitive advantage," said Laura Jean Stuart, president of a management consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "But they were arrogant enough to think they could do a better job than anyone else and develop their own systems and software for every need." The result, she said, is that the company has a "massive patchwork of old systems that is not particularly coherent or streamlined."
 Citicorp still claims that its investment in Transaction Technology Inc., a California company that designed and built Citicorp's automatic teller machines, was money well spent. Even so, the company says it will now make more use of outside vendors.
 But there are limits on how much to cut. Citicorp must continue to invest in developing products if it expects to sustain the recent annual growth rates of more than 25 percent in overseas consumer profits, which exceeded $300 million last year.
 The promotion last week of Pei-yuan Chia (pronounced PAY-youon JAH), who has Mr. Reed's old job as head of Citicorp's consumer businesses in the United States and 36 other countries, to the six-member management committee underscores the foreign consumer's importance to Citicorp's future.
 In Germany, for example, the local Citibank has used automated teller machines and consolidated account statements (two products that pushed it ahead of the competition in New York City many years ago), to increase growth rapidly. The bank, which specialized in installment loans for lower-middle-income customers when it was acquired by Citicorp in 1974, is now aiming at wealthier customers. By introducing a broader selection of loan and deposit products, including credit cards, and automated teller machines more sophisticated than the machines used by German competitors, the German bank has increased its customer base to more than 2 million households, from 1.5 million in 1988.
 In its foreign consumer business -- serving more than 10 million households through 876 branches -- Citicorp is taking advantage of the fact that local banks in many countries do not pay much attention to consumers. In many instances, like home mortgages in Taiwan and the Philippines, and financing of motor scooters and other durable goods in India, Citicorp has created entirely new markets and profited greatly.
 In such places, "the margins are much better than in the more developed markets, where there are lots of sophisticated players and the pricing is tough," Mr. Chia said.
 
Big Profits In Exotic Locales
 In Brazil, for example, Citicorp is a major force and earns an annual profit estimated at $50 million, even though it has only a few dozen branches compared with more than 1,000 branches for the largest local banks. In India, where Citicorp has 500,000 accounts, up from 100,000 in 1986, profits from consumer banking are growing by 25 percent annually and were estimated at $25 million in 1990.
 Credit cards are a key part of Citicorp's offerings in many foreign countries, and it is looking for faster growth overseas to compensate for slower growth in the United States. While Citicorp does not have the branch networks and large base of consumers needed to offer debit cards, through which purchases are automatically deducted from the customer's checking account, it has learned that credit cards can be sold to consumers who are far removed from a Citicorp branch.
 "The appeal of credit cards overseas is the same as in the United States: It's the best way to pay," said Pete Hart, chairman of Mastercard International. While credit cards are not as popular in some markets, like France and Germany, "there are many other countries where a credit card is a prestige item and is the most convenient way to pay for travel and entertainment expenses," he said.
 In the American market, Citicorp's prospects were recently summed up by a New York rival, who said: "Citi is still the biggest, but they are not necessarily the best any longer. The rest of us have caught up."
 In the domestic credit card business, for example, Citicorp is more than twice the size of the nearest bank competitor, with more than 30 million accounts and at least one card in 19 percent of American households, but Citicorp is reconciled to revenue growth of only 10 percent annually in the 1990's, down sharply from the 30 percent growth rates common in the 1980's.
 In the New York banking market, Citicorp faces a new challenge from the recent merger of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, which were, respectively, the second- and fourth-largest banks in the New York consumer market. The new bank, known as Chemical, trails Citibank in the number of accounts and deposit levels, but Chemical has more than 500 branches in the New York area -- more than double Citibank's. Chemical also has by far the leading share of small and medium-size business accounts and is likely to find more ways of linking its success in that business to its consumer banking.
 Citicorp is trying to attract new accounts by offering free checking and heavily promoting its family of mutual funds.
 It is also trying to offer its trademark high-technology banking services, but one recent example came to market clumsily -- and behind the competition. When Citicorp rolled out a highly computerized bank-by-phone service last year, it was following the lead of Chemical and others, but it was not until last month that the bank was able to offer customers the convenience of having the same phone number in all six of the metropolitan New York region's area codes. Early this year, when Citibank plans to introduce a service for paying a wide range of bills by telephone, it will be more than a year behind Chase Manhattan Bank's unveiling of a similar service.
 For all its size, moreover, Citicorp has no branches in Connecticut or New Jersey, where many customers of its New York branches live. Last year, Chase moved into Connecticut, and Chemical has expanded in New Jersey.
 Outside New York, Citicorp's purchases of weak savings and loan associations in the mid-1980's were an early attempt to assemble an interstate banking network of offices. But Citicorp's effort, which now encompasses about 350 branches, has been surpassed by regional banks like Banc One of Columbus Ohio; which went into Texas and other parts of the Midwest; Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., a leader in the Southeast and Texas, and the Bank of America of San Francisco, the No. 1 bank in the West.
 Citicorp's savings bank in San Francisco, which has $13.1 billion in assets -- equivalent to a big regional bank -- and branch networks in California, Chicago and Washington, D.C., is the strongest of the group. But it earned only $66.6 million in the first half of last year, for a paltry 6 percent return on Citicorp's investment. In the same period, Citicorp's Florida bank, with $2.7 billion in assets, earned only $2 million. And its Arizona bank had a $27.9 million loss; Mr. Reed says he wants to sell that one.
 To carry the company through its malaise, Citicorp executives scoured the world to find buyers for $1.25 billion of its preferred stock in late 1990. Half the money came from Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, and half from more than three dozen institutional investors. And all of it cost dearly as the hard-pressed Citicorp was required to pay an interest rate much higher than other banks.
 Citicorp has also announced a series of gains from accounting changes and the sale of investments and subsidiaries. And it has signaled that more sales will come. In the first nine months of last year the company had such gains of more than $800 million.
 Robert Albertson, a banking analyst at Goldman, Sachs, estimated that Citicorp probably had at least $1 billion, and perhaps $2 billion, of hidden profits it could tap by selling real estate, investments in various companies and "superfluous businesses."
 
Some Businesses Fell Far Short
 One businesses widely rumored to be for sale is Quotron Inc., a leading supplier of stock quotes and other financial information that has never lived up to Citicorp's expectations when it bought it for $630 million in 1986. Quotron was a centerpiece of Citicorp's information business, which Citicorp officials once touted as a wellspring for future profits.
 But now, talk about the information business has all but ceased. It lost more than $1 billion since 1988, reflecting, in part, write-offs of investments in Quotron and Citicorp's expensive efforts in the point-of-sale business, a network of computers connected to retail cash registers that debit customer accounts and provide Citicorp with information about individual shopping habits. The idea was to generate valuable information that could be sold to food companies and others.
 "Attitudes at Citicorp must change from one of assuming that we can win any game we want to play, to one of we must choose more carefully the games we want to play," said Harrison F. Tempest, chairman of the North American operations of ABN AMRO, the large Dutch bank. "It's emotionally tough to abandon some dreams, but not even the largest bank in the country has the capital to be in every business."

Wriston, Citicorp's chairman from 1970 to 1984, was a disciple of growth who shocked other bankers in the early 1970's when he set a goal of 15 percent annual revenue growth.

HEADLINE: A Chicken/Egg Debate Over Bolstering Ruble

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 19

 BODY:
In the belief that a free market in Russia requires a convertible currency as quickly as possible, President Boris N. Yeltsin's financial advisers are pushing to achieve this goal in the next few weeks -- over the objections of the Russian central bank and the doubts of the Bush Administration.
 The battle over convertible currency, which would greatly increase the country's attractiveness to foreign investors, is the most visible aspect of a larger struggle between those who want the Yeltsin Government to end numerous subsidies and payments to the people as quickly as possible, and those who favor a slower phasing out of Government supports. 
The latter group is more concerned with maintaining a social safety net than with shoring up the economy.
 Mr. Yeltsin's finance group, headed by Deputy Finance Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, says the President has decreed the free convertibility of the ruble, adding that Russians can now buy dollars at exchange windows in bank and hotel lobbies around the city.
 "You can go to 80 exchange windows and buy hard currency freely," said Pyotr O. Aven, a Gaidar assistant and chairman of the Russian federation's Committee on Foreign Economic Relations. "And if you can't, that is because the banks play their games. They can hoard dollars and we have no control."
 But in visits to three such exchange windows at branches of Menatep, a recently established private bank, clerks would only sell dollars to Russians with passports and visas for travel abroad, and then only up to $200.
 What is more, the decree cited by Mr. Aven, signed by the President in November, says in one paragraph that limitations are lifted on the purchase of foreign currency, and in the next paragraph that the central bank should set up "a limited range of exchange rates for the purchase and sale of hard currency."
 Mikhail B. Brudno, a Menatep director in charge of foreign exchange, said that the paragraphs seem contradictory and that Menatep prefers to wait "until the central bank offers an explanation of what it plans to do."
 His caution might be justified. The central bank chairman has opposed free convertibility, preferring a fixed exchange rate that would overvalue the ruble by offering fewer than 100 to the dollar. (That makes a ruble worth more than a cent.)
 Nevertheless, the ruble appears to be moving toward convertibility. An informal weekly auction has sprung up, conducted by the private banks that have been organized in Russia in the last 18 months. The auction matches exporters who have earned hard currency with importers who need it.
 The current auction rate is 150 rubles to the dollar, which makes a ruble worth two-thirds of a cent.
 Mr. Gaidar and his team argue that the auction is too restrictive. With a freely convertible currency, they say, two things would happen: First, Russian companies would export more goods, confident that the dollars they earned could be exchanged for more rubles than exporters can now acquire legally. And second, people with dollars would demand imports, helping to fill shops and build up commerce.
 The Gaidar team's mentor and chief adviser in this approach is Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Harvard economist who advocated a similar crash program for Poland. "The convertible ruble engages exports right away by producing a realistic, market-based exchange rate," Professor Sachs said in an interview here last week, adding that Russia must revive its nearly nonexistent exports to rebuild dollar reserves and, indeed, to survive.
 
Which Comes First?
 The clash comes over whether the ruble should be made convertible before other steps are taken.
 Some analysts, including officials in the Bush Administration, say currency convertibility should be delayed until the Yeltsin Government reduces the budget deficit and raises oil prices. Higher prices for gasoline and heating oil would reduce consumption, making more oil available for sale abroad.
 Mr. Gaidar also favors these measures, but is not insisting that they be achieved before the ruble is freely convertible. In addition, his group wants the Russian central bank to reduce the number of rubles in circulation -- an anti-inflation measure the bank has so far resisted.
 All three steps -- fewer rubles, a balanced budget and higher oil prices -- would strengthen the ruble.
 "Exporters will bring back dollars and exchange them for rubles only if they have confidence that the ruble will hold its value," said one Bush Administration official.

HEADLINE: Hope and Anger Mix on King Day

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 20

 BODY:
In pride, anger and sorrow, the nation, and blacks in particular, paid homage to the memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. today on the seventh observance of the national holiday established in his honor.
At the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached, speakers talked of his unfinished work in often harsh tones that reflected the ravages of the ailing economy and the tide of violence and despair in the nation's inner cities. 
 "Invest in the new order now," the Rev. James Alexander Forbes Jr., of the Riverside Church in New York told the congregation at Ebenezer. He delivered an impassioned sermon that took note of the string of racial incidents that have shocked and divided New York City in recent weeks. "When the power of destruction is stronger than the power of creating, you're dying. It doesn't matter if you're the Soviet Union or the United States," he said.
 
Looking at Social Ills
 The annual service here was the focal point of a range of activities, some of them reflecting the rancorous national debate on race. In Denver, a crowd attacked a bus carrying Ku Klux Klan supporters. In New York City, the rash of racial incidents provided a somber backdrop to services and gatherings throughout the city.
Those who spoke here today, including Dr. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and the South African anti-apartheid leader Winnie Mandela, alternated between looking at the social ills within the black population and the economic and political ills they reflect. Dr. King, who was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968, would have turned 63 last week.
On Sunday, two days after President Bush visited Atlanta to pay homage to Dr. King, Mrs. King challenged the nation to reorder its priorities and work to solve the problems of the poor, particularly the inner-city poor.
"Hope is becoming the most endangered commodity," she said. "Resources such as drug and family counseling programs are scarce; job-training opportunities are nearly non-existent."
She offered statistics that nearly one of four American children under the age of 6 lives in poverty and that babies born in 21 other countries have a better chance of surviving their first year of life than do American babies.
 
'National Disgrace'
 "There are only two words that can adequately describe such conditions for so many children in the wealthiest country on earth, and those two words are "national disgrace,' " she said.
But there was also a strong sense, partly reflecting the conservative strands that have become more a part of the civil rights debate over the past year, that many of the answers to the ills of black America must come from within.
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, former president of the Morehouse School of Medicine here, said that blacks did not march for civil rights only to be enslaved by drugs or riddled with black-on-black crime.
"Many of the ills plaguing our society stem from our own decisions," he said.
Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said that in his first term in office in the early 1980's, about 65 percent of homicides were the result of domestic disputes. Now, he said, almost the same percentage were the result of street violence, with 95 percent of homicides the result of black-on-black violence.
 
Remembering Struggles
 "We've got to stop the guns, we've got to stop the dope, and time has run out," he said. "The boys in the 'hood are killing each other. We've got to stop the guns and stop the violence to remain true to the dream of Martin Luther King."
For speakers like Wilma Mankiller, chief of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, the day was a time to remember the struggles of Dr. King's life and the power of people to change their world.
"If there was any message that Dr. King gave us it was that each of us are responsible for doing what we can in our lives," said Mrs. Mankiller. "When thinking of a tribute to Dr. King, I think all of us recognize that we've lost ground in the last decade or so. All of us collectively have lost ground. The best tribute we could give to Dr. King from now on is to not give up one more inch."
Around the country, observances were held on the King holiday, which is observed nationally and by every state but New Hampshire, which celebrates Civil Rights Day, and Arizona. Most private businesses, however, remained open.
The most dramatic gathering came in Denver where about 150 Ku Klux Klan supporters attended a rally at the state Capitol. When they left, those in a crowd of protesters threw bottles and bricks at their bus.
In New York, speakers such as Mayor David N. Dinkins and the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, paid tribute to Dr. King and talked of recent racial incidents that included spray-paint attacks on young students and the rape of a 15-year-old girl.
 
'How Very, Very Sad'
 "I cannot help but think how surprised and how sad, how very, very sad Dr. King would be to see the level of violence in our society, especially in communities of color where violent crimes hit hardest," Mr. Dinkins said. "As African-Americans, we have a special stake in winning this battle against violence in our community. For we did not come this far in gaining respect for the dignity of our lives only to see those lives lost with such indignity. We did not leave the back of the bus only to place our children in the back of an ambulance."
Some 2,000 persons turned out at the Brooklyn Academy of Music to hear recordings of Dr. King's speeches and a tribute to his life.
Yvonne Reaves, 36, of the Bronx came away with a renewed sense of hope.
"It was a small gesture, but it was a beautiful one," she said. "It brings people together. It eases the tension, for a while, anyway."
In Arizona, where the debate over designating a state holiday has been heightened by an angry rap video called "By the Time I Get to Arizona" that depicts state officials being assassinated, several thousand people marched in Phoenix in support of a paid state holiday honoring Dr King. Arizonans voted against the holiday last year, but the measure will again be on the ballot in November.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Wants to Increase Tuition And Cut State Jobs and Medicaid

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 20

 BODY:
To close the gap of nearly $5 billion in next year's $31 billion budget, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposes authorizing sharp tuition increases at SUNY campuses, eliminating more than 5,000 state jobs, cutting Medicaid spending by about $1 billion and deferring more than $1 billion in tax cuts.
Most of the biggest elements of the plan, which the Democratic Governor is to present to the Legislature on Tuesday in his annual budget message, have been discussed for some time. The tuition increases, of $200 at some campuses and up to $800 at others, were disclosed today by Cuomo administration aides. If they are enacted, the cost of attending some State University schools will have doubled over the last two years.
 
Major Stumbling Block
 In addition, the new budget would eliminate between 5,000 and 10,000 state jobs on top of the 20,000 cut in the last year. It would also pay for about $500 million in borrowing that the state will likely have to undertake this spring because of the failure of the Governor and the Legislature to agree on any plan for closing the gap in budget for the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31. 
 The major stumbling block in reaching agreement on both the current budget gap and the new plan has been the question of Medicaid cuts. The Governor plans both to cut services and to tighten eligibility requirements -- as favored by the Republicans who control the State Senate -- and to cut state reimbursements to hospitals and other health-care providers -- as the Assembly Democrats favor. But both groups take more extreme positions in their own approaches, and no one here expects any easy compromise.
Since Mr. Cuomo will not officially unveil the plan until Tuesday, there was little reaction to it today from legislative leaders or the Wall Street credit rating agencies that monitor the state finances. But a variety of Cuomo administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, provided portions of the budget plan in interviews today but declined to make it known in its entirety.
The tuition increases, which would raise $60 million, are bound to prompt heated protests from students who have already faced two major increases in the last two years. But another part of the plan may prove even more controversial: to charge more, for the first time in history of the State University of New York, to attend one of the four large "university centers" in the SUNY system -- at Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo and Stony Brook -- than for the other 25 campuses operated by the central SUNY administration.
Discussion of this new policy, known as differentiated tuition, has provoked considerable controversy within the SUNY system. Officials at the university centers, led by H. Patrick Swygert, president of the Albany center, have favored the concept. They say it could help direct more funds to their schools, which in part because of their extensive research operations tend to be more expensive to run than other campuses.
 
'Champagne and Ripple'
 But attitudes about the idea on the smaller campuses have been more mixed. While presidents at some of those campuses say offering a lower tuition than the university centers might attract some students, many others have said it could simply harden a perception that their schools were second-class citizens compared to the prestigious university centers. One president has called this a "Champagne and Ripple effect."
Still, SUNY is the only public university system in the country that does not vary tuition by campuses, according to statistics compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Technically, Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature do not approve tuition increases but only the authorization for them since the final decision is up to the boards of trustees of both the State University and the City University of New York. In proposing the new authorization, Mr. Cuomo may well argue that he is not actually favoring a tuition increase because the board could reject one if it decided to cut costs instead.
But in each case in recent years in which authorization has been granted, tuition increases have followed.
 
Cut in State Assistance
 Because the Governor's budget will include a proposed cut of about $80 million in the state's $1 billion assistance to SUNY, the trustees will probably be unwilling to forgo a tuition increase. Without it, they would have to cut an additional $60 million out of an already strapped budget that has forced SUNY to cut course offerings, library hours and research funds.
Annual tuition at SUNY remained at $1,350 from 1983 to 1990, when it rose to $1,650, and last fall it rose again to $2,150. At CUNY, which is expected to face a somewhat smaller increase than SUNY, tuition has risen in that time to $1,950 from $1,250.
SUNY could raise tuition by an average of $500 a student at the state-operated campuses to reach the $60 million target. But under the differentiated-tuition policy, a more likely scenario would be a range from $200 a year at some two-year colleges to $800 at the university centers, university officials said today.
Because Mr. Cuomo has held intensive negotiations with the Legislature on Medicaid and welfare cuts in the last three months, though without reaching agreement, his proposals in that area are expected to be familiar.
 
'Myths of Medicaid'
 He reviewed several of them today at a news conference he called to dispel what he called the "myths of Medicaid." The news conference, focusing on spending on children and the elderly, was clearly intended as a pre-emptive strike to undercut Senate Republicans' arguments that the state's Medicaid program was rife with fraud and abused by able-bodied and employable welfare recipients.
Among the proposals Mr. Cuomo said he would make is to cut welfare benefits to teen-agers between 16 and 18 who drop out of school.
At least one measure revealed by Cuomo aides today would merely push costs into the next fiscal year.
Because of a calendar fluke, there will be 53 Wednesdays in the 1992-93 fiscal year, which runs from April 1 to March 31. Because the state sends Medicaid checks to reimburse health-care providers on Wednesdays, the extra Wednesday would mean an extra payment for the state. But under the Governor's proposal, the last payment would be made instead on April 1, a Thursday, pushing a $110 million expenditure into the next fiscal year.

Chart: "New York State Budget: What Led to the $4.8 Billion Gap"
 
The roughly $31 billion budget proposal that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is set to unveil today for the fiscal year 1992-93 will make provisions to close a nearly $5 billion potential deficit, state officials say. Here are the major components of the deficit.
 
* Costs Above Original Projections
 
Medicaid: $1.1 Billion
Prisons: $300 Million
Welfare programs: $250 Million
 
* Reductions in Revenue
 
Previously scheduled tax cuts: $1.2 Billion
Tax revenue beloe projections: $650 Million
 
* Debt
 
Borrowing needed to close the current fiscal year's gap: $500 Million
 
* 53 Wednesdays in the Fiscal Year
 
Added payroll costs because the year will include one more payday for state workers than usual: $210 Million
 
* Inflation
 
Increases in non-personnel costs such as utilities: $105 Million
 
* Other Causes: $475 Million

HEADLINE: Northeast Gas Pipeline Ready But Critics Still Doubt Need

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOUTH COMMACK, L.I., Jan. 17

 BODY:
After a decade of planning and construction that has provoked fierce opposition from environmentalists, homeowners and oil executives, a major natural gas pipeline from Canada is to begin operation here this month, providing the largest single new source of energy to the New York region since the 1950's.
The pipeline, the Iroquois Gas Transmission System, has been the region's most contentious energy project since the failed Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, which is being dismantled 30 miles east of here. The Iroquois pipeline, along with projects under way to expand pipelines from domestic oil and gas fields, would increase the capacity to pump natural gas to New York, New Jersey and New England by more than 50 percent.
 
Marketing Campaigns
 With the Iroquois pipeline nearing completion, experts in the energy industry say it may lead to a historic shift in a region that is far more dependent on oil from the Middle East to heat its homes and fuel its power plants than other sections of the nation are. 
 More than a dozen utility companies and gas distributors have signed 15- year contracts to buy all its gas and dedicate most of it to home heating and other residential uses. The pipeline will pump enough gas each year to replace 30 million barrels of oil, and its capacity can be doubled by a series of compression stations in upstate New York sites that have yet to be determined.
For customers, the most immediate impact will come in aggressive marketing campaigns that promote natural gas over other fuels. Already, the Long Island Lighting Company has said it plans to convert 10,000 Long Island houses each year from oil to gas furnaces and has done so each of the last two years; it says it currently has about 220,000 customers with gas-heated houses. In contrast, there are about 650,000 one-family oil-heated houses on Long Island, according to oil industry estimates. In Connecticut, the Yankee Gas Services Company, another distributor that will buy gas coming through the Iroquois system, plans to offer natural gas service for the first time in Groton and New London.
Another major market for the Canadian gas could be in new electrical generating plants, which, in the aftermath of the failed project at Shoreham, are planned in New York and New Jersey with gas as their principal fuel.
Anyone hoping for a windfall in immediate cuts in gas prices will be disappointed. As part of their contract to buy the Canadian gas, signed in 1987, the utilities and distributors in the Iroquois project have agreed to tie gas prices to those of other fuels, including heating oil and gas from the United States Oil Patch, the fields from the Gulf Coast to West Texas.
So even if a surplus develops, as some economists are predicting, gas prices will not decline any faster than the costs of alternative fuels.
But proponents of the project say its economic benefits, both to individual users and to the region's economy, will become more apparent over a decade or more, as more plentiful natural gas prevents oil prices fro rising and lets industry expand.
 
Fearing Too Much Of a Good Thing
 "There have been very legitimate questions raised about this project, but any new source that will lessen our dependence on foreign oil is a positive for New York," said Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the state's Consumer Protection Board.
As a project planned a decade ago, when the national trauma of energy shortages was still a fresh memory, the pipeline will begin sending gas into a different economic environment. Although all agree on the New York region's need for more access to natural gas, some experts now say it may get too much of a good thing.
"There is certainly going to be a period, whether it lasts for a decade or more, when we have more pipeline capacity than we need," said Ronald Derhardt, a partner in Jensen Associates, an energy consulting company based in Boston.
Threading its way seven feet below the ground for 370 miles, the Iroquois pipeline runs south from Iroquois, Ontario, through upstate New York, across western Connecticut, and beneath the Long Island Sound to a muddy construction site here, just down a quiet residential side street from an Amoco service station. It will then hook up with smaller existing pipelines.
It has been built for $655 million by a consortium of utilities and gas distributors that will sell its gas in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. In New York, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company and Lilco are members of the consortium and have pledged to buy the largest amount of gas from the Iroquois line.
The consortium says it plans to turn on the Iroquois spigot here on Jan. 28.
 
Environmentalists Say Toll Is Too High
 "This is the culmination of a dream," said Robert B. Catell, the president of Brooklyn Union Gas, adding that projections of excess capacity in a weak economy are wrong.
"The Iroquois pipeline will stimulate economic development," he said, by adding fuel for new electrical power plants, new industry and even new technologies, like cars and air-conditioners run by natural gas.
But critics remain unpersuaded.
Environmentalists say the pipeline has extracted too great a toll in five years of digging and pipe-laying across a rich variety of geography, including streams, front lawns and village greens. Oil executives complain bitterly that by providing a major new source of Canadian gas, it will discourage domestic exploration.
The pipeline has been barraged by protests and lawsuits. Several prominent New York area residents, including Dr. Joyce Brothers, fought vigorously to divert it from their country and suburban properties, and the pipeline's builders agreed in October to a settlement paying New York State $225,000 rather than face charges of illegally digging out a Dutchess County creek bed.
"In most cases, the protests fell under the heading of 'not in my back yard,' " said Anne Marie Mueser of Clinton Corners, a village in Dutchess County. Her protests in 1987 persuaded the pipeline builders to detour the line around her cornfield.
Since then, she has been hired by one of the New York contractors that laid the pipeline to advise its workers on avoiding environmental damage.
"I still object to the project," she said. "Although we certainly do need access to more natural gas, it didn't have to come through a huge new pipeline, and it didn't have to come from Canada."
 
Overruns in Cost And Maybe Supply
 Besides environmental concerns, the project has been marred by large cost overruns, raising its price $70 million above the original estimates. The pipeline consortium says that the additional cost will not require an increase in the price charged natural gas distributors and that it hopes to raise volume within two years to increase revenues.
But even as the Iroquois project has moved from drawing board to trenches, the region's gas pipeline capacity has expanded sharply. Two major pipelines that were built in the 1950's to deliver gas to the Northeast from Texas and Oklahoma, the Tennessee Gas Pipeline and the Algonquin Gas Transmission System, have finished major expansion programs since 1986, adding larger pipelines and powerful new pumps.
The pipeline expansion was undertaken in anticipation of the new Iroquois system, into which both of the other pipeline companies have connected with switching systems in upstate New York and Connecticut. The Iroquois system will allow them broader distribution and will most likely lead them to pump more gas.
That means the region's access to gas is increasing just as its economy struggles through the longest recession since World War II. Mr. Derhardt, the energy consultant, said he expected a surplus of capacity in the pipelines because of reduced projections for industrial expansion and population growth in the 1990's.
But other analysts say the huge new gas resources, by their very presence, will create new markets.
"We are going to see natural gas distributors, who until now just have not had the supply, becoming much more competitive at attracting new customers," said Thomas Kiley, president of the New England Gas Association, a trade group. He said he expected at least a 50 percent increase in demand for gas throughout the Northeast over the next decade.
In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, homeowners, landlords and the managers of industrial buildings remain much more reliant on heating oil than those in most states.
Across the nation, 88 percent of all homes and apartment buildings are heated by gas, says the American Gas Association. In contrast, it says, gas-fired furnaces heat only 51 percent of the residences in New York, 70 percent in New Jersey and 71 percent in Connecticut; heating oil is used in almost all homes not heated by gas.
 
Reliance on Oil Is Legacy of Barons
 The region's reliance on oil has deep roots early in the century, when American oil barons, led by John D. Rockefeller, discovered huge reservoirs under the deserts of the Middle East. They found that the most efficient route for the oil was across the Atlantic to ports along the northern half of the Eastern Seaboard.
Later, after World War II, vast pipeline systems began linking most of the nation with the oil and gas fields of the Southwest. But by 1960, when pipeline construction had almost halted, the New York region and New England, partly because of their distance from the oil fields, were left with little access to gas.
Now, after decades of oil shocks, political turmoil and heightened concerns over air pollution, "any significant new source of gas is important, particularly in a heavily congested area like New York," said Robert Stobaugh, a professor of business and an energy industry analyst at the Harvard Business School.
One benefit of natural gas is its cleaner burning, he said; it produces less sulfur pollution in the atmosphere than gasoline or heating oil.
Another, he added, is that it will generate more competition between fuel distributors and discourage sellers of heating oil from imposing sudden price increases whenever frigid weather or a political upheaval abroad threatens oil shortages.
Although the consortium that has built the Iroquois pipeline says most of its gas will be used to heat homes and industrial buildings, others say they expect growing demand, which could be partly met by the new pipeline, to fuel electrical power plants.
One candidate is the now-idle shell of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station. The Shoreham plant has been the subject of broad studies on ways to rebuild it for non-nuclear use. This month, the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency created to oversee Shoreham, requested proposals from several corporations to determine if it would make economic sense to convert the plant to gas.
"It would certainly make sense that this major new pipeline will make the natural gas option for Shoreham more attractive," said Mr. Kessel, who serves as chairman of the power authority.

HEADLINE: LIBYA IS EXPECTED TO GET U.N. DEMAND ON BOMB SUSPECTS

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council is expected to serve Libya on Tuesday with a virtual demand that it hand over agents accused of blowing up Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988 or face the threat of economic sanctions.
The resolution also calls on Libya to cooperate with an investigation into the destruction of a French airliner over West Africa in 1989. 
 If the Libyans decline to meet the Council's demands, they are likely to be faced with a follow-up resolution in a week to 10 days setting forth the sanctions, diplomats from Council nations said today.
The Security Council is now certain to approve such a resolution, diplomats said tonight, adding that Tuesday's vote could well turn out a unanimous one after the six third-world members said they would recommend the text to their capitals. But some cautioned that Morocco might still abstain out of solidarity with Libya, a fellow North African nation.
 
'Full and Effective Response'
 The carefully worded draft avoids specifically accusing Libya of responsibility for blowing up the two planes but merely "urges" it to provide "a full and effective response" to the demands of the United States, Britain and France "so as to contribute to the elimination of international terrorism."
In practice, this means Libya would have to hand over for trial the two Libyan agents the United States and Britain have accused of helping blow up the Pan Am airliner with the loss of 270 lives, and pay compensation as these two Governments have demanded.
The French Government has not formally asked for extradition of any of those it thinks helped blow up Union de Transports Aeriens Flight 772 over the West African nation of Niger in September 1989 with the loss of 177 lives. But a French investigating magistrate has accused several Libyans of doing so and issued warrants for their arrest.
 
'Remain Seized of This Matter'
 The new draft resolution also avoids threatening Libya openly with sanctions if, as expected, it fails to comply, saying only that the Council decides "to remain seized of this matter."
But spokesmen for the American, British and French Governments have all made clear in recent days that they will ask the Council to impose mandatory economic sanctions on Libya under Article 7 of the United Nations Charter if it refuses to cooperate.
Such sanctions would probably take the form of a worldwide ban on civil aviation links as well as on sales of aircraft and spare parts.
The United States, Britain, France, Russia and China have permanent Security Council membership and can veto any decision. Other members, serving two-year terms, are Hungary, Austria, Belgium, Japan, India, Zimbabwe, Cape Verde, Morocco, Ecuador and Venezuela.
Libya has sent a high-level delegation to attend Tuesday's meeting, headed by a former Foreign Minister, Jadulah Azuz Talhi, who is currently Minister of Strategic Industries.
Mr. Talhi, who is expected to address the Council, made no statement today. But Libya's Arab League representative, Ali Treiki, who is a former United Nations representative, said Libya is ready to cooperate with an investigation into the bombing of the planes but appeared to exclude handing over the accused Libyans. "There is no law which requires us to hand over our citizens," he said. "This is something we can't do."
The resolution hammered out today after weeks of negotiation "strongly deplores" the fact that Libya has not "responded effectively" to the three countries' "request to cooperate fully in establishing responsibility for the terrorist acts referred to above against Pan Am Flight 103 and U.T.A. Flight 772."
It "urges the Libyan Government immediately to provide a full and effective response to those requests so as to contribute to the elimination of international terrorism." And it also "urges all states individually and collectively to encourage the Libyan Government to respond fully and effectively to those requests."
 
First Demand for Extradition
 Today's draft marks the first time the Security Council has effectively demanded the extradition of the citizens of one country to stand trial in another. It is also the first time the Council has implicitly accused another United Nations member of involvement in government-sponsored terrorism.
The resolution's adoption on Tuesday, diplomats say, would thus continue an emerging trend in which the United Nations is becoming increasingly involved in countries' domestic affairs to promote such goals as justice, human rights, democracy, humanitarian assistance and disarmament.
Libya has reacted with growing alarm to the prospect of a new confrontation with the United States and its allies. It says the accused agents are under arrest and is offering to try them itself or send them before some specially convened international tribunal.
The United States and its supporters argue that the Libyan Government cannot try people it sent to destroy the airliners. They also say that no international court is competent to hear such a case.
Libya has also proposed a list of eccentric measures that it wants the United Nations to take to eliminate what it calls the causes of terrorism. These include a ban on hunting, boxing and wrestling, as well as promoting agricultural development by reversing the flow of rivers so their waters can be used for irrigation instead of running to waste in the sea.
Last week the Arab League adopted a resolution praising Libya for offering to release all facts about the loss of the two airliners and calling on the Secretary General "to solve this dispute through negotiations, mediation and judicial settlement."
The final text asks the Secretary General "to seek the cooperation of the Libyan Government" in complying with the new resolution. But the United States, France and Britain prevented the Council from specifically asking the Secretary General to become involved in resolving their dispute, fearing that this could be used as a pretext to delay a decision on sanctions.
Families of victims of the Lockerbie bombing today criticized the draft text of the United Nations resolution as weak and inadequate.
Speaking at a news conference shortly before the scheduled vote of the Security Council, they said that though the United Nations resolution is a first step, it is not enough.
 
'Better Than Nothing'
 "The current resolution contains no deadlines, no provisions for sanctions and the word extradition is not even mentioned," said Susan Cohen, who's 20-year-old daughter, Theodora, died in the crash. "However, it is better than nothing."
Members of the families felt that although there is evidence pointing to Libya's involvement, it should not be the sole accused. "There is ample evidence that both Syria and Iran were involved," Daniel Cohen said. "But, because of political reasons the United States and Great Britain have drawn the Pan Am 103 case very narrowly, accusing only two Libyans."
After the news conference, the families held a brief vigil across from the United Nations headquarters at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza on 47th Street and First Avenue, where they read aloud the names of the 270 people who were killed in the crash of Pan Am Flight 103.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
BUSH AIDES DIVIDED ON HOW TO CORRECT SLIP IN POPULARITY

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The struggle over how to stop President Bush's political slide has fanned staff rivalries in the White House and intensified a broader debate over campaign tactics and economic policy, Administration officials and Republican strategists said today.
Inside the White House, they said, there is a lingering sense of confusion as Samuel K. Skinner, the new chief of staff, struggles to gain control of the policy apparatus and dominate Richard G. Darman, the powerful White House budget director. 
 Their conflict, concealed by a public veneer of cordiality, is linked to a disagreement over whether Mr. Bush has a public relations problem or a fundamental flaw in his domestic policy apparatus.
 
Need for Action Is Seen
 So far, Mr. Bush is said to have accepted the contention, held primarily by Mr. Darman, that his political problems are more a matter of communications than substance. The White House's efforts to come to grips with the political slide have produced a sporadic series of economic initiatives as well as political gestures.
But there is a general agreement among Administration officials, campaign aides and Republican strategists that whatever the diagnosis, Mr. Bush is struggling to catch up at a time when he should be commanding the political field and that he must do something.
Prodded by Mr. Skinner to abandon a position that the economy was basically sound and would heal itself, Mr. Bush last week made several trips intended to demonstrate his concern for the average American, but instead left the impression of a President apologizing for the state of the economy.
In another move intended to show that the President was grappling with the economic issues, the White House today announced proposals to halt the issuing of all new Government regulations for three months. [Page A19.]
On Tuesday, Mr. Bush will unveil a proposal to spend more on preschool children in the Head Start program, a move that officials said would increase financing for the popular program by more than $500 million in the 1993 fiscal year.
But many officials regard this approach as piecemeal and are frustrated that Mr. Bush bowed to Mr. Darman's insistence that the formal announcement of the economic growth package be held for the State of the Union Message next Tuesday.
To help cure the disarray that has struck the White House only five weeks before the New Hamshire primary, the first in the nation, Mr. Bush met with Mr. Skinner to receive his first plan to reorganize the White House staff, an approach that is expected to be unveiled this week. Officials said the plan will focus on communications rather than policymaking.
 
New Slide in Polls
 The sense of political shakiness in the White House was reinforced tonight as CBS News disclosed the results of a new poll in which approval of Mr. Bush's handling of foreign policy, his strongest suit, had fallen below 50 percent for the first time. The drop, to 48 percent, was recorded after the President's trip to Japan and represented an 11-point decline from a New York Times/CBS News Poll a week earlier.
The CBS poll of 2,897 adults, conducted on Jan. 14-19, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points. It showed that public approval of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy had slipped to 19 percent, from 23 percent in the previous poll. Jimmy Carter, whose lowest score for economic policy was 15 percent in July 1979, was the last President with an economic rating in this range.
The latest poll comes as the White House puts the finishing touches on Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message, which is being presented by the White House as the pivotal moment in both the last year of Mr. Bush's first Administration and in setting the stage for his re-election campaign.
White House and campaign aides are counting on the speech to give a lift to Mr. Bush's struggling campaign for the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18, but his top advisers remain divided over whether Mr. Bush's economic growth plan goes far enough.
Having lost the battle over the details of Mr. Bush's growth proposals, conservatives in the Administration and the Republican Party are already arguing behind the scenes that the plan will not go far enough either toward improving the economy or correcting the politically damaging impression that Mr. Bush is too detached from the concerns of average citizens.
 
Emphasizing Communication
 Other officials contend that there is little Mr. Bush can do to right the economy, a view supported by many economists, and that the main problem is to make voters believe that he is trying.
"Bush seems to have bought the line that it's a communications problem, not a policy problem," one official said. "We're floundering. You have no growth for two years and the White House sits around saying 'Gee, we're falling. We haven't communicated. We've got to show we care.' "
Some officials and Republican strategists say the President has staked a dangerously high amount of his dwindling political capital on the State of the Union Message address, which rarely produces dramatic headlines.
"The way they have this set up, this speech has got to be better than Bush's speech at the Republican National Convention in '88 and in a venue totally unlike a group of 5,000 rabid Republicans," said a senior Republican strategist with close ties to the White House.
Behind the scenes, the relationship between Mr. Skinner and Mr. Darman bears the marks of a classic White House power struggle, with Mr. Skinner insisting that he and Mr. Darman get along fine while at the same time making it clear that he intends to break what White House aides described as Mr. Darman's "chokehold" on domestic policy.
Mr. Darman has been uncharacteristically quiet at staff meetings, officials said. But they said he scored a big victory last month by persuading Mr. Bush to hold his major economic proposals for the State of the Union Message and not promote some of them in advance, as others, including Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, Vice President Dan Quayle, and Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman, had been arguing.
Since then, officials said, Mr. Darman has appeared to be preparing the ground to blame Mr. Skinner if Mr. Bush's economic proposals do not go over well. At a meeting in Mr. Skinner's office last week to review the State of the Union plans, Mr. Darman announced that "he had produced an incredibly substantive budget and if that was not clear, it was a communications problem, not a policy matter," one official said.
Another official said, "If I was Sam Skinner, I'd be suspicious."
But officials said Mr. Skinner had not directly challenged Mr. Darman. "Sam either believes Darman's argument that we've just got a communications problem, or he's not willing to challenge Dick," an official said.
Mr. Skinner has let it be known that he is unhappy with the communications staff at the White House, currently headed by David Demarest, and is expected to announce a major shakeup this week, officials said. "Some people are saying internally that this is simply shooting the messenger," one official said.
Another said: "Historically, communications is always blamed when the White House message is weak. The communications system is a good one, but it has to have some grist to run."

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Gone, but This City's Alive

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORWOOD, Ohio

 BODY:
On Nov. 6, 1986, General Motors delivered a body blow to this city of 24,000. To cut costs, the auto maker said it would close its 64-year-old plant here that assembled Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds.
Residents feared that G.M.'s departure would mean the end to life as Norwood had known it for generations. G.M.'s taxes afforded this small city its independence from neighboring Cincinnati and spawned a wealth of services, including free paramedic services, and generous budgets that had allowed the city to buy a $750,000 incinerator and a $110,000 fire truck, both for cash. 
 With the fate of Norwood and 4,300 jobs so closely linked to General Motors, residents shared worries on the streets and in restaurants. "It's almost as if there was a funeral," recalled Charlotte Shockley, a longtime Norwood newspaper editor and columnist.
Since the last car rolled off the line in August 1987, however, Norwood has discovered that there is life after G.M. Today, where the G.M. plant once stood, a new business park that already provides more than 1,000 jobs is rising. Young professionals who once shunned blue-collar Norwood are moving here and lifting prices of the city's spacious brick homes.
City officials and residents almost unanimously agree that Norwood's prospects are better without the auto maker. "It's been rough, but it's given us the only opportunity in the next 100 years to change the image of Norwood," Mayor Joseph E. Sanker said. "I think we're going to be a much better city in the long run."
Around the country, in towns that stand to be hurt by G.M.'s recently announced plan to close 21 plants and lay off more than 70,000 employees, residents and city leaders are bracing for the worst.
In recent weeks, local government and union officials have marshaled their best arguments to persuade G.M. to stay. Arlington, Tex., for one, has had the site of its G.M. assembly plant deemed an enterprise zone, which would mean tax breaks on future expansions. And Gov. Ann Richards of Texas has pledged to buy from G.M. all the natural-gas-powered vehicles that state agencies will be required to use in coming years.
Throughout the 1980's, from San Jose, Calif., to Framingham, Mass., more than a dozen communities have shared Norwood's struggle to recast their economies after the closing of a Big Three assembly plant. Their stories are as different as the cities themselves, with turmoil intensified or softened by the complexion of their regional economies.
"It can cut both both ways," said Harley Shaiken, a visiting scholar at the Institute for Industrial Relations at the University of California at Berkeley.
Norwood's fate is not the rule, in the view of Mr. Shaiken and others, but neither is the city the exception. The city's successes and struggles offer a broad look at both the possibilities and difficulties of building a new economy without the riches of a high-paying manufacturer like General Motors.
Although Norwood is not out of the woods and has to contend with an ominous $2.7 million budget deficit, it no longer mourns the loss of G.M., and its citizens are upbeat about the future. Their optimism is inspired largely by the city's new office buildings and fountain, which replaced the G.M. plant and brightens what would otherwise be a fading downtown. Some believe the city now has all the ingredients to eventually match the exclusivity of neighboring Hyde Park.
 
Some Get Lower Pay
 There are some former G.M. employees, though, who have settled for lower-paying jobs. Harold Bennie, 44 years old, had planned to retire in 2000, when he would be 52 and have 30 years with G.M. But because he did not want to move to another G.M. plant, he took G.M's severance offer, invested it in mutual funds and works at the municipal court, a job that pays $10,000 a year less. "I don't have the same pocket change," he said.
When G.M. operated in Norwood, it paid a 2 percent payroll tax as well as property taxes on its factory, equipment and inventory of new cars. The money accounted for a quarter of the city's budget and a fifth of the school district's. After G.M. departed, the city cut 40 employees, about 16 percent of its work force. The school district closed one of five elementary schools and laid off 39 employees, including 22, or 11 percent, of its teachers. Because of the loss of G.M.'s revenues, students started paying $20 this year for extracurricular activities that were once free.
 
More Cuts Expected
 The city's auditor, Donnie R. Jones, said the rising cost of all city services would continue to outstrip tax revenues and add $1 million each year to the current $2.7 million budget deficit, even with some rising property values. Although some city leaders believe the new office park will recoup lost tax revenues, Norwood could be forced into bankruptcy unless several cherished services are trimmed, Mr. Jones said. "We grew fat with General Motors," he noted.
But others were not hurt, and some were even helped, by G.M.'s departure. Some of Norwood's 400 businesses suffered temporary setbacks, but every company except a car transporter weathered the closing of the plant, said Charles L. Geraci, executive director of the Norwood Chamber of Commerce.
One reason for the nominal impact: Only about 400 of the G.M. workers lived here. "Those people who lived outside of Norwood took their paychecks and ran," Mr. Geraci said.
 
Home Prices Are Rising
 Housing sales have fallen since the plant closed, but real estate agents and homeowners say values have risen, in some cases as much as 30 percent, in four years. Keith and Jeannine Dostal said they would have never moved to Norwood until G.M. left because of its blue-collar image. But now they own a 4,100-square-foot home they bought for $76,900 in 1990. Mr. Dostal, a 30-year-old pharmacist, said the value of the house had risen $15,000 since he bought it and did some renovation.
G.M.'s plant closing indirectly benefited two other Norwood manufacturers. United States Playing Card and a Siemens electrical engine plant were both negotiating union contracts at the time of G.M.'s announcement. Executives at both companies said G.M.'s closing enabled them to win wage concessions from workers. "They could see that they could lose their jobs," said Ronald C. Rule, president of United States Playing Card.
Siemens and United States Playing Card did not hire many former G.M. workers, but opportunities in the region were plentiful. In the late 1980's, Cincinnati's economy was "really humming," adding about 30,000 jobs a year, said Joseph C. Kramer, vice president of economic development at the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.
Some former G.M. workers created jobs themselves. Don Combs used G.M.'s buyout to turn a part-time summer job building in-ground pools into a full-time business. Mr. Combs's concern has grown every year since, and he makes more money than he did at G.M. "I would never, ever go back," he said.
Local cultural institutions said they were not hurt by G.M.'s departure because the auto maker rarely supported such local activities, said Mary Lee Beckstedt, the city's treasurer and head of the Norwood Cultural Committee. G.M. workers helped raise $229,000 for the United Way of Greater Cincinnati in 1986, but that represented only a fraction of the total $35 million raised that year.
 
'They Are on Their Way'
 Despite the expectations of many, the social fabric of Norwood has mended almost completely since the shock of G.M.'s announcement. "It's going to take Norwood a long time to fully recover, but they are on their way," said Tom Gustina, a former case worker with the Salvation Army family service bureau. The Rev. Frank H. Niehaus of St. Elizabeth Roman Catholic Church in Norwood, added, "I see a very positive attitude in the community."
Much of Norwood's optimism is inspired by the fledgling Central Parke business development on the 60-acre G.M. site.
In all, the three buildings in the park house 19 tenants and more than 1,000 workers, including a bank check-processing center, a telemarketing company and a Computerland store. Within six months, the park's developer, the Belvedere Corporation of Cincinnati, fully leased the three buildings. Belvedere plans to invest more than $100 million to develop one million square feet of commercial space.
"In pretty difficult economic times, we've hit a home run," said Steven N. Stein, Belvedere's president.
 
Parking Garage Is Helpful
 Mr. Stein said Central Parke was popular largely because of its central location and its proximity to two main highways. Because of the 1,700-space parking garage left behind by G.M., Belvedere has also been able to offer free parking to its tenants, a costly amenity for tenants of competing projects in downtown Cincinnati. And the rent at Central Parke is roughly half that of downtown Cincinnati, he said.
City officials say the site's redevelopment would have been difficult if G.M. had not torn down the factory. The auto maker was at first hopeful that it could sell the plant although city officials wanted it razed to give them a chance to forge a new economy. Norwood filed a $318 million lawsuit against G.M., contending that it had reneged on its responsibilities to the city. The suit was later dismissed, but G.M. tore down the plant anyway.
 
The Developer's Desires
 Belvedere, the developer, had a particular interest in seeing the site developed as a business park. In 1989, it bought and upgraded a retail center, the Surrey Square Mall, directly across the street. Belvedere executives worried that another developer might build a competing mall. "Norwood's desires and ours were one and the same," Mr. Stein said.
Mayor Sanker is one who predicts that the growth of the business park will help Norwood balance its budget within four years without cutting services. Central Parke has also buoyed the political fortunes of city officials; residents returned all incumbents to office in November.
Indeed, many citizens said morale had improved in Norwood, which was once the butt of jokes in Cincinnati about hillbillies who came from Kentucky to work at the plant. Several residents echoed the words of Theodore A. Hooks, a Norwood native and publisher of The Norwood Times. As a young student, Mr. Hooks bused tables at the Country Kitchen restaurant across the street from the factory; when plant workers went on strike, he worried about his job. "I'm tickled to death that G.M. is gone," he said. "The city depended on G.M. like a crutch."

Sanker, above, standing outside a new business park that now rises on the old site of the G.M. plant.

HEADLINE: Cuban Firing Squad Executes Exile

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HAVANA, JAN. 20

 BODY:
A Cuban exile convicted of sabotage and terrorism was executed by firing squad today in a warning the Government said was aimed at right-wing exile groups operating from the United States.
 Eduardo Diaz Betancourt, 38 years old, was shot after appeals for clemency were turned down by Cuba's Supreme Court and the ruling Council of State headed by President Fidel Castro. 
 The official national news agency AIN, quoted by state television, reported the execution in a brief one-paragraph note titled "Sentence against terrorist carried out."
 Mr. Diaz Betancourt went to the firing squad despite pleas for clemency from leaders around the world.
 
 
Convicted of Sabotage
 The execution was approved as Cuba faced mounting international calls for political change and the worst economic crisis in its history, triggered by the breakup of the country's former ally and supplier, the Soviet Union.
 Mr. Diaz Betancourt and two other men were found guilty by a Cuban court 10 days ago of terrorism, sabotage and enemy propaganda.
 The three, who lived in Miami, were captured with arms and explosives on Dec. 29 shortly after landing on Cuba's northern coast in an inflatable dinghy.
 In a partial response to the international calls for clemency, death sentences against the others, Daniel Santovenia Fernandez, 36, and Pedro de la Caridad Alvarez Pedroso, 26, were commuted to 30 years' imprisonment.
 The Council of State, which made the final decision on the execution, made clear in a statement on Sunday that the death sentence for Mr. Diaz Betancourt was intended as a deterrent to future sabotage missions by right-wing Cuban exiles in the United States.
 The death penalty "fulfills a goal of overall prevention, especially when the idea is to stop such loathsome actions from being repeated, to deter others and so to prevent innocent human lives from being endangered in the future," the Council said.
Mr. Diaz Betancourt, who was said to have been the leader of the group, repeatedly confessed in court and on state television that the group's mission had been to plant firebombs in public places like movie theaters and restaurants and to attack economic targets.
 The United States Government strongly denied Cuba's allegations of involvement. State Department officials were not available for comment on Monday after the execution.
 Cuba's Council of State accused the United States authorities of showing "spectacular incompetence" in failing to prosecute Cuban exile leaders who recruited and trained individuals on American territory for attacks against Cuba.
 Entering the country illegally to commit terrorism, sabotage or other serious acts against state security can carry the death penalty. Lawyers during the trial said that the death penalty could be applied even if the accused had not been able to carry out the actions they had planned.
 The Council of State, in ratifying the death sentence against Mr. Diaz Betancourt, had ruled he was the most directly responsible in the charges against the three exiles.
 It said he was motivated by ambition for political power. The Council said he had hoped his planned terrorist activities would create chaos in Cuba and provoke United States intervention to end Communist rule on the island.
 In the past, armed Cuban exiles from the United States caught attempting to infiltrate were usually given long prison sentences.
 It was the most politically significant execution in Cuba since Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa and three other senior officers went to the firing squad in mid-1989 after being found guilty of corruption and involvement in drug trafficking.
 The three exiles were tried and sentenced amid a wave of nationwide anger in Cuba over the Jan. 9 killing of three policemen, two of whom were shot after being tied up, by a group trying to steal a boat to flee the island.
 The five men and two women of the group have been captured and could also face the firing squad if convicted.

HEADLINE: Bills Fans Overheat Buffalo (in January)

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Cathy Jo Woloszyn spent a lonely 1991 Super Bowl on Manhattan's Upper East Side, desperately looking for a bar populated with Buffalo Bills fans. Instead, the Buffalo native recalled, she found swarms of New York Giants fans, who cheered their team to victory over the Bills.
This year, she will be safely ensconced at the Buffalo Sports Garden, a sprawling warehouse-like bar and restaurant where 1,500 fans watched the American Football Conference championship game on more than two dozen 27-inch televisions (including several in the rest rooms) and three gargantuan screens as large as 23 feet. 
 The hordes will return for the Super Bowl on Jan. 26, and it is a safe bet, as Ms. Woloszyn said, "this place will really be cranking."
As the Bills prepare for their second Super Bowl in two years, Buffalo fans have become fanatics and their city has become one giant cheering section.
 
Bills Mania
 Some people say Bills mania is like the old New York Mets madness: After years of losing, finally, in the last few seasons, the Bills have turned into a genuine National Football League powerhouse.
"The Bills have labored long and hard to get here," said Mike Doyle, a store manager. "People here have suffered through all those 2-and-14 seasons."
Others say it has to do with the city and its people.
Buffalo, in the minds of outsiders, is a dreary place filled with faded factories and cursed with winters that are among the nation's most brutal. But the metropolitan area's 1.2 million people proudly defend their city, and lifelong residents like Ellen Collopy say that theirs is a community of good neighbors and loyal citizens.
That fierce loyalty is evident in the form of "Go Bills" banners draped on workplaces throughout the area, from gritty industrial parks in the northern suburb of Tonawanda to staid law firms like Jaeckle, Fleischmann & Mugel in downtown Buffalo. Shops are doing a booming business in Bills clothing and trinkets, and the classified pages of local newspapers are filled with columns of advertisements selling Super Bowl tickets for as much as $1,250 and even an offer to trade a condo in Cancun for a room in Minneapolis, where the Bills will square off against the Washington Redskins.
 
Cheer or Go Shopping
 "Everybody here's a Bills fan," said Laura Kopra, an office coordinator at Freddy's, one of Buffalo's many giant discount stores. "If you're not, it's best to stay home and stay quiet, or else go out shopping."
Neddy Lojacono, a saleswoman at the department store AM & A's, also disparaged the notion that any true Buffalonian might not be a Bills fan, as she joined other shoppers transfixed by a continuously playing 45-minute video featuring quarterback Jim Kelly and running back Thurman Thomas.
Bills mania is hard to miss at 80,000-seat Rich Stadium, where fans gloat about the fact that the league's highest attendance is in Buffalo -- one of the National Football League's smallest cities.
"Our voices are trained to stand the cheering and yelling," said Ken Wasiewicz, a clerk who happily paid $225 for season tickets this year.
"It doesn't matter if ticket prices go up," which they did this season and are likely to do next season, he said. "We had over 99 percent capacity on Sunday. They said only about 180 seats were empty."
At the Sports Garden, 50 kegs of beer had been consumed by mid-afternoon on the day the Bills won the American Conference title and the right to go to the Super Bowl, said Jeff McKnight, the bar manager. "We're going to have 80 kegs for the Super Bowl, but we'll probably be so full we'll have to turn people away as soon as we open."
He said that the restaurant's owner, Norm Labruzzo, had confided that "the difference for us between the Bills being in the Super Bowl and not being in is about $30,000 at the bar."
Like many at the Sports Garden and throughout the area, Mr. McKnight expects the Redskins to be tough opponents. But even if the team loses, the Chamber of Commerce has planned a rally the day after the Super Bowl. And residents are likely to turn out by the thousands, although some people see Bills players as less than ideal heroes.
"A lot of people are out of work in this area," Mr. McKnight said. "And when you get someone who makes a lot of money like Kelly, who the economic hard times aren't hitting, people resent it."
For many, however, Super Bowl excitement has meant a chance to improve their own incomes. At the airport, James Stokes, a Continental Airlines sales agent, was happily calculating the money to be made from flying three planeloads of players, coaches, team owners and their families to Minneapolis. And on Tuesday, a less savory attempt to cash in on the Bills was uncovered, when the local police arrested two men at the loading dock of Trench Manufacturing, accused of stealing 20 boxes of Bills T-shirts, worth $5,600.
At a time when few retailers' cash registers are ringing, Bills paraphernalia are Buffalo's hottest commodities. In the AM & A's store in Tonawanda, other merchandise has had to make room for a special Bills display.
Among the more exotic clothes are red-white-and-blue zebra-like caps and pants, and the home-furnishings' department is well-stocked with Bills tablecloths, paperweights and blankets. But for true Bills fanatics, the top-of-the-line gift is a $54.95 package that includes a team video and a welcome mat made of AstroTurf from Rich Stadium, complete with an official plaque declaring that it is "Certified Authentic End Zone AstroTurf."

HEADLINE: Can a Symbol of Fiscal Aplomb Ever Retire?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In 1975, Felix G. Rohatyn was recruited from the lofty confines of investment banking to help rescue the city from its own excesses. Mr. Rohatyn quickly emerged as a household name.
Today, Mr. Rohatyn is a frustrated gray eminence, an economic statesman whose vision is largely unfettered by a green eye shade and who understands the liabilities of a budget that meets legal definitions of balance but breaches the social contract. His advice as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation is valued by an eclectic following that includes Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, congressmen, chairmen of multinational corporations and, among others, the Government of Kazakhstan. 
 Yet for a man who has been deemed beyond reproach, he has also been greeted by some New Yorkers not as a messiah but as an intrusive messenger preaching fiscal responsibility at the expense of city services and city employees.
 
'Get Its House in Order'
 Today, Mr. Rohatyn (pronounced ROH-ah-tin) is even more concerned about the budget stalemate between the Governor and the Legislature.
"The state is far more culpable than the city," he said. "What's in question is not the ability of the state to get its house in order. The question is whether the state has the political capability to come to any kind of understanding.
"Nobody has recognized that the next time the credit rating is lowered it might not mean a quarter point extra in interest rates but serious market access problems," he said.
Mr. Rohatyn had planned to retire at the end of this month as the first and only chairman of the M.A.C., the state agency created in 1975 to borrow on the city's behalf. But two weeks ago, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Mr. Cuomo prevailed upon him to remain indefinitely.
As the embodiment of the M.A.C., Mr. Rohatyn has sometimes been an institutional irritant to Mr. Dinkins and to his predecessors. But as reluctant as the Mayor and Governor may have been to lose Mr. Rohatyn's financial expertise, something even more fundamental was at stake.
 
Message to Wall Street
 Mr. Rohatyn has become such a symbol in public finance that his planned departure, shortly after the Governor unveils his budget today and after the Mayor releases his own financial plan next week, might have conveyed a message to Wall Street that would have further jeopardized the city and state's credit.
"If all of a sudden you were to walk off and leave," Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's spokesman quoted Mr. Dinkins as saying, "people would say the city was falling apart."
Arguably, the role Mr. Rohatyn assumed in the latest crisis is more challenging than the one he played in 1975, when he was recruited by Gov. Hugh L. Carey. In a city inured to crises, there is neither the sense of urgency nor the cooperative spirit that prevailed then. This time, recurring deficits have been compounded by new social problems and by the state's even more pressing budget crisis. And Mr. Rohatyn has been dismissed as a doomsayer so consistently that when his pessimism is justified it may not be heeded.
What distinguished him in 1975 were his negotiating skills, his access to power and to publicity, his proficiency both at crunching numbers and at crafting quotable metaphors, and his ingenuity in forging solutions that seemed to satisfy budgetary and political imperatives.
Today his access is undiminished. But rather than being an outsider from Wall Street, Mr. Rohatyn is one of the players. Moreover, he now personifies the M.A.C. And having outlasted virtually everyone who had a role in the financial struggles of the 70's, he became an inviting target.
 
Faulting Dinkins Plan
 Instead of being viewed as resolving a crisis, he was perceived in some quarters as trying to create one last fall, in order to provoke a solution. He did this, his critics say, by dangling, then threatening to withhold from the city, a billion dollars that could be generated by refinancing bonds issued by the corporation. Without that money, Mayor Dinkins warned that it would have to raise taxes or further shrink municipal government.
The Mayor had planned to use the M.A.C. money instead of raising property taxes. But Mr. Rohatyn, describing the Mayor's preliminary financial plan as too tentative, called substituting M.A.C. money for a tax increase "sacrilege."
That public admonition alone persuaded the administration to draft a revised version in conjunction with the state Financial Control Board, an overseer headed by the Governor.The Dinkins administration now proposes to re-finance some of its own debt to pay off M.A.C. bonds, a maneuver that could cost millions of dollars more but would not require the approval of a recalcitrant Legislature.
Largely without questioning his motives, critics maintain that Mr. Rohatyn usurped prerogatives of elected officials to spend corporation surpluses that they maintain are the city's anyway. For all his well-known glibness, Mr. Rohatyn says he finds it difficult to defend himself without sounding self-serving.
But, he said, "when people ask, 'Who elected Felix?' the answer is that the politicians did, because they needed somebody to do this."
He has been a foil and a prod. But he was so stung by criticism from municipal labor leaders in 1990 that he announced his retirement -- then was persuaded by Mr. Cuomo to return to administer a final transfusion to the anemic city.
After Mr. Rohatyn retires from the M.A.C., he hopes to fulfill a personal commitment to the city by pursuing other civic ventures, including long-range planning for Carnegie Hall and helping to advance the public-education agenda set by his wife, Elizabeth, through her roles, among others, as the vice-chairwoman of Thirteen/ WNET and a trustee of the New York Public Library.
"I'm worn out, I really want to get in from out of the cold," he said last fall. "But everywhere I go, whether social functions or people coming up to me on the street, the message is the same: 'Hang in there.'
"I'm 64," he said. "We're going to stay in the city, but I frankly don't know what I would do if I were 20 years younger. I know it sounds arrogant, but one woman came up to me at a dinner party and said: 'Don't leave. It would be such a symbol. We'd all have to leave.' "
The potency of ideas, the authority to convey them in private and the flair to promote them in public would empower Mr. Rohatyn under any circumstances. He derives institutional power from his chairmanship of the corporation, which he engineered in 1975 to borrow for a city shunned by the private credit markets. The corporation's more than $6.5 billion in bonds are backed by the city's sales-tax receipts, which are diverted each year to pay off the debt.
The dozens of plaques and photographs that line Mr. Rohatyn's modest Rockefeller Center office, along with five Holbein prints, attest to a public presence that could not have been achieved simply by negotiating the sale of M.C.A. to Matsushita or finessing other high-profile deals as the senior partner of Lazard Freres & Company, the investment banking house.
Nonetheless, Mr. Rohatyn said he would never seek elective office. "I don't think I could take the abuse and the pandering that you have to do," he said. "I don't confront people. I negotiate. This is what I do for a living. When you deal in the private sector, you deal in solutions. When you deal with government, the political system insists that there be winners and losers."
Encased with other mementos in a small conference room just outside his office is a certificate of appreciation from Mayor Abraham D. Beame, who presided during the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's. Successive administrations resisted proposals to expand the M.A.C.'s mandate. Mayor Edward I. Koch bristled at the strings Mr. Rohatyn attached when he dispensed more than $3 billion in M.A.C. surpluses that had accumulated when bonds were refinanced at more favorable interest rates.
In conjunction with Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Koch, Mr. Rohatyn set the priorities on how the Assistance Corporation's surpluses would be spent -- mostly on education and mass transit. He also helped lobby the State Legislature to relax contract rules that would have driven up the cost of school construction.
Mr. Rohatyn said it was mostly his concern about racial tension in New York that led him to vote for Mr. Dinkins in 1989, when the Mayor became the first black man elected to the post. Today he particularly praises Mr. Dinkins for trying to calm Crown Heights in the aftermath of racial violence there last summer and for his latest aggressive response to racial assaults.
In part to reassure the financial community early on, Mr. Dinkins recruited Mr. Rohatyn as an adviser. Soon after, though, Mr. Rohatyn said that Mr. Dinkins acknowledged, "I'm more comfortable with my friends in labor than with financial geniuses like you."
A former colleague at Lazard Freres, Norman Steisel, Mr. Dinkins's First Deputy Mayor, has periodically been denounced by the Mayor's most liberal supporters as a tool of Wall Street. But, Mr. Rohatyn said, referring to the Assistance Corporation, "if we were tools of Wall Street, we never would have turned our surpluses over to the city."
In 1975, said Barry Feinstein, the head of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, "Felix was an agent of the Governor to bring the parties together."
"Now he has his own self-interest because of his bondholders," he added. "His judgment is clouded by his overwhelming desire to be the consummate financier."
If Mr. Rohatyn says he is frustrated that he has become the embodiment of the Assistance Corporation, it is an image that he has also cultivated as an integral part of his strategy of generally friendly persuasion.
"My role doesn't demonstrate power -- it demonstrates institutional failure," he said, meaning that if political institutions in the city were doing their jobs, his would largely be superfluous. "The only thing I can do is warn people and and try to do it as dispassionately and apolitically as possible.
"I have dreams, but I no longer have illusions," he said. "I don't believe I have a hidden agenda other than the fact that I live here. The Mayor has nothing that I want. The Governor has nothing that I want. There is an ego satisfaction in doing important things well, but if I wanted publicity I could get it in business."

HEADLINE: Auto Import Goal Isn't a Commitment, Japan Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Japan's Prime Minister and one of its leading car manufacturers reiterated today that Japan had made no commitment during President Bush's trade visit to buy United States autos and parts.
A top Bush Administration official responded by saying that if the Japanese back off their auto import goals there will be "a very negative reaction" in the United States. 
 Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and the chairman of the Toyota Motor Corporation, Eiji Toyoda, sought to dispel expectations that Japan was bound to meet auto purchasing targets set on Jan. 9, when Japanese negotiators agreed to trade concessions to help relieve the United States recession.
 
Termed a Target
 Mr. Miyazawa told NHK television that an announcement that Japanese auto makers would try to import nearly 20,000 Big Three vehicles and $10 billion more in auto parts was "a target rather than a firm promise." Japan now buys $9 billion in American auto parts a year.
The announcement was "a kind of forecast of how many U.S. automobiles and parts Japan would definitely be able to purchase by 1994," he said in the interview broadcast tonight.
Mr. Toyoda, chief of Japan's largest auto maker, told reporters in a separate interview that Toyota "will study and consider the possibility of selling G.M. cars. It is too much to say we will actually sell them."
At the time the agreements were signed earlier this month, the Japanese auto makers also described their purchase plans as targets, saying that fulfilling them depended largely on an increase in the quality of American-made auto parts. They said, however, that roughly $17 billion of the targets, which were established in November when the Japanese Government urged each auto maker to set a specific buying plan, should be attainable.
They have not been as optimistic about the remaining $2 billion, added during President Bush's visit here. "It is a best-case scenario," a senior Toyota executive said today.
 
U.S. Official Comments
 But in Washington, J. Michael Farren, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said of the statements today by Mr. Miyazawa and Mr. Toyoda: "It may be a sign of backing off from the stated goals that they have unilaterally set for themselves. It is not unusual for Japanese Government officials to make what looks like a fairly basic commitment and then qualify it heavily at a later date. This doesn't shock me."
Still, he added, Japanese auto makers realize there will be "a very negative reaction here in the United States if they don't expeditiously move to meet and exceed the goals."
Mr. Farren said the 20,000 import figure was never included in the formal Japanese Government statement -- at the United States request. That was because "frankly any number they might come out with would probably be low and not necessarily realistic," he said.
But the goal of raising auto part imports from $9 billion to $19 billion by 1994 "was in the document the Government put out," said Mr. Farren, who attended the Tokyo meeting.
During the four-day meeting that ended Jan. 10, Toyota announced it was setting a target of selling up to 5,000 General Motors vehicles a year through its dealerships. Japan's other four major auto makers -- Nissan, Honda, Mazda and Mitsubishi -- separately set targets totaling 15,000 more vehicles.
"In terms of a direct agreement with Toyota, we never said we had a direct agreement with Toyota," a G.M. spokesman, John Pekarek, said today in Detroit. "They pledged they would investigate selling 5,000 cars."
In another trade development today, Japan announced a pledge to open bidding to foreign companies on $3.3 billion worth of Government-purchased computer products and services. Japan had signed an accord on Government purchases of American computers during the visit by Mr. Bush.
Computers, like autos, have been a chronic sore point in talks to even out the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States. American negotiators have argued that Government agencies open bidding only to Japanese computer companies; Japan says the same thing about United States Government purchases.
On Wednesday, Japan's Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, who arrived in the United States today for meetings with top Government officials, will attend a White House signing ceremony of Japan's agreement to buy American-made computers. He will meet on Tuesday with Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.

HEADLINE: A Top Japanese Politician Calls U.S. Work Force Lazy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 20

 BODY:
One of Japan's most senior politicians said over the weekend that America's economic troubles were rooted in a work force "too lazy" to compete with Japan, and argued that one of the biggest problems of the United States was that nearly a third of its workers "cannot even read."
The harshly worded assessment by Yoshio Sakurauchi, the 79-year-old Speaker of Japan's powerful lower house of Parliament, seemed bound to fuel the trans-Pacific arguments over the causes of America's trade and competitiveness difficulties with Japan. Though Japanese politicians rarely speak publicly in such direct and confrontational terms about the United States, Mr. Sakurauchi's comments seemed to amplify themes that have appeared in the Japanese press and on television since President Bush and his entourage of business executives left Japan 10 days ago. 
 In Washington today, a Department of Education official denied the assertion that a third of American workers could not read, saying that less than 5 percent of the American population is illiterate. [Page D11.]
According to accounts that appeared widely in the Japanese-language press today, Mr. Sakurauchi told a meeting of supporters in Masuda City, a manufacturing and agricultural area in western Japan, that America risked becoming "Japan's subcontractor," and had no one to blame but itself.
"The source of the problem is the inferior quality of U.S. labor," he reportedly said. "U.S. workers are too lazy. They want high pay without working."
About 30 percent of American workers "cannot even read," he was quoted as having said. "So managers cannot convey their orders in written form. Therefore, they get a high ratio of bad parts."
Mr. Sakurauchi's comments clearly caught the Government here off guard. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is trying to play down differences with the United States and put the best face possible on Mr. Bush's much-criticized visit. Asked about Mr. Sakurauchi's assessment of the talents of American workers, the Government's chief spokesman, Koichi Kato, said that while individual politicians had their own views, "the Government should make no comments about the level, the quality or the education of workers in other nations."
Mr. Sakurauchi is a powerful member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and no stranger to dealings with the United States. In a long career, he has served as Foreign Minister, Agriculture Minister, Minister of International Trade and Industry and Construction Minister. He has also been the secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party and the head of its chief policy-making body.
 
Gist Is Confirmed
 Reached today at the speaker's office, one of Mr. Sakurauchi's political secretaries, Kyoshi Tsuchida, confirmed the gist of the press reports. But he said that another political secretary who attended the meeting on Sunday said that while Mr. Sakurauchi described illiteracy as a widespread problem among American workers, he did not mention a figure of 30 percent. He is quoted as using that number in two of Japan's leading newspapers, Yomiuri Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun. Apparently Japanese reporters attended the session.
"The same sorts of thing have been said repeatedly in industry magazines and other publications," Mr. Tsuchida said. "What he wanted to stress is that in the U.S. there is no good communications between managers and workers."
Despite Mr. Sakurauchi's comments, statistics indicate that American factory workers are, on average, still more productive than their Japanese counterparts. A recent survey by the United States Labor Department indicates that the American work force still leads the world in output per worker, and leads Japan by a margin of about 19 percent. But worker productivity in Japan is growing at roughly twice the rate of productivity growth in the United States. If current trends continue, Japan would surpass the United States in productivity around 1995.
Mr. Sakurauchi's comments today recalled several controversial remarks about the United States that have periodically come from Japanese leaders. In 1986, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who runs the faction to which Mr. Sakurauchi belongs, said that blacks and other minorities had lower intelligence levels than other Americans. In 1988, Michio Watanabe, who is now Foreign Minister, said that blacks used credit cards irresponsibly, spending themselves into bankruptcy. And a year and a half ago, during a sweep of a Tokyo red-light district, Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama compared foreign prostitutes to American blacks who, he said, destroyed good neighborhoods.
Mr. Sakurauchi's comments, however, were not overtly racial. Instead, he seemed to reflect a growing sentiment here that America was lashing out against Japan for a litany of domestic problems that are described almost daily in the press here: overpaid executives, a crumbling educational system and too little attention to the quality of products.

HEADLINE: SHAMIR IS VOWING NEW SETTLEMENTS

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 20

 BODY:
In a direct challenge to Bush Administration calls for his Government to stop building settlements in occupied lands, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir declared defiantly today that "this construction will continue and no power in the world will prevent this construction."
His Finance Minister went a step further by saying that if the United States insisted on a settlement freeze as the price for $10 billion in American loan guarantees that Israel says it needs to absorb new Jewish immigrants, he would rather forgo the assistance, no matter what the economic consequences. 
 "It is impossible to give up this hold on the land or undermine it for reasons of absorption or the population's welfare," said the Finance Minister, Yitzhak Modai. "We'll have to suffer together."
While the substance of what the Israeli officials said was not new, the timing was significant.
 
Seeking Political Benefits
 Having lost his parliamentary majority on Sunday when two far-right parties walked out of his governing coalition, Mr. Shamir seems headed for national elections in the next few months, and his uncompromising remarks today opened his political campaign. He has apparently decided that talking tough on settlements, especially before a group of cheering settlers in Betar Illit, outside Jerusalem, will do him enough good with Israeli voters to outweigh the harm it is almost certain to cause him in Washington.
"We see the construction in all of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip, and in all the land of Israel," Mr. Shamir said as he planted a tree at the settlement. Judea and Samaria are the biblical names that Israel uses for the West Bank.
"We will build, and I hope very much that we will also obtain guarantees," he said. "In any case, I'm sure we will continue to absorb emigration."
 
One Million New Immigrants
 The Prime Minister chose to take his uncompromising stand on settlements just as Israel is turning to Washington once more to provide the loan guarantees. They are intended to help Israel borrow billions of dollars from commercial banks to resettle an estimated one million immigrants expected from the former Soviet Union by 1995.
When the aid issue first arose in September, President Bush asked Congress to hold off debate for 120 days to avoid ruffling the budding Middle East peace process. Now that period is about to expire. As before, a pivotal issue is the Shamir Government's insistence on putting settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip despite warnings from some Israeli diplomats and American Jewish groups that this construction endangers the assistance package.
Increasingly, these American groups and some Government officials here say they are resigned to getting a lot less than they had originally asked for, in part because of the settlements and in part because of the anti-foreign aid mood in Washington.
 
Polls Suggest Irritation
 Public opinion polls suggest that the irritation with Mr. Shamir's hard-nosed position on settlements is widespread, for many Israelies complain that he is sacrificing the economic well-being and social needs on an altar of unyielding ideology. Some American Jewish leaders, though not all, are also unhappy because they feel that the Prime Minister is pushing them into battle against a White House that has already proved that it has more muscle than they do on this matter.
As though to define these lines even more sharply, the Israeli press today reported that a Government-commissioned study had concluded that unemployment here would rise to more than 16 percent, from 11 percent, in the next four years if the loan guarantees did not arrive.
The study, which warned of "human suffering and social problems," was ordered three months ago by Finance Minister Modai to bolster Israel's case for the assistance. But Mr. Modai said today that "even these kinds of unemployment rates are not the end of society or of the Israeli economy." Retaining the right to build in the territories is more important, he said.

HEADLINE: Thrift Office's Eager Terminator

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
In the mire of the savings and loan mess, T. Timothy Ryan Jr., the nation's top savings and loan regulator, has gotten remarkably little mud on his clothes.
The 46-year-old regulator has won so many political points for his swift seizure of faltering institutions and his crackdowns on industry scoundrels that his name has come up as a possibility for the next Comptroller of the Currency. He has successfully calmed a worried Congress, and his personal ties to President Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady have brought him into the Administration's inner circle. 
 But many in the industry are less than happy with his reign, which began three years ago when Mr. Ryan became the first head of the newly created Office of Thrift Supervision.
 
Some Say He Has Gone Too Far
 As chief of the agency that decides which institutions will live and which will die, he has been so eager to close them down that his actions have sometimes bordered on the reckless, many industry executives and lawyers say. They contend that he has taken a dragnet approach, closing savings and loans that might have survived. And they say his attacks on savings industry lawyers have gone too far, raising questions about whether his agency has violated due process protections.
"There have been some very heavy-handed actions that have cost taxpayers money," said Douglas Faucette, a Washington lawyer who once worked for bank regulators and now represents industry clients. "Absolutely, many of these institutions might have survived. But in the political situation, they have to round up everyone."
To Mr. Ryan, such criticisms are compliments. "Some think we've been real aggressive," Mr. Ryan said in a telephone interview. "And we plead guilty to that."
Mr. Ryan sees himself as a warrior for the taxpayer. "We are the front-line troops," he said. "We're trying to make it through each battle. Most people here have been in combat positions for three years already."
 
Cleaned Up Teamsters' Fund
 This is not the first time that Mr. Ryan has faced combat. A labor lawyer, he is perhaps best known for having cleaned up the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' pension fund while serving as solicitor in the Reagan Adminstration's Labor Department. After taking on the teamsters, a task made even more delicate by the teamsters' support for Mr. Reagan's Presidential bid, confronting savings-and-loan crooks pales by comparison, some officials say.
But at his thrift agency confirmation hearings, his lack of experience in financial services, along with admissions of marijuana and concaine use in his youth, nearly derailed his nomination. Only after Secretary Brady made a concerted push did Mr. Ryan squeak by.
By his own admission, Mr. Ryan's credentials were weak. "My concern was that I wasn't qualified and it was a big job," he said. Those close to him say that he accepted only after a personal call from the President. Mr. Ryan's only comment is that he took the job "because the right guy asked me."
Since then, he has won high marks as a quick study of an arcane industry whose misdeeds are costing the Government tens of billions of dollars.
"Timothy Ryan is a born and bred Washington operator," said S. William Seidman, former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "And that proves more important than being an expert in financial services. He came to the job well prepared to work the Washington scene, less well prepared to work finance. But he's picked that up rapidly."
 
670 S.& L.'s Sold or Liquidated
 During Mr. Ryan's tenure, his agency has ordered the liquidation or sale of some 670 savings and loans with assets of $350 billion, cut his agency's budget by about 10 percent a year and seen the capital of the surviving industry grow from under 1 percent to about 5 percent of assets.
An institution's capital is its cushion against losses. Those savings and loans determined to be unsound are transferred by the Office of Thrift Supervision to the Resolution Trust Corporation for sale or liquidation.
Currently, there are 2,148 savings and loans with $910 billion in assets under the thrift office's supervision. In the third quarter of 1991, 86 percent of these institutions were profitable, and the industry as a whole showed a net income of $271.8 million -- the third profitable quarter in a row.
But the numbers, rosy of late, mask an industry where the fate of many institutions remains uncertain and where, some say, a regulatory reign of terror pervades. "Everybody who's still alive is scared to death," said one former top Government enforcement lawyer now in private practice.
The argument some executives and lawyers offer is that in his zealousness, Mr. Ryan is closing institutions that if given a little latitude might survive. In doing so, they say, he is costing taxpayers extra money, since the Government has to cover the losses of these institutions -- immediately.
Charles John Koch, chief executive at the First Federal Savings Bank of Cleveland, said that while he was happy to have fewer competitors, Mr. Ryan's course imposed high costs on the public.
 
'Not in a Gambling Mood'
 "Mr. Ryan is not in a gambling mood that any given institution might make it," he said. "So they are teeing up to put anything remotely questionable into the R.T.C. It's good for me as a healthy thrift, but it's not in the best interests of the taxpayers because it costs a lot more."
While Mr. Ryan says that he has closed solvent savings and loans, he adds that his actions have been upheld in court and reflect his goals. "My mission has been to clean up the industry and make sure it is safe and sound," Mr. Ryan said. "We have been admittedly aggressive, but I know we don't have any Charles Keatings running around. We're the regulator of the industry. We aren't the trade association and we're not its promoter. That's how they got into trouble the last time. They had a regulator who was a promoter."
 
September 1993 Deadline
 Mr. Ryan admits, however, to feeling the pressure of a September 1993 deadline, when the cost of the cleanup switches from Treasury borrowings to the savings and loan insurance fund, which is supported by premiums levied on the industry. Mr. Ryan says the "most difficult part of this job" is making sure that the fund starts out with as few obvious liabilities as possible, which means closing institutions that could cause future problems.
"No one wants institutions to crash and then have the thrift insurance fund go down the tubes," he said. "It's like a health-insurance fund. You don't want to take in people with pre-existing conditions."
But that's the source of the problem, some say. "There's no downside to pulling the trigger too early," said Richard K. Kneipper, a Dallas lawyer with Jones Day Reavis & Pogue.
Another sore area is over the new legal tactics Mr. Ryan's agency has used. These include using administrative orders to freeze assets and impose severe penalties, even before a court finding of guilt. And his agency has begun to say that lawyers representing savings and loans also have a duty to report on their clients to regulators.
Congress gave Mr. Ryan's agency broad new prosecutorial powers when it was created in 1989. And he is using them all -- often at the same time. His agency can impose fines of up to $1 million a day, seize assets and set limits on how much defendants can pay for legal representation.
"You can only kill the person once, but there seems to be a lot of bullets going into the body," said Arthur Liebold, a Washington lawyer who represents savings and loans. "I don't think that Congress, by providing authority, necessarily says to an agency that you must excercise every single bit of it and push to the outer limits of statutory and judiciary authority."
Mr. Ryan is well aware of these comments. "Lawyers don't like it because they know they are potential targets," he said, "and accountants and investment bankers don't like it for the same reasons. But that's a major effort of ours right now. So, stay tuned."
Right now, Mr. Ryan's attention is on the "tweeners," savings and loans that are not obviously "brain dead," in regulatory parlance, and that at the same time are not clear winners -- a group with $247 billion in assets. These institutions have poor earnings, low capital and real estate portfolios that could go either way. Many of them, four large ones in particular, are in California.
While Mr. Ryan said he was optimistic about the California economy, he added that dealing with these institutions was much more difficult than his earlier actions.
He is currently floating the concept of "Early Resolution Assisted Mergers," to allow the Government to encourage buyers of these institutions by giving them some protection against the riskiness of the loan portfolios. The most controversial idea would allow existing stock- and bondholders to retain some investment in the institution, instead of being wiped out, a change from current policy.
But this plan is still in the discussion stage, as are proposals to merge the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates banks, with Mr. Ryan's agency. Both agencies come under the Treasury Department, and Mr. Ryan has long advocated their consolidation -- even before his name was raised as a possible Comptroller.
He demurs when asked whether he might like to head the combined agency, listing all the political obstacles to effecting such a union. "My only job," he said, "is to do this job."

HEADLINE: 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Debate Is Mere Tuneup On Democrats' Journey

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 20

 BODY:
Everybody had an angle in Sunday night's debate among the Democratic Presidential candidates. Stirring political theater it certainly was not, but it gave some clues about what each of the five will be trying to do in the weeks ahead.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas portrayed himself as the tribune of the middle class. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts said his economic program was more highly regarded by experts than those of his rivals. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska talked a lot about health insurance. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California rolled out a whole new tax plan. And Senator Tom Harkin worked hard to justify his claim to be "the only real Democrat" in the lot. 
 No one fell on his face. Each managed to score a point or two at the expense of his rivals. And a few ideas, usually about as common at such shindigs as unfilled jobs in New Hampshire, actually found breathing room.
But all of the five hopefuls have a lot to accomplish before the Democrats' third debate on Jan. 31, which will constitute the next checkpoint on the road to the New Hampshire primary, the nation's first, on Feb. 18.
Governor Clinton, who attracted the most support in a poll published by The Boston Globe the morning before the debate, got a taste of what it is like to be a front-runner. He attracted the gibes of both Mr. Harkin and Mr. Kerrey, with Mr. Harkin particularly hard on his record as Governor.
There will be a lot more detailed examination of that record in the days ahead, including discussions of the success of Arkansas's education overhaul, a sales-tax increase supported by Mr. Clinton and the harsh comments of the Little Rock newspaper on many of his ideas. More than anything else, Mr. Clinton will have to prove that he can take such punches and hit back, because the Democrats are determined, after the passivity of Michael S. Dukakis four years ago, to nominate a counterpuncher this time.
So far, his main rebuttal has been to call attention to the two senators' votes in favor of $23,000-a-year raises for themselves.
The Governor may also have to contend with accusations of extramarital affairs published last week in some newspapers and the potential damage the allegations could cause among women voters in particular. The accusations had relatively little circulation, but they came up during the debate, and despite Mr. Clinton's contention that the American people are tired of negative politics, that is unlikely to be the end of the subject.
His lead is not yet overwhelming, so it is probabaly too early for an ABC alliance (Anyone But Clinton) by his opponents, but Mr. Clinton has not been thoroughly tested, and they cannot afford to let that last.
For Mr. Kerrey, the challenge is to make himself seem the logical alternative to Mr. Clinton for those who find the Arkansan unsatisfactory for one reason or another. There has not seemed to be a tremendous amount of ideological space between them, but Mr. Kerrey is trying to open some and said today that he was "ready for some body contact" with his Democratic rivals.
His new television commercials show him tending goal in a hockey rink, promising to protect American jobs. In the debate, he insisted that the Japanese had blocked the United States from their markets, and he expressed doubts that a middle-class tax cut would "massively stimulate the economy." Both of those views resemble those of Senator Harkin, and may represent an attempt to go after voters who find Mr. Clinton too bland.
Mr. Harkin sought to undermine any such effort by accusing Mr. Kerrey of voting against American workers' interests on the special "fast-track" authorization for President Bush's trade negotiations with Mexico.
Clearly, the Iowa Senator faces the greatest peril here of the three candidates who are given a good shot at eventual nomination. The polls show him with an almost invisible base, and his hard-hitting performance Sunday night was designed to convince people, in his own words, that he alone offered something other than "a tweedledee Democrat attacking a tweedledum Republican." He bluntly termed Mr. Clinton an apostle of Reaganomics.
New Hampshire ought to offer, in this winter of its economic discontent, fertile ground for a candidate who offers a radically different approach on taxes and benefits, and Mr. Harkin is such a candidate. Yet he is faltering. If the problem is the messenger, his television advertisements and a more focused personal style like the one he displayed Sunday night may help; if the problem is the message, and Democrats are convinced that a middle-of-the-road approach is needed to defeat Mr. Bush, there's not much Mr. Harkin can do.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Tsongas face a much more worrisome problem: getting the electorate to take them seriously. Although several influential local commentators praised his performance Sunday night, Mr. Tsongas is still taken as a regional candidate with little real chance, and Mr. Brown, despite a more measured performance than in the last debate, is considered the rank outsider.

HEADLINE: In Move to Spur Economy, Bush Is Urged to Order 90-Day Ban on New Federal Rules

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
President Bush's senior advisers have recommended that he stop all Government agencies from issuing new rules for three months as part of a broad campaign to revive the economy by reducing the burden of Federal regulation, White House officials said today.
The recommendation, most likely to be included in Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message on Jan. 28, comes from Vice President Dan Quayle and other officials, including C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel; Richard G. Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. 
 Rules required by statute and those considered most likely to have a beneficial effect on the economy would be exempt from the ban, Administration officials said.
 
An Across-the-Board Ban
 "What we envision is a moratorium on proposing new regulations, across the board in every agency, except those rules required by statute or those that stimulate economic growth," a White House official said, confirming a report in today's issue of The Wall Street Journal. "This will send a clear signal to agencies that the President wants them to re-examine all regulations and their impact on the economy."
The moratorium would affect most of the 4,800 regulations now being developed by Federal agencies.
White House officials said Mr. Bush was troubled by studies documenting a resurgence of Federal regulations since he became President in January 1989. The number of pages in the Federal Register, a crude but useful indicator of regulatory activity, increased last year by 26 percent, to 67,715 pages, the highest number since 1980, the final year of the Carter Administration.
As Vice President, Mr. Bush was in charge of President Ronald Reagan's Task Force on Regulatory Relief, which blocked hundreds of rules deemed burdensome to business, consumers, universities or local governments. But as President, Mr. Bush has allowed such rules to proliferate.
White House officials listed seven broad areas in which they now hope to reduce Federal regulation on entrepreneurs and businesses: environmental protection (including fuel economy standards for automobiles); energy (natural gas, electricity); transportation (trucking, ocean shipping, airlines); exports; communications (cellular telephones, cable television); biotechnology, and "access to capital."
Gary D. Bass, director of O.M.B. Watch, a consumer group that monitors the Office of Management and Budget, said the moratorium was "an outrageous attempt by the Administration to appeal to business interests in an election year."
Mr. Bass also said the effects of the moratoriium would run beyond three months because "agencies will be afraid to initiate regulations to protect workers, consumers and the public in general."
Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Government Operations Committee, which supervises Federal regulatory policy, said, "Particularly in light of what appears to be the total lack of any economic analysis to support this proposal, it is likely only to increase the perception that President Bush is desperate, rudderless and lacking in any original program to get the economy back on track."
 
Improper Interference Charged
 Mr. Conyers and Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, have charged that the White House improperly interferred in the rule-making of Federal agencies.
White House officials said the 90-day ban on new regulations could be imposed by the President alone without action by Congress.
"For tax policy we have to go to Congress, and for monetary policy we have to depend on the Federal Reserve, but regulatory policy is one area where the President can act unilaterally," said a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Administration officials said they did not have a reliable estimate of benefits from the moratorium. One White House official said it could save businesses $10 billion to $100 billion a year. But Gail E. Shearer, manager of policy analysis for Consumers Union, said the Administration "undervalues the benefits of regulations that protect health and safety."
It is not clear who would decide which regulations are exempt from the 90-day ban.
Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency, and Edward M. Emmett, a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, welcomed the prospect of a moratorium. Mr. Clarke said his agency was drafting "an absolute mountain of regulations, guidelines and restrictions" to be imposed on banks.
Mr. Emmett estimated that the nation could save $40 billion a year by curtailing trucking regulations. "We still have vestiges of a regulatory scheme from the 1930's," he said.
Murray L. Weidenbaum, who was chairman of Mr. Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers in 1981 and 1982, and James C. Miller 3d, who was Mr. Reagan's budget director from 1985 to 1988, applauded the idea of a ban on new rules.
"It will signal employers and producers that the Bush Administration is seriously concerned about the costs of regulation," said Mr. Weidenbaum, now a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "It will also give regulatory agencies a more adequate opportunity to carefully develop the regulations that are coming out at prodigious rates."
The action recommended to Mr. Bush is reminiscent of a 1980 campaign pledge by Mr. Reagan, who said he would declare a moratorium on new regulations. As President, he killed many pending rules and ordered rigorous comparison of the costs and benefits of all proposed rules.

HEADLINE: Diplomats Are Edgy as India Stubbornly Builds Its Nuclear Arsenal

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 20

 BODY:
In sharp contrast to the rest of the world, South Asia is on the brink of a nuclear arms race, say senior Western diplomats and foreign political figures who have visited New Delhi in recent weeks.
This arms race is viewed with particular alarm because of the continuing tension between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, a region over which two wars have already been fought. 
 And although both India and Pakistan are regarded as nuclear powers by Western intelligence agencies, these diplomats generally contend that it is India, rather than Pakistan, that has blocked any meaningful progress toward defusing nuclear proliferation.
"South Asia seems to be bucking the trend on reducing international tensions," said a senior diplomat here. "We see South Asia at the precipice of a nuclear weapons race. Within the next five years, both sides will have medium-range missiles. Each side will have to assume the worst of each other. And this is destabilizing because of the hair-trigger nature of these missiles in times of tension."
 
First Nuclear, Now Chemical
 India detonated a nuclear device in 1974 for what it said were peaceful purposes, and Pakistan is generally recognized as having developed its own nuclear abilities. Indeed, in testimony this month to the Senate subcommittee on nonproliferation, Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, expressed Washington's anxiety over the direction both nations were taking.
"In South Asia, the arms race between India and Pakistan is a major concern," Mr. Gates told the subcommittee. "Not only do both countries have nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs; they have recently pursued chemical weapons as well. These programs are particularly worrisome because of constant tension and conflict in Kashmir." All American assistance to Pakistan was cut off in 1990 because of its nuclear-weapons program.
In the last year, and especially in recent months, concerted international pressure -- a medley of wooing, cajoling, encouragement, suggestions, hectoring and plain blunt talk -- has been applied to India, pressure intended to get the Government to address the question of nuclear proliferation in South Asia. So far none of it has worked.
 
Pakistan Proposes Talks
 Since June, Pakistan has been making proposals for talks with India over nuclear issues, has volunteered to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if India does and has suggested a gathering of the United States, Russia, China, India and Pakistan to discuss the elimination of nuclear weapons in South Asia.
In November, during a visit here by the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, Reginald Bartholomew, the United States proposed more sweeping five-power talks to explore a greater range of options.
Among his ideas were a test-ban treaty and pledges not to attack urban centers, along with a proposal that both India and Pakistan sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to international inspection.
 
No Response From India
 India has remained silent on all these proposals, instead offering arguments as to why it cannot contemplate a limit on its nuclear options. These arguments are made publicly in the press, privately in conversations with foreign journalists and even, with hardly any differences, in discussions with foreign governments.
Foremost, India insists that Pakistan retains aggressive intentions toward India and that it has its own nuclear weapons. With its smaller army, the Indians argue, Pakistan will inevitably rely more on its nuclear arsenal, however tiny, if there is a serious conflict along the border.
The Indians also argue that as long as China, a nation with whom it fought a border war in 1962, possesses nuclear weapons, New Delhi cannot consider any proposal that would lead to a nuclear-free zone in South Asia, since China shows no signs of giving up its nuclear weapons. India also contends that there is an inherent unfairness in the pressure from the large powers on New Delhi when they continue to possess large arsenals of their own.
But these arguments have not been met with sympathy, neither in Washington nor in Moscow, nor in London nor even in Tokyo. "Nonproliferation is not an American issue," said a diplomat here. "The French and the Germans have found religion on this issue. Even the Japanese have expressed their concerns to the India about this."
The United States and Britain in particular, are pressing India to put forth some ideas of its own. Last week, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain was here and the issue of nonproliferation headed his agenda. And next month Ronald F. Lehman 2d, the director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmanent Agency, is to visit New Delhi to re-emphasize Washington's position.
"I have left them in no doubt of the growing anxiety of nuclear proliferation," Mr. Hurd told the BBC. "They left me in no doubt that so far as they are concerned they see the problems here in this part of the world as resulting from the differences between of India and Pakistan."
After emerging from his meetings with Government leaders, the Foreign Secretary was pessimistic about prospects for India joining any five-power talks on nuclear proliferation. "I didn't have the impression that this was likely in the near future," he said.
Diplomats here and in Western capitals are becoming increasingly frustrated by India's refusal either to discuss proliferation with them or to put forth ideas of their own.
At the British Embassy here, David S. Keeling, first secretary for information, said: "What we have suggested to the Indians is that there is no point in turning their backs on these ideas, that they should frame proposals of their own. Why not come out with some positive proposals of their own and come and sit down and talk about it?"
"India is becoming more and more conspicuous in its stance," said a senior Western diplomat here. "The Indians know that the countries they are depending on to make their economic reforms a success are pushing them on nonproliferation. They have a hard choice to make."
Particularly worrisome, this diplomat said, is the rush toward the development of medium-range missiles by both sides. "They say they have a legitimate need for missiles," the diplomat said. "China has them. Pakistan is getting them. It's a matter of parity and all that. This is extremely dangerous."
 
The Political Factor
 Many diplomats here say the difficulty facing India's leaders in grappling with nuclear issues is as much political as substantive. The main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu chauvinist party bitterly hostile to Pakistan, opposes signing the nonproliferation treaty. Indeed, in a visit to the United States this month, the party's president, Lal Kishen Advani, said India should retain its nuclear ability.
Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, who heads a minority Government in Parliament and who is delicately pushing forward with the most radical restructuring of India's economy since independence, is not seen by most diplomats as willing to provoke a showdown with the opposition over the nuclear issue. Pakistan's continued aid to separatist rebels in Kashmir has made it virtually impossible for him even to engage his counterpart in Islamabad in discussing the matter.
But a diplomat here said the Indians had been told repeatedly: "Pakistan has said it will match any Indian move on nukes. Maybe it's a bluff, but it should be called."

HEADLINE: Net Up 9.9% At Raytheon

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Mass. Jan. 20

 BODY:
The Raytheon Company today reported a 9.9 percent increase in quarterly earnings, saying its diversity helped shield the company from a weak economy and military cuts.
Raytheon, a leading Government contractor, reported earnings of $157.8 million, or $2.37 a share, for the last three months of 1991. That compared with profits of $143.6 million, or $2.20 a share, in the 1990 quarter. 
 Sales dipped slightly to $2.43 billion, compared with $2.46 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier. But Raytheon also tried to cut costs during the year, shrinking its payroll by about 5,000 jobs.
For 1991, Raytheon reported its seventh straight year of record earnings. Annual profits rose 6.2 percent, to $591.8 million, or $8.95 a share. Sales were virtually flat at $9.27 billion. That compared with earnings of $557.3 million, or $8.53 a share.
Annual profits were down in Raytheon's electronics segment, which does much of the company's military work. But profits rose 43 percent in the energy services division.
Raytheon shares lost $1.50 each today, closing at $87.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Congress Returns Today To Fight Over Economy

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Congressional leaders are predicting that they will kick out of the starting block when they return to work Tuesday, trying to overcome election-year partisanship and act quickly on a number of measures intended to stimulate the economy, like a tax cut for the middle class and an extension of unemployment benefits for the jobless.
The political discord of Presidential election years usually shackles Congressional action, but leaders say this year could be different, at least on tax policy, because the recession demands efforts to stimulate the economy. 
 While most economists warn that a tax cut might worsen the budget deficit and harm the bond market, Democratic leaders say it is politically imperative for them to work with President Bush to take action.
"Both the President and Congress will try to act expeditiously to get things done because the economy is in trouble," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said in an interview. "We'll try to move a tax bill quickly."
The first test will come early this week when Democrats in the House introduce legislation to extend unemployment insurance another 13 weeks. Mr. Bush vetoed two earlier versions last year before signing a 20-week extension in November. Democratic leaders say they have the votes to override a veto, but they believe the President has to be more cooperative this year.
The White House and Democratic leaders in Congress appear ready to tinker with the spending restrictions of the 1990 budget agreement, allowing them to use money from reduced Pentagon spending for non-military purposes. They also appear to be moving toward penalty-free withdrawals of individual retirement accounts for first-time home buyers and tax incentives for businesses willing to make capital investments.
The White House is expected to propose a smaller tax cut than the Democrats support, but differences appear to be lessening.
Republican leaders in Congress say they are willing to work with Democrats to cut taxes, but they will fight Democratic efforts to increase social spending by directing that cuts in military spending be targeted at reducing the deficit or paying for tax cuts.
"The big debate will be over what should be done with defense savings," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. "The Democrats desperately want to spend it. We will fight any effort to destroy spending restraints."
Republicans will also promote a cut in taxes on capital gains, a proposal that George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, said he would oppose unless the rate for the wealthiest taxpayers is increased. That is a concession the White House is not expected to accept.
 
Education Debate Looms
 Economic matters are likely to dominate Congressional action until the Easter break, particularly in the House, where tax legislation originates. But as the session progresses, the Democratic Congress and the Republican White House are likely to shoot arrows at each other over a number of other issues, including banking regulations, energy conservation, changes in health insurance and family and medical leave.
The first arrows are expected to fly this week, when the Senate debates a $850 million education bill sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, that would give parents a choice in deciding on what public schools they want their children to attend. Senate Democrats will sharply criticize an alternative proposal by the Bush Administration to use Federal money to subsidize parents who choose to send their children to private schools.
Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Senate Republican whip, said that if the Democrats did not accept the President's education proposal it would mean "just the usual business, a highly partisan wrangle" that could spill over on the debates on crime and health care. But he predicted that both parties would try to cooperate to a greater extent than in most election years because of "this tremendous specter hanging over all the incumbents."
 "The public is restive." the Senator added. "We have to do something."
 
Family Leave and Health Care
 Family and medical leave promises to be a defining issue this political season because it is popular among many middle-class voters but is opposed by the President as an intrusion on business. Both the House and Senate last year passed bills that would require all but small businesses to give their employees unpaid leave in the event of birth, adoption or the illness of a relative.
Noting that a conference committee will soon reconcile the two versions, Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House majority whip, said, "We'll send Mr. Bush a bill and let him veto it."
Many leaders expect that the hottest Congressional debate of the year to be over health care, with most Democrats demanding comprehensive changes in the nation's health insurance system to cover unemployed and part-time workers, as well as all women and children.
Although proposals like universal national health insurance are gaining momentum, particularly in the House, a veto by Mr. Bush has been promised for all but the most modest changes, like tax incentives to expand private insurance coverage.
In foreign affairs, Congressional Democrats are most likely to challenge the President on China and trade. The Administration appears to have shelved its free-trade pact with Mexico until after the Presidential election, but protectionist impulses may grow on Capitol Hill, especially if the recession deepens.
The Senate is scheduled to vote on a House-Senate conference report that would insist that China release all Tiananmen Square protesters and halt importation of goods produced by Chinese prison labor.
 
Democratic Consensus Needed
 But first, Senate and House Democratic leaders must meet this week to decide how much to cut military spending below the 1990 budget agreement and how to divide the savings. Senator Mitchell has proposed a cut of $100 billion in military spending over the next five years.
Then the Democrats must reach a consensus on what kind of tax cut they support and whether any revenue that would be lost would be balanced by a tax increase on the wealthy. Mr. Gephardt said that the Democratic leadership had still not decided on what kind of tax cut package it would endorse, but he added that most Democratic members supported plans proposed by Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, or Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
The Bentsen approach would offer families a tax credit of $300 for each child 18 years old or younger and, regardless of income, full deductability of up to $2,000 in contributions to individual retirement accounts. Lost revenue would be made up by a 5 percent cut in military spending.
The Rostenkowski plan calls for an income tax credit equivalent to one-fifth of the Medicare and Social Security taxes a taxpayer pays, with a minimum of $200 for a single filer and $400 for a working couple. The credits would last two years, and would be financed by higher taxes on the rich.

GRAPHIC: Photo of Congress
 
Chart: "Issues Awaiting Congress"
Taxes: An assortment of middle-class tax cuts are being considered.
 * One approach, proposed by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, would grant income tax credits equal to 20 percent of the Medicare and Social Security taxes paid by individual filers and families. The credits would be financed by higher taxes for those with the highest incomes.
 * Another approach, proposed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, would give families tax credits for each child and full deductability of up to $2,000 for contributions to individual retirement accounts.
Health care: More than 30 bills intended to improve the health insurance system have been offered. They include plans which would require companies to expand coverage, as well as to grant tax incentives to individuals and companies to buy or provide coverage, extend many Medicare and Medicaid benefits to all citizens, or create a national health insurance program.
Energy: Congress will consider redrafted legislation aimed at promoting renewable fuels and conservation.
Crime: Efforts will be renewed in favor of legislation to expand the death penalty and handgun control.
Family and medical leave: A Senate-House conference is due to reconcile bills that would guarantee workers unpaid leave for sickness, adoption or birth.
Foreign Policy: Congress must decide what kind and how much aid to give to the Soviet Union, and whether or not to restrict imports from Japan and China.

HEADLINE: Home Health-Care Employees Reach Pact on Wage Increases

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
In a labor agreement likely to set the pace for publicly financed home health-care services in New York City, the union representing about 20,000 nurses' aides announced a tentative agreement yesterday with 28 private agencies on a 5 percent wage increase, from $5.90 to $6.20 an hour.
The agreement affects about a third of the 60,000 workers in New York City who are paid under the Medicaid program to care for elderly and disabled patients who are stable enough to be discharged from a hospital. The number of home health-care workers has swelled in recent years as government agencies have tried to cut costs by moving people out of the hospitals and nursing homes.
 
Lump-Sum Payments
 Union officials say the workers, many of them middle-aged women with much less clinical training than registered nurses or therapists, are among the lowest-paid employees in the health-care industry. 
 "These are poor people serving poor patients," said Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union, which reached the agreement. "They are the most under-represented workers in America."
The agreement comes 18 months after the last union contract on home-care services expired. A ratification vote by union members is set for today. The agreement, which expires July 1, would make the wage increases retroactive to last July and give workers a lump-sum payment of between $1,000 and $1,200.
Union officials said the main impetus for the agreement was obtaining support for the wage increases from the city, which reimburses the home-care agencies.
Under the agreement, the private health care agencies granted a wage increase that exactly matches the state's estimate of inflation.
The agreement includes several new benefits. The agencies agreed to contribute to a new pension fund, at the rate of 6.5 cents an hour. Union officials estimated the contributions to the pension fund would total $4 million a year. In addition, the agencies would begin contributing to a new training fund. Union officials conceded that workers would ultimately need more money to finance their pensions adequately, but described the agreement as a first step in providing retirement benefits.
Tom O'Brien, executive director of Family Home Care Services of Brooklyn and Queens, who represented the agencies in the negotiations, said the agreement would likely be the model for two other unions that represent home health-care workers. "This will set the pace. You can be sure of it," he said.

HEADLINE: Nationsbank Posts Loss After Merger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Nationsbank, the new name for the country's fourth-largest banking company, created by the year-end merger of the NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., and the C&S/Sovran Corporation of Atlanta, said it had a $243.8 million loss in the fourth quarter and a profit of $201.8 million, or 76 cents a share, for all of 1991. The loss, the bank said, was a result of its previously announced plans to lump various merger expenses into the final quarter of last year.
Nationsbank also said it expected to cut costs by $450 million annually as a result of a closer study of the merger plans, rather than $350 million as it had previously forecast. The bank first, however, had to charge off $314 million of expenses in the fourth quarter for costs that included closing offices, combining computer systems and making severance payments to employees. 
 Earnings were further reduced as the company added $525 million to its reserve for loan losses, up from $430 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Most of the reserves were needed for loans at C&S/Sovran, which was badly hurt by real estate projects in the Washington area.
The fourth-quarter loss compared with a profit a year earlier of $38.3 million, or 13 cents a share. For the full year profits were down 66 percent from $594.7 million, or $2.61 a share, in 1990.
Despite the increase in reserves for loan losses, John Mason, a banking analyst at the Interstate/Johnson Lane Corporation, in Charlotte, said that problems with bad loans were declining.
 
Cleaning Up Problems
 "It looks," he added, "as if they are cleaning up the old mess, and not strugglihg with newly emerging problems."
He noted that the total of loans 90 days delinquent, plus other loans not expected to be repaid in full and holdings of real estate acquired through foreclosure, was slightly less than $3.03 billion at the end of the year. That was up only about $61.4 million from Sept. 30 and was by far the smallest quarterly increase of the year.
Nationsbank's loss for the fourth quarter would have been even greater but for a profit of $222.2 million from its investment portfolio, where declining interest rates caused bond prices to rise. Because loan demand from Texas has not been enough to absorb all the deposits generated in that state, Nationsbank has accumulated $24.9 billion in its investment portfolio in the last few years that is the largest of any bank in the country. Profits on those investments, which the company reports in its income only when it sells securities, totaled $453.5 million last year.
Analysts expect additional profits from the investment portfolio this year, since the portfolio's market value at Dec. 31 was $915 million greater than the value shown on the company's books.
As Nationsbank reduces its investment portfolio and increases its consumer lending to its goal of 50 percent of all loans, from 39 percent at the end of last year, analysts expect profits to increase because the consumer loans pay interest rates of well over 10 percent, or several percentage points higher than yields on its note and bond investments.

Dollar Falls Against the Yen In Light Trading on Holiday

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday against the Japanese yen and was narrowly lower against other currencies in light holiday trading.
Gold prices closed higher. Gold rose $3.80 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $357.80 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $357.50, up $3.50. 
 Analysts said the dollar remained vulnerable against the yen after Friday's intervention by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The two central banks sold dollars to push the dollar lower against the yen.
Traders are "not in any big hurry to test the central banks' resolve after the big selloff Friday," said Mike Faust, a foreign exchange analyst with MMS International.
The dollar fell to 123.25 Japanese yen in New York yesterday from 124.55 late Friday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell 4 yen, to 123.95 yen, and in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 123.70 yen.
Trading was very light as big banks were closed and other traders took the day off for the holiday marking the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Mr. Faust said the market was expected to remain quiet for the rest of the week in the absence of any new economic statistics and in advance of a meeting next weekend of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
The British pound gained against the dollar yesterday, rising to $1.7980 in New York from $1.7955 on Friday. In earlier London trading, the pound rose to $1.7905 from $1.7780.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.59155 German marks, down from 1.5920; 1.4095 Swiss francs, down from 1.4085; 5.4275 French francs, unchanged; 1,198.50 Italian lire, down from 1,199.25, and 1.14955 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15025.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $358.85, from $356.30 late Friday. In Zurich, it rose to $358.30 an ounce from $355.55.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.62 an ounce to close at $355.78
Silver lost 1.3 cents on the Commodity Exchange and closed at $4.257 a troy ounce. Silver also fell in London to a late bid of $4.28, from $4.30 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Efforts to Reduce Retiree Costs

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
PUSHED by a new accounting rule, most large employers are examining ways to reduce the enormous future costs of medical benefits they have promised to retirees. Benefits consultants say some executives view the benefits as a "gratuity" rather than a permanent obligation, when they are not detailed in an employment contract. But most employers say they are committed to continuing the programs, albeit often with reduced benefits, despite rapid growth in both medical costs and the numbers of retirees.
Under an accounting rule that takes effect in 1993, corporations with at least 500 employees must calculate future retiree medical obligations and charge off the costs against income -- either all at once, or spread over 20 years. The rule does not require setting aside cash for the future costs. 
 Michael J. Gulotta, president of Actuarial Sciences, a consulting unit of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said that employees' concerns about their economic security would push some companies to set up tax-deductible funds dedicated to future retiree costs. Trust funds negotiated with unions qualify for special tax breaks.
After discussions last year with its unions, A.T.& T. invested $361 million for retiree medical benefits in two voluntary employee benefit accounts. One is for union members, the other for nonunion people. The telephone company said it expected its accumulated liabilities for future retiree health benefits to be $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion, after payment of taxes.
The retiree accounts are much less attractive for businesses with fewer union employees. A recent survey of 1,200 employers that offer retiree health benefits, by the A. Foster Higgins consulting firm, found that only 8 percent were "prefunding" the benefits and 3 percent were setting aside some funds. The vast majority, 89 percent, were spending only for current medical expenses of retirees.
The Central Telephone Company, a unit of the Centel Corporation in Chicago, has not established a retiree medical account, said Steve Bailor, Central's vice president and controller. It reports the future expenses in its annual reports, he said, but it uses the money "for general business purposes."
Some utilities are asking state regulators for rate increases based on the expenses, whether or not money is being set aside. Florida granted such a request by Centel's Florida unit. But officials in California and a number of other states said that such increases would have to be based on money set aside by utilities in their states.
In view of the meager tax advantages in retiree benefit trust accounts for management and other nonunion employees, Mr. Gulotta at Actuarial Sciences said that a number of employers were considering setting up trusts that would buy life insurance for employees. The up-front expense would be considerable but the insurance could grow with tax-free interest, reducing a company's liability under the new accounting rule.
Companies that have invested in employee benefit funds "today will have less of a burden in the future than those who have not," Mr. Gulotta said.
But Judith F. Mazo, a senior vice president in Washington with the Segal Company consulting firm, said that many employers were reluctant to invest in the funds because of uncertainty about future changes in the nation's health system that could make the issue moot.
Some unions have similar qualms, said Meredith Miller, assistant director of employee benefits with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "They have been resisting the idea of prefunding," she said, "because they did not want to break apart the retirees from the major plan" -- risking dividing their members over benefits. "They are pushing for national health care," Ms. Mazo said.
Patricia Wilson, a principal with A. Foster Higgins, said: "Many employers still maintain that benefits are gratuities rather than contractual obligations. I think they're right." Even so, she added, employers were not canceling promises.
"They need to satisfy the needs of retirees, whether they fund through pensions or a medical plan," she said. "If they cut back on retiree benefits, they may be forced to increase wages or contributions to a 401(k)" employee savings plan.
FHP Inc., a health maintenance organization based in Fountain Valley, Calif., is taking a different approach with the help of Federal money for the elderly. H.M.O.'s can get 95 percent of the usual Medicare costs per patient.
"We can relieve the companies of all or a preponderance of liability under the accounting rule," said Wescott W. Price 3d, FHP's president. Medicare members got basic coverage and free prescription drugs, he added.
FHP said companies like Chevron, B. F. Goodrich, Northrop, Rockwell International and TRW were offering the plan to retirees. Dan Heslin, director of employee benefit programs at Rockwell, said his company encouraged retirees to join H.M.O.'s by adding dental and vision services that Medicare would not cover. But he said the program appealed mainly to longstanding H.M.O. members who lived near an H.M.O.'s doctors.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Up a Bit Abroad

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved a bit higher in overseas trading yesterday.
There was no activity in cash fixed-income markets in the United States in observance of the holiday for the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Futures markets in Chicago were open, but they closed early because of the holiday. 
 Analysts said the modest price improvement abroad was probably a delayed reaction to the results of the University of Michigan's midmonth reading on consumer confidence, released on Friday.
 
Surprise in Confidence Report
 Traders had been speculating that confidence surged in mid-January in response to the Federal Reserve Board's aggressive cuts in interest rates on Dec. 20.
In fact, the survey showed that confidence fell a bit further during the first two weeks of the month. The results prompted traders in the United States to bid up securities prices on Friday.
Remarks by a Fed governor, Edward W. Kelley Jr., had no impact on trading yesterday but may be an influence today.
In a speech before a Florida business group, Mr. Kelley said the United States must accept undesirably slow economic growth while the excesses of the 1980's are worked off.
In recent weeks, concerns have mounted among credit market participants that the recent declines in interest rates engineered by the Fed will generate a recovery that is more than mild.
 
30-Year Bond at 104 29/32
 At the close of trading in Europe, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds were offered at a price of 10429/32 , up 11/32 , to yield 7.58 percent, compared with 7.60 percent late Friday.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, the nearby March Treasury bond contract rose by 3/8 point, to 103.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 1037/32 , up10/32 , to yield 7.03 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/8, up 2/32 , to yield 4.93 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.76 percent, down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged, at 3.87 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.94 percent.
Because of the holiday, the Treasury did not hold its weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday. The auctions will be held today.

HEADLINE: Paris Showcase of Ukrainian Performing Arts

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 20

 BODY:
In his film "Meeting Venus," the Hungarian director Istvan Szabo used a Paris production of Wagner's "Tannhauser" as a metaphor for the quarreling cacophony of the new Europe. "Ukraine in Paris," a five-month showcase of the performing arts from that newly independent country, which began here on Friday night, seems a kind of real-life echo of Mr. Szabo's film, exposing the mixture of privation and pride, confusion and purpose that defines the Ukrainian intelligentsia in these unsure times.
The showcase, planned before independence but given a new weight by it, will consist of two opera productions this month by the Kiev Opera, several ballet programs by the Opera Ballet in February, performances by the National Ballet of Ukraine in March and April and by the Kiev branch of the Red Army Chorus (billed on some posters as the Ex-Red Army Chorus) in May. 
 Friday's opening performance of Mussorgsky's "Khovanshchina" in the cavernous Palais des Congres -- at 3,800 seats it is nearly three times the size of the company's home theater -- was remarkably assured. It was old-fashioned, but it was also more stylistically secure and vocally consistent than what was heard from the Bolshoi Opera of Moscow in New York last summer. This success was all the more remarkable given the comic-opera chaos that attended the arrival of the Kiev ensemble.
Their charter flight was delayed a day. Their buses arrived an hour late at the airport. They had to wait two hours in their hotel lobby for their room keys. Most of them straggled into the theater only a couple of hours before their first performance, exhausted and bereft of proper stage rehearsal.
"We are artists," complained Anatoly Mokrenko, a former singer and Ukrainian nationalist writer who was named company director in November. "For me, it is difficult to grasp the situation. We need our rest."
Irina Molostova, a longtime Kiev stage director born and trained in Moscow, was more adamant. "Can you imagine the courage of our artists?" she asked just before the opening-night performance. "You might ask, 'How do these people, who have nothing to eat, who have so many difficulties, sing so beautifully?' "
It was a good question. The operas -- the other is Tchaikovsky's "Mazeppa," which receives its first performance on Tuesday night -- are being given with alternating casts. The singers heard on Friday would have done honor to any operatic ensemble in the world, although their vocal amplitude was difficult to gauge in the quirky acoustics and subtle yet distinct amplification of the Palais des Congres.
Like so many Slavic troupes, the Kiev Opera seems particularly strong in male voices, with solidly sonorous performances by Valentin Pivovarov as Ivan Khovansky, Nikolai Chopcha as Dosifei and Aleksandr Vostriakov as Golitsin. Equally impressive was the choral singing, with more than 100 colorfully attired soldiers of various allegiances, Old Believers, peasants and townsfolk filling the stage with sight and sound.
 
Realistic Conventions
 Miss Molostova's production, unlike the Bolshoi's timid and erratic attempts at modernization, stuck securely within realistic conventions. The company used Shostakovich's orchestration, as does the Metropolitan Opera, although some 45 minutes of music were shorn (at least for Paris). No doubt the production was considered snappily up-to-date when it was new in 1963, but now it looks comfortably ensconced in tradition.
"Unlike Western theaters," Miss Molostova said with a distinct touch of disapproval, "we don't change productions every one or two seasons. Our style depends on the composer. With Mussorgsky, we are traditionalist, because what is important is the period of the opera, the 17th century. To my mind, though, 'Khovanshchina' is a modern opera, from the point of view of its ideas. It's like Gorbachev and Yeltsin: everybody's grabbing for power, and the people lose their heads."
It might seem odd that a showcase of Ukrainian culture would open with two operas by Russian composers, even if "Mazeppa" is being sung in Ukrainian and concerns, at least ostensibly, a 17th-century Ukrainian hero (Tchaikovsky chose to emphasize a fictional love story over politics). According to Miss Molostova and Mr. Mokrenko, however, the reason for this repertory is simple: musical superiority.
"Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky are classics; they belong to the whole world," said Miss Molostova, who like Mr. Mokrenko spoke in Russian through an interpreter. "There are Ukrainian operas, but our national opera had a later and more difficult development than Russian opera. When our theater was founded in 1867, we could not sing or compose in Ukrainian. The Urkrainian language was not permitted until 1926. Now, the company sings most Russian operas in Russian and all the rest in Ukrainian."
 
The New and the Classic
 Mr. Mokrenko, who wears a lapel pin of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag, said that a systematic policy of Russianization persisted in all aspects of Ukrainian culture well after 1926. He said that the company now included about 4 Ukrainian operas in its annual repertory of 30 works, and that he hoped to gradually increase that number without abandoning the classics, Russian and otherwise.
"We have to test the Ukrainian operas that have been written to know what we already have, and encourage new ones," he said. "Until now, Ukrainian composers have had no motivation, because what they wrote wasn't produced. We have to develop the creativity of our composers."
Mr. Mokrenko's optimism comes at a time in which major artistic institutions of the former Soviet Union face a cloudy future. The Kiev Opera and Ballet employ a total of 1,200 people, nearly half of them vocal soloists, chorus singers, ballet dancers, orchestra members and artistic stage personnel of one sort or another. So far, relatively few of the star singers have defected to the West -- Miss Molostova says that's because they are more patriotic than their Bolshoi peers -- which contributes to the sense of ensemble closeness heard and seen on Friday.
 
Inflation a Problem
 Although the new Ukrainian Parliament has pledged to increase the theater's subsidy in real economic terms, inflation has confounded long-range planning. "Already, before this trip to Paris, we had to raise salaries twice," Miss Molostova said. The annual budget has increased 10-fold in 10 years, from 1.2 million rubles to 12 million, nearly all of which reflects inflation. "The situation is so unstable, we can't even speak of figures and percentages," she went on.
Dmitri Gnatuk, a former star baritone with the company and now stage director of its new "Mazeppa" (the production was first seen last year), said: "Three months ago the top ticket price was three rubles. Now it's seven rubles. Fortunately, the audiences have held pretty steady."
"Still, I am sure that with independence we will live much, much better," added Mr. Gnatuk, who is a native Ukrainian and worldwide exponent of Ukrainian folk songs. "Not only the Ukrainians but all the nationalities that live in Ukraine." He smiled at the Russian-born Miss Molostova. "Even the Russians will live better than the Russians in Russia."

The Perils Of Life in Minneapolis

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
THEY have signs on some of the larger streets here that inform drivers that these are "Snow Emergency Routes." The signs draw a glance from the Super Bowl crowd beginning to stream in for next Sunday's game. The signs in fact are not taken down even in summer. I remember asking someone about this when I moved here in 1965. "Remove them?" she said. "For three days?"
This was kind of a joke, but you never know when it's going to snow in Minneapolis. Last Halloween, just a couple of days after the World Series here, 28 inches fell. So the people are prepared: like the hotel doorman who greets you in a raccoon hat and a raccoon coat; like those residents who sought to make the snowplow the offical pace car for the Super Bowl. 
 While the weather can be brutal, the locals still laugh. Ha. Ha. This is not new, either; the Sioux, the original tenants of the land here, named one of their landmarks Minnehaha Falls, "Minnehaha" meaning Laughing Waters.
I lived here for two years, working at The Minneapolis Tribune, and I liked this town very much. It is as clean as a declarative sentence, as easy to move around in as one of those great old houses on Lake of the Isles, or on Summit Avenue in St. Paul, and the landscape around the Twin Cities is often beautiful. I've never again seen the changing of the leaves in fall as gorgeous as it was along the banks of the Mississippi here. Not even in Hancock, N.H.
They have their problems here, though, like any big city, from a fall in the economy to a rise in crime. "You heard of the Rolex girls?" I was asked. "They were women in bars who met visiting businessmen who wore Rolex watches and other jewelry. They went up to the men's rooms, drugged and robbed them. Now, everyone knows these things can happen. But people here were amazed because it happened in Minneapolis."
And the town has had its growth -- skyscrapers and skyways and malls exist where none did before -- but nearly 25 years after I left here for Gotham, much of it seems unchanged.
I have even been invited to go ice fishing.
I remember the first such invitation many years ago. I was told about this quaint local custom, in which people either sit outside, mufflered like mummies, and peer down a hole, or they erect wood and tin shacks as soon as the lakes freeze over. People in those houses bring in furniture and heaters and televisions and schnapps, carve holes in the ice of the living-room floor and fish.
I thought I'd try it. "We'll go to White Bear Lake," my host said. "It's pretty safe there."
"Safe?" I said. "You mean some aren't safe?" "Well," he said, "some guys rush the season, or there's a weak spot in the ice. And sometimes people driving their trucks or cars on the lake go down in it. Houses float away sometimes, too."
"In other words," I said, "people drown while ice fishing."
"Happens all the time," he said.
I didn't make it ice fishing that weekend and attended something else. I don't remember what, probably a snowball fight.
The Super Bowl is going to be played in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, home of football's Vikings and baseball's Twins. But I covered those teams in the old Metropolitan Stadium, an outdooor ball yard that had the feel of a cozy, minor league park, and was terrific. I saw Fran Tarkenton running for his life on numerous occasions on frozen fields, and I saw a rookie with an eye-catching swing stroke one of his first hits in the major leagues, a pinch-hit single to win a game in the ninth inning. Rod Carew went on to get some 3,000 more hits, and a bronze plaque in the Hall of Fame.
Carew enjoyed Minneapolis, and fell in love in Minneapolis, marrying Marilyn Levy. But I also remember another side of life here for him. He was infuriated when police officers would stop him while he was jogging, figuring, he said, that if a black man was running, he must be running from something.
I once saw the namesake of the Metrodome at a University of Minnesota football game -- the school is in Minneapolis, and he was class of '39. In the closing minutes of the game at Memorial Stadium, with the Gophers losing by an insurmountable margin to Kansas, Vice President Humphrey saw that his companion, Gov. Karl Rolvaag, was rising to go. Humphrey gently put his hand on the Governor's arm to keep him in his seat. "If the old ship goes down," Humphrey said, "we go with her."
Minnesotans can be that hardy, that loyal, that dreamy. Meanwhile, I still haven't gone ice fishing. Maybe one day. First, though, I've got to work on my breaststroke.

Six Mind Benders

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Now that we have been told everything we always wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask, could somebody please tell us the answers to some other questions we've been afraid to ask because the answers are probably so obvious that asking the questions would make us look stupid?
Question 1: Why does the United States have to import paper clips from Taiwan? Cars from Japan are one thing. Making a car may take a lot of good old Japanese know-how, which may be beyond Americans at the moment. But paper clips? 
 You mean to say Americans are too dumb to bend a flimsy little piece of metal three times, then put it in a flimsy cardboard box with a lot of other flimsy little bent pieces of metal, and send the boxes to the local stationery store?
You mean to say it's cheaper to bend this metal in Taiwan, then ship it all the way across the Pacific, then all over the continental U.S., than it is to make them down by the gas works and have them delivered around town by kids on bicycles?
Obviously that's exactly what you mean to say, or every paper clip in this house would not be made on the other side of the world. Is it dumb to ask what's wrong here anyhow?
Question 2: Speaking of Japanese car know-how, why do President Bush and the Detroit auto big shots go to such pains to make Americans look like whiners by trying to make the Japanese buy more American cars?
Are we wrong in thinking the problem is not that the Japanese aren't buying enough American cars, but that the Americans aren't buying enough American cars? Wouldn't it make more sense, and help us keep our dignity, for the President and Detroit big shots to persuade Americans to buy more American cars?
Question 3: Speaking of Detroit, doesn't the political campaign to put tougher trade restrictions on Japanese car imports amount to the same thing as trying to give Detroit a government handout?
Why is it that when government takes care of large industries its tenderness is called "tougher trade policy" instead of "welfare"? If New Jersey has a good idea in cutting off added welfare payments to mothers who don't stop having babies, isn't it an equally good idea, if the government starts subsidizing the auto industry, to cut the subsidy every time car tycoons conclude a losing year by giving themselves a pay raise?
Question 4: Speaking of New Jersey, why did the Republicans there scream when the outgoing Democratic Legislature proposed repealing Governor Florio's tax package?
Didn't the new Republican Legislature get itself elected by sympathizing loudly with the public's hatred for the cruel, brutal, unfair, beastly, not to say monstrous taxes enacted by the Florio Democrats? Shouldn't the Republicans, then, have supported the outgoing Legislature's attempt to rid New Jersey of this burden?
Can it be that New Jersey Republicans secretly believe tax revenue, especially when provided by brutal Democratic governance, is actually wonderful stuff for politicians to have at their disposal, especially when the rascals who provided it have been tossed over the side?
But why are there no outraged-taxpayer demonstrations against the Republicans for refusing to support repeal of the punitive Florio taxes? Is it because American voters are more hardened to being conned by Republican than Democratic governments, hence more stoical about it when betrayed by the G.O.P.?
Question 5: Why does the stock market reach record heights at the very moment the President of the United States declares the national economy is in a "free fall"? Does this mean that what's bad for the average American is terrific for Wall Street? And does it work the other way around? Would the economy snap out of the present slump if only the stock market would collapse?
Honestly, now, is there any difference between playing the stock market and taking your bankroll down to the big casino on the Jersey shore?
Question 6: Why do serious people keep saying Dan Quayle is "not as bad as he's made out to be"? The question isn't what degree of badness Quayle measures out at. Most of us probably aren't as bad as a lot of people think we are, but does that put us among the top 500 people most qualified to be President?
Why doesn't anybody ever say, "Dan Quayle would make a great President"?

HEADLINE: Prague Has to Drive Fast in Economic Mud;
Lustration Is Necessary

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Perils of 'Lustration' " (editorial, Jan. 7), criticizing the lustration process in Czechoslovakia where former Communist Party officials are banned from employment in high posts for five years, misreads the situation in my country. You have assumed a stable country with a normal market economy, but neither of these conditions hold.
At all levels and in all sectors of society, former members of the Communist Party are employed, many of whom acted as agents of the notorious secret police. In the current situation in Czechoslovakia, where the economy is dominated by state enterprises, they have enormous power. 
 During the transformation from Communism to a democratic system, when former social structures are being replaced by new institutions, these people have used their positions and the information they have been privy to for so many years for two purposes: to enrich themselves and to maintain their dominance as long as possible. They know that in a democratic, market system, they will have fewer occasions for their extralegal activities and that positions of responsibility will be filled on the basis of competency, not membership in the Communist Party. Clearly they have no interest in assisting the transformation process.
Germany after World War II experienced a salutary denazification process, and so it is necessary for Czechoslovakia to undergo a process of decommunization. Lustration is merely an instrument to accelerate this process. By no means is the law ideal. But it should be noted that the "five-year ban on employment" applies only to high-level functions in government and top management of state-owned enterprises and it applies only to officials of the former Communist Party above a particular level.
If America had experienced the ravages of a Communism that for 40 years ruined our economy, demoralized us and consigned an entire generation to emptiness, perhaps you would be more understanding of our need for lustration.

HEADLINE: AID TO EX-SOVIETS IS BEING HINDERED

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Two months after Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan announced a $165 million program to send free American food to what was then the Soviet Union, no food has been delivered and only one contract, worth $15 million, has been awarded.
And that contract, providing for deliveries of mostly butter to Armenia, will not be carried out until Feb. 20 because shipping companies refused to lease refrigerated air-freight containers for fear they would be stolen, said the Rev. Yeznig Balian, who is supervising the delivery for the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, which is based in New York. 
 As diplomats from four dozen nations and seven multilateral institutions prepare for meetings in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday to coordinate assistance to the former Soviet republics, aid programs remain bogged down by Western red tape and Soviet corruption.
 
Theft There, Ultracaution Here
 The disappearance of German food parcels from St. Petersburg docks, the availability of Dutch ground meat on the Russian black market and the rejection of free British beef by Moscow authorities with possible links to hoarders have made headlines in the West.
The invisible twin of the problem there is caution verging on paralysis among Western aid officials, who lack the staff to supervise large-scale deliveries and find private voluntary organizations overwhelmed by the task.
The result is that while many Western and Russian experts warn that shortages could provoke the overthrow of the democratic governments in the former Soviet republics, any major Western assistance organized at the conference is unlikely to arrive soon.
Frustration is also causing American and German officials to speak seriously of sending humanitarian supplies with forces from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which will be represented at the conference.
 
Pace Is Slowing, Not Quickening
 The European Community has delivered barely half of the $300 million in food grants it pledged 13 months ago, said a senior community official who insisted on anonymity. None of the $600 million in food credits announced then has been disbursed and almost none of a recent $250 million package of grants, he added.
Japan has pledged $600 million in aid and credits but has only just begun deliveries after several months of worrying about who would repay the loans.
When Mr. Madigan announced the $165 million in food grants along with $1.25 billion in food credits on Nov. 18, the Agriculture Department had already been negotiating for a month or more with nonprofit groups.
But the need to insure that these groups have realistic distribution plans, guarding against spoilage and corruption, has kept a half-dozen contracts from receiving final approval, said Roger D. Runningen, a spokesman for the department.
 
A Warning from the Embassy
 The delays have produced irritation at the highest levels of the American Embassy in Moscow, Administration officials said.
The embassy has repeatedly warned the State Department that food must be shipped more quickly, and is considering a plan to begin selling some food to Russian officials to reduce the embarrassment of giving food away and then having it show up in markets anyway, the officials said.
The food delivery issues will be taken up by a special committee at the conference this week, led by Canada, Britain and Germany.
And for those who want to flee the uncertainties of the new economics in the new republics, Foreign Minister Guido di Tella of Argentina said in an interview published today that his country would be willing to accept up to 100,000 immigrants from the Russian minorities in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Reuters reported.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 23, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about food aid to the former Soviet republics omitted an American contract, because of incorrect information provided by the Agriculture Department. The department awarded a $1.2 million contract last week to the Brother's Brother Foundation in Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: Economy Likely To Revive Soon, Congress Is Told

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
At the start of a Presidential election year in which the economy is a central issue, the Congressional Budget Office predicted today that the economy would begin a weak recovery by the middle of 1992 and warned lawmakers not to endanger the recovery by resorting to radical changes in economic policy before the November election.
In a report to Congress, the budget office said the recession was likely to end within six months. But it offered no guidance as to whether Mr. Bush and Congress would be able to withstand the mounting political pressure for steps to stimulate the economy. 
 The pressure from that side of the budget debate was raised a notch today when a group of conservative Republican members ofCongress said at a luncheon at the White House that that they favored a strong economic growth program, including deeper cuts in capital gains taxes than the Administration has been planning.
 
Bad News on Joblessness
 The legislators implied that they might introduce their own tax cut proposals if the President's plan failed to satisfy them but stopped short of threatening to do so, said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack F. Kemp, who attended the meeting.
The Congressional report also included some bad news for Mr. Bush with its prediction that unemployment would average about 7 percent this year, despite the modest economic growth foreseen for the last two quarters of 1992.
Unemployment is the most politically sensitive economic issue in a Presidential election year. White House advisers have been debating how vigorously to attack unemployment and the low growth rate as a means of reversing the decline in Mr. Bush's popularity and combating the assertion from his rivals that he lacks concern for people of average income.
In the report, the nonpartisan budget office said that the recession had made "further deficit reduction inadvisable this year" but that "the deficit should return to the top of the political agenda in 1993," because huge deficits cripple economic growth.
In an interview tonight, Robert D. Reischauer, director of the budget office, said that if recovery was jeopardized with significant further deficit reduction, "it would only add to the national debt and leave us in a deeper hole from which to climb out."
 
High Unemployment
 Mr. Reischauer is scheduled to present his conclusions on Wednesday at a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee.
The report said Federal spending would account for nearly 25 percent of the gross national product this year, the highest share since World War II, as the Federal budget deficit soared to a record of $352 billion. It also predicted a growing gap between Federal spending and revenue, which it expected to account for slightly less than 19 percent of the gross national product.
The budget office predicted that the nation would begin to pull out of the recession in the second half of this year but that the economy would grow only 2.8 percent between the final quarters of 1991 and 1992.
"This lukewarm performance will only gradually reduce the hardships that the recession has brought to many parts of the country," it said. "The unemployment rate will remain high for some time, averaging close to 7 percent in 1992."
The nation's unemployment rate climbed to 7.1 percent in December 1991, the highest in five and one-half years. Nearly eight million people were out of work.
In the interview, Mr. Reischauer said: "The economy is basically dead in the water at this point. We expect it to strengthen over the course of the spring, in large measure because of the easing of monetary policy that occurred in the last half of 1991."
 
Difference in Forecasts
 The budget office's forecast of economic growth is slightly above that of private economists. The White House forecast will be in the President's budget proposal later this month.
Last year at this time, the budget office was estimating that the 1992 deficit would be $298 billion. And Mr. Bush was projecting a 1992 deficit of $281 billion.
In its new report, the budget office said, "The deficit outlook is far bleaker than was expected when Congress and the President reached their budget summit agreement in the fall of 1990." But it asserted that "the budget would be in a much deeper hole" without that agreement.
The budget deficit was $269 billion, or 4.8 percent of the gross national product, in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 1991. The $352 billion deficit projected for the current fiscal year would amount to 6 percent of the G.N.P., just shy of the post-World War II high of 6.3 percent in 1983.
For politicians, public officials and lobbyists, the report means that the battle over the Federal budget will probably be more difficult than usual this year, as the desire to stimulate economic growth comes into conflict with the need to control the deficit.
At the White House luncheon today, the Republican lawmakers criticized Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady for not pursuing a bolder economic policy, according to The Washington Post, which first reported the meeting in its early edition of Wednesday's issue.
The lawmakers, including Senator Connie Mack of Florida and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Minority Whip, were invited to the luncheon by Samuel K. Skinner, the chief of staff, and Robert M. Teeter, the chairman of Mr. Bush's re-election campaign. Mr. Skinner, who has been portrayed as seeking to wrest policy-making power at the White House from Mr. Darman, has has been talking to Republican members of Congress for the last 10 days about the President's plans, and today's lunch gave them a chance to respond, one participant said.
 
High Debt Growth Expected
 In his report, Mr. Reischauer reviewed many proposals to stimulate the economy through various combinations of tax and spending programs known as fiscal policy. But the report concluded that "no changes in fiscal policy can provide major stimulus to the economy unless they increase the budget deficit."
The budget office foresaw explosive growth in the Federal debt -- the accumulated total of all Federal borrowing -- and rapid growth in the interest that must be paid on it. Interest payments will continue rising despite the recent decline in short-term interest rates, the report said.
The ratio of the Federal debt to gross national product will reach 52 percent this year, it said, a level not seen since the mid-1950's, when the Government still owed huge amounts from World War II. The budget office said this ratio, which measures the Federal debt in relation to the size of the nation's economy, would reach nearly 55 percent in 1994 and 1995.
Interest payments on the Federal debt will be "the third-largest category of spending in the budget" this year, after Social Security and military spending, the report said.
"Debt held by the public is projected to grow from $2.7 trillion at the end of 1991 to $4.2 trillion in 1997 as the Government runs $1.5 trillion in deficits over the six-year period," it said.
The budget office, created in 1974, strives to be nonpartisan, works for both Democrats and Republicans and does not endorse specific legislative proposals.
The report laid out criteria for evaluating proposals to combat the recession. "The most effective fiscal policy actions are those that can be applied quickly, stimulate the economy rapidly rather than gradually and encourage spending rather than saving," it said.
The budget office said several measures might satisfy these criteria and stimulate the economy "with perhaps only minimal adverse long-term effects." They include personal tax rebates on 1991 tax liabilities, temporary tax credits for additional business investment in plants and equipment, and a temporary increase in Federal aid to state and local governments.
The President is known to be considering the investment tax credit and some type of tax cut for families, but he has not signaled any interest in additional grants to local governments.

HEADLINE: SPENDING CUTBACKS OUTLINED BY CUOMO TO BALANCE BUDGET

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, rebuffed in bids to forge a long-term solution to New York State's chronic fiscal ills, presented the Legislature today with a more traditional approach that would pare spending on nearly all local-aid and state programs in his 1992-93 state budget.
He pleaded with lawmakers to pass the budget by April 1, the statutory deadline that he and they have failed to meet in each of the last seven years. 
 The Governor's $30.2 billion spending plan, unveiled in a somber presentation in the State Capitol, would in general provide New York City and other local governments and school districts with slightly less in state aid than they received this year, further squeezing their budgets even as their costs and the demands for services during the recession continue to rise.
 
Impact on Dinkins Budget
 In New York City, officials said the Cuomo plan would add $300 million to $350 million to the $1.6 billion potential gap in the $29 billion budget that Mayor David N. Dinkins is to present next week. Aides to the Governor vigorously disputed the number, saying relief from some state mandates and Medicaid programs would make the overall impact roughly a wash.
Although Mr. Cuomo said his budget officials had come up with a balanced plan, he acknowledged that they had done so based on a variety of Federal and state projections that the economy would rebound slightly by the fall. This, if true, would raise some tax revenues and lower spending on social-service programs for the poor. Similarly optimistic projections built into last year's plan proved incorrect, causing a major shortfall to develop.
 
Tax Cuts Deferred
 The spending plan outlined today does not include any tax increases, but it does for the third year in a row defer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts -- an average of a little more than $100 per taxpayer -- passed in the flush fiscal times of the mid-1980's. A planned reduction in the 15 percent surcharge on corporate tax liability would also be put off.
By offering across-the-board cuts but withholding Draconian action against any segment of the budget typically protected by either the Republican-led State Senate or the Democratic-controlled Assembly, Mr. Cuomo was clearly trying to present a conciliatory document that could garner relatively quick agreement here. [News analysis, page B6.]
The Cuomo plan also imposes $127 million in new and higher fees, including an increase from $16 to $20 in the cost of a four-year driver's license and a roughly $1-a-year surcharge on all telephone bills to help finance emergency medical services.
The across-the-board approach, of course, is no guarantee of success. The Governor and lawmakers have been feuding for months over the contours of the budget, and Mr. Cuomo today repeated accusations that the Senate had deliberately walked away from an all-but-agreed-to deal earlier this month.
The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay, L.I., seemed to leave himself maximum flexibility in his response to Mr. Cuomo's plan.
He said the Governor "falls short in his approach to trim welfare and Medicaid costs," but added that he was encouraged that Mr. Cuomo had adopted what he said were several Republican proposals in these areas. Among them were fingerprinting welfare recipients to deter fraud, requiring the poor to make co-payments (50 cents to $3) for some Medicaid services and requiring some younger recipients of benefits from social programs to live with their parents.
 
'A Disgrace'
 Mr. Cuomo warned today that another delay in adopting the budget -- last year's final accord came a record 65 days after the deadline -- could prove "catastrophic" for the state, whose credit rating was lowered earlier this month to the worst of any state except Massachusetts. He said further action by Wall Street, which could be prompted by a late budget, could force some public authorities and school districts to pay exorbitant rates to borrow or could shut them out of the markets.
"The perennial failure to adopt a budget on time is a disgrace," Mr. Cuomo said today. "This year, 'timeliness, timeliness, timeliness' should be the mantra repeated everywhere in the Capitol."
Under the Cuomo plan, the state's "general fund" budget, which accounts for spending derived from nearly all state taxes and fees, would rise by 1.4 percent to $30.25 billion. But factoring in Federal funds for Medicaid, welfare, housing and other areas channeled through the state government, as well as some bonding for capital programs, the state's "all funds" budget would grow by just under 6 percent, to $56.5 billion.
The plan provoked expressions of dismay from dozens of advocacy groups, ranging from hospital organizations and schoolteachers to patrons of the arts. The unhappiness could bode poorly for its chances of approval in the Legislature. But on the other hand, it seemed to lend some credence to Mr. Cuomo's assertion that there were no "sacred cows or sacrificial lambs" in his budget plan.
The Governor's proposal would, in tandem with cuts made in the last year, reduce the state work force to about 160,000 employees from the fall 1990 level of 185,000.
About 6,500 jobs would be eliminated in the coming fiscal year, an action budget officials said would save $233 million and affect nearly every agency, from about 1,500 layoffs at the State Office of Mental Health to a dozen or so each at the much smaller Council on the Arts and the Department of Agriculture and Markets.
Mr. Cuomo said his plan would bridge a potential gap of nearly $5 billion -- $500 million of which comes from borrowing the state will need to undertake because he and legislative leaders failed to agree on filling a hole in the current budget.
 
Medicaid Cutbacks
 Other actions would be savings of about $1 billion in the roughly $5 billion the state had projected to spend on Medicaid in the coming year, derived from a mix in cuts in services and eligibility levels for recipients and higher state assessments on hospitals and nursing homes.
About 2.5 million people are enrolled in the Medicaid program, serving the poor, elderly and disabled.
While today's budget plan can hardly be characterized as an upbeat document, it did include an assumption that there would be somewhat of an upturn in the economy later this year that would increase sales-tax and income-tax collections by 2 to 3 percent over this year.
But Mr. Cuomo, who in the past has ridiculed White House projections of an economic rebound, said he would accept the forecasts for this budget.
Asked at a news conference by a Newsday columnist why he did not use more conservative estimates, given the midyear deficits that have materialized in recent years, the Governor retorted: "Because I'd have to kill your schools on Long Island and you'd crucify me."

HEADLINE: Libya Unyielding Despite U.N. Demand

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The Security Council voted unanimously today to demand that Libya turn over for trial the agents accused of blowing up two civilian passenger aircraft and killing 440 people, but Libya indicated no willingness to comply.
The Council's resolution in effect tells Libya to cooperate with the investigation that Britain, France and the United States are conducting into the two bombings by surrendering two Libyans indicted for these acts. Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 and U.T.A. flight 772 over Niger, in Africa, a year later.
 
'Satisfaction' Among Families
 
 This is the first time the Security Council has ever demanded the extradition of citizens of one country to stand trial in another or implicitly accused a member government of involvement in terrorism.
Representatives of the families of passengers killed on the Pan Am flight reacted with satisfaction to the vote.
Aphrodite Thevos Tsairis, chairwoman of the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, who lost her daughter in the crash, spoke of "a tremendous feeling of satisfaction," saying this was the first time a state had been "indicted for state-sponsored terrorism."
But she also described today's resolution as only "the first stepping stone" toward a much stronger resolution imposing economic sanctions on Libya.
If Libya does not comply with the resolution, the United States, Britain and France have said, they will ask the Council to impose mandatory economic sanctions, most probably by cutting off civilian air links and banning the sale of aircraft and spare parts.
 
'False Premises,' Libyan Says
 Addressing the Council before it voted, Libya's Minister for Strategic Industries, Jadallah Azouz el-Talhy, a former Foreign Minister, said the indicted Libyan officials were guiltless because the accusations against them were based on "false premises and assumptions."
Since Britain, France and the United States have asked Libya for information about the bomb attacks but have refused to share the results of their investigations with Libya, Mr. Talhy argued, they lack evidence to support their charges.
Nevertheless, Libya has said that it will investigate and try the officials itself. But Mr. Talhy said Libya's investigation "has not made any progress" because the three countries refuse to share their evidence with Libya.
"How can you condemn Libya for its failure to cooperate after Libya has taken all these actions to cooperate," he asked the Council.
 
A Call for Arbitration
 The Libyan Minister said the Security Council had no right to tell it to extradite its own nationals, adding that the dispute was essentially over interpretation of the 1971 Montreal Convention on terrorism against civilian aircraft and should be resolved by international arbitration. In the past Libya has also offered to send indicted officials for trial by the World Court or some other international tribunal.
The United States, Britain and France all rejected the Libyan Minister's contentions. Speaking for Britain, Sir David Hannay, this month's Council President, said the two officials indicted in the Pan Am 103 disaster should be tried "in Scotland or the United States" since the plane was American but crashed in Scotland.
He reassured countries that ban the extradition of their nationals that the new resolution did not "establish any precedent that would cast doubt on the legitimacy" of such rules. But there could be no confidence in the impartiality of Libyan courts, he said, and no international tribunal has jurisdiction over criminal acts.
 
'Evade Its Responsibilities'
 The United States representative, Thomas R. Pickering, said Libya had "sought to evade its responsibilities." If further action is needed, "we are convinced the Council is ready on a continuing basis to face up to its responsibilities," he said.
France's deputy representative, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, said Libya still had not replied satisfactorily to the three countries' demands, but he hoped it would now do so after hearing this "unanimous reaction of the international community."
At the insistence of the Council's six developing world members, the resolution also asks the new United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Ghali of Egypt, to try to persuade the Libyan Government to comply with the new resolution.
What the Secretary General will do remains unclear. But Western diplomats say the Council will now have to give him a reasonable amount of time to intervene with the Libyan authorities before considering sanctions.
 
What Might Happen Next
 At present the United States, Britain and France say that cutting aviation links with Libya appears the most acceptable sanction.
While Libya's principal export is oil, an buyers' embargo is considered unlikely because -- on top of the embargo against Iraq -- it would further disrupt supplies to Western Europe. Germany, Italy and Spain, for example, rely on Libya for between 8 per cent and 15 percent of their supplies.
The unanimous vote on today's resolution was widely seen as a diplomatic triumph for the United States and its allies as well as a further sign of the Council's increasing willingness to intervene in the domestic affairs of countries in the name of promoting democracy, human rights and disarmament.
Several countries, including China and India, usually staunch upholders of the belief the United Nations should not intervene in members' internal affairs, voted for the resolution.
China's representative, Li Daoyu, said his Government condemned all acts of terrorism but still hoped for a negotiated settlement to the dispute.
India's representative, Chinmaya Gharekhan, recalled that India had been the victim of terrorism, including the blowing up of an Air India passenger airliner on its way back from Canada with the loss of some 400 lives.
But he also stressed the importance of respecting national sovereignty, which he said "is widely perceived to have come under some strain recently."

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh Mayor Seeks New Image: From Grandmother to Tough Leader

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
Mayor Sophie Masloff was in her elegantly appointed office talking to a reporter when her chief of staff stepped up to her desk and interrupted. "Sophie," he said, "I popped a button off my jacket and I was looking for you to sew it on for me."
The aide, Joseph Sabino Mistick, was poking fun at the image of Pittsburgh's first female Mayor as a soft and nurturing grandmother. It is an image she encouraged at first, often calling herself "an old Jewish grandmother" and saying she wanted to be known as Sophie to everyone in this city of 370,000 people, which has a large elderly population and about 80 ethnic neighborhoods. 
 "My friends all say, 'That's enough of this old Jewish grandmother bit,' " she told reporters in 1988, after being appointed interim Mayor to serve out the term of Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri, who died of a rare blood disease. "But it's a fact: I am a grandmother and a housewife. I can't say I'm a 35-year-old hotshot."
Mrs. Masloff, a Democrat, was elected to a full four-year term the next year. Now the immensely popular 74-year-old Mayor, who faces a projected $35 million deficit in this year's $340 million budget, is trying to shed the grandmotherly image for something closer to that of a hotshot politician.
 
A Tougher Image
 In a recent interview, she talked of having "almost blackmailed" local banks to invest in a housing project by threatening to close city bank accounts. She boasted about lowering the city's wage tax just before her last election, and vowed not to raise taxes this year no matter what happens.
"I am making some very tough decisions," she said, referring to having laid off 120 workers over the past 12 months. She talks of laying off as many as 180 more of the city's 5,000 workers.
But apart from her desire to project herself as a professional politician responding to the recession, Mrs. Masloff acknowledges that the grandmother image has become her Achilles' heel, as it plays into criticism of her management skills from political opponents.
Mrs. Masloff is unquestionably shrewd, but she has had only a high school education and she delegates so much authority to her aides that they automatically reply to many of the substantive questions asked of her in public meetings and in news interviews. She almost always reads prepared statements in public and has been known to write words on her hand to jog her memory.
 
Springsteen or Bedspring?
 Her verbal gaffes and malapropisms are relatively few but often colorful, and they rattle behind her like a string of tin cans. She has, for example, never been able to live down her 1988 reference to Bruce Springsteen as Bruce Bedspring.
Her critics are blunt. "I don't think she knows what's going on," said Tom Flaherty, the city controller, who was a candidate for mayor in the last primary election.
Jim Ferlo, the most vocal of several critics on the nine-member City Council and a likely opponent in next year's primary for mayor, said, "She's absolutely ineffective, a laughingstock." No one has formally announced a candidacy. These critics, like most, are fellow Democrats. Democrats hold every major office in this city, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by six to one.
Political opponents dwell on what they call her lack of vision for Pittsburgh, which has been extremely successful in diversifying its economy since the death of the steel industry in the early 1980's, but less successful in keeping the new biotechnology and computer companies within the city limits and on the tax rolls. Last year alone four companies, with more than 3,000 jobs, moved just outside the city to industrial parks with more space and lower taxes.
But apart from economic difficulties, Pittsburgh is remarkably free of many big-city problems. Along with many corporate headquarters, it has relatively affordable housing, generally good public schools and its streets are among the safest of any big city in America. And in more than a half-dozen interviews, Mayor Masloff's critics could not point to any major mistake she had made. Her biggest error, it seems, was an ill-conceived, and hastily withdrawn, proposal last year to use city dollars to build a $100 million baseball stadium right next to the 20-year-old Three Rivers Stadium.
Mayor Masloff often dismisses criticism as sex or age discrimination. Conceding that she makes speaking mistakes like anyone else, she also complains that some people misunderstand her sense of humor. "In some situations, where you have to listen to a lot of boring speeches, I can't resist the opportunity to say something silly," said the Mayor, who has a high-pitched, raspy voice. "But some people are not too humorous, and lately, I've come to the place where I limit joking around because it might look like I don't know any better."
Mrs. Masloff is like a popular movie that the critics pan. "Nobody likes Sophie but the people," said Jacques L. Kahn, a local advertising executive.
Mrs. Masloff has not sampled her approval rating lately, but it may well be high, based on the jovial greetings she received on the street the other day. It was "Hi, Sophie!," or "How're you doing, Sophie!" just about everywhere she went.
Wearing a plum dress and a red coat, Mrs. Masloff gave a reporter a whirlwind tour of her favorite places in Pittsburgh. The stops included a stand-up lunch in a fish store, shopping for spice in an Italian market and a visit to the Hill District, just outside the downtown area, where she grew up. Her childhood home, along with several blocks of blighted houses, has been razed to make way for several hundred units of subsidized housing that are now under construction.
Sophie Friedman Masloff was born on Dec. 23, 1917, to Romanian immigrants. Her father, Louis Friedman, an insurance salesman, died in 1920, and her mother, Jennie, worked in a factory rolling cigars and never spoke a word of English. Mrs. Masloff, who lived with two half-sisters and a half-brother from her mother's previous marriage, went to a local high school, now an abandoned building waiting to be recycled.
 
Death of Husband
 She married Jack Masloff, a security guard in a downtown office building, when she was 21. The Masloffs had one child, Linda Busia, who lives in Pittsburgh with her husband, Nicholas, a Conrail track inspector, and their two children, Michael and Jennifer. Mr. Masloff died last June.
Mrs. Masloff says she has always been interested in politics and became a volunteer in the Democratic Party in the late-1930's. She obtained a succession of low-level jobs working for Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, and in the State Court of Common Pleas downtown, where she ultimately became an assistant chief clerk. In 1976, after 40 years of service to the Democratic Party, Mrs. Masloff was nominated and elected to a seat on the City Council. She served there for 12 years, ultimately becoming Council president, and says her major accomplishment was helping bring cable television to Pittsburgh.
In 1988, when Mayor Caliguiri died, Mrs. Masloff automatically became the interim Mayor for one year. The next year, the party did not endorse her candidacy for mayor and she received no endorsements from news organizations, but she won a stunning upset victory over five men in the primary and ran unopposed in the general election.
And Mrs. Masloff, who always did her family's cooking, laundry and cleaning, interrupted her primary campaign every night so that she could go home and fix her husband dinner. "We had an old-fashioned marriage," she said.

HEADLINE: In Letter, Khrushchev Tells Of Mockery Over Cuba Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Among the most embarrassing aspects of the conclusion of the 1962 missile crisis for Nikita S. Khrushchev was the mockery it exposed him to from China and other Communist countries, according to a document made public today.
In a rambling letter dated Jan. 31, 1963, to Fidel Castro explaining why he had backed down in the face of United States pressure and withdrawn nuclear missiles from Cuba, the Soviet leader complained of "representatives of some Socialist states" who were "distorting," and "criticizing" his actions. 
 The letter was written at a time when relations between Beijing and Moscow were already quite strained, and Khrushchev, who then headed the Soviet Communist Party and Government, foreshadowed the Soviet Union's decisive rupture with China. More than half of it -- 30 pages in Russian and 22 in English translation --is devoted to Chinese criticisms of Soviet policy on Cuba.
 
Critics of Soviet Policy
 The Khrushchev letter is among documents freshly declassified by Cuba and distributed at a news conference here after a meeting about the missile crisis that included American, Soviet and Cuban officials in Havana this month.
Addressed to "Dear Comrade Fidel Castro," the letter noted that "viewpoints did not always coincide" between Khrushchev and the Cuban leader, then Prime Minister.
He then said he wanted to explain his decision "to deploy our ballistic rockets" in Cuba "because even the representatives of some Socialist states are thinking in a rather strange way, distorting not only our initial steps but also those we took later."
Khrushchev went on to assert that those critics of Soviet policy "really didn't do anything to help Cuba when it was faced with mortal danger," later making clear he was talking about China by referring to Chinese Communist attacks on the United States as "a paper tiger, dung."
 
Invitations to Castro
 "Some are now daring to slander us," he continued, "stating that when resolving the conflict in the Caribbean we guided ourselves exclusively by our own egotistical interests. That is the greatest offense against the Soviet people." He said "our men would have fought to the end along with our Cuban brothers," had there been an American invasion.
Evidently Khrushchev was concerned lest Mr. Castro consider abandoning his alliance with the Soviet Union and switching to China. To that end he not only assured Mr. Castro of wishing to "help strengthen the economy" of Cuba, but urged him repeatedly to come to his country for an extended trip in the spring and to hunt and fish.
The Castro Government did flirt with the Chinese Communists then and later, but ultimately committed itself to the Soviet Union.
 
Three Documents Released
 The letter is one of three documents released after a meeting Jan. 8-13 in Havana of officials from the three countries directly involved in the missile crisis 30 years ago, sponsored by the Center for Foreign Policy Development at Brown University.
Another document is the text of a draft treaty on Soviet-Cuban military cooperation that was supposed to have been signed in November 1962, but made obsolete by the withdrawal of Soviet missiles weeks earlier.
The third was the text of a letter from Khruschev to "Comrade Castro" dated Oct. 22, 1962, noting President Kennedy's speech demanding to control the shipment of weapons to Cuba and inspect those already in place.
In it, Khrushchev said, "Because of the situation that has arisen we have instructed the Soviet military representatives stationed in Cuba on the need to take necessary measures and to be at full readiness."
At the Havana conference, Mr. Castro said he interpreted that, wrongly as it turned out, as Soviet willingness to fight for Cuba.

HEADLINE: New Worry for Bush;
Possibility of Supreme Court Decision On Abortion Poses Campaign Risk

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 21

 BODY:
The Supreme Court's action today on abortion activates an extraordinarily divisive issue in the 1992 Presidential election and becomes one more worrisome variable for President Bush's re-election campaign.
Since the Supreme Court began restricting abortion rights, most notably in 1989, Democrats have grown increasingly convinced that their support for the constitutional right to choose abortion is a major political plus. 
 Many Republican strategists had hoped to cast their party in 1992 as a "big tent" where all sides could feel at home. But today's action suggests that the conservative Court created by Presidents Reagan and Bush will send a very different message this year.
Most of the major candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination were already beginning to attack Mr. Bush for his staunch opposition to legal abortion. Today's Court decision, accepting a Pennsylvania abortion case for review and raising the possibility of overturning or further weakening Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion, before the election, suggests that the issue could haunt Mr. Bush throughout the general election campaign.
 
Partisan Lines
 The partisan lines could hardly be clearer: All five of the major Democratic candidates will help mark the 19th anniversary of Roe v. Wade Wednesday night at a Washington gathering of the National Abortion Rights Action League. Mr. Bush, who once held a more flexible stand on abortion earlier in his political career, has remained fiercely anti-abortion as President and Vice President.
The political impact of abortion, like every other aspect of the issue, is a matter of dispute. Both sides come armed with voting data that show they have the greater political power and can produce more votes at the polls. What is clear is that Mr. Bush is headed for a squeeze from both sides.
Patrick J. Buchanan, who is challenging Mr. Bush from the right in the Republican primary here, declared today: "I'm pro-life and I think my party should be pro-life. If that loses my party votes, so be it."
At the same time, Frank Greer, an adviser to Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, gave a taste of the Democratic attack to come. "It's going to be a voting issue," Mr. Greer said. "I believe George Bush has packed the Court and he's going to pay a political price for it. This will push the issue front and center."
Torie Clark, press secretary to the Bush campaign, declined to comment on the potential political fallout. "No comment on hypotheticals," she said.
Both Mr. Bush and his party leaders seemed to recognize that public attitudes were changing on the issue as the Court moved closer to overturning Roe v. Wade. As a result, Mr. Bush has tried to signal that those who disagree with his stance on abortion were nevertheless welcome in the party. But even before today's Court action, Mr. Bush was having trouble managing the issue in his own party and seemed headed for a battle over the Republican platform, which now calls for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.
The worst case scenario for Mr. Bush, in the view of many Democrats and some of his Republican friends, would involve the High Court overturning Roe at the height of the campaign. That, coupled with the weak economy, could have a significant impact on the younger, suburban voters who are a critical swing vote in many Presidential elections.
The abortion rights issue had seemed to cool since the handful of elections held in 1989, right after the Court handed down Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, which gave states sweeping new powers to restrict abortion. The Virginia and the New Jersey elections for governor that year seemed to turn on the abortion issue, giving major advantages to the Democrats that year. But in 1990, when the economy started to lag and war was looming in the Persian Gulf, the issue no longer seemed as dominant.
There are constant arguments over which side has the greater political clout. Abortion opponents assert that their forces vote, consistently and single-mindedly, on the issue -- in far greater numbers than those who support abortion rights.
Both sides are dug in. And the Supreme Court today may have guaranteed that a new and bruising round of the struggle will be fought in 1992.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles on Verge Of Ending Japanese Pact

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Smoldering American resentment against Japanese economic competition has flared into a political firestorm in California, and Los Angeles County officials appeared today to be on the verge of canceling a $122 million contract they awarded just a month ago to a Japanese company to build rail cars for a new mass transit line here.
Instead, they proposed today to build a new factory to build the cars in Los Angeles County, providing jobs for a region deeply mired in recession and putting the county in direct competition with the Japanese. 
 The action represented a stunning political reversal in the face of bitter public protests that have mounted steadily since Dec. 18, when the 11-member Los Angeles County Transportation Commission awarded the contract for 41 automated rail cars to theSumitomo Corporation of America over a competing bid from the Morrison-Knudson Corporation of Boise, Idaho. Sumitomo had hired as one of its lobbyists the former Republican Governor of California, George Deukmejian.
 
Pressures Building
 The pressures were building as President Bush took a trade mission to Japan earlier this month in an effort to open Japanese markets more to American companies.
The protests culminated on Jan. 13 with a 70-0 vote by the state Assembly urging cancellation of the contract. Bending under crushing political pressure, the executive director of the commission, Neil Peterson, ordered Sumitomo on Friday to halt work on the project immediately. The full commission has scheduled a meeting Wednesday afternoon, at which it is widely expected to officially cancel the Sumitomo contract and reopen bidding.
"We have listened carefully to the concerns expressed by the public and our elected officials," said Ray Grabinski, a Long Beach City Council member who is chairman of the commission and who had originally approved the staff recommendation in favor of Sumitomo as the better qualified bidder. "And we believe this action plan addresses the strong desire to keep the jobs generated by our transportation investment, and specifically rail vehicle procurements."
A spokesman for Sumitomo, Chuck White, said that the company was unable to comment until the commission acted Wendesday. But he said the company was found to be the best bidder and had met or exceeded all requirements with regard to American and local content and in use of subcontractors operated by minorities and women. He added that Sumitomo would employ 370 workers in Los Angeles County for the final assembly of the cars, though the car bodies, systems integration, propulsion and air-conditioning equipment would be made in Japan.
 
30-Year Plan
 The contract was for the Green Line, a 23-mile, 14-station rail line connecting the suburbs of El Segundo, near Los Angeles International Airport, and Norwalk. Scheduled to begin service in 1995, it is part of a $150 billion 30-year plan to build a modern mass transit system, including a subway downtown, to relieve massive congestion on Los Angeles area roadways. Sumitomo built cars for the Blue Line, from Long Beach to Los Angeles, which began operation two years ago.
But the Green Line's approval came in a vastly different economic and political climate. The commission appears to have underestimated the depth of resentment and worry about the faltering economy in Southern California.
"It's amazing; it touched a hot button like nothing has here for a long time," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corporation, a private group attempting to retain and create jobs in Los Angeles County, which has more than eight million people.
"In the 21 years I've been in office, I've never seen people more angry than about this," said Joel Wachs, a Los Angeles City Council member who has been a outspoken foe of the contract.
 
'Spending Dollars at Home'
 "We're in a recession," he said. "I see a feeling of spend our dollars at home where they do the most good. People are hurting."
In another indication of the growing "buy America" sentiment, Mr. Grabinski called on the legislature in Sacramento today to pass legislation permitting the commission to establish rules requiring 60 percent domestic or local content in future contracts and to grant preference to local businesses.
In preparation of the cancellation, Mr. Grabinski and Mike Antonovich, a county supervisor who will succeed Mr. Grabinski as chairman of the transportation commission this month, called a news conference to present a six-point plan to build what they called an "L.A. Car." If approved by the commission, it would scrap for now the driverless cars preferred by Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles in favor of a manned car similar to those in use on the Blue Line.
Assemblyman Richard Katz, a Democrat from Los Angeles who sponsored the Assembly resolution, has urged that the contract be put out for bids again with a requirement that 75 percent of the work be done in Los Angeles County. That would not be possible now, because there is no factory equipped to produce rail cars in the area. But talk has been growing of converting an automobile plant that General Motors plans to shut this summer in the Van Nuys area of Los Angeles.
 
200 New Jobs
 The rail plant that is envisioned would produce two rail cars a week and create 200 direct jobs at the beginning. The commission estimated that once environmental and other permits are issued, the plant could be in operation within 26 months. The plant would be owned by the county but operated by private companies producing the rail cars, which presumably could also be sold to other cities installing high-speed commuter systems.
If successful, the plant could foreshadow the revival of what was once a thriving American industry in mass transit, long since ceded to the Japanese, Italians and Canadians.

HEADLINE: Grand Forks Journal;
History's About-Face Felt on Plains

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRAND FORKS, N.D., Jan. 19

 BODY:
For the last quarter of a century, this quiet farming and university town high in the Dakota plains stood sentry at the front gates of the cold war.
Just outside of town, spread over an area the size of New Jersey, underground silos storing 150 long-range nuclear missiles puncture the wheat, potato and sugar beet fields, their deadly tips pointed north toward the former Soviet Union. No one needs reminding that in a nuclear war, Grand Forks would be a bull's-eye at the top of Moscow's hit list. 
 So last summer when President Bush took all nuclear bombers and older long-range nuclear missiles off alert, and the Soviet Union collapsed, people here breathed more easily.
"Most people had a feeling we were living at ground zero," said Mike Jacobs, editor of The Grand Forks Herald. "Now there's a sense there won't be a nuclear war, and we won't be incinerated."
But the President's order did not cover the more modern MX or Minuteman-3 missiles around Grand Forks Air Force Base and three other bases in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. Some 2,000 nuclear warheads remain on alert, ready to fire at a moment's notice.
But at whom? For the 50,000 people in this riverfront town 80 miles south of the Canadian border, the question sums up the uncertainty of straddling old world and new.
"We feel less like targets now," said Lorraine Whitty, a 44-year-old native North Dakotan. "But we shouldn't be too hasty. The world is still a very unstable place."
Grand Forks has grudgingly accepted the missile fields since the military installed them 26 years ago. But there have been scary moments. In 1980, a B-52 caught fire at the air base 15 miles from downtown. The Air Force neither confirmed nor denied that the plane was carrying atomic weapons, but people here feared the worst.
In the movie "War Games," the fictional generals realized that a computer hacker had set off a simulated Soviet attack on the United States only after calling Grand Forks to see if the base had been vaporized.
The underground silos and command posts are inconspicuous, especially on a day like today, when light snow and temperatures hovering around 20-below give the site the look of a frozen tundra. Only a chain-link fence enclosing a 110-ton concrete pad hints at the destructive power below. It has been a year or so since protesters picketed a site.
"They don't bother no one," Earl Gunderson, a 70-year-old retired Merchant Marine engineer, said of the missiles. "If war ever did break out, they'd hit cities, too, and everyone would be a target."
The scenes from the underground, though, are Strangelovian. At launch-command center, known as "Charlie Zero," Capt. Mark Turcotte invites a visitor into the vault-like bunker 45 feet beneath the surface and wrapped in a reinforced-concrete egg eight feet thick. Chairs and computer consoles are bolted to a floor that is mounted on shock absorbers to withstand a nuclear "near-miss."
"I'd be crazy not to think what would happen if I were ordered to launch these," said the 28-year-old captain, motioning to a console panel of "alert" lights glowing red. At the bottom of the console is a row of lights marked "missile away."
Elsewhere on the sprawling air base there are signs of change. The "hot strip," a walled-off part of the runway where three or four nuclear-armed B-1B bombers always stood on 24-hour alert, is now deserted.
Peace may exact a price. Residents worry that the thaw in relations with what was the Soviet Union will render the base obsolete. The base, with its 12,000 personnel and dependents, pumps about $212 million into the local economy every year.
"We'd definitely feel the impact," said Debbie Steding, manager of the local Holiday Inn, which relies on the base for at least 10 percent of its customers.
So far, no one is talking about closing the base. But with Minot Air Force Base 210 miles away fielding its own set of Minuteman-3 missiles, many North Dakotans fear that the Pentagon will say that the military does not need both installations.
Some here would applaud. Ron Smith, a 34-year-old firefighter, said, "To me, there's a lot better things the Government can spend our money on than missiles."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS CRITICIZED ON AID TO RUSSIA

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The 47-nation conference on coordinating aid to the former Soviet Union opens at the State Department on Wednesday, with a host of tensions between the United States and its allies bubbling just beneath the surface over how best to help Russia and the other republics, officials and experts involved say.
At issue are both clashing egos and clashing policies. Many European officials, who were not consulted about the conference before it was announced, say they resent the leadership role being taken by the United States, which some of them argue is an effort to disguise how little Washington is actually doing. No longer feeling the need for Washington's security umbrella after the demise of the Soviet Union, the Europeans are increasingly speaking their mind. 
 They say that if the United States wants to lead the coordination effort, it must lead in giving. After all, they say, the United States did not simply "coordinate" the Marshall Plan for European recovery in 1947, it fully financed it. From that fact its leadership flowed automatically.
"France regrets the United States of America, which has only contributed 20 percent of urgent food aid, is in charge of coordination," the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, has said.
 
'Still Worth Doing'
 Other European participants are being more charitable. An Italian official said the conference "is probably more of a political gesture than anything else, but it is important to mobilize people."
A British diplomat said, "It is not going to change things overnight, but we feel it is still worth doing."
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who came up with the idea for a coordinating conference, has been guarded about exactly what he wants to come out of the two-day meeting.
Playing down expectations that the conference will somehow come up with new sums of money for Russia and other republics, he told reporters today that it was important that donor nations "get together and at least compare notes about preparations to confront what may very well be some major difficulties there, as reformers and democrats in the former Soviet Union try to continue their fight to embrace democracy."
But some leading American specialists say that the focus on coordination is inadequate, given the needs of Russia and the price reforms already introduced by its President, Boris N. Yelstin. What is needed is not simply a humanitarian aid package, they say, but a whole, multibillion dollar economic aid program to support Mr. Yeltsin's move to free markets.
 
Calculated Risks
 "The West has got to be ready to take some calculated risks right now in supporting Yeltsin's imperfect, but nevertheless bold, initiatives," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a former Assistant Secretary of State for International Economics. "If Yeltsin does not succeed, he is not going to be followed by a combination of Thomas Jefferson and Milton Friedman. He is going to be suceeded by some Rasputin-like xenophobic nationalist."
Nevertheless, Mr. Baker, aware that asking for money to aid the Russians would probably not be politically popular in the United States in this election year, has emphasized that this is not intended to be a conference to pledge new aid. Rather, it is intended to better coordinate the distribution of food, energy, medical, housing and technical aid already committed by the various countries to members of the new Commonwealth of Independent States.
Conference subcommittees will be assigned to devise "action plans" to spell out how to improve the amount and flow of humanitarian aid to different areas of the commonwealth and prevent redundancies. Progress will be reviewed at a meeting to be held in three months.
The United States has already pledged about $4 billion in food credits and technical aid and delivered about two-thirds of it. The European Community has contributed about $4 billion, as well as donations from individual members, and Japan about $2.6 billion.
The State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, seeking to defuse simmering tensions over who gives how much, said today: "We're not here to come and take score or find out who's ahead in the sixth inning. We're here to coordinate our assistance and try to make it more effective."
 
'The Biggest Dodge Going'
 The Germans and French, who will be the first to be affected by any turmoil in the former Soviet Union, tend to favor more fundamental economic aid now, not simply humanitarian aid. The Bush Administration has preferred to wait for the Russians and others to introduce sound economic reform programs. But that patient approach is now under fire from many American experts.
The coordinating conference "is the biggest dodge going," said Jeffery Sachs, a Harvard University economist who advised Poland and is now advising Mr. Yeltsin. In Eastern Europe, the West gave financial aid from the very beginning, he said.
Mr. Hormats said: "This meeting, which is being held at the foreign ministers level, has to go beyond mere coordination. Coordination can be done by technocrats. These ministers need to make some fundamental decisions, not just about coordination but about whether at this moment in history it is more important to support the Yeltsin reforms with a broad package of economic assistance."

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Embroiled in legal squabbles and unable to pay its creditors, 47th Street Photo Inc., whose stores epitomize the feisty, combative world of consumer electronics retailing, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday.
The company, known for being the first with the latest gadgets at the lowest prices for those shoppers willing to brave curt clerks and congested floors, said that all four of its stores in New York City and on Long Island would remain open as usual. Indeed, it was business as usual yesterday at its stores on West 45th Street and West 47th Street, which were swirling with bargain hunters searching for VCR's, stereo equipment, cameras and computers. 
 The company was pushed over the edge into Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code after it defaulted on about $500,000 in payments last week to the Transamerica Commercial Finance Corporation.
Sales fell about 21 percent last year, to $225 million, according to the company, and it laid off about 20 percent of its work force -- now down to about 300 -- which largely consists of Hasidic Jews from the Williamsburg and Borough Park sections of Brooklyn.
In court papers filed in Manhattan, Irving Goldstein, the immigrant from Hungary who founded 47th Street Photo in 1965, said he was filing for bankruptcy because of a lien on the company's collateral.
The company has more than 200 creditors, whom it owes $57 million, against $30 million in assets, according to the court documents.
Abraham Weiss, a financial consultant to 47th Street Photo, said Transamerica, a subsidiary of the Transamerica Corporation of San Francisco, froze the company's bank accounts on Friday, making it impossible to do business.
In June, Transamerica won a $10 million judgment against the retailer and agreed on a schedule that required 47th Street Photo to pay it about $62,000 a week. Mr. Weiss said the retailer had paid back about $2.8 million to date.
But in a statement yesterday, Transamerica said 47th Street Photo had defaulted on an extraordinary $450,000 payment due Jan. 15, and a day later, failed to make its weekly payment. That was the day Mr. Goldstein signed the court papers that were filed yesterday.
On Jan. 17, Transamerica said, 47th Street Photo agreed to a new payment schedule and then promptly failed to make the first payment.
Mr. Weiss said that 47th Street Photo had tried to negotiate with Trans america over the weekend but that the talks had broken down.
"Our feeling is that Transamerica forced us into the filing," Mr. Weiss said. "We couldn't conduct commerce. All the money that was coming in was going right back out to them, so we couldn't do business with our vendors."
He said 47th Street Photo would contest the June judgment and try to get back the money it had already paid Transamerica.
Mr. Weiss said he was "99 percent sure" 47th Street Photo would not go the way of Newmark & Lewis, another local consumer electronics chain. Newmark & Lewis, which filed for Chapter 11 protection last September, announced last week that it was closing its remaining stores.
"We're really on top of things at the moment and feel good about things," Mr. Weiss said.
For years, competitors marveled at 47th Street Photo's sales volume and the lightning speed with which it brought goods in and sold them out. Though 47th Street Photo never added new stores by the handful like Newmark & Lewis, Nobody Beats the Wiz and other competitors, its reputation spread across the country through a lucrative mail-order business.
One of the many legends about the quintessentially New York retailer had it that even the International Business Machines Corporation bought personal computers for its offices from 47th Street Photo, finding it quicker and cheaper than getting the terminals from its own factories.
"It's always been this mystique-laden operation," said Martin Brochstein, senior editor of Television Digest, a weekly newsletter on the consumer electronics industry. "It looked like a hole in the wall, but it did an incredible volume."
Attempts to obtain Mr. Goldstein's home telephone number to ask for his comments were unavailing.
The secret of 47th Street Photo's business was simple: cash. Mr. Goldstein was always able to procure the best merchandise at low wholesale prices because he paid distributors up front in cash, people familiar with his business operations said. And he freely bought in the "gray market," picking up manufacturers' overruns and other retailers' excess inventory for a fraction of the list price.
People familiar with the operation, but who refused to be identified, said the retailer's profit margins were relatively slim. So, Mr. Goldstein took the cash generated by the stores and invested in real estate, as property values skyrocketed during the early 80's.
But the bottom fell out of the real estate market at the same time the consumer electronics business hit the skids. Once the sole source for bargain-basement-priced cameras, tape recorders, batteries and sunglasses, 47th Street Photo lost its edge as competition in the consumer electronics industry became a local and national war in which price was the only potent weapon.
It did not help that in the last few years the consumer electronics industry failed to come up with any product to drive the business the way videocassette recorders and microwaves once did.
And then recession not only compounded the industry's ailments, but also dried up the cash flow 47th Street Photo depended on. Recently, it closed its Nassau Street store after enlarging the ground floor of its flagship on 47th Street.
The company remains tangled in a vitriolic legal spat between Mr. Goldstein and Joseph Fischer, who served as an adviser to the 47th Street Photo founder.
Mr. Goldstein hired Mr. Fischer to handle his business affairs in 1987, after Mr. Goldstein was severely injured in an automobile accident. Mr. Goldstein had previously invested in real estate managed by Mr. Fischer.
The relationship soured as the stores, hit by the recession and the bust in the consumer electronic business, struggled to pay down debt on the real estate transactions.
Each man is now suing the other, charging broken promises and defamation and seeking money.

HEADLINE: 1992 CAMPAIGN: Washington Memo;
Senate Jousting Is a Lesson in 'Bipartisan' Debate

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The 1992 election campaign arrived on Capitol Hill today, as senators called for bipartisan efforts to solve national problems and then split on party lines over education legislation.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said, "The needs of the nation are not partisan." Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said Americans would reject "the same old partisan posturing, political games and Congressional gridlock." 
 Then they started sparring over the education bill, which Republicans say Democrats have shaped in a way that ignores, for partisan reasons, President Bush's main proposals.
The continual drumroll of appeals to interest above party means one of two things. At its most optimistic, it reflects the hope that the other side will see that its hand is so weak that it will throw in its cards. An example of this is another extension of unemployment benefits. Democrats believe the recession has such political impact that Republicans cannot delay the measure in 1992, as they did in 1991.
 
Dole Out of Character?
 The more frequent and realistic purpose is reflected in Mr. Dole's assertion that the public is impatient with partisanship -- even if it was offered by one of the Senate's most skilled and avid partisans.
Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said Congressmen are fearful that "the public, which is already unhappy with them, will turn on them with a vengeance.
"The signal they're getting from the public is, 'Do something, stop that bickering,' " Mr. Ornstein said.
The issue where fear of seeming to be partisan will probably do the most to produce compromise legislation is on an economic growth package.
 
Deadlock May Be Avoided
 Neither party is likely to be happy with the emphasis in the other's economic proposals, which will only be fully on the table once President Bush gets around to offering his plan next week. Democrats will argue that the Republican plan does too much for the rich; Republicans will say the Democrats care too little about real investment. But as Senator Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, said today: "I don't think we will have deadlock. I don't think either party can afford it."
But on other questions, the Democrats have come so far since their immediate post-Persian Gulf war disarray that battles are almost certain.
For example, when a bipartisan poll conducted by Tarrance and Associates and Greenberg-Lake asked last June who was better at handling the economy -- President Bush or the Democrats in Congress -- 41 percent preferred Mr. Bush and 30 percent picked the Democrats. When the question was asked in December, only 28 percent picked Mr. Bush and 45 percent the Democrats.
On education, a 34-34 percent deadlock in June has shifted so that 43 percent think Congressional Democrats can do better, and only 28 percent prefer Mr. Bush. Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander came up to the Senate today to tell reporters that the public would not tolerate Democrats if they blocked Mr. Bush's plans.
 
Big Stakes for Both Sides
 The Democrats have another reason to push an agenda. After 11 years, they hunger for an ally in the White House and sense that they have a chance of defeating Mr. Bush. But, of course, the Republicans have a reason to fight back. They want to shore up Mr. Bush in his area of greatest weakness by combating the argument that the President has no domestic policies.
So the $850 million education bill is just the first of several efforts by the Democrats to flex their muscles.
On unemployment benefits, the Democrats were so awed by Mr. Bush last year that they waited until late July to push a bill on this bedrock Democratic issue. This year, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will introduce a bill on Wednesday for another 13 weeks of benefits, and a hearing will be held on it on Thursday. The measure will probably come to the House floor in February.
The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee is expected to vote on Wednesday to send a major health care measure to the floor, and on Thursday the same committee will begin hearings on broader anti-recession measures. Regardless of whether these measures go anywhere soon, they offer competition for headlines, television time and political attention.
Legislation to require employers to offer leaves for workers whose families need personal attention, and an effort to split the differences between House and Senate Democrats on campaign finance legislation, are other efforts sure to go ahead in the face of promised Presidential vetoes, which will almost surely be sustained. But family leave offers Democrats a popular-sounding issue, and any bill which can be described as improving the campaign spending situation offers a defense against public discontent.
Beyond the economic growth measure, expectations of bipartisanship today usually focused on talk of the other side's giving in. Mr. Dole said it would be nice if Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is managing the education bill, gave some ground. But Mr. Dole grinned and said that a bipartisan approach would be "refreshing and new."
An even franker suggestion came from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who told reporters, "Beware the politician who claims to be nonpartisan."
Mr. Mitchell spoke of bipartisan approaches in his speech opening the session. But earlier, referring to Mr. Alexander's suggestions on the education bill, he said, "We expect the best result from a political process in which competing views are debated."
But there are also reservations. Mr. Rostenkowski, who is reluctantly agreeing to the political demands for tax-cut legislation even though he expressed doubt that it would help the economy, said last week he longed for the days when "you took your shots just before the election, and then after Jan. 1 of the odd-numbered year you'd start governing."

Analysts Back Burlington Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GREENSBORO, N.C., Jan. 21

 BODY:
Analysts today supported a plan by Burlington Industries to become a public company again, saying the move was timely considering the recent strength of the stock market and falling interest rates.
Burlington Industries Equity Inc., the parent of the textile company, said on Monday that it had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed public offering of 57 million shares at an initial price of $14 to $16 a share. 
 At those prices, the sale would generate between $798 million and $912 million and put 83 percent of the company's stock in public hands.
"I'm not sure what factors there may or may not be behind it, but it's a healthy sign," said James Thayer, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company in New York.
Burlington Industries went private in 1987 in a leveraged buyout engineered by Morgan Stanley & Company to thwart a takeover attempt by the New York financier Asher Edelman.
The buyout left Burlington with $3 billion in debt, though that was reduced to $1.9 billion in 1988 through asset sales. Its debt as of Dec. 28 was $1.76 billion.

HEADLINE: New York Announces Plans For Executive Life Bailout

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
Insurance regulators in New York announced a rescue plan yesterday for the Executive Life Insurance Company of New York that should pay 100 cents on the dollar to the insurer's 118,000 customers. But insurance professionals said the plan would make it impossible for customers to cash in their policies without incurring substantial penalties, known as surrender charges.
The professionals said that under the plan, which requires the approval of a New York State court, some customers would earn significantly lower interest on their policies and annuities than they had before Executive Life of New York and its sister company in California were seized by the respective state regulators last spring. Both were units of the bankrupt First Executive Corporation of Los Angeles. 
 The plan calls for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of New York to only provide bookkeeping services for Executive Life annuities that are currently making payments and to take over the rest of Executive Life's businesses.
 
Cancels Old Contracts
 The businesses to be taken over are deferred annuities, whole-life policies, term-life policies and so-called interest-sensitive policies -- known as universal-life policies. Executive Life's contracts for deferred annuities and these three types of policies would be canceled, and the holders would be issued new contracts by Metropolitan Life.
Under the plan, however, any customer picked up by Metropolitan Life would be considered a new customer and would be subject to the cancellation fees charged to other new Metropolitan Life customers. That would apply even if a policyholder was an Executive Life customer for years and was eligible to cash out without penalty.
Under Metropolitan Life's current rules, customers who cash in their policies the first year pay a surrender charge of 7 percent of the account's value. The penalty declines by a percentage point for each year the policy is in effect.
Executive Life customers who turned down a Metropolitan Life contract would face even stiffer penalties for cashing out. They would be paid in four annual installments, and no interest would be paid on balances that remained with the company.
Most customers who converted to Metropolitan Life would get the same interest rate they had with Executive Life -- anywhere from 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the type of contract. But some Executive Life customers who had policies that guaranteed minimum rates as high as 8 percent would earn less with Metropolitan Life.
"It seems very unfair to the policyholders" and a great deal for Metropolitan Life, said Michael Berman, a leading Executive Life agent in New York.
Kevin E. Foley, the New York Insurance Department official overseeing the bailout said no company would rescue Executive Life if it had to pay 8 percent interest and could not impose the surrender charges.
At Metropolitan Life, Ted Athanassiades, a senior executive vice president, said most Executive Life customers had expected to hold their policies for many years, so the schedule of surrender charge was not that important.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin District to Assign Pupils On Basis of Income to Disperse Poor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA CROSSE, Wis., Jan. 21

 BODY:
Amid much debate, the La Crosse school district next fall will become the first in the nation to use family income as the criterion for assigning elementary students to schools.
The plan is designed to break up a large concentration of poor students in just two of the district's nine elementary schools. By dispersing both poor and affluent students more evenly, administrators said they hoped to address several issues, including reducing the stress of teachers who work primarily with the poor, enhancing the education of poor children and exposing all students to a greater cross section of classmates. 
 But many parents, rich and poor alike, are inflamed. They oppose the district's decision to bus about a third of the 3,500 elementary students to execute the plan and say they want their children to attend the nearest school.
School officials said widespread busing was necessary next fall anyway, because two schools built to ease crowding will open and are on the outskirts of town, away from most residential neighborhoods. They also point out that a group of elementary school principals and administrators examining the needs of all the district's children had come up with the new family-income approach.
 
Using a Federal Standard
 The school board, an elected body, approved the plan, 8 to 1, two weeks ago. It will use the standards of the Federal free-lunch program to determine who is poor; by the standards, the children of a family of four with an annual income of less than $17,420 qualify for free lunches.
"We certainly have set up a plan that is not easy," said Superintendent Richard A. Swantz. "But we think this is a good thing to do, even though it is very controversial."
Thousands of parents disagree.
"People don't live in a small community to have their kids bused," said Jay Hoeschler, a real estate developer and real estate broker who opposes the plan because his two children will be bused. "There's no one who's going to say there's no value to socioeconomic mixing, but putting them on buses and moving them all over the place, there are far more negatives to that."
The district has ordered that no more than 45 percent and no less than 15 percent of an elementary school's enrollment be children who qualify for free lunches. The busing plan will affect only elementary schools because they tend to be more homogeneous by neighborhood; the district has only two high schools and three middle schools, so they attract a wider mix of students.
The La Crosse district has 7,722 students this year, including middle and high schools. Eighty-five percent of the students are white, and of the 1,163 minority students, 904 are Asian, most of them Hmong.
The district is working to insure that both low-income and affluent students are among those bused, Mr. Swantz said.
The development of the plan has been watched with growing interest by education specialists, who think the district is taking a risky path by busing students without first giving parents an incentive to support busing, regardless of its legitimacy or necessity.
"The benefit of obtaining a socioeconomic mix is outweighed in many parents' minds by the cost of being bused, or mandatorily being reassigned to a school they did not choose," said David Armour, a school-busing expert at George Mason University in Virginia who is monitoring the La Crosse plan.
A more palatable approach for parents, for example, would have been the use of magnet schools to disperse students and ease crowding, which could also encourage a better socioeconomic mix, said Joe Nathan, director of the Center for School Change at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota.
Mr. Nathan said that La Crosse's approach was similar to busing for racial purposes, and that given the largely unsuccessful experiences of many school systems in busing for desegregation, the district might be better served by other approaches. "We've spent 20 years trying to push people together," he said, "and it's ultimately unwise and doomed."
 
Problems in Some Schools
 But La Crosse officials have stuck to their plan. By blending students based on family income, they said they had a rare chance to break disturbing trends in schools where a majority of the students are poor. In other communities, schools with heavy concentrations of the poor have deteriorated over time because of the variety of ills, like absenteeism, associated with poverty.
"Why wait until our schools have problems?" asked David L. Johnston, the district's assistant superintendent. "We have an opportunity now to keep them from becoming bad."
It is difficult to see immediately many differences between the schools attended by La Crosse's poor and those attended by its middle class. Hamilton Elementary School, one of two schools where 70 percent of the nearly 400 students are eligible for free lunches, has a computer laboratory; so does State Road Elementary School, in an affluent neighborhood where only 4 percent of the 500 students receive free lunches. Both schools are well maintained and have well-stocked libraries and enough counselors.
But differences lie below the surface.
At Hamilton, Donnie Lee, a first-grade teacher, spends a great deal of time addressing problems among her 25 students, usually family problems that have little to do with education. Some students are withdrawn, she said, and need to be coaxed to communicate. In addition, she said, students are sometimes late to school because no one wakes them and sends them off.
"You have all these things going on at home that affect what's going on in the school," said Ms. Lee, who supports the district's plan because, she said, a better student mix would allow "for more teaching time than is now possible."
"I think what the schools are trying to do is good," said Grace Dahl, whose two sons are attending preschool and first grade at Hamilton this year but will attend another school next year under the district's plan. "It's important for kids to see both sides of life. We're not rich by any means, but we aren't dirt-poor either."
 
Objections From Parents
 For all the benefits touted by school officials and some parents for mixing enrollment based on income, many parents remain furious. About 4,000 people signed petitions last October protesting the district's decison to abolish the longstanding practice of letting children attend schools nearest their homes. A few families are considering moving to a different neighborhood so their children will not be bused.
While many parents object to busing, others question the premise of the district's effort to blend students by income. "Why should we be the subject of a social experiment?" asked Kevin O'Keefe, a lawyer who has three children, though none of school age. "If you want to do something for poor kids, study what other schools have done rather than do a social experiment. To me, it's the height of craziness."
Early on in the district's deliberation, some parents threatened to file a lawsuit to block the plan. But experts in busing said district officials had done nothing illegal in redrawing boundary lines, and the threat of a lawsuit has faded.
Dr. Charles Miller, president of the board, said that busing per se, not the idea behind it, was behind much of the criticism.
"Anytime you change school boundaries, you have people coming out of the wall," Dr. Miller said. "Socio-economic blending is no red herring. We knew this would be controversial, but we did the best we could."

HEADLINE: Citicorp and 2 Other Banks Post Losses as Loans Sour

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The decline in the California real estate market has caught up with some of the state's largest banks, and yesterday Wells Fargo & Company and the Security Pacific Corporation announced large fourth-quarter losses as a result. And Citicorp, as expected, posted losses for the fourth quarter and the year.
Wells and Security Pacific had also said earlier that they expected losses in the quarter that were close to the shortfalls announced yesterday of $231 million at Wells and $409.2 million at Security Pacific. They also warned that severe problems could continue as long as the state's economy remained weak. 
 Following are the details of the banking companies' results:
 
Citicorp
 Citicorp announced losses of $133 million in the quarter and $457 million for 1991. It had lost $382 million in the fourth quarter of 1990, but earned $458 million that year. Citicorp also said it was nearing the halfway point of its goal of cutting its expenses by $1.5 billion by the end of this year. The company's stock fell 62.5 cents a share yesterday, to $13.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Excluding the extra $285 million in expenses for managing the real estate it has acquired through foreclosure and other costs for nonrecurring costs, like severance payments to employees, Citicorp reduced its expenses last year by $700 million, to $10.1 billion, from $10.8 billion in 1990. As part of its expense cuts, Citicorp has reduced its staff to 86,000, from 89,000 three months ago and 95,000 a year ago.
Revenues at Citicorp grew slightly, to $14.8 billion, from $14.6 billion last year, a much slower rate than normal, which the banking company attributed to the effects of the weak American economy.
Among Citicorp's large business groups, the global consumer business earned $196 million in the quarter and $549 million for the year. A sharp rise in delinquencies in the bank's credit card business kept profits well below the $905 million earned by the global consumer group last year.
The corporate-finance business in Japan, Europe and North America succeeded in reducing expenses and in improving trading profits, but still reported a loss of $466 million in the quarter and $1.02 billion for the year. The loss reflected the growing burden of bad loans.
Problems with commercial real estate loans accounted for most of the $647 million in loan write-offs and write-downs on the real estate Citicorp owns because of foreclosure. About 21 percent of Citicorp's $12.45 billion in commercial real estate loans were in California as of Sept. 30, but John S. Reed, the banking company's chairman, said yesterday that the loan losses were spread widely throughout the United States, Australia and Britain.
Mr. Reed also noted that problems with other kinds of business loans, which typically become more severe after the bottoming out of an economic recession, were increasing, but not to a serious level.
To help strengthen the management of its corporate lending business, Citicorp yesterday confirmed the appointment of H. Onno Ruding, a former Dutch Finance Minister and senior official at the International Monetary Fund, as vice chairman.
Mr. Ruding, who earlier in his career was an executive at ABN AMRO, the largest bank in the Netherlands, said yesterday that he aimed to strengthen Citicorp's systems of checks and balances to keep a rein on bankers who were inclined to push for growth and new business.
 
Wells Fargo
 Wells Fargo, where loan troubles emerged as a serious problem in the second half of last year and where the company is known for keeping expenses low, managed a $21 million profit for the year, down from $712 million in 1990.
"The downturn in the California real estate market really accelerated last year, as the state's economy began a free fall," said David Shulman, a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. and an expert in real estate markets.
Wells Fargo said the primary reason for its large fourth-quarter loss was the need to add $700 million to its loan-loss reserves, after a review of its books by Federal examiners. Other parts of its business continued to perform well, as the company increased slightly the difference between the rates it pays to depositors and the rates it charges borrowers.
Non-interest income grew to $251 million, from $204 million a year ago, mostly because of higher charges on consumer accounts and other fees. Wells's stock fell $2.375 a share yesterday, to $64.75.
 
Security Pacific
 Security Pacific lost $774.5 million for all of 1991, compared with a profit of $161.3 million a year earlier.
Mr. Shulman, of Salomon, said the real estate market, particularly for commercial developments like office buildings, "will get worse before it gets better and will be aggravated by the merger of Bank of America and Security Pacific" later this year.
The elimination of 20,000 jobs, out of a combined 96,500 at the end of 1990, that he expects to result from the merger will reduce demand for office space in California by about five million square feet, or more than the total commercial space under construction in downtown Los Angeles in the middle of last year, Mr. Shulman noted.
The BankAmerica Corporation expects savings from the merger to be well in excess of $1 billion a year and said yesterday that the earnings report by Security Pacific did not change its plans to proceed with the merger.
Security Pacific's stock fell 87.5 cents yesterday, to $32.625.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Move Up in Price Again

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher and interest rates fell again yesterday, as the recovery from the sharp selloff of the last two weeks continued.
"Underwriting all the corporate paper issued during the early part of January made Treasuries cheap," one government securities trader said, since dealers had to sell Treasury issues to cover positions in unsold corporate issues. 
 "But the distribution of that corporate paper is taking place, and the market is correcting as it happens. Rates backed up by 50 basis points" in the recent selloff, the trader added, "but only half of it was justified."
Much of the price improvement in longer-dated securities occurred during trading in Asia and Europe. And American dealers said there was good demand in the United States for short-term bills and notes.
"The selloff over the last couple of weeks was overdone, and as a result we were presented with some real value late last week, particularly in issues with maturities from two years to seven years," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
 
3-Month Bills at 3.78%
 Demand for short-term securities was also manifested at the weekly sale of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.78 percent, down from an average rate of 3.83 percent at last week's sale. Bids on the new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 3.84 percent, compared with an average rate of 3.87 percent a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 1051/32 , up by 13/32 , to yield 7.57 percent, compared with 7.58 percent on Monday.
All of the gains in the bond came overseas. At its highs of the day, the bond was offered in London at a price of 1056/32 , Mr. Sullivan said.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10313/32 , up by half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 7.01 percent. And the 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 987/32 , also up by half a point, to yield 6.69 percent.
 
5-Year Notes at 6.25%
 Before the auctions today and tomorrow of new two-year and five-year notes, the two-year securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 4.94 percent.
The new five-year notes, to be sold tomorrow, were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 6.25 percent.
New issues continued to flow into the investment-grade corporate bond market. Among the issuers were ARCO, the Los Angeles-based oil company, and the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, the principal subsidiary of J. P. Morgan & Company.
ARCO offered $250 million in 30-year securities through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers Inc.
The 8.25 percent bonds were priced at $98.80, to yield 8.36 percent, 78 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager on the sale of $200 million worth of 10-year subordinated notes for Morgan Guaranty.
The 7 3/8 percent notes were priced at $99.75 to yield 7.411 percent, 40 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AA-1 by Moody's and AA+ by Standard & Poor's.
 
$600 Million Bond Sale
 The biggest offering of the day was the sale of $600 million in noncallable 20-year bonds for Tele-Communications Inc., the Denver-based cable company. The 9.80 percent bonds were priced at $99.608, to yield 9.845 percent, 2.28 percentage points over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead underwriter for the offering. The securities carry a split rating. Moody's rates the bonds Baa-3, an investment-grade rating. But Standard & Poor's gave the issue a speculative, BB rating.
Investors in the municipal bond market were apparently unmoved by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget proposals yesterday. Traders said prices of most New York State debt securities were virtually unchanged.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	Average Price	99.045	98.059	Discounted Rate	3.78%	3.84%	Coupon Yield	3.88%	3.98%	High Price	99.050	98.064	Discounted Rate	3.76%	3.83%	Coupon Yield	3.86%	3.97%	Low Price	99.045	98.064	Discounted Rate	3.78%	3.84%	Coupon Yield	3.88%	3.98%	Accepted at low price	48%	75%	Total applied for	$32,593,780	$33,522,680	Accepted	$10,218,350	$10,216,385	N.Y. applied for	$29,325,580	$30,967,620	N.Y. accepted	$8,756,630	$9,093,575	Noncompetitive	$1,533,035	$1,150,665	
These issues are dated Jan. 23, 1992. The three-months bills mature on April 23, 1992, and the six months bills mature on July 23,1992.

HEADLINE: Fed to Relax a Bank Rule

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said yesterday that it would phase out by June 30 the requirement that banks disclose in their financial statements the total amount of loans to highly indebted leveraged companies.
The 7-to-0 decision eliminates the definition of certain loans now called highly leveraged transactions, which banks issued in the 1980's. 
 The Fed noted that the special category had caused some analysts to view the loans as extra risky, and might have had the unintended effect of discouraging bank lending to some highly leveraged borrowers or setting higher prices for the loans.
Although bankers supported the Fed's move, they were not sure yesterday if it would mean the end of disclosures about loans to highly indebted companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission has required such disclosure, though it has never issued its own definition of what loans should be included.
John D. Heine, a deputy director at the S.E.C. said future disclosure by banks "will depend on the situation" and noted that banking companies are still required to disclose facts which are material to investors.
The other bank regulatory agencies, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are also phasing out use of the "highly leveraged transaction" designation.
The change by bank regulators is part of their efforts to prevent their examinations from impeding the availability of credit to worthy borrowers. Regulators and examiners were criticized last year for unduly tough oversight which, some economists said, created a credit shortage that weakened the economy.
But bank examiners will continue to scrutinize leveraged-transaction loans in their annual bank reviews.

HEADLINE: Chase Investigating Loss

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation said the drop in its fourth-quarter profits reported last week reflected the effect of possible fraud by a borrower, Arochem Inc., a Connecticut-based oil refiner and trader.
"We are aware of a problem with Arochem and took appropriate action in the fourth-quarter financial statement," a Chase spokesman said on Monday, declining to elaborate. 
 A banking official said yesterday that the F.B.I. tion was investigating fraud at Arochem. Chase had $80 million of a syndicated loan to the company, said the official, who asked not to be identified.
Last week, Chase, citing higher loan-loss provisions and a weak economy, said its profits had slipped about 30 percent in the quarter, although it ended with a profit for the year.
The New York-based banking company said its fourth-quarter profits slipped to $135 million, or 80 cents a share, from $193 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier.
In the quarter, Chase charged off $77 million in commercial loans, $37 million of which were attributed to two unidentified loans, Chase officials said last week.

HEADLINE: Gesture of Fiscal Conciliation

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 21

 BODY:
In promoting his budget as a vehicle for a quick deal with State Senate Republicans, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo armed himself today with political ammunition to assail the Legislature if it fails again to pass a timely budget.
Mr. Cuomo could have used his budget to present a stridently Democratic response to the recession, which has helped generate a $4.8 billion gap in the state's $30 billion budget. 
 Instead he crafted a proposal that would not increase broad-based taxes, would impose heavy cuts in Medicaid and welfare programs and would make relatively small reductions in state aid to schools. All are positions embraced in principle by the Republican majority in the State Senate.
 
An Entreaty for Action
 Even before Mr. Cuomo formally presented his budget today, he began selling it as a gesture of conciliation to the Senate Republicans.
"It will accommodate them sufficiently so they can feel, 'O.K., this isn't a declaration of war -- this is an entreaty for us to sit down and negotiate something and to do it in a hurry,' " Mr. Cuomo said in a news conference on Monday.
But if Mr. Cuomo's budget represents something of a peace offering, it also carries an implicit threat. Given his concessions, Mr. Cuomo seemed to be suggesting today, the only thing that could frustrate a budget agreement by the start of the fiscal year on April 1 would be a strategy of deliberate obstructionism by the Senate Republicans.
If that happens, Mr. Cuomo can be expected to wage a fierce election-year campaign to make the damage stick to the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, and his Republican colleagues.
"If the Senate's made up its mind that they want to make it late, there's no way to stop them," Mr. Cuomo said in offering a preview on Monday. "If that's what they want to do, the state is gone."
 
Doomsday Warnings
 With the help of Felix G. Rohatyn, the New York City investment banker whom Mr. Cuomo has supported as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the Governor has tried to raise the stakes in recent days by issuing a series of doomsday warnings.
Another late budget, the two men have warned, could lead Wall Street rating agencies not only to downgrade the state's credit rating again but also to lower it to junk-bond grade. That would essentially close the credit markets to the state and threaten New York with bankruptcy.
After Standard & Poor's dropped the state's general-obligation bond rating last week to the second lowest level of any state, New York's rating stands three notches above investment grade. But Mr. Cuomo has said that if the state fails to meet its budget deadline for the eighth year in a row, the credit agencies might lose patience and destroy the state's rating in a single fatal blow rather than downgrading one step at a time.
Both the Senate Republicans and the Democrats who control the Assembly recognized today that Mr. Cuomo's strategy was to offer a deal that the Senate could not easily refuse.
"The fact that he recommended school-aid cuts of $168 million when he had been talking late last year about cuts of $600 million was some sort of olive branch," said Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat. "I would say his attitude was conciliatory."
 
'Some Progress'
 Mr. Marino, a Nassau County Republican, conceded that Mr. Cuomo's budget represented "some progress." But he said the Governor had not gone far enough in cutting the Medicaid and welfare budgets and he challenged Mr. Cuomo to push the Assembly Democrats toward the Governor's position.
"While the Governor has made some progress in moving to adopt some of the structure reforms proposed by the Senate Republicans, it remains unclear if he will be able to deliver the support of his fellow Democrats in the Assembly," Mr. Marino said.
Mr. Cuomo made it clear in his news conferences today and on Monday that he was a reluctant convert to some of the policies he endorsed in the budget. Some of them, he said, reflect misdirected blame for the state's dire financial condition.
The Governor did not seem enthused, for instance, about his proposal to terminate benefits after six months for employable recipients of Home Relief, a welfare program largely for single adults and childless couples, and he mocked the Republican emphasis on proposals -- many of which he has not accepted -- to combat fraud and abuse by appointing a welfare inspector general and by requiring Medicaid recepients to carry identification cards.
"We're not going to get ripped off even by old people who are sick," he said. "We'll see to it they don't steal the sheets, I guarantee you. We're going to fingerprint them. We're going to have inspectors general. But let's not make the mistake of thinking that they are the cause of our problems."
Mr. Cuomo devoted much of his news conference today to stressing his commitment to cutting the social-services budget. By proposing $1.158 billion in savings from Medicaid and welfare programs in the 1991-93 fiscal year, Mr. Cuomo said he was going beyond the $1.1 billion in savings that the Senate and the Assembly had agreed to seek in their unsuccessful negotiations over a 15-month budget.
 
Negotiations Scheduled
 But the Senate Republicans complained that too much of the savings came from proposals to increase taxes on hospital and nursing-home revenues, and not from cuts in spending.
That is likely to be a dominant topic in the negotiations scheduled to start in Mr. Cuomo's conference room on Wednesday afternoon, when the Governor has invited Mr. Weprin and Mr. Marino to begin their discusssions.
For the time being, all parties are cautiously optimistic, including the Governor.
"What it takes to make the talks successful is very easy -- will," Mr. Cuomo said. "Not intellect, that's all been used up. Will -- that's the part of the psyche we haven't used."

HEADLINE: Recession Prompts First-Time Gifts as Neediest Cases Lead '91 Pace

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
"I have not donated money to the Neediest Cases fund before," Deborah Dorfman of Princeton, N.J., wrote, "but the need seems so great this year."
That simple note goes a long way toward explaining the remarkable success of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund this year. The appeal, which continues through Feb. 29, has managed to surge $476,000 ahead of last year's pace in part because of a large increase in the number of first-time contributors like Ms. Dorfman, who gave $50. So far, almost 13,000 donors have contributed almost $4.4 million. 
 In the short notes and letters attached to their checks, donors have described many reasons for making their first contribution. But the declining economy has been the most common theme.
"This donation comes from thankfulness for coming through another year," wrote Lynn Ann Harris of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., who gave $50. "All in my family who are old enough to work have work. We are all able to meet our rent/mortgage obligations, other bills and put food on our tables. We have enough and in this economy, that's quite a lot."
Carol R. Kolton of Westfield, N.J., said the rising needs of the city's poor, sick and disabled were impossible to ignore. "In the past it has been easy for me to turn the page and say someone else will respond," she wrote in a note attached with $100. "This year everyone who has the ability should respond because the need is so enormous."
 
Times Covers Overhead
 Freida Malament of Massapequa, L.I., had often intended to make a donation but "usually forgot because of the pressures of my own life." In a letter attached to her $25 check, she explained: "This year I feel especially grateful for my health and my very good and caring daughter. I feel lucky to have her and my relatively tranquil life."
Several first-time contributors are newcomers to the city. "As a recent emigre to N.Y.C. I have noticed that people are particularly hard pressed this year," wrote Clarinda Bisceglia, who recently moved to Brooklyn from California and contributed $50. "I myself have not been able to find work on a steady basis, but I am fortunate to have had some savings."
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor, and disabled. What began as the "Hundred Neediest Cases," has expanded to meet needs of thousands of individuals.
The Times covers all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar is passed on to seven charities. The money provides many forms of relief including food, homes and clothing for those without. The seven charities also use the money to provide job training for the disabled, counseling for substance abusers and to support a wide array of AIDS-related programs.
Many first-time donors made contributions despite their own problems. "Although my earnings this year are only a tenth of what they were five years ago, I could not find it in my heart to avoid contributing this year," an anonymous donor who gave $50 wrote. "While many earnings may be down this year, the opinion I have of myself cannot possibly be higher. I hope this note will encourage others to follow suit by making positive contributions toward your fund. As for myself, I plan on making this a tradition."

HEADLINE: United Technologies To Cut 13,900 Jobs; Blow to Connecticut

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The United Technologies Corporation, the largest private employer in Connecticut, announced a series of plant closings and cutbacks yesterday that would eliminate 13,900 jobs, including 6,412 in the state, by 1995. The cuts represent 7 percent of the 193,000 workers employed worldwide by the sprawling company, whose businesses include Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators.
The largest job losses will be at the Pratt & Whitney division, based in East Hartford, Conn., and are a result of declining military spending, company officials said. But virtually all parts of the company will be affected. 
 The military-related cuts are just the latest to hit Pentagon contractors in the region. The Electric Boat division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Conn., has said it will eliminate 10,000 jobs because fewer submarines are being ordered. On Long Island, the Grumman Corporation and other military suppliers lost an estimated 20,000 jobs since the procurement boom of the mid-1980's.
Connecticut's Governor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., was vacationing in St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands, but his office said state officials had feared that United Technologies was planning to move many operations out of state, which would have been a much harder blow to the state's economy. The Governor's office said it hoped that the company's restructuring would make it stronger and ultimately help to preserve Connecticut jobs.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, agreed with the Governor's office that the news could have been worse. But he said he feared the ripple effect from the company's decision to cut in half its list of parts suppliers, to 250 from 500. "That's a real blow to us, in terms of our manufacturing base," he said. "That can have as significant an impact as what we're talking about here."
 
Executive Ranks Hit Harder
 The company's executive ranks will be hit harder than the overall work force, as 12 percent of management jobs will be eliminated. Some of the cuts, at its corporate headquarters and research laboratories, have already taken place, officials said. In all, the company said it would close or consolidate more than 100 operations worldwide, cutting its total factory space by 16 percent.
United Technologies officials said the purpose is to reduce costs by $1.1 billion a year by 1994 to improve the company's financial performance. But for 1991, the cost of program was $1.28 billion. In addition, the company took a charge of $256 million for the anticipated costs of meeting environmental standards.
The special charges produced a loss of $1.22 billion in the fourth quarter and a loss of $1.02 billion for the year. The loss did not come as a surprise since the company announced last fall that it would take a charge of over $1 billion that would produce losses in both the quarter and year.
The loss for the quarter compares with a profit of $168.8 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter totaled $5.81 billion, down 2.3 percent from $5.95 billion a year earlier. The loss for the year compares with a profit of $750.6 million, or $5.91 a share, in 1990. Total sales were $21.26 billion for the year, a decline of 2.4 percent from $21.79 billion in 1990. The company's stock closed yesterday at $54, down $1.25 for the day.
The environmental charge had not been forecast, but in cases where accounting rules allow companies to choose when to recognize particular losses, companies typically choose years that are going to be bad anyway to pave the way for better earnings in future years.
Robert F. Daniell, the chairman of United Technologies, said some of the plant closings and layoffs "recognize the realities of a shrinking U.S. defense budget." In 1990, 22 percent of the company's sales were to the Federal Government. But he said the need to improve efficiency and the prolonged recession were factors as well.
 
Drop in Engine Orders
 In a letter to Pratt & Whitney employees, James G. O'Connor, the head of the division, said production of jet fighter engines was expected to drop from a high of 700 in 1982 to about 50 next year. Sales of civilian engines and spare parts are being held down by the financial turmoil in the airline industry, he said.
"Over all, our total engine and spare parts forecast shows production volume declining through 1995 then leveling off through the rest of the decade," Mr. O'Connor said. About 4,100 jobs are expected to be lost at Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut, and a total of 5,096 in the division. United Technologies employed 47,650 in the state before the cutbacks began last year.
Beyond the problems in the military business, Mr. Daniell said the plant closings and job cutbacks were intended to make the company more efficient. "We have begun a transformation more profound and more potent than any single event in the corporation's recent history," he said.
 
Blow to the Economy
 Meeting with securities analysts in New York, Mr. Daniell conceded that announcements of plant closing and job reductions would not help pull the nation's economy out of recession. He defended the reductions as necessary for the company. "This is correct for us at this time," he said. But he added, "It is a dichotomy, I'll admit."
The analysts seemed generally to be favorably impressed by the presentation by Mr. Daniell and other top company executives. "The size of the charge was eye-popping, but the returns could be wonderful," said Howard Rubel of C. J. Lawrence. The company said the object of the changes was to increase profits to 18 percent of shareholders' equity by 1994 from the low to mid-teens recently.
"The actual announcement was anticlimactic; they had telegraphed it well in advance," said Michael Lauer of Kidder, Peabody. "This is a company that is not likely to benefit from a pickup in the economy except for its automotive parts business."
 
Most Cuts This Year
 United Technologies officials said the bulk of the job cuts, more than 7,000, would take place this year. But job reductions will continue at Pratt & Whitney through 1995. More than 1,700 jobs were cut at the company's corporate offices and the Otis elevator division in 1991, officials said.
The company said the layoffs would save $440 million a year. Closing plants will add another $260 million a year and improvements in design, engineering and manufacturing will add the remaining $380 million in projected savings.
Mr. Daniell said the company would seek to reduce the cost of developing products by seeking alliances with overseas companies. He cited a recent agreement between Pratt & Whitney and a division of Germany's Daimler-Benz to develop jet engines jointly as an example.
He also said the company agreed with the forecast of some analysts that the company would earn from $4 to $5 a share this year. "Whether we are at the high or low end of that range depends on the economy," he said.
 
A Bad Year Anywhere
 The special charges masked what would have been a disappointing fourth quarter and year for the company. Sagging sales of military engines and spare parts depressed fourth-quarter operating earnings at Pratt & Whitney to $138 million from $252 million. Since the division typically produced more than 50 percent of United Technologies' total profit, the corporation's fourth-quarter operating profit was down 14 percent, to $302 million from $351 million.
For the year, Pratt & Whitney's problems were given as the main source of a 41 percent decline in operating earnings, to $968 million from $1.653 billion.
The company said it would close its Pratt & Whitney overhaul and repair plant in Southington, Conn., but keep a separate manufacturing operation in the same town. The Carrier air-conditioning and heating equipment subsidiary said it would close plants in City of Industry, Calif.; Knoxville, Tenn., and Ellijay, Ga.

HEADLINE: Bank Fund, C.D. Yields Down Again

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit dropped for the week that ended yesterday, but the pace of the decline slowed, according to figures released yesterday by The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication that follows bank rates. The explanation, however, does not give much solace to savers hoping for an end to the rate declines.
Robert K. Heady, The Monitor's publisher, explained: "The modest decline in savings yield for the most recent week was caused partly by the Monday bank holiday" observing the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Some institutions that normally change rates effective on Wednesday, he said, will cut them on Thursday of this week instead. 
 "That will further depress the week's average yields, because the down cycle still has a lot of force behind it," Mr. Heady said.
 
Steeper Drop Is Seen
 By the end of the week, Mr. Heady expects the average fall-off in yields on short-term certificates of deposit to be down 6 or 7 basis points rather than the average of 3 basis points reported this week. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Among commercial banks in the New York area, the average money market account yield was 3.70 percent, down 2 basis points.
Among the savings institutions in this area, money market account yields fell 9 points, to 4.29 percent.
For money market accounts, the steepest cut among area banks was made by the Carteret Savings Bank in New Jersey, which lowered its rate by 53 basis points. The Dollar-Dry Dock Bank of New York led the way with a drop of 11 basis points for its three-month certificate of deposit, and Green Point Savings Bank in Brooklyn made the largest cut in its yield on its six-month certificate of deposit, dropping it 15 basis points.
The Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area also showed significant declines in savings yields, with the average yield on a money market account down 7 basis points, to 3.71 percent, and six-month certificates of deposit down 3 basis points, to 3.88 percent.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday, the average rate on the maturities at auction was 3.78 percent and 3.84 percent, respectively.

G.E. Net Up by 2% In Quarter

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Helped by continued strength in financial services, the General Electric Company said yesterday that profits in the last three months of 1991 edged up 2 percent, to more than $1.26 billion. It also cited growth in businesses where products are ordered many months or even years in advance, like medical equipment, power systems and aircraft engines.
The double-digit profits in these businesses compensated for sharp declines at the company's NBC broadcasting subsidiary and in the economically sensitive materials group, which supplies products like plastics to a wide range of industries. 
 Earnings per share were $1.46, up 3 percent from $1.42 a year ago. Revenues for the quarter rose 2 percent, to $17.5 billion, from $17.2 billion a year ago.
G.E., as is its custom, did not supply details of the quarter's performance by any of its business units. But John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, said that the broadcasting and materials groups were the only segments of the company not reporting operating gains.
The earnings fell right in the middle of the narrow band of estimates by Wall Street analysts who follow the company. G.E. shares fell along with the rest of the market in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, ending yesterday down $2.50, to $78.
 
Annual Net Off 38.7%
 G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., ended 1991 with earnings of almost $2.64 billion, or $3.03 a share, down 38.7 percent from more than $4.30 billion, or $4.85 a share, in 1990. But that decline included a $1.8 billion charge in the first quarter of 1991 to cover a change in how the company accounts for its future obligations to retirees.
The accounting change did not affect cash flow. Without it, net income for the year rose 3 percent, to almost $4.44 billion. Per-share earnings rose 5 percent for the year to $5.10, increasing at a faster clip than income because the company repurchased about 15 million shares last year for about $1 billion.
Mr. Welch said that G.E. had met many of its long-term objectives for the year. The operating margins of 11.3 percent were down slightly from 11.6 percent in 1990, but the decline was entirely due to NBC, the company said. Margins improved to 11.9 percent from 11.5 percent at the other businesses.
 
Big Gain in Financial Services
 G.E. said it earned almost $1.3 billion from financial services, spurred by $6.2 billion worth of acquisitions in the leasing and credit card business. The company said that it was also helped by a "significant" turnaround at Kidder, Peabody, the company's investment banking and stockbrokerage subsidiary.
G.E. said that its aircraft engine group won more than 55 percent of all new orders for large commercial aircraft engines last year, although its backlog declined to $11.9 billion from $13.2 billion at the end of 1990. The power systems group won 60 percent of the worldwide business in its segment and increased its backlog 23 percent, to $9.6 billion, the company said.
G.E. also reported double-digit profit growth and increased worldwide market share for its medical business, which makes CAT scanners and other expensive diagnostic systems. The appliance business managed a slight profit gain despite falling demand for appliances in general.

Shuffle of Economists: Dean Witter Lands One

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
At a time when the stock market is bubbly and the economy is flat, chief economists at some of the nation's biggest banks and brokerages have been involved in a giant job shuffle.
The latest job hopper is Joseph G. Carson, 39, who will be chief economist at the Dean Witter Financial Services Group, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company. Until recently Chemical Bank's top forecaster, Mr. Carson lost that post to Irwin Kellner, his counterpart at Manufacturers Hanover, after the two banks merged. 
 By switching from a bank to a brokerage, Mr. Carson will be focusing on the needs of small and large equity investors. "It's more balanced, it's a great opportunity," he said. "It gives me a very, very big platform to speak from."
In a roundabout way, Mr. Carson owes that platform to Edward J. Hyman, the top-rated Wall Street economist who had been chief economist at C. J. Lawrence for nearly two decades. Mr. Hyman set off a chain reaction when he left to set up his own firm, the ISI Group, last year. Edward E. Yardeni, then Prudential Securities' chief economist, moved into Mr. Hyman's old job at C. J. Lawrence and Richard D. Rippe of Dean Witter jumped into Mr. Yardeni's slot at Prudential, creating a well-timed opening for Mr. Carson at Dean Witter.
"Joe is very talented " said Nancy Lazar, ISI's executive vice president. But in her view, "There's definitely no cosmic significance" in all the job-swapping among forecasters.
One sign of Mr. Carson's acumen is that he's been a bear on the economy since late 1989. He correctly anticipated the sharp slowdown in growth that made the economy acutely vulnerable to shocks like Saddam Hussein's August 1991 invasion of Kuwait. And, despite the postwar pickup in Americans' mood and spending, Mr. Carson refused to forecast the arrival of a real recovery before 1992.
When will the recovery start? Sometime in the spring or summer, Mr. Carson said. But he also thinks that the next few months will be rougher than the consensus of economists expects.
That could sprinkle a raindrop or two on the stock market parade and perhaps scare away some of Dean Witter's customers. But Mr. Carson is cautiously optimistic that interest rates are headed even lower and that corporate profits will start to recover before the end of the year.
A native of Girard, Ohio, a small town near Youngstown, Mr. Carson and his family had close ties to General Motors. Both his parents worked there and so for a time did he -- as a senior economist after he earned his master's degree at Youngstown State University.
Mr. Carson arrived on Wall Street just as the 1980's bull market was taking off. He was senior economist at Merrill Lynch, responsible for divining the direction of the United States economy, from 1981 until 1986, when he joined Chemical.
A serious golfer who snared a golf scholarship as an undergraduate, Mr. Carson says he wishes he could play every weekend. Not likely. In addition to his demanding new job at Dean Witter, Mr. Carson has recently acquired another major responsibility: Jordan, a 3-month-old son born to his wife, Debra.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Economy Is In/Out of Woods

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FORECASTING, the economic wits say, is difficult especially about the future. But these days you can't even put much faith in descriptions of the present.
Depending on which professional is doing the appraisal, the American economy is now: A) Grinding slowly ahead for the third straight quarter but carrying such heavy regulatory and other burdens that the recovery is glacial; B) Turning down again after an aborted, post-Iraq recovery; C) Still gripped by a recession that is now the longest since World War II. 
 Don't know quite what to make of this? Want somebody in authority to help get your bearings? Well, George Bush told voters in New Hampshire last week that the economy was in "free fall," a statement far more pessimistic than any made by his advisers -- some of whom wouldn't acknowledge the onset of recession until it was six months old.
Candidates are expected to apply political spin, but what is one to make of a Presidential statement, later asserted to be merely "rhetorical," that accentuates the negative? It's quite possible, some economists say, that gross domestic product will be positive for the fourth quarter when the Commerce Department publishes the results next week.
Economists, of course, have long disagreed about economic prospects, much of this having to do with their judgment about the starting point as well as the relative strength and importance of the forces at work on the economy.
The latest survey of 48 respondents by Blue Chip Economic Indicators shows the consensus predicting growth in G.D.P. this year of 1.6 percent but with one predicting 4 percent growth and one predicting modest contraction.
But economists at least tend to look at the same group of variables, such things as personal incomes, inventory levels, interest rates and plans by industry to invest in modernization.
Ask corporate executives about how things are shaping up, however, and the stress will be elsewhere. They focus on orders, backlogs, taxes, regulations, profits and factors peculiar to their industry. Also of importance, however, is the fact that corporate people generally don't consider a recession over until all lost ground has been regained. To the economist, however, recovery begins much earlier, when things start to improve even if business is still 20 percent below pre-recession levels.
Another source of confusion is the statistics themselves. Some, such as housing starts and first-time claims for unemployment insurance, gyrate wildly despite efforts to adjust them for recurring seasonal factors. There is also the question of adjusting for inflation, which for 1991 retail sales was the difference between the smallest gain in 30 years or the biggest decline in 11 years.
Then there are such things as demographics, droughts and oil shocks. The current unemployment rate, for example, would be considerably higher than 7.1 percent if the labor force were growing at the rapid pace of the early 1980's, when joblessness during the steepest postwar recession surpassed 10.5 percent.
One also needs to keep in mind that some statistical series, such as building permits, tend to move in advance of the economy as a whole, while others, such as the prime interest rate and the unemployment rate, lag behind it. Industrial production is one of the main coincident measures but it, too, can be misleading such as in December when the index fell again but only because exceptionally warm weather curbed output at utilities.
While G.D.P. is generally used to summarize economic performance, attempts are occasionally made to combine indicators to provide a more revealing bottom line. One was the "misery index" devised by the economist Arthur M. Okun that simply added the inflation and unemployment rates. At around 10 the misery index is scarcely half the level it reached in the late Carter and early Reagan years. Another, a 10-item composite dubbed the Economic Performance Index, has been proposed by Republican members of the Joint Economic Commmittee.
The vast array of data on the economy, much of it conflicting or at odds with one's own anecdotal evidence, often seems to defy attempts to make the pieces part of a coherent whole -- at least one tied to reality rather than ideological predilection.
Yet one thing that does seem fairly clear to many analysts these days is that the economy is not as bad as is widely perceived. One of the many possible explanations for this is the fact that unlike previous downturns the present one has caused heavy and probably permanent loss of jobs among white-collar workers. Another is that the pain is concentrated on the East and West Coasts, which largely escaped the forced restructuring of the Rust Belt a decade ago.
Since the news media -- purveyors of the mostly bad news -- are housed mainly where things are worst, David Wyss of DRI/McGraw-Hill offers one obvious solution: "Relocate all the reporters," he suggests, "from Washington and New York to Minneapolis."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
New on the Laser Menu: Potato Skins, Well Done

 BODY:
A research lab in Ohio is using sophisticated laser technology in the service of one of the most mundane culinary tasks: peeling potatoes.
Battelle Memorial Institute, a research laboratory in Columbus, has devised a way to use lasers to burn the skin off potatoes instantly. "You just see a little puff of vapor, and there is a naked potato," said Dr. William McComis, Battelle's projects manager for food science and engineering. "It's a fascinating thing to watch." 
 The project was done on behalf of H. J. Heinz's Ore-Ida division. Ore-Ida's peeling currently involves putting 900 pounds of potatoes into a pressure cooker the size of cement mixer. When the steam is released, the skins are literally blown off by the rapid drop in pressure. But along with the skin goes almost 10 percent of the potato.
The process also creates a troublesome byproduct, a grayish-brown gruel with the viscosity of hot peanut butter. "Right now, they pay pig farmers to haul it away," Dr. McComis said.
To solve these problems, Dr. McComis's team turned to lasers, inspired by a fellow researcher who had success using a laser to strip paint from metal.
Bouncing its beam off the mirrored facets of a revolving wheel, the laser creates an arc of light that quickly scans the surface of the potato, burning off the skin without cooking the potato. The beam heats the skin to about 1,000 degrees, leaving only a trace of carbon residue.
The process is only an experiment now, peeling one potato at a time. To make the technique commercially feasible would require three $1 million industrial-strength lasers, the type most often used to weld or slice neatly through slabs of metal. Directing beams at each potato from three sides, the lasers would be able to peel 30 potatoes a second as they raced by on a conveyor.
Because the price of lasers is slowly dropping, Mr. McComis hopes the process will eventually be economical. To show off the additional utility of the process, the Battelle scientists turned the laser on other foods and vegetables of special interest to Heinz. As it turned out, the skin of large tunas destined for Heinz's Starkist cans proved too uneven -- thick scales on the dorsal section, thin skin over the belly -- for the lasers to work effectively.
But Mr. McComis found an application that should have great appeal to the giant ketchup company. "It works beautifully on tomatoes," he said.

HEADLINE: It's Time to Come Home, Now: Those Little Local Spots Are Back

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
ROLL out the red-checked tablecloths. The little place around the corner is back. The neighborhood restaurant that isn't too fancy, isn't too expensive and isn't too far away.
There has never been a shortage of these places in New York City. In 1925, George S. Chappell noted in "The Restaurants of New York" that every side street "bristles with small restaurants, neighborhood places which care for their particular section." Their mellow, side-street glow is eclipsed by the dazzle along the avenues whenever cash flows freely in the city and big restaurants boom. But when the glitz dims, the local joints remain. Or, they are reinvented. 
 For every luxury restaurant extinguished by the current economy, it seems that a small, inexpensive place has taken root. Some are family-owned and mirror their locale. Others are ersatz, shamelessly courting leaner pocketbooks with price-slashing, and countering a sense of economic and social ennui with nostalgic decor and throwback cooking. The red-checked tablecloth is to New Yorkers what his ragged blanket is to Linus.
Willies, a pub at 1426 Third Avenue (81st Street) that was converted to the upscale Malabar's in the 1980's, recently reverted to its previous incarnation, with the old tablecloths: Business has doubled.
"People walk by and see those cloths and, I'm telling you, girls, it's amazing," Cathy Messina, a waitress at Willies, said to two customers recently. "They reel around and come running in."
Caring is the unifying principle among the city's busiest restaurants today. "In the 80's we were building huge spaces that awed people," said Sam Lopata, the restaurant designer. "Restaurateurs can't afford to awe customers now, so we build cheaper, more intimate dining rooms and beef up the personal involvement instead. Soothing and caring has replaced aweing and performing."
Austere faux marbre is out, he said. Wood walls are in. The price of padded armchairs or architect-designed seating can't be amortized on dinner checks any more; mismatched kitchen chairs give a different sort of comfort.
"You want to create the illusion of something that has endured long enough to have nicotine stains on the ceiling," Mr. Lopata said. "You want to create a sepia photograph that people can place themselves in. It is reassuring."
The yen for reassurance may be what's turned stretches of some neighborhoods into yesteryear. In Sunnyside, Queens, new-old Irish pubs, like Sidetracks and Bliss Street Station, are popping up and packing them in. Along Washington Street in Hoboken, N.J., new Italian restaurants like Amanda's and Cella Luna recall the old spaghetti joints. It is tough to walk more than two blocks in Greenwich Village without confronting a new-old cafe.
Today's old haunts seem to fall into three basic categories. The Bar and Grill is a "Hey, guy," slap-on-the-back kind of place. The Cafe tends toward understatement and empathy. The My Place, usually denoted by homey names like Vince & Eddie's or Mi Cocina, is mom-like, which often means the best cooking.
The Bar and Grills, like Joe's Bar and Grill in the Village, Luke's Bar and Grill on the Upper East Side and Willies, are packed with a "pub meets the frat house" crowd. Customers trade Armanis for Gap wear. In Bar and Grill vernacular, "good food" means "lots and cheap." Martell's, a pub that originally opened 30 years ago at 200 East 83d Street, serves a barely passable chicken pot pie and a bowl of chili that wouldn't make it to the semifinals of any chili contest, but the place, which was recently rebuilt after a fire, is jammed.
"It's not as cool as it used to be," said Laura Jenson, 39, an accountant who grew up in the neighborhood. Since the restaurant has been renovated, she said, "It's as if somebody opened a Martell's in a mall."
But she keeps coming back. "I love the people," she said. "My husband and I come at least twice a week."
When he renovated, Joseph Smith, the restaurant's owner, tried to keep the feel of the old place. "I had a new tin ceiling made so the place would look old," he said. And when it comes to customers' names, his recall, as any Bar and Grill aficionado would say, is "awesome." His beef and barley soup might be too salty, but on New Year's Eve Mr. Smith got five standing ovations.
At Joe's Bar and Grill, at 142 West 10th Street, the meatloaf is only O.K. and the salmon so-so, but every few weeks the place seems to spontanteously combust into neighborhood gatherings. Sunday nights' "soup and sandwich" dinner at Joe's is a flashback to Bohemia and bluejeans.
Bar and Grills have sprouted all over but the Upper East Side remains the heart of Bar and Grill country. "We have a whole slew of young professionals who party in this neighborhood," said Joe Salvato, manager of Willies.
That slew's best mirror is Luke's Bar and Grill, a wood-paneled pub that opened last year at 1394 Third Avenue (80th Street) and has kept a full house nightly with a bigger and better burger, big salads, a decent bowl of spaghetti and an average check of $15. Luigi Militello, the restaurant's manager, said, "They come back because I know their names and I don't make a big deal out of dinner."
This no-big-deal subversiveness in kitchens on the city's side streets sends a shiver through the citadels of chic. Discussing the scaling down of local restaurants in an interview last year, Gilbert LeCoze, the chef and owner of Le Bernardin, said: "It will be the death of cuisine. A chef cannot afford to imagine and create on a $20 check average."
But while they may not have invented a new culinary genre, the cooks in Cafe and My Place restaurants often turn out fine versions of familiar dishes.
"It's reassuring to eat quiche Lorraine again," said Jon Riley, a 47-year-old investment banker who was eating at Tartine's, a tiny cafe at 253 West 11th Street. The cramped storefront, which opened in December, is small, and has lots of single diners reading over dinner. Let the Bar and Grills foster an esprit de corps through Super Bowl parties. At Cafes, group participation is more like group therapy, heavy on the support factor.
"I'm afraid he's overwhelmed," worried a guest who had been waiting for a croque-monsieur (made on brioche here, and very good) for nearly an hour on a recent week night at Tartine's.
"He only has six burners back there," nodded the woman at the next table, empathetically glancing from her book to the kitchen door.
"Would it be easier if we just had the onion soup and spinach salad?" asked one of two gentlemen sharing a table in the opposite corner of the cafe.
The chef, Thierry Rorchard, opened Tartine's with his partner, Jean-Francois Bernard, a pastry chef, after several decades of working in large French restaurants in New York. He said he hadn't gotten used to "doing everything myself." But the soups, sandwiches, omelets and beef mignonette are almost always good. The check is always about $10 for dinner. And the neighborhood has embraced Mr. Rorchard and Tartine's in a strong, protective hug. Some call ahead to see if he needs them to stop for milk, lemons or parsley on the way over to dinner.
The Cafe is widely imitated throughout the city. But the Village remains its epicenter. Anglers and Writers, a charming jumble of mismatched antiques that opened last year at 420 Hudson Street (St. Luke's Place), is a place where neighbors linger for hours.
"We look lived-in, not fabricated," said the owner, Craig Bero. One couple who had been regulars before moving to the Upper West Side now write him postcards. "They miss me; I miss them," said Mr. Bero, who also owns the Village Atelier on Hudson Street. "That's what a neighborhood cafe is about."
The Atelier, which opened three years ago at No. 436, was an advance guard in the recent wave of My Place restaurants. It looks like an idealized farmhouse in Wisconsin, which is where Mr. Bero grew up. The pan-fried brook trout and pike, game and the pies that his mother, Charlotte Bero, bakes are, too, the best of the Midwest. My Places always bear the imprimatur of the owner and are usually efforts to bring "back where I came from" into "where I live now."
In a city of strangers, My Places are therefore tough to resist. Today, they are the most crowded -- and most frequently imitated -- restaurants in town. If a neighborhood restaurant feels more like a business than home, it is a My Place pretender. If, on the other hand, every detail is intimate and idiosyncratic, you've entered an authentic My Place.
Don't be put off my by noise. "I can't believe all these people," said Marzena Hurgado, who with her husband, Jose, the former executive chef of Cinco Di Mayo, opened Mi Cocina at 57 Jane Street (Hudson Street) in August. The cooking is highly personalized Mexican fare. There are tender tamales and Oaxacan chicken soup, fresh shrimp in a mellow, roasted tomato sauce, and fresh flour tortillas wrapping grilled vegetables. The menu says "service by Marzena."
"We just wanted to do a place our way, very personal," Mrs. Hurgado said. "We aren't flashy. They have to look for us. And they find us."
Uptown at a My Place gone berserk, Eddie Schoenfeld, proprietor of Vince & Eddie's at 70 West 69th Street, was facing a line of 10 people who were waiting for tables, waiting to order the onion tart or white bean soup, the lamb shank with dried cherry sauce or roast chicken. Dinner can top the $25 mark. The crowds keep growing.
"We knew if we cooked just a little up the scale from meatloaf, and made people feel cozy, we'd be fine," said Mr. Schoenfeld, who has run restaurants for several decades. "But what we are looking at here is a neighbhorhood joint that's turned into a destination dining spot."
Mr. Schoenfeld, in an entrepreneurial flurry, has recently opened Fishin' Eddie at 73 West 71st Street, and plans in three months to open Chop Suey Looey's Litchi Lounge in midtown and a string of Chinese take-out kitchens. He'd like to take personal credit for his business success, but he can't.
"What people want most right now is to be taken care of and that's what I've always done the best," he said. "But in another era, you'd never find this many people wanting to be taken care of this much."

HEADLINE: Some Neighborhood Haunts Go Back 120 Years, Some Only 40

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
THEY are harbors of serenity in the feverish metropolis. You won't find them in the trend-tracking urban magazines, nor will their chefs be lionized in lists of up-and-coming stars. And the chances of spotting Warren Beatty or Michelle Pfeiffer chewing the fat at the bar are about equal to encountering Saddam Hussein on the IRT.
These are the original neighborhood haunts. They are steady, family- owned, economical pub-style restaurants. The clientele is so loyal that if someone does not show up at the appointed hour, the owner calls to see if anything is wrong. 
 "I've been coming here since 1943 and not a day goes by that I don't stop in," said Alice Mulligan, a Greenwich Village resident, who was having an early evening cocktail with a friend at Gene's, a vintage Italian restaurant on West 11th Street in the Village.
Such steadfast patrons can be found at all of New York City's neighborhood haunts. One of the oldest and most enduring is Billy's. Dating to 1870, originally on First Avenue near 56th Street, Billy's was forced to move twice: in 1880 to the southeast corner of 56th Street and First Avenue, then in 1966, to the present location, three blocks south.
The Billy's of today retains its Old New York charm, with an ornately carved mahogany bar illuminated by an original gas lantern, red-checked tablecloths and menus posted on the wall. Almost all customers get a hug from the hostess upon entering, and the genial, wisecracking waiters are studies in quiet efficiency.
"We have the children and grandchildren of Billy's longtime customers now coming in with their own children," said Joan Condron Borkowski, the owner and great-granddaughter of the founder. "That's so nice to see."
A major appeal of restaurants like Billy's is their consistency. You can go there one day and return 10 years later and find the exact same decor, same menu, same crowd and same staff. "It's a second home," Mrs. Borkowski said. On a recent weeknight, Joseph Donadic, a waiter there for 30 years, estimated that 95 percent of the dinner crowd were regulars.
The traditional American steakhouse menu at Billy's is the same as it was in the Eisenhower Administration, with just a few contemporary concessions. "I fought my father for four years to add vegetables to the menu, and he finally gave in," Mrs. Borkowski said. Pasta was the great innovation of 1991, the result of lobbying by some regulars. Among the other selections are roast prime rib ($19.25), sauteed calf's liver ($15.50), salisbury steak ($15) and broiled fillet of sole ($15). The fare is simple, fresh and copious.
Fanelli's Cafe opened at the corner of Prince and Mercer Streets in lower Manhattan in 1872, just two years after Billy's. "It was originally called Prince Cafe and owned by a guy named Nicholas Volpe," said the current owner, Hans Noe. "I learned that from a signature etched on the glass doors."
Mr. Noe, who has owned the bar and restaurant since 1983, said the second owners, Harry Green and Joseph Israel, kept it until 1915, when a former boxer named Michael Fanelli took over.
If Nicholas Volpe were to walk into Fanelli's Cafe today he would feel right at home. He would pass through the original etched glass doors, shuffle over the same tile floor, take a seat at the same magnificent carved mahogany bar, order a locally brewed beer and maybe dine on shepherd's pie. The only difference might be the wall covered with photos of famous pugilists, an addition of Mr. Fanelli in the World War I era.
Fanelli's appears to be a hangout for struggling young SoHo artists and musicians, as well as families who crowd around the formica-topped tables in the back dining room. It's hard to stickle over a mountain of food covering every inch of the plate that costs $9.75. Burgers, meatloaf, chili, pizza, grilled chicken breast, pasta and shellfish platters are the specialties of the maison.
While many upscale restaurants have been struggling through the recession, Fanelli's Cafe has continued to grow every year, Mr. Noe said.
Donahue's, a steakhouse and bar on the Upper East Side, is a period piece in its own right, though the period is not 19th century but rather 1950's. The long, rectangular bar is a time warp with its wood paneling, tile floor, television overhead and eerie blue lights emanating from behind the liquor shelf. The back dining room has 10 black vinyl booths, overhead fans, and nautical art on the wall.
Martin Donahue opened the restaurant in 1950, and today it is run by his son, Michael, and his granddaughter Maureen. "We get a lot of writers and antiques people who live in the neighborhood," Maureen Donahue said. "Teddy White was in here four times a week. He was like my stepfather."
Camaraderie is one draw of a place like Donahue's, and so, too, is economy. On the menu are items like Hungarian goulash ($9.50), eggplant Parmesan ($10.50), sirloin steak ($15.95) and pork chops ($12.25).
"A lot of these people go to Le Cirque and other fancy places on weekends," Miss Donahue surmised. "During the week they come here to be easy and relaxed."
Gene's, on West 11th Street in Greenwich Village, resembles the type of Italian restaurant that existed in every suburban town in the 1950's and 1960's: smoke-stained murals, big mirrors, sundry oil paintings, blue-green floor tile, discolored soundproof tile in the ceiling, symmetrical rows of tables, and friendly waiters in short jackets. Opened in 1919, it has been a social and gastronomic anchor for the neighborhood ever since.
"We never change anything on the menu," declared Albino Ramirez, who with Concepcion Domingez, has owned Gene's for 12 years. "But of course, if a customer wants something special, we will make it."
On the extensive menu are linguine with clam sauce ($12.95), baked ziti Sicilian style ($8.75), shrimp marinara ($13.95), broiled lamb chops ($16.95) and veal piccata ($13.95) and more. Mr. Ramirez said that he could offer inexpensive food because his overhead is low and his business is holding steady.
On a weekday afternoon, three regulars were getting a head start on cocktail hour while chatting with Mr. Ramirez. "These trendy places that open uptown, you go once and that's it," said Alice Mulligan, who lives nearby. Her friend, Sheila Thorpe of Ridgewood, N.J., who says she has been coming to Gene's for years, adds: "Whenever I come into the city, I make a point of coming here. That's unusual."
Mr. Ramirez, a small, stout man with a slender mustache, beamed.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Making a Movie Take the Rap For the Violence That It Attracts

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
The type of individual who would brandish a semi-automatic weapon at a movie theater where Ernest Dickerson's "Juice" is playing (as someone did in Commack, L.I., the other evening) is the best argument for the reasonableness of what Mr. Dickerson has to say. His film addresses the peer pressures at work on a group of Harlem high school students, one of whom eventually develops a taste for murderous mayhem and viciously attacks his friends.
The irrational bravado and macho posturing displayed by Bishop (Tupac Shakur), the film's bad-boy character, are undoubtedly shared by those gun-toting, knife-wielding moviegoers who have put "Juice" in the news. In the wake of similar violent outbreaks surrounding the openings of Mario Van Peebles's "New Jack City" and John Singleton's "Boyz N the Hood," it's not surprising to find this happening again. All these films address the frustration faced by young urban black men, and all have become lightning rods for that frustration. So bad news is being delivered, both in the lobby and on the screen. 
 When that happens, the messenger tends to take the blame. But can "Juice" be held accountable for the behavior it has provoked? The film observes Bishop's actions from the viewpoint of Q (Omar Epps), who is worried and frightened by what he sees and eventually renounces the recklessness of Bishop's actions. Mr. Dickerson, who both wrote and directed the film, depicts Bishop as a loose cannon and condemns him by the time the story is over. Fundamentally, "Juice" leaves no question as to where its values lie.
On its surface, which involves a rap soundtrack and a fairly lighthearted attitude toward petty crime, this film says something slightly different. (So does its advertising art, which underscores Bishop's toughness, not Q's fears. Obviously, frightened young heroes don't sell tickets the way tough ones do.) Although no more exploitative than "Boyz N the Hood," which decried gang violence in South Central Los Angeles but still felt the need to depict some, "Juice" sends a mixed message just by illustrating the dangers it deplores. Like the English rock star played by Eric Bogosian in "Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll," the one who speaks so invitingly of all the debauchery he has given up, "Juice" conveys a vivid sense of the temptations its characters try to resist.
For the portion of the audience that has created disruptions in theaters where "Juice" is playing, those things must loom disproportionately large. Viewers who grew up heavily influenced by violent films and television shows, by rap records and MTV, are bound to have short attention spans and a taste for easy excitement. They may well miss the subtlety of the antidrug attitudes of a "New Jack City" if they pay more attention to the exploitative touches -- the shootouts, flashy jewelry, fast women, stacks of money and close-ups of crack vials -- that help frame the message.
At a time when black American film makers have achieved new prominence, and when an important creative boom is under way among them, they can't be faulted for matching white Hollywood's standards of violence. None of these films makes crime any more alluring than it has long been in movies about the Mafia, and none is any more violent than a vehicle for Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Even by comparison with rap music video, which is currently under fire for Public Enemy's depiction of an assassination plot against state officials in Arizona (because that state has not yet endorsed Martin Luther King Day as a holiday), "Juice" seems comparatively responsible and tame.
But a film like this does not simply speak for itself, any more than a "J. F. K." or a "Thelma and Louise" does. Whenever a movie arrives amid a blizzard of attendant news stories, its message tends to be distorted and oversimplified, a process that in the case of "Juice" has proved more dangerous than usual. "Juice" now joins other black-oriented films that have indirectly incited their audiences to deadly violence, and the coincidence must be taken seriously. Those who distribute and advertise such films are now forced to anticipate the possibility that the film's meanings will be misunderstood.
The regrettable but necessary step of hiring extra security guards for theaters playing "Juice," an expense that will be absorbed by Paramount Pictures, introduces an air of economic reality into the problems raised by this film's release. The more responsible a distributor feels for the climate in which a film is shown, the calmer that climate is likely to be. And film makers addressing themselves to volatile viewers may wind up thinking harder about the unintended messages their work conveys. Films have every right to mirror society's troubles. They also have an obligation to avoid making those troubles any worse.

HEADLINE: America-Bashing, Not All False

 BODY:
First came President Bush's clumsy, embarrassing effort to bully the Japanese into buying unwanted autos and parts. Now Yoshio Sakurauchi, Speaker of Japan's lower house, gratuitously and falsely berates U.S. workers as lazy and illiterate. As apologetic Japanese officials realize, these views could not have spewed out at a worse time, with overtones of trade war already audible in the Presidential campaign. 'Sneak Attack!' yesterday's New York Post shouted, voicing the offense many Americans are apt to feel.
Both countries have an urgent interest in halting such bilateral blame-mongering quickly. And it is in Americans' particular interest to recognize why Speaker Sakurauchi's comments sting. However coarse, they come close to some truth. 
 Mr. Bush's performance in Tokyo was rightly condemned by U.S. commentators as soon as the shock of his flu attack receded. Now it's Mr. Saku rauchi's turn for reproach. Speaking to constituents Sunday, he reportedly said that the source of America's competitive problems "is the inferior quality of U.S. labor. . . . U.S. workers are too lazy. They want high pay without working." About 30 percent "cannot even read. . . . So managers cannot convey their orders in written form. Therefore, they get a high ratio of bad parts."
As a former Foreign Minister, Mr. Sakurauchi ought to know that illiteracy in the U.S. is closer to 5 than to 30 percent and that American labor productivity remains higher than in Japan. How diligently, Americans might ask, did this experienced politician work on his research?
America's work force is not the problem. Auto workers who want to work hard but instead face widespread layoffs are entitled to feel offended. Meanwhile other Americans, less threatened, also bridle at Mr. Sakurauchi's outburst. They see Japan's economy growing while America sputters in recession.
Mistakenly, they blame bilateral trade deficits. They are not mistaken to wonder why this country, with its faith in success and upward mobility, now seems to be steadily losing ground. They recognize that some things are wrong: Americans need to consume less and save more. They need to revitalize management and morale. They need to adapt production to world market needs.
All that is harder than exchanging epithets, but promises far happier results. President Bush and his crew of auto executives did Americans no favor by trying to press import quotas on a resentful Japan. Japanese politicians have every right to complain about U.S. blame-mongering, but not by blame-mongering themselves. Americans have every right to resent crude criticisms from Japan, but not to forget that the main problems are made in the U.S.A.

HEADLINE: Who Should Liberate Iraq?

 BODY:
Should America encourage Iraqis to overthrow Saddam Hussein? Yes. Should it advertise that any new Iraqi government could expect an early easing of the international economic embargo and generous reconstruction aid? Yes again. But should the U.S. commit itself in advance to give armed support to any group that challenges the Iraqi dictator, as Saudi Arabia now urges? Under present circumstances, the best answer is no.
The world has every right to hold Saddam Hussein accountable to international law. But replacing even the most obnoxious regimes, provided their cruelties are confined to their own territories, is best left to the people directly concerned. 
 Besides, a military blank check might have disastrous consequences. The offer could be taken up by an Iraqi cabal no less brutal than the present Government. A rebel coalition with weak domestic support could get bogged down in protracted fighting. Kurdish or Shiite rebels could provoke wider regional war.
A year ago, the issues were different. Saddam Hussein had occupied Kuwait, in defiance of U.N. resolutions. His deployments threatened Saudi Arabia; his statements showed he was trying to use force to control oil prices and supply. And, as postwar inspections revealed, he was assembling a nuclear capability in violation of Iraq's Nonproliferation Treaty commitments.
Compare that with the situation today. Iraq's forces have been thrown out of Kuwait and badly mauled. They pose no immediate threat to anyone outside Iraq. An effective international embargo prevents Baghdad from rebuilding its military might. And the Security Council's cease-fire resolution, with the implicit threat of military action, has shut down nuclear, biological and chemical weapons development.
At the same time, Saddam Hussein's survival in power is a political embarrassment to President Bush, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the U.N. coalition -- and a nightmare for the Iraqi people.
Kurdish families are exposed to the ravages of winter in the open. Suspected dissidents face mass executions and other forms of state terror. Millions of Iraqis have been condemned to malnutrition and illness by their Government's callous rejection of U.N. terms for humanitarian relief.
If those conditions result in a rebellion with good prospects for success, and with a reasonable likelihood of setting Iraq on a more constructive course, there may be a case for the U.S. to provide limited logistical support.
But any decision to return to Iraq in force needs to be preceded, as before, by U.N. and Congressional deliberation. Iraqis deserve better than a quick fix; Americans deserve better than a campaign season surprise.

HEADLINE: Here's a Way To Fight Japan

BYLINE: By Joseph I. Lieberman; Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat, is Senator from Connecticut.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Congress will soon be asked to cut taxes to combat the recession. Cuts for the middle class would be fair and might encourage more consumer spending. But the economy needs more than a quick fix -- an extra $300 in every middle class family's bank account. It needs a large-scale, aggressive, long-term Government-business partnership for growth.
People worry that the recession is not just another cyclical slide from which we will bounce back. They fear, correctly, that unless America takes fundamental action, we will never improve our living standard. We will keep slipping because of our social and economic weaknesses and the strengths of our European and Asian competitors. 
 The Speaker of the lower house of the Japanese Parliament has characterized our workforce as "too lazy" to compete with Japan. We must reply the way we replied to Nikita Khrushchev's threat, "We will bury you," and again prove to the world and ourselves that we are still capable of the hard work that has always been the path to success in America.
This means we must urgently deal with our weaknesses: the deterioration of our manufacturing sector, our low rate of investment, slowness in bringing new products to market, limited nondefense research and development, the lack of coordinated public and private planning and investment, our inadequate education system and a declining work ethic.
Incentives such as capital gains tax cuts, investment tax credits and credits for research and development and for worker education and training are necessary to unleash private capital and creativity. They should be part of an overhauled tax system that promotes long-term low-cost capital for sectors needing growth, particularly manufacturing.
Developing joint planning and action with business means breaking through ideological barriers. The U.S. has never had a pure laissez-faire economy; since our founding, we have had a mixed economy that relies on market forces as much as possible but also uses Government for economic growth and creating jobs -- as in aerospace and agriculture, for example.
The Federal Government should reorganize such agencies as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and charge them with stimulating economic expansion. They might be coordinated by an economic growth adviser to the President or all be brought under the Commerce Department, which could be renamed the Department of Economic Growth.
We can focus on the 22 technologies the White House has designated as critical to growth and then did nothing about. They include advanced materials, computer-integrated manufacturing and biotechnology. While investment tax credits and capital gains tax cuts would help some businesses and entrepreneurs in these sectors, other industries will need low-interest loans or Federal investment to insure that foreign companies, whose governments support them, do not have an unfair advantage.
In alliance with business, the Government should take as much as possible of the $22.5 billion spent yearly at Federal laboratories and refocus it on commercial and industrial products and technological development. Such cooperation can keep America at the leading edge of breakthroughs in energy, medicine and other high-tech fields.
We must give our exporting businesses the support Asian and European governments give their companies. This means more and better financing authority for the Export-Import Bank, tougher trade negotiations that emphasize the opening of markets and, if needed, agreements that result in an increase in specified U.S. exports when a trade imbalance persists.
And we should dramatically improve support for scientific, technical and engineering education and training by expanding tax credits for employers providing such programs and creating apprenticeships with business in public schools.
If the Administration continues to dismiss such pragmatic steps, on the ground that the Government has no business picking winners and losers, the losers will be the millions of Americans whose jobs will go to foreign workers in countries where governments understand their responsibility to expand domestic businesses in a competitive global economy.

HEADLINE: No Time to Be Stingy With Russia

 BODY:
Western Foreign Ministers gathering today in Washington need to concentrate on one urgent task: arranging a substantial transfusion of aid to Russia and a beleaguered Boris Yeltsin.
Europeans, especially Germany, have been quick to act. The U.S. by contrast has been slow and stingy, in part because foreign aid is politically unpopular. But without more aid, Russia could slip back into autocracy. 
 The Bush Administration annoyed many Europeans by convening the conference. Washington seemed to be seeking maximum credit for a modest effort. The Administration could put things right, and enhance its influence in Europe, by shouldering its fair share of the burden.
All the former Soviet republics face a treacherous transition from Communism. Russia, by its size and strength, is critical to its neighbors' success. But its prospects are uncertain. Mr. Yeltsin is surrounded by rivals and advisers ready to counter economic crisis and popular discontent with authoritarianism. Furthermore, most of the preconditions were not in place when Mr. Yeltsin freed prices, like banking and tax systems and tight money. And no economist knows whether hoarders and producers will move enough goods to market to halt spiraling inflation.
No sooner did Mr. Yeltsin take the leap than his rivals began backtracking. Their distaste for the disorder of markets and democracy is exceeded only by a dangerous nostalgia for the strong hand.
Aid, carefully targeted and delivered, can calm public anxiety and give reforms time to work. It can allow Russia to downsize a restive Red Army by supplementing severance pay. It can help convert military to civilian production.
Germany was quick to provide aid and credits. It sent much-needed food and medicine. And it is spending substantial sums to build housing back home for Soviet troops, the price for their withdrawal from eastern Germany.
Washington demeaned these efforts as self-interested -- as if helping the former Soviet Union transform itself and demobilize the Red Army does not serve America's interests as much as Germany's. Washington also contends it has helped as much as Bonn. Yet by any reasonable standard -- aid per capita or aid as a proportion of G.N.P. -- the American effort doesn't measure up.
The idea of increasing foreign aid may seem to challenge America's mounting preoccupation with troubles at home. But the U.S. needs to assure tranquillity in Europe. And it can easily afford more aid once it cuts its bloated defense budget.
"Let Germany do it" is no answer to Russia's need. America will pay the price if it skimps now.

The $64 Question

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
It's hard to imagine, looking over New Jersey's new welfare legislation, that the people who designed it sought information or help from those who will be most affected by it.
Have they talked to the people who have pumped themselves up with job training programs and then been blindsided by the reality of the job market? Have they talked to the women on welfare who fear that if they go to work they will lose their children's health care coverage? Have they talked to those who have stayed on public assistance rather than take minimum wage jobs because they had no place to put their kids while they worked? 
 No one hears those voices. The poor are a losing franchise; even the Democratic candidates for President, some sounding suspiciously like Rockefeller Republicans, seem to have thrown them over to concentrate on the forgotten middle class. The voices of compassion are reedy and thin, replaced by those reflecting, sometimes overtly, sometimes subtly, the stereotypes: that the welfare rolls are filled with lazy people who maximize their drag on the public weal by spitting out a child a year.
In New Jersey the result is legislation, called the Family Development Initiative Act, that may be well meaning but is about as reality-based as "Star Trek."
The most controversial part of the package refuses additional benefits to women who have a child while enrolled in the welfare program. This plays to the notion that welfare mothers are having one baby after another, which is simply untrue; a family on welfare in New Jersey is slightly smaller than the state average.
And it suggests that poor women have kids for the money. Right now, a woman on welfare in New Jersey receives an additional $64 a month if she has another child, or around $2 a day. I'd like to propose a month during which all members of the legislature attempt to meet their daily nutritional needs on $2.
The list of groups objecting to that provision includes the New Jersey Catholic Conference and the National Organization for Women, the American Civil Liberties Union and the state Right to Life group. Bad legislation makes strange bedfellows. Supporters of the bill say that middle-class people don't get government subsidies for additional kids, conveniently ignoring tax credits and deductions. They argue that it will teach women on welfare responsibility, a kind of legislative "tough love" program.
What it will really do is teach a 3-year-old what it feels like to have an empty stomach.
The Family Development Initiative Act, signed yesterday by Gov. Jim Florio, allegedly a Democrat, requires that all welfare recipients attend school or job training or risk losing benefits. In theory this sounds fine, until you remember the state of the economy, even for the middle class. "The myth of a meritocracy has overshadowed the reality of available jobs," the New Jersey Council of Churches said in a statement opposing the legislation. Job training? Great. For what jobs?
The welfare system is a mess, and everyone knows it. When you meet a 16-year-old with a newborn who is the third generation of her matriarchal line to settle back into the quicksand of public assistance, you know that a system meant to get people back on their feet has instead cut many of them off at the knees.
And the solutions to welfare dependency are daunting: more emphasis on reducing teen-age pregnancy and the dropout rate, more education and training that targets the real needs of a changing job market, more innovative thinking about new ways to get people working, more initiatives for child care and health care.
Real welfare reform is going to require radical action, massive root changes, another war on poverty. And radical action requires big ideas, not $64 questions. One good way to begin is to talk to the strong, smart women who have as much contempt for the welfare system as any middle-class person could, but who find, simply put, that it is the only way they can manage to put peanut butter in the cupboard for their kids. Putting a lid on the peanut butter is an insulting and punitive way to show them that you want to improve their lives. They've probably got some better ideas if anyone's willing to listen.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
An Ad in Defense Of the Ad Deduction

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Proposals to cut the Federal deficit by lowering the deductions on advertising as a business expense have not made much progress over the last five years. But as President Bush's State of the Union address nears, the American Advertising Federation is not taking any chances.
In a pre-emptive strike against such a measure's inclusion in this year's budget package, the group has created an ad in the form of a letter to the President. It describes advertising as an "engine of economic growth" and goes on to say: "Like you, Mr. President, we want to help get America's economy started again. Incentives to advertise are incentives for growth." 
 Wally Snyder, the federation's president, said that The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal had agreed to run the ad and that other publications were still considering it. It is expected to appear tomorrow, five days before the address.
The advertising industry's tax status will "be threatened for the next several years as budgets are challenged and Government explores for new sources of revenue," Mr. Snyder added. "We feel like we really need to be pro-active on this issue."

HEADLINE: Japanese Trade Surplus Surged Last Year

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus has reversed course after a three-year decline, surging by 50 percent in 1991, the Government said today. The announcement is likely to fan increasing resentment in the United States and other nations upset because the surplus, they say, stems from Japan's adherence to unfair trade policies.
The Finance Ministry said that for the year, Japan sold $78.23 billion more goods overseas than it imported, compared with a $52.15 billion surplus in 1990. These preliminary figures were for what is called the customs-cleared trade surplus. The Government will later announce broader figures that include a variety of other costs of conducting trade, like transportation and insurance. Those inclusive figures are generally cited by economists when they discuss trade imbalances. 
 Because of the American recession, Japan's custom-cleared trade surplus with the United States rose only slightly, to $38.45 billion, from $37.95 billion in 1990. Economists said that inclusive of all trade costs Japan's surplus with the United States exceeded $43 billion, which is expected to be roughly three-quarters of the total United States trade deficit. Many expect that to rise much more quickly this year if the economy begins to recover and Americans buy more Japanese cars, television sets and the like.
 
Asian and European Expansion
 The surplus with the European Community jumped 48.1 percent and with other Asian countries it rose 43.2 percent, demonstrating a new resilience in Japan's trade policies. For one, it showed that exporters were able to make up for the slower growth in the United States and expand sharply their shipments to Asia and Europe.
Such a big jump in the politically sensitive figure also suggests that just days before an important meeting of the finance ministers of the leading industrial countries in Garden City, L.I., policy makers here and abroad may have to start over to find ways to shrink Japan's remarkably persistent trade imbalances. Already there is speculation that for the second time since 1985, the dollar will be engineered lower in what is effectively a devaluation against the yen.
The dollar has already declined slightly against the yen for the last year to the current level of about 123 yen to the dollar. However, that has shown no apparent benefit for America's trade deficit yet. "This is the 28th year in a row Japan has had a trade surplus," said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist here with the securities brokerage arm of Deutsche Bank. "I think we have to conclude it is structural, and that the measures taken have not been effective."
Today's news also comes at the start of a Presidential campaign in which America's battered industrial competitiveness and trade deficit are becoming major issues, particularly after President Bush's troubled trade mission to Japan earlier this month.
 
Imports Rise Slightly
 In its report today, the Finance Ministry also said Japan's exports surged 9.6 percent, to $314.6 billion, while imports rose by a modest seven-tenths of a percent, to $236.4 billion, because of a slowdown in the Japanese economy.

HEADLINE: Japan Seeks Ways to Tame Stock Market

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Financial industry executives and officials, alarmed about the Japanese stock markets entering its its third year of a deep slump, are contemplating emergency measures that could reverse several years of liberalization and make it harder for foreign brokers to do business in Japan.
The measures under discussion range from introducing new restrictions on trading in stock index futures -- the principal source of profits for many foreign brokers in Japan -- to forming a huge fund with contributions from banks and securities houses to inflate share prices with concerted buying, a method last attempted tried here in the 1960's. 
 In a host of speeches, press conferences and leaks to the news media, officials of securities houses, industry associations and the authorities of the stock exchanges have made it clear in recent weeks that they do not intend simply to let market forces take their course.
Behind their discussions lies a fundamental question about whether Japan can turn back the clock and intervene to manage its financial markets in an era when capital flows around the globe with increasing freedom.
There is also a much quieter concern over the growing profitability of foreign brokerage houses here. They are gaining ground against their much larger but scandal-battered Japanese rivals, the so-called Big Four -- Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi.
In the first half of the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 6 of the 10 most- profitable firms here were foreign. Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley, which reap a substantial portion of their profits through program trading that involves stock index futures, occupied the third and fourth places.
The Nikkei index future, representing the value of 225 leading Japanese stocks, permits investors to bet on the market's general direction. In trading, American firms have used their technical advantages to earn tens of millions of dollars in Japan through computer-assisted trading strategies, including program trading.
Most traders and brokerage executives say that creation of a stock-buying fund to bolster prices would certainly fail because the market is simply too big to be propped up in this way. Nonetheless, a report on Wednesday by the Mainichi newspaper that such a plan had been discussed contributed to a sharp rebound in share prices. The Nikkei stock index rose 675.82 points on Wednesday, to 21,534.12. Today, the Nikkei was up 46.60 points, a little more than two-tenths of 1 percent, to 21,580.72.
Adding urgency is a decline that has brought the Nikkei from a peak of 38,915.87, on the last trading day of 1989, down almost to 20,000. Prices haved slid steadily this year. Many here believe that if the market falls through the 20,000 barrier, it will begin to damage the Japanese economy and perhaps cause panic selling.
Most industry executives are betting that the authorities will rein in trading in stock index futures, which some blame for the market's troubles.
Thus far, the American firms have been trying to work behind the scenes to block restrictions on their key business here. The possibility of new restrictions in the financial markets comes after President Bush tried to open other Japanese markets to American businesses.
 
Protection for Investors
The foreign firms say that futures trading merely reflects and helps investors protect against volatility and that restrictions are unwarranted.
"It's shooting the messenger," said Richard Greer, head of the Tokyo office of Baring Securities. "I don't think it would have much effect to restrict the futures market, and in fact, some of the recent measures to restrict it seem to have increased volatility."
Mr. Greer added that some trading had simply been driven to Singapore, where another version of the Nikkei stock index futures contract is traded.
Tomoko Aikawa, a spokeswoman for Nomura, confirmed reports that representatives of the Big Four held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss market-bolstering measures.
Index futures trading, Ms. Aikawa said, "was a very important topic." Creating a fund to mop up stocks was discussed, but was not a serious possibility, she added.
"The end result was that they decided to form a working group to take up proposals for regulations and administrative things that could be changed to make it more convenient for the market and for investors," Ms. Aikawa said.
The Osaka Stock Exchange, where the key Nikkei futures are traded, has already made it more difficult and expensive to trade stock index futures. The margin, or downpayment, that an investor must make has risen from 9 percent in September 1988, to 30 percent as of last month. The margin rate was increased three times last year.
In addition, the exchanges have slowed down the pace at which prices can change, a practice that effectively suspends the stock index futures market when the underlying stock market is volatile. In the rally on Wednesday, traders said, the stock index futures market was suspended more than it was open.
 
Japanese Rush to Sell
Many experts insist that some of the measures could do more harm than good by making it more difficult for investors to move in and out of the market. They also say that what ails the Japanese stock market is not some technical problem with stock index futures but the Japanese themselves dumping shares with abandon.
According to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, institutional investors here were net sellers of 1.78 trillion yen, about $14.35 billion at current exchange rates, worth of stocks in 1991. Investment trusts, the Japanese equivalents of mutual funds, sold a net 1.52 trillion yen of stocks, while nonfinancial corporations sold 1.86 trillion yen worth and individuals sold a net 2.53 trillion yen in stocks.
The only big buyers are foreigner investors, who were net purchasers buyers of 5.62 trillion yen of Japanese shares last year.

HEADLINE: Bush to Press Congress to Approve $645 Million for Ex-Soviet Lands

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
At the start of a conference to discuss aid to the former Soviet Union, President Bush said today that he would ask Congress for $645 million in new aid for Russia and the other independent republics.
It is not clear whether Congress, under pressure in an election year to deal with domestic problems, will approve the assistance. 
 The House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said he would be inclined to back the additional aid, but only if the President "will finally take the lead in selling it to the American people, explaining to them why it is in their self-interest and helping them to understand that this is not the end but the beginning if we are to seize this great moment."
The President made the announcement as he opened the 47-nation conference at the State Department, which was convened by the Bush Administration to better coordinate assistance of food and shelter for the new Commonwealth of Independent States. The new aid proposal seemed in reaction to criticism that his Administration had not done enough to assist the former Soviet republics.
By all accounts the atmosphere of the meeting was cordial and announcements on concrete steps for improving aid to the Commonwealth are expected Thursday.
 
Poor Distribution
 Among the more novel proposals made today was a suggestion by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany that the Western allies create an institution that would hire unemployed Soviet nuclear scientists to work on peaceful research and keep them from selling their services to hostile nations. Nevertheless, some of the tensions between the allies over how to help were also apparent.
The French representative, Elisabeth Guigou, Minister for European Affairs, said in her opening speech that the problem now is not the threat of famine in Russia and other republics, but "poorly organized distribution" systems on the ground, as well as corruption.
Implicitly criticizing Washington, she said that what is needed now is not another international conference or structure overseeing aid, but rather practical, on-site mechanisms to make sure that what is already available gets to those who need it.
Ms. Guigou said France regretted that Russia and other former republics were barred by Washington from attending the conference -- on the ground that they would compete with one another for more aid -- "since they are the practical actors, and it is through joint efforts with them that our emergency aid will be most effective."
Although Mr. Bush said the conference would not be a pledging session, complaints from European countries like Germany and France that Washington had to lead with its pocketbook if it wanted to be treated as the leader in the coordination effort, intensified pressure on the President to step up the Administration's assistance.
Addressing the European, Asian, Japanese and Arab foreign ministers gathered around a single conference table in the State Department's Benjamin Franklin Room for the two-day meeting, Mr. Bush said: "Let us bring equal commitment to the challenge of helping to build and sustain democracy and economic freedom in the former U.S.S.R. just as we did to winning the cold war. Let us help the people throughout the independent states to make the leap from Communism to democracy, from command economies to free markets, from authoritarianism, to liberty."
Saying that the "U.S. cannot and will not falter at the moment that these new states are struggling to embrace the very ideals that America was founded to foster and preserve," Mr. Bush said he was proposing that Congress approve $645 million in new humanitarian and technical assistance. He did not specify where this money would come from.
The new aid would include $585 million for humanitarian and technical aid, $25 million for medical aid, $20 million for training in private farming and farm businesses and $15 million for development.
 
Will Congress Approve?
 The new assistance, which would not have to be repaid, would put the total American contribution to the Soviet aid effort at $5 billion. Most of that $5 billion, though, are farm credits for the republics to purchase American grain and other foodstuffs. Such credits benefit American farmers and must, by law, be repaid.
Whether Congress will approve the new aid in an election year is unclear, and could depend on whether the money comes out of the defense budget or the existing foreign aid budget or involves a new outlay of cash.
Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat from Connecticut and chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade, reacted negatively to Mr. Bush's request, saying: "I think that the President needs to focus on the United States. The Germans and the countries that are in better economic shapes should be putting together the packages. They'll be hard pressed to pass any additional aid without first dealing with the domestic issues."
But other key Democrats who have long been pressing the Administration to take advantage of the historical opportunity to transform the Soviet Union, were more positive about the proposal.
 
'Absent at the Creation'
 "A new world is being born and the United States is perilously close to being absent at the creation," said Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Deleware Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Europe. "It will be tragic indeed if a year from now, we find ourselves mired in a debate over 'Who lost Russian democracy?' "
There still seemed to be, though, a large gap between the historical task that President Bush outlined and Washington's contribution, which many experts say must quickly go beyond humanitarian aid into the more far-reaching economic assistance, like a multibillion-dollar currency stabilization fund of the sort used to underpin Poland's move to free markets.
 
Producing Work Plans
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who suggested the conference in a last-minute addition to a foreign-policy speech, said in his opening remarks that the ministers should confine themselves to trying to reach two immediate goals, neither of which have been fully explained yet to reporters or the public.
First, five working groups have been established to coordinate assistance in the areas of medicine, food, energy, housing and technical advice. Those groups, which are each chaired by two different countries, "should produce work plans -- documents that the working group co-chairs and the other participants can use as guides for action," said Mr. Baker.
As an example of the sort of working coordination, he pointed out that last month German milk powder was shipped via Canadian planes to Russia.
Second, he said, "We must identify appropriate follow-up mechanisms to insure that coordination will continue into the immediate future."
In that regard, the ministers agreed today to meet in Lisbon in the first half of 1992 to follow up on what has been organized at this meeting, and to invite Russia and the other republics to attend as well.
He was more restrained in discussing Japan's "important contributions," while adding "now other nations in the Far East, the Middle East and Latin America should commit their expertise, their resources to assure the success of reform."
But Japan's Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, told his colleagues that European requests for a huge increase in Japanese aid to the former Soviet Union were not possible right now, according to Japanese officials.
Mr. Watanabe told the Germans, for instance, that while they have signed a peace treaty with the Soviet republics, Japan is still seeking the return of Pacific islands occupied by the Soviets during the war.

HEADLINE: U.S. CONSIDERS MOVE TO CUT MULTIPLE-WARHEAD MISSILES, CORE OF THE NUCLEAR FORCE

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
In preparation for President Bush's State of the Union address next week, the White House and the Pentagon are considering plans to sharply reduce or eliminate long-range nuclear missiles with more than one warhead, Administration officials said today.
Some of the cuts, most likely in American land-based multiple-warhead missiles, would be made without conditions, while others would hinge on the response of the four former Soviet republics with long-range nuclear weapons. These republics, which operate under a unified command, are Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. 
 Several senior Administration officials said the plan to be presented was still being refined but it was expected that Mr. Bush would be able to announce the broad proposal in the State of the Union speech, which he will deliver on Tuesday. The White House refused to comment today.
 
Obstacle to Arms Control
 Multiple-warhead missiles, introduced in the early 1970's, have been the core of both the American and the Soviet long-range nuclear forces, and at the time they were introduced, were considered the greatest obstacle to arms reduction efforts. Thus, their elimination or reduction now would be a significant step in controlling the growth of nuclear arsenals. This idea, which is not new, has received new impetus from the recent collapse of the Soviet Union and its military power.
These missiles carry as many as 10 warheads each. The weapons, known as Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicles, or by the acronym MIRV's, were extremely difficult to keep track of with normal surveillance techniques.
 
Reliance on Submarines
 The multiple warheads were placed on missiles in underground silos or on missiles carried aboard nuclear-powered submarines. They could hit as many targets as there were warheads, and were considered extremely threatening because an all-out first strike using such weapons could, in theory, destroy or severely damage all or most of a country's land-based missiles and prevent it from retaliating.
This forced both of the superpowers to use increasing numbers of submarines as a retaliatory force at sea, one more likely to be safe from attack.
Among the proposals now under consideration are removing some or all long-range ground-based missiles with multiple warheads, either eliminating them or replacing them with single-warhead missiles. This would include the Minuteman 3 and MX missiles. In addition, the Administration for the first time is considering cuts in the number of warheads on submarine-based missiles, which have been considered untouchable, and constraints on D-5 missiles, the Navy's most advanced.
The plans go beyond earlier proposals by President Bush, who said in September that reductions in land-based, long-range missiles with multiple warheads would require negotiations. Specific limits on submarine-based warheads were not even considered at the time.
The reductions would represent a further recognition by the Administration that large nuclear arsenals are no longer needed and that Washington's strategic goals are better served by encouraging the former Soviet republics to curtail their most threatening class of nuclear weapons -- silo-based SS-18's and SS-24's.
Senior officials said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney discussed the plan with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and with Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, last weekend and that the three top advisers agreed on broad outlines of the proposal. The officials said that arms-control specialists at the Pentagon were fine-tuning the details on the plan this week before sending it to the White House for final approval.
The Bush Administration has often operated in this fashion, developing new initiatives among a small group of senior officials in tight secrecy, and then announcing them with great public fanfare to maximize the public relations value of the proposal.
The Administration's hope is that the former Soviet republics with long-range nuclear weapons would respond in kind to a pledge by Washington to cut long-range multiple-warhead missiles in silos. If the republics embraced reciprocal land-based cuts, the United States may be prepared to pare warheads and halt weapons-modernization plans for the strategic submarine fleet.
The American cuts could be reversed if the republics snubbed the offer, but given their pressing need for Western economic assistance, Administration officials believe that the timing is right to coax broader nuclear-arms cuts.
Mr. Bush tried the same approach in September when he unilaterally took American long-range bombers off 24-hour alert and ordered the elimination of all short-range nuclear weapons on land and at sea in Europe and Asia.
A week later, the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, matched Mr. Bush's initiative and announced that his Government would exceed the requirements of the latest strategic arms treaty, pledging to further cut the number of Soviet strategic warheads.
It was unclear today whether President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia or any other leaders of the new Commonwealth of Independent States have been consulted about the plan, or have told Washington whether they would reciprocate with their own cuts.
 
Trip to Ex-Soviet Lands
 The Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, Reginald Bartholomew, was to return Thursday from a weeklong trip to the former Soviet republics, where he was to discuss Mr. Bush's September proposal as well as other arms-control agreements negotiated with Mr. Gorbachev's Government.
An Administration official said that some of the ideas under consideration were presented to the Russians on Mr. Bartholomew's trip, and not all the responses were deemed encouraging by American officials.
State Department officials said today that in recent months the United States had received mixed signals from republic officials on deeper reductions in long-range, multiple-warhead missiles. Some of Mr. Yeltsin's advisers had embraced the idea and discussed making overall cuts deeper than Mr. Gorbachev proposed.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, said in an article in the newspaper Izvestia on Jan. 2 that the aim of Russian diplomacy was "to achieve radical reductions in nuclear weapons and curtail the arms race."
Some high-ranking Russian military officers, however, are said to be resisting the plan because it would cut what has been the pride of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal.
 
Cuts Under Treaty
 Reciprocal reductions would likely remove more than 2,000 long-range nuclear weapons from the American and former Soviet arsenals, in addition to roughly similar cuts achieved under the arms treaty Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev signed last summer.
American weapons susceptible to cuts under the plan being considered are the 500 Minuteman-3 missiles, with three warheads each, and 50 MX missiles, with 10 warheads each.
By the end of this decade, the Navy plans to have 18 Trident submarines, each of which carries 24 missiles with 192 warheads. The Navy now has 12 Trident submarines, but only 4 are equipped with the most modern missiles and warheads.
Pentagon and other Administration officials said Mr. Bush would also accelerate the scheduled retirement of several older nuclear weapons, including Minuteman 2 long-range missiles and Poseidon submarines, and perhaps cancel a single-warhead missile in development, the Midgetman.
Combined with cuts in other military programs that the President is expected to outline in his address, the nuclear arms reductions could also serve the political purpose of blunting calls from Democrats in Congress to make deeper reductions in Pentagon spending.

HEADLINE: U.S. Discloses Tougher Rules To Revamp Treasury Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
The Treasury will intervene in the Government securities market whenever prices are distorted by a shortage of securities, whether a result of market forces or market manipulation, the three agencies that regulate the market said today.
The new policy for the $2.2 trillion market, where the Government borrows the money for its operations, is the most drastic item in a package of new rules, procedures and legislative changes put together by the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve in the wake of the illegal bidding scandal involving Salomon Brothers that was disclosed in August. 
 The package announced today includes some immediate policy changes, some that will take time to develop and others that require legislation to put in place. These are the main points:
*The auction market will quickly be opened up well beyond the tight-knit group of 38 primary dealers, which included Salomon, that have dominated the market. This rule change will apparently diminish the primary dealers' role and status, but no one could say immediately by how much.
*An open bidding process, in contrast to the secret bidding done now, would be created in early 1993 for Treasury auctions, diminishing the opportunities for market manipulation.
*A surveillance process to be refined over time will coordinate the resources of the three regulatory agencies. Other regulatory initiatives, like the collecting of data and sales practices for traders, are still in dispute or discussion among the three agencies.
*For the first time, the rules for Treasury auctions have been codified.
 
Intervention Would Be Rare
 Treasury officials, who said they would intervene in the market by either selling or lending enough securities to end a "squeeze," said they would resort to this cure only rarely. But they were clear that they wanted to convince market participants that significant squeezes, like the one that Salomon Brothers was involved in last May, will not be permitted to take place.
A squeeze occurs when a shortage of any security, either because of market forces or an attempt to corner the market, forces some traders to pay distorted prices. In the May auction of two-year Treasury notes, Salomon Brothers, through its own bids or those of its customers, held more than 90 percent of the auction.
Combined with regulatory changes already ordered in the last several months, the measures announced today would mean vast change in the Government securities market, though the effect will take months to sort out.
Immediate Wall Street reaction to the report was cautious, with most market participants saying they wanted to see more details before they could assess what the changes would mean to the market. There was widespread support from many quarters for the regulators' move to clarify and codify the market rules. But Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, complained that the new rules did not go far enough in monitoring market activity.
 
Public Confidence Shaken
 When the Salomon scandal came to light, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said that the illegal bidding, which led to the resignation of the firm's top management, did not mean the world's confidence in the market should be shaken. That view was reflected in today's report.
"The agencies do not believe that the Government securities market is flawed or broken in any fundamental economic sense," the report said. "However, serious problems have arisen, and these problems suggest that various aspects of the efficient operation and regulation of this marketplace can be improved."
Referring to Salomon Brothers' illegal bidding and to two squeezes in 1991 that forced many traders to pay millions in higher prices, the report added, "Taken together, these events threatened the public's confidence in this crucial marketplace, which could ultimately result in higher costs for taxpayers in financing the national debt."
The Treasury securities market, in which the Government raised $1.7 trillion in the 1991 fiscal year, is central to the Government's daily operation, providing money to cover the budget deficit and the national debt. It also affects the economy here and abroad by acting as a benchmark for interest rates. Even the smallest disruption in the market or doubt about the market's integrity can raise interest rates and cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
The report does not make new judgments about Salomon's conduct or mention any penalties. The decision on punishment will come after the conclusion of investigations now under way by the S.E.C. and the Justice Department. But the report does note that under one new rule, a firm that pleads guilty or no contest to a felony faces suspension as a primary dealer. The newly codified Treasury rules mention no specific punishment, like suspension, for such a felony, but officials said they would take appropriate action in Salomon's case.
 
Decisions Still Pending
 Many aspects of the plan remain to be worked out. While intervention could take place immediately, a new bidding system will not be possible until early in 1993, when the Treasury system is computerized. And on some issues, like sales practice rules and audit trails for trading in the market, the regulators are divided.
William Heyman, director of the S.E.C.'s division of market regulation, acknowledged that the differences that reflect the institutional biases of the agencies "were tough issues before and they probably will continue to be tough issues."
Jerome Powell, the Assistant Secretary for domestic finance, said at a briefing that the intervention policy was "a better way to deal with a prolonged market squeeze than laying on more regulatory procedures." Mr. Powell said this intervention would be used only on "very few and rare occasions," adding, "We are not intending to micromanage" the market. But he said the May squeeze was an example of an opportunity for intervention.
 
Subcommittee to Meet
 Mr. Powell is one of several regulators who will testify at a Senate securities subcommittee hearing on the report on Thursday. The Treasury is considering several ways to intervene. The Treasury apparently would prefer to lend the securities to investors who are squeezed rather than selling them outright. But authority to lend the securities would require new legislation.
Some dealers in the Treasury market have said the uncertainty created by this threat could raise the cost of borrowing. But Mr. Powell argued that this would not be the case.
Under the present system for Treasury auctions, bids are on paper and sealed and the bidders get the rate they bid, so some can bid a higher interest rate than others in the same auction.
The new system will be like an art auction. It will be open and all the securities will be awarded at one interest rate. Mr. Powell said the new system, combined with the threat of intervention, "reduces the possibility and incentives for colluding."
 
Mechanics of the Auction
 The Treasury will begin the auction at an interest rate a little over the expected level and should get far more bids than needed to sell the securities. It will keep moving the interest rate lower, which means the Government pays less, in steps until the total of bids just falls short of what is required. The interest rate paid is set just above the lowest level.
For example, the auction can begin at a rate of 8.03 percent and be oversubscribed down to 8.00 percent. At 7.99 percent it is undersubscribed. The rate is set at 8.00 percent. All those who bid at 7.99 percent get a full share of their bids and those who bid at 8.00 percent get a pro-rated share.
For primary dealers, the Federal Reserve has dropped its requirement that they handle 1 percent of all the customer trades in the secondary market. And the Fed had dropped its direct surveillance of primary dealers in favor of broader market surveillance. This fall, the Government already moved to attract other bidders besides primary dealers to the auctions by allowing non-primary dealers to submit bids for customers.
But while the report says the Fed wants to get rid of the impression that primary dealers have a special status, Fed officials could not say what will happen from here.
"I would expect there to be more primary dealers," said Peter Sternlight, executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But he could not say what the new mix of primary dealers, now 38, and non-primary dealers might be and whether the primary dealers would really have a lesser status. There are now about 1,650 other dealers in the market.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Chief Says Threat By Ex-Soviets Is Small

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
In an unusual public review of global threats to American security, two intelligence chiefs testified today that the countries of the former Soviet Union have sharply cut their military spending and have lost the will -- and much of the ability -- to attack the United States.
One of the officials, Lieut. Gen. James R. Clapper Jr., Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's intelligence arm, also reported that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons and suggested that it would be able to make them in a few years. 
 In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Clapper said the Russian federation's military procurement for the first quarter of 1992 "appears to have been cut by about 80 percent," reflecting reductions in virtually all classes of equipment. In previous briefings, intelligence officials have said there was no clear evidence of a slowdown in procurement.
The testimony by General Clapper and by Robert M. Gates, Director of Central Intelligence, was based on threat assessments derived from intelligence sources and not by policy considerations. What those two top officials said might increase pressure within Congress to impose greater reductions on military spending than those under consideration by President Bush for his State of the Union address on Tuesday.
 
Russian Procurement Cut: 80%
 Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, said their comments could be seen as in "a head-on collision" with Mr. Bush's military budget. He seemed stunned by General Clapper's assessment that the Russians had cut their procurement budget by 80 percent, remarking, "This statement, I must say, has caused me a bit of surprise."
Although President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and other officials have tried to limit the cutbacks in military research and development, General Clapper said, spending in that area may fall as much as 30 percent from last year.
"I see virtually no likelihood or premeditated Russian or commonwealth military aggression against the U.S. and its allies," he said. "The intentions of the new commonwealth states toward the West have clearly changed, and overall, the military capabilities of Russia and the successor states are in profound decline."
His assessment about a much-reduced conventional or nuclear threat from the countries that make up the Commonwealth of Independent States was echoed by Mr. Gates, who told the committee, "The threat to the United States of deliberate attack from that quarter has all but disappeared for the foreseeable future."
The C.I.A. chief cited the elimination of a class of submarines and of SS-11 and SS-17 missiles, cutbacks in the modernization of nuclear forces, the dismantling of the Blackjack bomber program, and, for the first time in decades, the lack of production of a new ballistic-missile submarine.
Asked about Mr. Yelstin's survival prospects, he replied: "I think that the chances are good that he will remain in power. I think if something should happen to him, or if for some reason the commonwealth should not survive, then the prognosis would be much more pessimistic."
But during his prepared statement, Mr. Gates said, "If Yeltsin's reforms have not put affordable goods on the shelves by spring, his political position, despite the large reservoir of public support for him, will diminish, as will his ability to push ahead with economic reform."
General Clapper described a "once privileged" military apparatus that was in chaos with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a force "under extraordinary stress."
The Defense Intelligence Agency chief was also asked about the Persian Gulf region. He said that despite the grueling, eight-year Iran-Iraq war and Iraq's military defeat by the American-led coalition last year, those two gulf nations are still engaged in a struggle for hegemony over the region, one "in which war is a distinct possibility."
Speaking of the Government of President Saddam Hussein, he said that without economic sanctions and an intrusive inspection regimen, it would develop "a deliverable nuclear weapon in a few years, and certainly at the latest, by the end of the decade."
Asked by Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia and chairman of the committee, to compare Iran's capability to that of Iraq, General Clapper replied, "The Iranians are interested as well, and I think we are confronted with that specter, at least within the same time frame."

HEADLINE: Arica Journal;
Cocaine Invades Chile, Scorning the Land Mines

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARICA, Chile

 BODY:
After two hours of driving along desert roads, trekking through vaulting canyons and climbing rock embankments, Antonio Cubillo and his group of seven narcotics agents came to a small emerald-green valley. On one side, almost out of view, was a crude hut with walls made of mud blocks. A grimy sheepskin lay on the dirt floor. Greasy pots and pans were stacked under a piece of tin, evidence of recent use.
The team confirmed that this was a stopping point for Bolivian Indians transporting cocaine to Chile, just the most recent sign of a disturbing trend in this northern border town. 
 Isolated from the rest of the country by desert and close to hundreds of miles of uncontrolled border with Peru and Bolivia, Arica has become one of the newest and perhaps easiest transit routes for refined and unrefined cocaine intended for the United States and Europe.
"Northern Chile is a paradise for drug runners," Commissioner Cubillo said, struggling up a rock siding. From here, he said, the cocaine is carried by car to southern Chile for refining and then shipped to European and American markets.
 
Shining Path Stays Away
 Arica illustrates how hard it is for Chile, often considered the showcase of South America because of its open and thriving economy, to cope with two neighbors that have chronic problems with poverty, drugs and terrorism.
Police officials say that so far the Shining Path, the Maoist group in Peru, has not begun attacks in Chile, though it has distributed literature and painted revolutionary slogans on buildings in Tacna, Peru, a city 20 miles north of here.
But they concede there is so little control over the border that the only thing limiting such incursions are the rigors of the desert.
Thousands of illegal immigrants vie for jobs in the area, but the biggest problem produced by the lack of border controls is the unhindered drug trade.
While most of the cocaine leaves the region, much of it stays in Arica, creating the highest addiction rate by far in the country. The preferred drug of local youths is cocaine base paste, an unrefined product similar to crack. Every night in the poor sections of this city of 170,000 people, as many as 11,000 youths smoke monos, or monkeys, cigarettes made of cocaine paste and tobacco.
More disturbing for the rest of the country is that in the last few years Chile has become a vital link in the world cocaine business. United States Customs agents recently intercepted a ship in the Carribbean carrying more than a ton of cocaine. The 28 crew members were Chilean. The ship, under a different name, had left Valparaiso, Chile's main port, only weeks before.
Other elements have contributed to Chile's growing role in narcotics smuggling. In the last two years, the pressure that the Colombian Government has put on drug cartels has forced them to find transit routes in the southern part of Latin America.
Chile is also one of the easiest countries in which to launder money. The law permits foreigners to enter with millions of dollars in cash, declare it to customs officials, and the next day make huge bank deposits without further investigation.
But primarily it is the ease of entry across the border, which has at least 250 established crossing points, with only 7 controlled by immigration police, that has attracted such attention from drug dealers.
Ten miles north of Arica is the Peruvian border, which is marked only by a white pole every 1,000 yards. In a survey of the flat terrain, Lieut. Walter M. Lopez of Chile's antidrug force noted footprints from the night before crossing into Chile.
Two people had also just crossed from Chile into Peru walking along railroad tracks some 800 yards away. "We can't doing anything because they're already in Peru," he said.
The only impediment is that the army has extensively mined the area. But even that has not stopped the drug traffic.
"The drug dealers often send unsuspecting carriers into the minefields to find out just where it is mined," Lieutenant Lopez said. "After a few deaths they have created a path through."
Police officials struggle to control the heavily monitored Chacalluta crossing point. "We have 8,000 to 12,000 people crossing a day," said Commissioner Arturo Perez, chief of the border police. "The preferred mode of transit is in very small quantities, one to three grams, which is very hard to detect."
The border with Bolivia is not much different. In 200 miles, there are only four control points. Aymara Indians, accustomed to the exhausting altitudes of 12,000 to 14,000 feet, are the most efficient carriers and can outrun any law officer. They cross the altiplano by night on foot, when temperatures dip to 20 degrees, with a sack of up to 20 pounds of cocaine base paste. What does not move south stays in the local market and is sold at bargain prices. Refined cocaine goes for $3 a gram, compared with almost $30 in Santiago.
 
Seeking Answers in U.S.
 Mayor Pedro Lagos of Arica has spent two months in the United States studying what cities there do about rising drug addiction. And he is concerned that traffickers may realize it is easier and cheaper to trade in base paste and leave the refining process to the consuming countries.
"Look, you need only a very crude process to produce base paste," he said. "Also, it's more addictive and cheaper. This could be a dangerous drug for the American market."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Bombardier Agrees to Buy De Havilland From Boeing

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan 22

 BODY:
Bombardier Inc., the Montreal-based transportation conglomerate, said today that it would acquire the Boeing Company's ailing de Havilland division, a maker of commuter jets and Ontario's largest industrial employer. In the complex deal, valued at nearly $600 million, public authorities will provide nearly $500 million in subsidies.
The Seattle-based Boeing, which paid $155 million for de Havilland in 1986 and has experienced losses totaling nearly $1 billion, will walk away with $100 million. 
 Bombardier, with $3 billion in annual sales, will pay $51 million for 51 percent of de Havilland's shares and the Ontario government $49 million for the remaining stock. After four years, Bombardier can buy Ontario's shares.
The accord was announced before cheering workers at de Havilland's sprawling plant in Downsview, Ontario, by Bombardier's chairman, Laurent Beaudoin; Premier Bob Rae of Ontario, and the federal Industry Minister, Michael H. Wilson. Workers booed when Boeing's name was mentioned. The plant, with 3,760 employees, down from 6,200 in 1989, is about 20 miles north of Toronto.
"By combining their resources, skills and experience and building on their united strengths," Mr. Beaudoin told the workers, "Bombardier and de Havilland can look forward to achieving a strategic position in the aerospace industry."
The marriage would add two commuter jet lines -- the Dash 8-100 and Dash 8-300 series, seating 37 to 40 passengers each -- to Bombardier's extensive range of turboprops and jets, making the company one of the most varied aerospace manufacturers in the world.
Bombardier, also the leading rail equipment manufacturer in North America, produces a somewhat larger jet that carries 50 to 56 passengers, known as the Canadair Regional Jet. The company also makes Ski-Doo snowmobiles and cars for the New York City subway system.
Still, some analysts wondered how Bombardier might succeed with de Havilland, when Boeing experienced such dramatic failure.
Murray Grossner of Burns, Fry Ltd. said the acquisition would "increase the risk profile" for Bombardier. He said the Dash 8 and the Canadair were competitive, not complementary, aircraft.
Yet Bombardier has confounded critics in the past. It has compiled an enviable record of buying troubled companies with innovative technology at bargain-basement prices, usually with heavy Government subsidies, and then relying on its design, management and sales skills to alchemize the dross into gold.
Since the mid-1980's, Bombardier has picked up three other aircraft companies -- Canadair in Quebec, the Learjet Corporation in Kansas and Short Brothers P.L.C. in Northern Ireland. While their total cost was $250 million, they produced sales of $1.5 billion in 1990 alone.
 
64 Years, Many Owners
 The de Havilland company, which has changed hands several times in its 64 years, bears one of the legendary names in Canadian aviation. Its Fox Moths, Otters and Beavers helped open the north, while its plywood-bodied Mosquito bombers fought in World War II.
The company was acquired by the Hawker Siddeley Group P.L.C. in the early 1960's, and when the British engineering company wound down the operation in the 1970's, Ottawa stepped in to preserve jobs and an aerospace industry base.
 
Boeing Match in '86
 During a privatization drive in 1986 by the Tory Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, the Boeing match was made. But Boeing, which had labor problems at Downsview, later concluded that commuter aircraft did not fit into its core line of wide-bodied long-range aircraft and had had the Canadian company on the block for 18 months.
De Havilland almost returned to European ownership when a consortium, Aerospatiale S.A. of France and Alenia S.p.A. of Italy, made an offer, but the executive body of the European Community blocked the transaction in October because the consortium could become too powerful in the commuter aircraft market.
 
The Financial Breakdown
 The Canadian Government's support for the Bombardier transaction includes $260 million from Ontario and $230 million from the federal Government.
This is Bombardier's second major acquisition in Ontario in recent months. Late last month, it acquired, also with heavy subsidies, UTDC Inc., a manufacturer of mass-transit rail cars. The company, with sales of $250 million a year, has 860 workers in Thunder Bay and Kinston.
While Mr. Beaudoin, Bombardier's president, says he expects to make money from the deals, the closer commercial links between Quebec and Ontario represented by the transactions also reflect his opposition to Quebec separatism. In the Constitutional debate over Canada's future, he has contended that union is critical to the nation's economic health.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says It Foiled Japan on Beef Sale

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 22

 BODY:
What Japanese trade negotiators giveth, can Japanese bureaucrats taketh away?
This was the question today as American officials described what they said was a recent clandestine attempt by low-level Japanese bureaucrats to subvert a 1988 trade accord allowing unlimited imports of American beef into Japan. The Americans said they blocked the attempt this week. 
 A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries denied the American accusation, saying there was never any attempt to undermine the accord. "It's very strange for anyone to criticize us that way," added Minoru Suzuki, a senior staff member at the ministry.
Whoever is right, the disagreement, which came to light today, offered another indication of the subtle nature of trade disputes with Japan and the powerful role of anonymous bureaucrats in managing the Japanese economy. It was also yet another reflection of rising tensions over trade generally.
 
A Triumph in 1988
 At the center of the latest dispute was a 1988 agreement in which Japan promised under American pressure to drop its quotas on foreign imports of beef and oranges. That agreement was one of the early triumphs of American trade negotiators.
Although tariffs, which are only being phased out, are still in effect, beef prices have started to fall, and on Monday Japan's leading economic newspaper, The Japan Economic Journal, reported that low-level bureaucrats had begun issuing "guidance" to leading trading companies to reduce imports of beef. The tiny article caused Americans to cry foul.
A spokesman for the United States Embassy, William Morgan, said an American inquiry found that "some lower-level bureaucrats in the ministry did approach several beef importers and try to jawbone them into reducing the quantity of imports."
 
'Small Isolated Incident'
 He said that the trading companies had ignored the request, but that when the embassy raised the issue at senior levels in the ministry, senior officials were unaware of what had happened and promised it would cease. "We're satisfied this was a small isolated incident and that it does not reflect ministry policy," Mr. Morgan said. "We consider the issue to be closed."
Officials at the Agriculture Ministry charge heatedly that such talk is unfair. They said they never issued any direct "guidance" to any importers to curb imports of American or other foreign beef. Rather they merely "commented" to the importers on the market situation for beef.
"We are in a position to know the supply and demand situation of the market," said Mr. Suzuki, who is a staff officer in the meat and eggs division of the ministry. "If asked, we would tell anybody that it's clear that the market is in an oversupply situation right now."
 
A Comment or a Command
 He added: "We are entitled to comment that if the price of beef continues to fall, everybody will be unhappy, and to say that it is important to balance imports with demand. It's just a comment that cannot be enforced. We certainly can comment in such a situation."
Mr. Suzuki said he and his colleagues were incensed that anyone would interpret such "comments" as an attempt by the ministry to suppress imports.
Many analysts of the economic scene in Japan say ministries rarely give hard and fast directives, but usually convey their opinions through informal "guidance" or "comments.
A senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said recently that Japan would never tell automobile companies to comply with ceilings on exports, but that the ministry "monitors" whether such ceilings are adhered to.
Asked what was meant by "monitor," this official paused and said, "It means: We watch!" And with that he widened his eyes, leaped forward and raised both arms as if in attack, conveying the view that "watching" in Japan is often as good as enforcing when a ministry is considered all powerful.

HEADLINE: Plan by U.S. Reignites the Debate That Started With the Salomon Scandal

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
The far-reaching changes outlined today for the vast Treasury securities market have reignited debate over how to police this crucial marketplace, which is where the Government finances its debt and where investors around the world transact billions of dollars of business each day.
One influential lawmaker denounced the regulators' revisions as inadequate, and called for tougher measures. Many of those who participate in the market expressed intense concern that the changes, if put in place clumsily, could backfire and drive up the Government's borrowing costs. 
 But on Wall Street and in Washington, there was widesrpead acknowledgment that the report represents a watershed -- a shift away from the informal, behind-the-scenes regulation that has characterized the Treasury market through most of its life and a move toward a more rational, codified approach that scholars say is demanded by the modern market's size and importance.
"In the life of the Treasury market, these are very dramatic changes," said Jerome H. Powell, Assistant Treasury Secretary for domestic finance, after the release of the formal report detailing many of these administrative and regulatory changes.
Stephen G. Thieke, president of J. P. Morgan Securities in New York and chairman of the Public Securities Association committee set up after Salomon Brothers' bidding violations in the Treasury securities market came to light in the summer, agreed that "the idea of clarifying and codifying the rules" that govern the market "is one of the big positives" in the package of new and proposed changes.
With the Salomon disclosures, debate started in the markets and in the Government over who should regulate the marketplace, and how aggressively that policing should be carried out.
The recommendations announced today were jointly prepared by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve System and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Changes Already in Place
 One proposal, still under study by the Treasury, would change the basic form of the bidding for the Government's debt. Others, already being put in place, call for the Treasury to sell additional securities whenever an acute shortage of one issue distorts prices and for the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which conducts debt auctions for the Treasury, to spot-check the validity of customer bids and confirm that large bidders actually received the securities. In addition, the new rules call for the New York Fed to redefine the role that the largest Government securities dealers, called primary dealers, play in the market.
With respect to the Treasury's willingness to sell additional securities, Mr. Thieke was more cautious in his response. The idea has potential, he said. "But that is a part of the report where we really need further clarification of how it would be implemented."
More controversial, Mr. Thieke said, will be the suggested changes in the primary-dealer system and in the auction method.
 
Lawmaker Is Disappointed
 The report also drew fire for what it did not include. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, said today that he was disappointed that the three regulators could not agree on the need for improved pricing information and closer tracking of the individual transactions and investor holdings in the marketplace.
"The regulators seem to be taking a see-no-evil, hear-no-evil approach to monitoring the market position of large traders," Mr. Markey said. "The report's legislative recommendations make it clear that Treasury and the Fed remain reluctant regulators."
Eugene Rotberg, the former vice president and treasurer of the World Bank, sees the opposite danger: The package of rule changes goes too far and will overregulate the market on which the Government relies to finance its debt at the lowest possible cost.
 
Possible Cost to Taxpayer
 "I just don't see how this package can work," Mr. Rotberg said. "The people I know on the Street confirm that this will increase the uncertainty to be borne by the market, and that will inevitably increase the costs to be borne by the taxpayers."
Not everyone agreed. Merton H. Miller, a winner of the the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science and professor of finance at the University of Chicago, applauded the Treasury's intention to consider a new auction process that would sell all the proffered securities at a single price, rather than the current method in which bids are filled at varying prices until the full auction amount is spoken for. "This is a perfectly standard method, and there is simply no reason why it should drive up the borrowing costs," he said.
And John Burrs, president of the CRT Government Securities Corporation in New York, said that any uneasiness in the market was likely to be short-lived. "Any change in the bidding process for a period of time will discourage people until they get used to it," he said. As for the Treasury's willingness to sell additional debt if a shortage develops, he noted that such intervention would occur after an issue is auctioned. Since it is the auction price that determines the price to the taxpayers, he said, "I don't see at all that it would necessarily raise the price to taxpayers."
In many of the proposals and new procedures disclosed today, including the gradual redefinition of the role of large primary dealers, the Treasury is just catching up, in Professor Miller's view. "Their old rules didn't quite require you to use a quill pen, but they might as well have," he said. "The primary-dealer system may have been O.K. back in the 20's or even as late as the 50's, but you just do not need that kind of a market any more."
Joseph Grundfest, associate professor of law at Stanford and a former commissioner of the S.E.C., said today's report from the three regulatory agencies "shows that their heart is in the right place" with respect to developing a more rational framework for monitoring the Treasury market. "But there needs to be a careful assessment of the details associated with these ideas," he warned, echoing a common refrain from the marketplace, "because in the real world, success and failure lies not in the broad brush strokes, but in the details."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leader to Back Benefits Extension

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
In the first test of the politics of the recession of the new Congressional session, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, is expected to testify Thursday in favor of another extension of unemployment insurance benefits.
But Mr. Michel, who played a major role two months ago in getting the White House to compromise with Democrats on extensions of up to 20 weeks of benefits for people already out of work for at least half a year, is expected to tell a subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee that ways must be found to pay for the additional benefits instead of declaring a budget emergency that would permit them simply to increase the Federal deficit. 
 That issue has delayed extra benefits in the past; in November, various budgetary accounting devices were used to justify an extension.
The Washington Post, quoting unnamed Adminstration officials, said tonight that the President would no longer oppose a further extension of unemployment benefits and could propose one himself. But an undecided issue, an official was quoted as saying, was how pay for the extension.

HEADLINE: Health Insurance Bill Is Approved by Senate Panel

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
In a party-line vote that reflected the intensifying partisanship of the Presidential campaign season, a Senate committee today approved an overhaul of the nation's health insurance system to cover all Americans.
The bill faces an uncertain future on the floor of the Senate, where Republicans and a handful of conservative Democrats are preparing to argue that its requirement that businesses provide health insurance for employees will unfairly hurt small companies. But whatever its prospects for passage, the bill will sharpen an issue that Democrats feel is a point of vulnerability for President Bush, who is expected to propose more modest adjustments to the current insurance system in the State of the Union Message next week. 
 In the debate that preceded the 10-7 vote, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Labor and Human Relations Committee, scolded the Bush Administration, saying it had sat on its hands while health costs skyrocketed and businesses and individuals were forced to drop their coverage. "Worst of all," he said, "the vast majority of insured Americans fear with good reason that the health insurance they have today will not be there to protect them tomorrow."
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, complained that the bill would expand Government regulations but fail to contain costs. "As Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are abandoning a centrally managed economy," he said, "here we are ready to adopt anti-market models."
The bill would phase in requirements that businesses either provide their employees with private insurance or pay a 7.5 percent payroll tax into a public supplemental insurance fund called AmeriCare that would cover both employees and the unemployed.
The legislation seeks to reduce health care costs by developing guidelines that would help insurers decide what treatments should be reimbursed. One of the most debated features of the bill would allow states to opt for a tax-supported universal health insurance system that critics contend would lead to a national health insurance program like those in Canada and Western Europe.
Democrats say the bill has little chance for enactment this year, although they add that it will form the basis for the party's position in the coming Presidential election.
Labor Secretary Lynn Martin and the Health and Human Services Secretary, Louis W. Sullivan, have said they would urge Mr. Bush to veto the bill if Congress approves it.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Cancels Huge Contract With a Japanese Maker of Rail Cars

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22

 BODY:
In the most dramatic economic backlash yet against Japan, Los Angeles County today canceled a contract to buy $122 million worth of rail transit cars from a Japanese company.
At the same time, in a move that was likely to be as controversial as the original award of the contract to the Japanese company, the Sumitomo Corporation, the county began to carve out its own industrial policy. 
 Transportation officials voted to construct their own $49 million factory to build the cars and keep the jobs in Los Angeles, with the hope of making Southern California the national center of a reinvigorated American mass transit industry, producing 600 rail cars and 6,000 buses over the next 30 years.
The action came after weeks of emotional political pressure seldom seen in Los Angeles.
It was sparked by a vote by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission on Dec. 18, on the eve of President Bush's trip to Asia to stimulate more American jobs, to award the contract for 87 rail cars to the Sumitomo Corporation of America and reject a bid that was $5 million less from an American company, Morrison Knudsen of Boise, Idaho, the only American maker of rail cars.
The vote was 7 to 3, with one abstention, in favor of Sumitomo, which the commission said was better equipped to perform the contract.
But retreating under withering political attack, the 11-member commission unanimously rescinded the contract today at the county Hall of Administration in a room filled with about 200 angry unionized aerospace and automobile workers, who have suffered heavy layoffs from the recession and reductions in military spending.
The commission reopened the bidding under new rules that would require local manufacture of the trains and require that 60 percent of the content and assembly operations be of local or domestic origin if the State Legislature approves.
The commission is overseeing the construction of a 300-mile mass transit system in the nation's largest county, which is notorious for its traffic congestion.
The motion to cancel the contract was made by County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, new chairman of the commission, who had originally voted for Sumitomo.
Minutes after the vote, Kenji Miyahara, president of Sumitomo Corporation of America, issued a statement complaining that the contract was canceled for "nonbusiness-related reasons" and saying the company was "deeply disappointed" by the action. "Sumitomo acted responsibly in following all the requirements of our customer," he said.
"We were selected by the commission on our merits because of our experience, technical superiority, and past history of delivering world-class products on schedule within budget," Mr. Miyahara said.
The statement went on to say that Sumitomo employed more than 1,000 people in the United States, had been active in Los Angeles for 30 years and would "continue to make a contribution to the health of its economy."
 
An Issue Brought Home
 The entire episode brought home the potency of the economic issue in this election year.
"This might crystallize in political leaders' mind that part of their job is keeping the economy in their region vital," said Catherine O'Neill, co-founder of Citizens for Public Transportation in the Public Interest, a group that helped focus the public outcry. "This is the largest public works project in the United States, involving $150 billion over 30 years. Maybe we can bring some industry to this area."
The commission estimated that the new proposal, parts of which would require approval by the State Legislature, would produce 4,445 jobs in the United States and 740 jobs in Los Angeles for 30 years, as against 1,750 jobs in the United States and 370 jobs in Los Angeles for three years under the Sumitomo plan that was canceled.
The issue was complicated by a local dispute over whether the cars for the new Green Line -- a 23-mile, 14-station rail line from Norwalk to El Segundo just south of Los Angeles International Airport -- should use new driverless technology.
The commission last month had approved the more costly automated machines, heavily pushed by Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, a member of the commission.
But today, over Mr. Bradley's objections, the commission also retreated from the automated plan. It authorized instead a standardized driver-run design, dubbed the "L.A. Car," that could be used on all the different rail lines in the system but permit automation. Having standardized cars with same basic body, appearance, couplers and the like, commission staff members said, would encourage the development of local suppliers of parts and components, since they could rely on a consistent technology.
Under the plan, the county would spend $49 million to equip a new factory, which it would then lease to manufacturers to build the cars. The executive director of the commission, Neil Peterson, likened this to the so called GOCO, or government-owned, contractor-operated, system used by the Federal Government for the manufacture of jet fighters and other military equipment.
 
'It Doesn't Work'
 But critics say such a system is extremely costly and subject to enormous cost overruns. William J. Agee, chairman and chief executive officer of Morrison Knudsen, which lost the original contract, testified today that he applauded the efforts to create local and domestic jobs but derided the idea of a county-owned factory.
"The concept of the public sector establishing a manufacturing business in competition with the private sector is, in my judgment and the judgment of the business community and government leaders, very expensive, very inefficient and would put the L.A.C.T.C. in a business well beyond its charter," he said. "You may be wasting the $49 million it would cost to build and start up your own plant. The Soviet Union just moved away from that kind of public ownership and operation. It doesn't work."
A commission spokesman said it could not yet be determined how much it would cost to terminate the Sumitomo contract. Sumitomo, which had built the cars for the already-operating Blue Line between Los Angeles and Long Beach, said it had already begun design and engineering work. In an 11-th hour bid to salvage the Green Line contract, Sumitomo offered Tuesday to bring in an American company, General Electric, as a "substantial participant" in the project.
The commission's action today convinced local officials that Los Angeles was leading the way in establishing a new industrial policy for America that will help lift the region out of deep recession. "What is happening here today will happen at every level of government," Joel Wachs, a Los Angeles City Council member who has been a leader in the campaign against Sumitomo, said in an interview. "This is the new paradigm of how to invest our tax dollars. This will be the shot heard 'round the world."
Earlier, he told a rally of union workers outside the county building: "This is not about Japan bashing. This is for America, this is for Los Angeles, this is for using our hard-earned tax dollars to stimulate our local economy when we need it."
Another Council member, Zev Yaroslavsky, said: "Los Angeles has the capacity to build B-1 bombers. It certainly has the capacity to do this."

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, Mourning for an Old Friend: Manufacturing Jobs

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 22

 BODY:
It may be months before the pink slips go out to the 2,400 workers and managers at the yellow-brick Pratt & Whitney plant on Main Street here, where generations of workers have built aircraft engines.
But there was a sense of sadness outside the Art Deco-era complex today, one day after Pratt & Whitney's parent company, United Technologies, announced that it would cut its work force by almost 14,000, including 6,400 at plants throughout Connecticut. 
 It was a kind of mourning for the way life used to be amid a recognition that manufacturing in America has been transformed. It is smaller now, and much of what was once done inside the Pratt & Whitney complex is now handled by subcontractors, many of them overseas.
And in Connecticut, at least, there is no greater symbol of manufacturing than United Technologies, the state's largest private employer, with 47,600 workers and factories spread across the state from Norwalk to Windsor Locks.
The situation at United Technologies is mirrored across the state. More than 100,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since 1988, when such employment peaked at 450,000.
And the worst may be still to come. With the virtual elimination of the Soviet threat, a major submarine-building contract may be reduced or canceled, taking with it 19,000 jobs in eastern Connecticut, said Dr. David Pinsky, professor emeritus of labor economics at the University of Connecticut. Most of those would be at Electric Boat in Groton.
"There's no substitute for the defense industry," Dr. Pinsky said. "The only times we've had prosperity in the last 50 years have been during wartime and big defense buildups."
Unemployment in the state was 6.9 percent in November, up from 5.3 percent a year ago. Total employment statewide is 1.6 million.
Officials at United Technologies said on Tuesday that they hoped to reduce costs by $1.1 billion a year by 1994 by eliminating jobs and closing plants.
Today, the workers grappled with the news.
They included people like William Washburn, a test operator at Pratt & Whitney, who sat in an auditorium at the headquarters of his union, Local 1746 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and waited for a presentation on early retirement.
"It had crossed my mind," Mr. Washburn, a 27-year veteran of the East Hartford plant, said of retirement, "but I hadn't really thought about it." Now, as layoffs loom, he said he has decided to think about it.
 
'Just the Beginning'
 "People are on pins and needles," said Barbara Green, a brazer who has logged 17 years at Pratt & Whitney. She said people had not been told who would be laid off, only that the company would be cutting back and that some jobs would be transferred to East Hartford from other plants in the state. "People with 25, 27 years in here are frightened," she added. "This is just the beginning."
The layoffs are expected to affect almost everyone in this area, which soared during the military buildup of the 1980's but has been deeply wounded by the recession.
"It's not just that they take a fall -- we all take a fall," said Edward Pastula, a 25-year-old East Hartford native who works as a chimney sweep. "Nobody's going to have any money to spend for work on their house, and that's going to hurt everybody."
At Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford, another United Technologies company, workers seemed relieved that not as many jobs would be cut as in other parts of the state.
"Once they heard that there are only going to be 200 jobs lost, most of the people relaxed a bit," said Lou Havanich, a flight technician from Fairfield. "But layoffs are layoffs, and somebody's going to lose work."
For many Pratt & Whitney workers, as well as the towns around the plant, building airplane engines seemed a reliable calling and one that paid quite well -- an average of $15 an hour these days.
 
Built in 1929
 The East Hartford plant was built in 1929, the year the stock market crashed. The next year, George Hagi's father opened the Hockanum Restaurant directly across from the main entrance to the plant.
"They had hundreds of workers when my father opened," Mr. Hagi recalled today as pots full of pasta with meatballs simmered on the stove behind him. "At one time they had in excess of 30,000. Now it's about 14,000."
John Harrity, a spokesman for District 91 of the machinists and aerospace workers union, which includes union locals for most of the workers at Pratt & Whitney's four Connecticut factories, said the company's cuts were to be made in white-collar as well as blue-collar jobs. If work is moved to another plant, workers have the right to move with the job, he said. The company's contract with the unions also requires six months' notice before any move, so "nothing will happen for at least six months," Mr. Harrity said.
People who are 55 years old or older and have worked 25 years or more for the company are eligible for early retirement, he said. For every early retirement, he said, one more layoff can be averted.
 
'Making a Mistake'
 "There's a lot of hurt feelings," said Tom Nestor, a materials engineer. "This kind of gives a bad outlook on the future for the younger engineers. I think they're making a mistake cutting back on defense as much as they are."
Military orders for Pratt & Whitney are down sharply, Mr. Harrity said. "They had orders for 700 engines in 1982, and this year they've got orders for 50," he said. But the company's engines have been used elsewhere, in generators, for example, and conversion to nonmilitary products could be emphasized, he added.
Overhearing the conversations between workers and striking up many of his own at his restaurant, Mr. Hagi said he detected frustration among the people who have been laid off -- an earlier round cut about 2,400 jobs last January -- and the ones who now feel threatened.
"It's almost a fatalistic attitude," he said. "When they first started the layoffs, it was a festive mood. But they don't want parties now because they realize there's nothing out there. It's hard to get another job."
The Hockanum has been suffering, too. "Normally at this time," he said, "I'd have 30 people at the bar." Only about a dozen were sitting there today, staring at the television set or their glasses of beer.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
President and G.O.P. Take Aim At Abortion on Roe Anniversary

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Preparing for a campaign in which abortion could become a powerful issue, President Bush today delivered a speech that showed no sign of flexibility in his position, and the Republican Party named a strong anti-abortion advocate as chairman of its platform committee.
One day after the Supreme Court agreed to hear a Pennsylvania case that could propel the abortion issue into the center of the Presidential campaign, Mr. Bush addressed thousands of anti-abortion demonstrators by telephone from the Oval Office and commended efforts to overturn the Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, that made abortion a constitutional right 19 years ago today. 
 In doing so, he relied on Thomas Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence as a historical justification for what he called "a righteous cause."
 
Interpreting Jefferson
 "The most compelling legacy of this nation is Jefferson's concept that all are created equal," Mr. Bush said. "It doesn't say 'born.' Equal. He says 'created.' From the moment the miracle of life occurs, human beings must cherish that life, must hold it in awe, must preserve, protect and defend it."
At the time Jefferson wrote the document, abortion was well known and legal.
As Mr. Bush spoke, the Republican Party announced that Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, a staunch opponent of legalized abortion, would head the committee that will draft the Republican Party platform for its national convention in August.
The choice of Mr. Nickles suggested that Mr. Bush and the Republican leadership were planning, at least for now, to try to head off efforts to change the party's strict anti-abortion plank at the convention.
 
Narrowing 'Big Tent'
 That could narrow the opening of the Republican Party's "big tent," the expression coined by Lee Atwater, the late chairman of the Republican National Committee, and used often by Mr. Bush to assure Republicans who support abortion rights that they have a place in the party. Those Republicans have seen an amendment to the platform as their best chance of moderating the party's position on abortion, as well as a safe way for Mr. Bush to show some compromise on the issue.
The appearance of a tough line on abortion is especially important to Mr. Bush as he faces a conservative challenge in the Feb. 18 New Hampshire primary from Patrick J. Buchanan.
Thousands of anti-abortion marchers and smaller numbers of abortion rights advocates converged on the capital for today's anniversary events. A spokesman for the United States Park Police estimated, in a figure prepared in conjunction with other police agencies, that 70,000 people took part in the demonstrations. There was no official count of the numbers on each side.
Abortion opponents projected a sense of confidence and optimism because of the court's action, and some abortion rights advocates at the rallies today said they needed to work harder, with some expressing fears about the possibility of future legal restrictions on abortions.
While the anti-abortion rally and a smaller abortion rights rally took place several blocks apart at the Capitol Mall, the parade route for the annual anti-abortion "March for Life" was lined at points with hundreds of abortion rights advocates, who at times engaged in noisy and bitter exchanges with the anti-abortion marchers.
The rallies and march dominated today's anniversary events, but some anti-abortion Operation Rescue demonstrators engaged in a second day of blockading one of the city's abortion clinics. About 140 opponents of abortion were arrested today, following Tuesday's protests in which 386 people were arrested outside two clinics.
As the impending Supreme Court ruling on a Pennsylvania law that restricts access to abortion raises the prospect of the abortion issue crystallizing this summer in the midst of an already complicated campaign, opponents and supporters of abortion rights in the Republican Party have begun staking out their positions.
 
Shaping Abortion Debate
 Today's speech could have served as a chance for the President to lay down the ground rules of the debate.
But Mr. Bush, who is uncomfortable dealing with social issues and has had a particularly anguished history with abortion, neither hardened his stand on abortion nor moved toward the increasing number of Republicans who support some legalized abortions.
Indeed, in his comments today, Mr. Bush did not even detail his position on the issue. Instead, he gave the marchers a familiar, carefully worded version of the speech he has offered each year he has been in office, including the politically necessary phrases -- like "life is a precious gift" that begins at the moment of conception -- to indicate that he supported the cause.
The President, by telephone, briefly addressed abortion opponents gathered on the muddy mall grounds, and his words brought loud applause when he vowed to continue to oppose Congressional efforts to expand Federal financing for abortion.
Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, told the rally that "the scourge of Roe v. Wade must end," adding, "And it must end because the nation that condones the slaughter of millions of innocent, helpless babies cannot and will not survive."
When the anti-abortion rally ended, the demonstrators marched toward the Capitol in a slow-moving human river that brushed past counterdemonstrators for nearly a block along Constitution Avenue.
Some anti-abortion marchers carried large color photographs of late-term aborted fetuses. One man was dressed as a doctor in red-paint spattered white coat. Many held stop-sign shaped red signs saying, "Stop Abortion."
A few on both sides smiled, but more often they flung angry chants and insults at each other.
Despite today's angry gathering of forces on the mall, Republican strategists said they did not believe that abortion could define the political campaign in the same way as economics has this year, but they said it could still become a problem for Mr. Bush.
"Individual issues like abortion are not cutting for voters in a Presidential campaign," said James Lake, an adviser to the Bush campaign. "But abortion could be a distraction. It is conceivable if the pro-choicers go off and somehow do dramatic things that cause both candidates to pay attention or if something happens on the other side. Then, if they overturn the law, that becomes an event that causes more discussion and causes it to come into focus."
Mr. Bush has carefully tailored his position on abortion since he became Ronald Reagan's running mate and dropped his more flexible position on abortion rights.
According to the White House, Mr. Bush opposes abortions except "when the life of the mother is threatened or there is rape or incest." He supports a constitutional amendment that would reverse the Roe v. Wade ruling as well as an amendment to the Constitution that would outlaw abortion, with those same exceptions.
Mr. Bush opposes use of Federal funds for abortions, with the sole exception of when the life of a mother is threatened, and has vetoed six measures that would have provided such financing.
Mr. Bush has resisted the advice of some aides who have urged him to soften his position on abortion in the face of public opinion polls showing that many Republicans support some degree of legalized abortion. In large measure this is because of one of the last pieces of advice that Mr. Atwater, his trusted political tactician, gave him before he died last year: that flip-flopping on abortion is more damaging than any strongly held position.
But it was also partly because of Mr. Bush's desire to maintain the support of Republican conservatives, a courtship that has not completely succeeded.

HEADLINE: 47th STREET JOURNAL;
A Bankrupt but Still Popular Mecca

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The leafleters were on the street corners, making that crisp snapping sound as they handed out their blue and yellow fliers as always. The elbow-to-elbow crowd at the counter was pointing and shooting point-and-shoot cameras and aiming extremely powerful binoculars at the farthest thing that they could find, which in this case was the cashier.
The day after 47th Street Photo filed for bankruptcy protection, the main store looked like business as usual. But business as usual at 47th Street Photo has never been quite like business as usual anywhere else. 
 No other store could claim 47th Street Photo's clamoring take-a-number-and-take-it-home bargain-basement atmosphere, one flight up. No other store seemed to have so much merchandise and so few displays. Other retailers showed off their stuff in glass cases, but at 47th Street Photo a customer almost had to know what he wanted before going in. And no other store seemed to have so many gadgets, from cameras to computers to compact disk players to copying machines.
It is one of those only-in-New-York-institutions, and like other only-in-New York institutions that have run into money troubles lately, it owes more than it has. 47th Street was pushed into Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code after defaulting last week on $500,000 in payments to the Transamerica Commercial Finance Corporation. In court documents, 47th Street Photo said that it owed $57 million to more than 200 creditors and that it had just $30 million in assets.
But 47th Street Photo is determined not to go the way of competitors like Crazy Eddie, whose prices were insa-a-a-a-ane, but whose stores are no more, or Newmark & Lewis, where Dick Lewis was watching as the chain filed for Chapter 11 last year. Although 47th Street Photo has closed its lower Manhattan store on Nassau Street, it is keeping its other shops open, which means that there will still be a 47th Street Photo on 45th Street, as well as on West 47th Street and on East 19th Street and in East Meadow, L.I.
"It's a New York institution, for sure," a customer, Kevin Kuschel, said. "My first camera came from here. All my cameras came from here. I ordered the first one by mail. I was 17 and I was in Florida. I thought I'd explode before it got to me. It was the best camera I ever had."
Having heard about the bankruptcy filing, some customers rushed in yesterday, just in case the floor-to-ceiling shelves began to get a bit bare, something that the store's owner insist will not happen.
"It's very hard for me to believe," said Lawrence Evans, carrying a $150 gift certificate that some friends had given him for his 60th birthday. "Any time you come in, you've got to wait like this. It's like Yogi Berra said, 'No one ever goes there because it's too busy.' They're so busy, they're going broke."
Some customers were puzzled for other reasons. "We came to this shop from Buenos Aires because somebody told me it's good quality," said Sergio Lifraini, who was looking for a camera before heading to "The Phantom of the Opera" with his wife, Silvana. "I saw about this bankruptcy on TV. What was that all about?"
What it was all about, a vice president of the store, Stuart Held, said, were the ramifications of a lien that Transamerica placed on the 47th Street Photo account last week. The two sides bargained through the weekend, but the negotiations broke down on Monday. Mr. Held said 47th Street had a "positive cash flow" and indicated that the bankruptcy filing had been good for business.
"We're busier now than we were" one day before the filing, which Mr. Held referred to as "this procedure," the way some doctors describe some surgery. "Look at all the companies that are considering this procedure, like Macy's, or have done this procedure, like Bloomingdale's," he said.
"We had a pretty good Christmas, better than we had expected," added Mr. Held, who used to work for the company that imports Nikon cameras and later bought the company that makes Omega enlargers. "January started off strong compared to last year. Remember, last year we had Desert Storm. Does this mean the recession is over? Well, people who normally go on nice long vacations are spending time with the VCR's they already have."
That means, he said, that they are not buying new camcorders.
Also in the, pardon the expression, picture as 47th Street Photo tries to rebuild is Leah Goldstein, wife of the founder, Irving. Yesterday she was talking about setting up sitting areas for VIP's and t.l.c. for customers who used to feel that the salespeople brushed them off when they were looking for an airbrush. Now Mrs. Goldstein has hostesses handing out cellophane-wrapped candy.
"I don't allow it to be called candy," Mrs. Goldstein said. "I call them 47th Street energizers, but everybody thinks we're giving them a battery."

HEADLINE: Hertz Surcharge Doesn't Pay, One Franchise Says

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YONKERS, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The $2 billion-a-year Hertz Corporation has effectively stopped doing business with customers from the Bronx. But Timothy R. Tostanoski, who runs a Hertz franchise here, can't afford to follow suit.
"The economy being what it is, I can't kiss anybody goodbye who is good business," he said. "Absolutely not." 
 While Bronx residents make up less than 1 percent of Hertz's business in New York, they represent 40 percent of Mr. Tostanoski's customers, he said. So he is not charging the $56 surcharge for Bronx residents that Hertz imposed in its company-owned outlets on Jan. 2.
Mr. Tostanoski, 35 years old, and his father Edward, 69, rent cars under the Hertz name in six locations in southern Westchester, and their outlets are more convenient to the Bronx than Hertz's outlets in Manhattan. From Co-Op City, the closest location with the Hertz name is the Tostanoskis' counter just off the New England Thruway in New Rochelle; from Riverdale, the closest are their shops in Mount Vernon and here in Yonkers. Their company, founded in 1955, is called Yonkers Drive It Yourself.
 
Pressure Tactic
 For the privilege of using the Hertz name and being tied into the company's nationwide reservation service, they pay Hertz a monthly fee of $68 per car and a cut of revenue between 1 and 2 percent.
But lately, the Tostanoskis feel as though they are in bed with an elephant. The Hertz Corporation instituted its surcharge to put pressure on the Legislature to repeal New York's "vicarious liability" law. That law makes a car rental company liable when one of its renters hits a pedestrian or another car, or even when a renter runs the car into a tree and injures a passenger. Hertz paid out $45 million in settlements over a recent three-year period.
The Tostanoskis do not like the vicarious liability law either, but they have no illusions about pressuring the Legislature. In fact, they said, if they entered the argument they would have trouble surviving. Hertz is being sued by New York City and New York State, which are seeking refunds of the surcharges and a fine of $1,000 a day per violation. The Tostanoskis said they could not afford to defend themselves against such a suit.
 
Insurance Costs Soaring
 Their company has insurance up to $1 million, but its cost is soaring. Liability insurance used to take 2 to 3 percent of revenues; now it is nearly 7 percent, one of the reasons the Tostanoskis have lost money on car rentals in the last few years, the Tostanoskis said.
So far, the Tostanoskis said, they have not had a flood of customers who have been turned down by Hertz as too risky, but they have had a lot of phone calls asking if they impose the surcharge. Their situation is unique; the two other Hertz franchisees near New York City, both in New Jersey, do not see much traffic from the city. Andrew Kanter, of Passaic-Clifton Drive Your Self, said the point was moot because he had not seen a Bronx customer since Jan. 2.
Beyond vicarious liability problems, life here has been miserable in the last few years, the Tostanoskis said. They seem to worry about their business just as a father worries when he hands the ignition key to his teen-ager, times 60.
Since last February, for example, three of their 60 cars have been wrecked. Last summer, someone picked the pocket of a train passenger at the station in New Rochelle, walked into the Tostanoskis Garden Street building 100 yards away, and used the license and credit card to rent a Taurus station wagon, which was found three months later in New Jersey, minus the tires and with $2,000 in damage.
 
The Subtleties of Thievery
 There are more subtle thefts. Mechanics sometimes rent cars and use them like organ donors for customers' car; they may take out a $350 power-steering pump and replace it with a worn-out one, said Edward Tostanoski. Sometimes car owners will rent a car overnight to swap batteries, he said.
Cars that are rented aren't the only ones that get damaged. On cold nights, homeless people have broken into cars in the lot, for a place to sleep. While most Hertz locations offer Crown Victorias or Continentals as the top-of-the-line option, the Tostanoskis offer nothing more luxurious than the Taurus, for fear of having a $30,000 car stolen off their lot.
Even without theft, vandalism or fraud there are headaches. Of the 60 cars, at any given time 4 are in the local body shop; in fact, the Tostanoskis keep one worker there busy full time.
And by the nature of their business, the Tostanoskis are practically pen pals of the Parking Violations Bureau in New York City, which is not supposed to charge them for tickets accrued by renters, but has voluminous, painstaking procedures for documenting that the cars were rented.
Yonkers Drive It Yourself rents trucks, too, and still finds that profitable, but when it comes to cars, said the younger Mr. Tostanoski, "there is no bright spot."

Tostanoski, who runs six Hertz franchises in southern Westchester County with his father, Edward, right.

HEADLINE: Budgetary Brinkmanship;
Dire Threats to Cut Essential Services Are Often Just a Ploy

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
As tax receipts slip and budgets come under the knife in statehouses, city halls and private institutions, the region is witnessing the flowering of a kind of brinkmanship in which officials seek to protect their budgets by threatening to cut where the pain will be worst.
The object of this exercise is not usually to perform the dire amputations that are threatened, budget experts say, but to arouse support for an agency's strongest suit, usually the area in which it comes in contact with the public, and to deflect budget-cutting attention from more vulnerable, back-office operations with no public constituency. 
 In the last six months or so, the region's taxpayers have seen the City University threaten to lock out 10,000 incoming freshmen this spring and New York State's chief judge warn that thousands of criminals might be loosed upon the streets unless the courts' budgets are restored to desired levels. Nassau County Health Department officials decided that the wisest money-saver would be to eliminate the crews that check public beaches for such hazards as discarded needles, and New York State park officials once determined that closing a major beach just in time for the start of the summer season was their best source of savings.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is no stranger to budgetary brinkmanship, avoided the tactic in the state budget released Tuesday. But history shows that the gambit is most likely to be deployed in the final stages of negotiations with the Legislature, as it was last summer, when the Governor threatened to close Long Island beaches to force the lawmakers to raise fees instead.
"One of the most frequent bureaucratic responses to budget cuts is to come forward with programs that will so outrage the public that the cut will be rejected and the money restored," said Dall W. Forsythe, who was Governor Cuomo's budget director until September, when he left to teach government at Harvard's Kennedy School.
"It is the job of a good budget office to sort out the cuts that are proposed with that in mind," he went on. "If a budget office does its job well, most of these proposals never come to light."
Mr. Forsythe's favorite example of the art crosses his desk annually, he said, sent along by the Department of Social Services. Responding to requests to trim budgets, he remembered, the department would unfailingly propose eliminating the emergency telephone line for abused children.
 
Protecting the Operation
 "It's a matter of people in an agency trying to protect their operation by making it as painful as possible to cut their budget," said Ernest Reock, director of Rutgers University's Bureau of Government Research. "They try to protect an area that is vulnerable by picking out something that has a great deal of attractiveness and government support. It's fairly common. I do it myself."
Mr. Reock declined to give an example of his own use of a technique that has come to be known as the Washington Monument Defense, named in the early 1980's for a National Park Service official who, asked by Congress where some budget savings could be found, suggested closing the Washington Monument, one of the capital's most popular attractions.
Clearly, one department head's bureaucratic gambit is another's responsible defense of the public good. Mr. Reock aside, few department chairmen admit to doing anything so tacky as grandstanding.
So when Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds of City University of New York recently threatened to lock out 10,000 freshmen in the spring unless City Hall restored $5.6 million of its budget -- and when the plan somehow found its way into the news media -- the move was widely viewed as another page in the old budget game. The proposed cut, after all, amounted to less than 2 percent of the CUNY's $281.5 million annual budget.
 
CUNY Lock-out Plan
 But CUNY officials bridle at any suggestion of game-playing. "It got a great deal of attention, no doubt about it," said Jay Hershenson, a spokesman for the university. "There were a number of officials who wondered if the Chancellor really intended to follow through if the cuts were made. The answer is yes, absolutely."
Because the threatened cut could have come midway through the current budget year, the impact would have been doubled since the loss would have to be spread out over six months instead of 12, Mr. Hershenson said. The city's contribution to the CUNY budget had been cut by 29 percent since 1989, he added, and the recession is driving more and more applicants into the CUNY system, including 10,000 more for this spring term than for last year's. That was the group targeted for delayed admission under the lockout plan.
The gambit paid off. All but $900,000 of the cuts were restored.
Budget brinkmanship was evidently in play at other institutions in the region, whatever the merit of the officials' warnings. On Long Island, John H. Marburger, president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, warned last month that he might double the tuition or dismiss 500 employees, 18 percent of the total, if Governor Cuomo asked for further cuts in his campus budget. "In normal times, you might consider this political game-playing, but these are not normal times," Dr. Marburger said at the time.
Not surprisingly, a common defense against budget cuts is to argue that reduced spending will eventually end up wasting money and costing the taxpayers more. When Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey cut the state education department's budget from $47 million to $37 million last year, the Commissioner of Education, Dr. John Ellis, warned that the reduction would make it difficult for him to see that state education funds were properly spent.
Nor are private institutions exempt from the dire threat. In November, 26 department heads at Columbia University threatened to resign if the administration went through with proposed cuts beyond those agreed to in the Department of Arts and Sciences budget. The department heads' threat remains because the issue has not been resolved.
The Columbia department heads originally made their threat in a letter to a ranking university official, just as Chancellor Reynolds's threat to delay freshman admissions was originally made in a private message to Mayor Divid N. Dinkins and the City Council. But such threats must be public to be effective, and both soon found their way to the public.
Since budget money is drawn from a single pot, budget threats are often aimed at competing bureaucrats as well as at legislatures and taxpayers who might be persuaded to support tax or fee increases to avert a well-orchestrated threat. Richard Nathan, now provost of the State University of New York at Albany and an assistant director of the White House Office of Management and Budget during the Nixon Administration, said this competition produces precisely the wrong results.
"The good commissioners, who are really trying to make hard choices and do the kinds of needed structural change that you can make during a period of fiscal adversity, get hurt," he said in an interview. "Nobody squawks about the more carefully designed, thoughtful strategic choices that really look to get at low-priority programs or those that outlive their usefulness. So the people who use high-profile, 'Look what you are doing to me!' strategies get their cuts restored, and the good guys, the men and women who do the hard work, get their cuts accepted."
As a result, Mr. Nathan said, a new dynamic is introduced: budget brinkmanship as a counter-feint, in anticipation of similar ploys from competing agencies.
One of the most dire public threats of budgetary Armageddon during the current budget season came in November from Chief Judge Sol Wachtler of the New York Court of Appeals, who said he would have to close all of the state civil courts and half of the criminal courts, freeing "thousands of criminal defendants," if Governor Cuomo went through with a proposed $26 million cut in the court system budget.
Judge Wachtler backed up his threat with a lawsuit against the Governor, which he dropped last Thursday when he and Mr. Cuomo agreed on a formula that would restore 471 employees to the court system. But Governor Cuomo denied having given in to a Judge Wachtler threat.
But the administration is not immune from the gesture, either. Last June, at the beginning of the beach season, Governor Cuomo threatened to close Robert Moses State Park after the Legislature trimmed the state budget by more than he had requested.
The park, part of the Fire Island seashore, attracts 3.5 million visitors a year, and the threat produced 1,000 angry calls from Long Island officials and beach-goers. That was -- arguably, at least -- just the response the Governor had hoped for.

HEADLINE: Senators Hearten Dinkins

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins concluded two days of meetings here today saying he had found new support for efforts to make the plight of America's cities a focus of national economic policy.
"Washington can no longer turn its back on cities," said the Mayor, who also attended a meeting here of the United States Conference of Mayors. "We need help now." 
 The meetings were part of an effort by Democrats on Capitol Hill to seize the initiative on domestic policy, which is considered President Bush's Achilles' heel, and make it the focus of the presidential campaign.
 
Sees Change in Congress
 By the time Mr. Dinkins left this afternoon he was declaring victory. He said he had detected a sea change in the Congressional attitude towards cities and new understanding that improving the faltering economy depends on Federal help in rejuvenating urban areas and their suburbs.
"Clearly the attitude of senators is to recognize some urgency," he said. "That just hasn't been the case heretofore. There's recognition we have to do something and do something quickly."
The Mayor said the clearest sign of the new awareness was the formation of the Senate Task Force and Advisory Committee on Community and Urban Revitalization. A pet project of Mr. Dinkins and Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, it is touted as the country's first urban caucus and a way of increasing cities' political clout, which has declined sharply amid the suburbanization of the country.
"This is really a historic group; it's a pretty impressive group," Mr. Dinkins said.
The formation of the group was announced by the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine. It is to meet several times a year and its chairman will be Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the powerful Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. The group also includes two Governors, William D. Schaefer of Maryland and Ann Richards of Texas, as well as mayors, business, labor and community leaders from around the country.

HEADLINE: 2.6% Gain In Starts Of Housing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
In a report pointing to economic recovery, Commerce Department figures showed today that builders broke ground for new homes in December at the fastest pace in more than a year and that permits for future construction did even better.
Housing starts ran at an annual rate of 1,103,000 last month, or 2.6 percent above the November rate, with all regions but the West posting gains. Permits rose 5.8 percent, to 1,051,000. 
 New-home construction tends to be one of the first sectors to revive when the economy emerges from recession and its activity ripples widely because each new dwelling means fresh demand for such consumer durables as appliances, furniture and carpeting. Permits are one of the components of the Government index that is meant to foretell economic trends.
 
Stimulation Is Seen
 "Last month's rise in housing starts shows that low interest rates clearly are stimulating demand," said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.
Separately, a national survey by the Federal Reserve found that while overall economic activity was "lackluster" in late 1991 and the first two weeks of 1992, construction of single-family homes "expanded modestly." Sales of homes picked up, the Fed added in its "beige book" report, noting that "realtors, mortgage lenders and home builders are generally optimistic for the spring."
Housing could scarcely get any worse than it was in 1991, which saw starts dive to 1,014,700, the lowest level since 1946 and 14.9 percent below the depressed level of 1990. This was just half as many houses as were built in the industry's best years.
From their recent peak of 1.81 million units in 1986, starts fell for five straight years. Since March, they have climbed in seven of nine months, falling only in September and November.
 
'Coming Back Modestly'
 "Housing is coming back -- not storming back but coming back modestly," said David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. He said the main reason to expect further improvement was still lower interest rates, with the latest starts and permits figures not yet reflecting the latest, aggressive easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve just before Christmas.
Still, according to Thomas Holloway, an economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, a relatively sluggish overall recovery will keep starts in check this year. His forecast calls for a total of 1,210,000, 19 percent above the 1991 figure.
The December improvement in starts was entirely in single-family homes and small buildings with two to four units. House starts rose to a 948,000 annual pace, from 910,000 in November, while small multi-dwellings rose to 56,000 from 33,000. Starts in apartment houses and other buildings with five or more units, however, slumped to a pace of 99,000 from 132,000, the lowest since the end of World War II.
Mr. Berson observed that family formations typically fall during recessions and that builders seemed to have withdrawn from this sector until recovery had clearly taken hold. But he said he was encouraged by December's rise in permits for buildings of five or more units, to 168,000 from 148,000, that he said appeared to reflect optimism that recovery was on the way.
Activity varied by region. Starts rose to a rate of 139,000 from 122,000 in the Northeast, to 243,000 from 226,000 in the Midwest and to 469,000 from 457.000 in the South. They fell, however, in the West to 252,000 from 270,000.
The number of actual groundbreakings nationally, with no seasonal adjustment or annualization, was 66,800, with 29,500 in the South and just 8,000 in the Northeast, the report showed.
For permits, single-family homes rose to an 840,000 pace in December from 787,000 in November, while two-to-four unit structures fell to 43,000 from 58,000.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Wants Former Chicago Bank Chief in Top Economic Post

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Barry F. Sullivan, a longtime banker and the retired head of the First Chicago Corporation, is the Dinkins administration's top choice to be New York City's new Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, and is to tell Mayor David N. Dinkins as soon as today whether he wants the job, mayoral aides said yesterday.
Mr. Sullivan, who was born in the Bronx and spent 23 years at the Chase Manhattan Bank before leaving to head First Chicago in 1980, made a strong impression in an interview with Mr. Dinkins at City Hall last week, the aides said. He would replace Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, who has said she wants to spend more time with her children by shifting to a less demanding post. 
 Under pressure from business organizations to hold down taxes, retain companies and resolve the city's fiscal problems without devastating service cuts, the administration has sought a senior business figure to become chief economic steward and cheerleader to help bolster its credibility. One of the Mayor's financial advisers, David Rockefeller, the former head of Chase, helped recruit Mr. Sullivan for the post.
"The business community is enthusiastically behind him," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership and New York Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Sullivan, 61 years old, retired from First Chicago last fall after presiding over the bank through a decade. In Chicago, he was regarded as having helped that city's first black Mayor, Harold Washington, build links to the white business establishment. He increased the bank's lending to poorer communities.
He is currently heading an effort to involve Chicago business people in reviewing the finances of the city's public schools, an effort that Dinkins aides said might force him to delay taking the new post in New York for some time, or require him to start part time.
 
Accused by Former Aide
 Throughout his time in Chicago, Mr. Sullivan kept a family home in Bronxville, just over the Westchester County line. Top city officials are required to live in the city, and Mr. Sullivan has told those involved in the search that if his residency became an issue, he would take an apartment in the city.
One of Mr. Sullivan's former top aides in Chicago, Jeffrey Tassani, pleaded guilty last year to bank fraud and was sentenced to five years in prison for accepting kickbacks from businesses for arranging bank contracts. Mr. Sullivan was not implicated in the wrongdoing, but Mr. Tassani later charged that the bank under Mr. Sullivan had sponsored a gambling party for bank officials. Bank executives later reimbursed the bank for expenses of the party.
Lizabeth Weiner, a spokeswoman for the bank who is also fielding calls for Mr. Sullivan, said he had been refraining from commenting on his possible appointment, and he did not return a message left at the Bronxville house.

Tax-Free and Taxable Funds See Sharp Decline in Yields

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt money funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report dropped sharply for the week ended yesterday, and yields of taxable funds also dropped significantly.
Walter Frank, economist for the organization, attributed the sharp decline in yields on the tax-exempt funds to a "lack of supply of municipal bonds early in the year, as well as the easing by the Federal Reserve late in December." Another factor, Mr. Frank added, was an inflow that took assets of the tax-exempts to a record level. 
 These factors came together last week, he said, adding that "we expect to see an outflow from the tax-exempt funds for the next few weeks until yields show some increases from the current low levels."
The seven-day compound average yield for the tax-exempt funds dropped 28 basis points, to 2.76 percent from 3.04 percent, while the seven-day simple yield dropped to 2.72 percent, also down 28 points. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
During the same period, the 30-day compound yield dropped 27 points, to 3.57 percent, and the 30-day simple yield dropped 26 points, to 3.51 percent.
 
Three-State Leaders
 Among the yield leaders in the three-state area, the top Connecticut fund continued to be Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, which reported a seven-day compound yield of 3.28 percent, down from 3.54 percent.
In New Jersey, the top fund was Fidelity Spartan N.J. Municipal Money Market Portfolio, with a yield of 3.25 percent compared with the previous leader, which reported a 3.58 percent yield a week ago.
In New York, the top fund again was Salomon Brothers N.Y. Municipal Money Market fund. It had a seven-day compound yield of 3.60 percent, compared with 3.83 percent a week ago.
Assets of the tax-exempt funds rose by $663 million, to a record of $98.1 billion this week.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in the tax-free portfolios dropped by one day, to 52, this week.
 
Strong Still the Leader
 Of the funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund of Milwaukee continued to lead the way with a seven-day compound yield of 3.84, down 45 basis points. "That is almost half of 1 percent," Mr. Frank commented.
Meanwhile, assets of the taxable funds rose by $7.6 billion, to $502.5 billion, topping last week's record. The average days to maturity of holdings in the taxable funds remained unchanged, at 57. Mr. Frank said about $3 billion of the increase came from institutions, which meant that most of the inflow could be attributed to public investors.
 
Taxable Yield: 4.14%
 As for the taxables, Mr. Frank said: "Taxable money fund yields are in the process of bottoming, and the decline in their yields should end in the next two or three weeks. I would expect that we would see the institutional money flows into the taxables dry up as other market yields become more attractive."
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield dropped to 4.14 percent, from 4.28 the previous week, while the seven-day simple yield also fell by 14 basis points, to 4.05 percent.
At the same time, the 30-day compound yield declined to 4.39 percent, off 12 basis points, and the simple yield dropped 11 basis points, to 4.30 percent.
The taxable fund with the best seven-day compound return for the week was Parkstone Prime Obligation Fund, distributed by the Winsbury Company of Columbus, Ohio, with a yield of 7.02 percent, partly because of capital gains.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.94 percent, compared with 3.99 percent a week ago, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Fall

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Interest rates rose and prices of Treasury securities fell in light trading yesterday, as market participants continued to grapple with conflicting signals about the economy and to cope with additional new corporate debt securities.
Those developments overshadowed a strong auction of $13.7 billion worth of two-year notes, which were sold at the lowest yield since the Treasury initiated the regular sale in 1974. 
 A report showing that housing starts rose 2.6 percent in December, to their highest monthly level since November 1990, was a bit more robust than expected and provided a reason to sell securities early in the day.
 
Fed Reports Weakness
 But economists noted that despite the improvement, housing activity remains at low levels. Moreover, a report issued later in the day by the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks, known as the "beige book," showed the economy was very weak at the turn of the year.
The housing news is "modestly encouraging," said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. "But it is such a gradual recovery that it by no means indicates anything more meaningful for the economy over all. And the beige book was surprisingly gloomy."
Aside from the housing data, traders also cited heavy issuance of new 10-year and 30-year investment-grade corporate debt securities as another reason why prices of longer-term notes and bonds fell yesterday.
The contents of a Government report outlining sweeping changes in the way Treasury securities will be sold in the future, and who will sell them, had no impact on prices in the credit markets, according to market participants.
The Province of Manitoba led the way in the corporate debt market, offering $500 million of new 10-year notes.
At the two-year note auction, the securities were sold at an average yield of 4.99 percent, down from the average 5.12 percent yield at the last two-year note sale on December 18.
The securities traded well after the auction results were announced, and by late in the day were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 4.96 percent.
Today the Treasury is expected to sell $9.25 billion worth of five-year notes.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the securities were offered at a price to yield 6.27 percent.
At current yield levels, demand for the new notes should be strong, traders said.
"If the five-year auction can go reasonably well, this market might do pretty well for awhile," Mr. Johnson, the economist, said.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 104 3/8 late yesterday, down 21/32 , to yield 7.62 percent, compared with 7.57 percent late Tuesday.
Among reasury note issues outstanding, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 7/8, down 17/32 , to yield 7.08 percent. And the 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 98, down1/4 point, to yield 6.73 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.73 percent late yesterday, down three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 3.81 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late rate of 3.90 percent.
In the corporate debt market, the Province of Manitoba's 7.75 percent 10-year securities were priced at $99.929 to yield 7.76 percent, 67 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The noncallable securities are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The First Boston Corporation acted as lead underwriter.
First Boston was also the lead underwriter on a two-part, $325 million offering of 32-year and 5-year first mortgage bonds for Arizona Public Service.
The $175 million worth of 8.75 percent 32-year bonds were priced at $99.144 to yield 8.83 percent, 1.20 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The remaining $150 million of the offering consists of 7 1/8 percent five year securities that were priced at $99.892 to yield 7.15 percent, 85 basis points over the prevailing yield on the new five-year Treasury securities to be auctioned today.
All of the securities sold are noncallable for life. Both parts of the issue are rated Baa-3 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was highlighted by a competitive sale of $200 million worth of securities for Dade County, Fla.
A bid from an investment group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company won the bonds.
The securities were reoffered to investors with yields ranging from 3.40 percent on serial bonds maturing in 1993 to a maximum yield of 6.35 percent on serial bonds maturing in 2008.
A term bond maturing in 2011 was priced to yield 6.385 percent.
The issue is insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, and is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Traders in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most widely quoted issues fell by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.

HEADLINE: Company Earnings;
$318 Million Loss Is Posted at Caterpillar

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Weighed down by the recession and labor battles, Caterpillar Inc. today reported a $318 million loss in the fourth quarter and predicted that it would lose more money in the first quarter of this year.
Also today, Moody's Investors Service Inc., the ratings agency, lowered the long-term debt and commercial paper ratings of Caterpillar and its units, affecting $3 billion in debt. 
 The world's largest maker of construction equipment said it had lost $318 million in the last three months of 1991, after a profit of $11 million, or 11 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier.
 
$324 Million Charge
 The quarterly loss included a charge of $324 million for the likely closing of its plant in York, Pa., and the further consolidation of its Brazilian operations. Caterpillar has said its decision to close the York plant depends on contract concessions it wins from the United Automobile Workers union.
For the quarter, the company's sales fell 10.5 percent, to $2.46 billion from $2.75 billion.
For all of 1991, Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., said it had lost $404 million, compared with a profit of $210 million, or $2.07 a share, in 1990. Its sales shrank nearly 11 percent, to $10.18 billion from $11.43 billion.
The most significant factor in the 1991 loss, Caterpillar said, was a 12 percent drop in sales, caused by a slump in demand related to the recession.
The company forecast a first-quarter loss because of labor problems at its plants and uncertainty about the economy.
 
Union Dispute a Factor
 Caterpillar said its contract dispute with the U.A.W., which has idled 9,300 employees by strikes, lockouts or related layoffs, has disrupted operations but did not have a significant effect on the bottom line. The standoff began 11 weeks ago, and no settlement is in sight.
Analysts said the results disappointed Wall Street investors.
"The numbers were worse than the Street assumed, but then the charge was bigger than expected," said Tobias Levkovich, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
Nevertheless, Caterpillar's shares rose 12.5 cents each today, to $46.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
In its downgrading announcement today, Moody's also said Caterpillar's long-term debt remained under review for possible further downgrade. The agency cited the negative effect from its dispute with the U.A.W.

High-Flier May Be Airworthy Again

BYLINE: By Lawrence M. Fisher

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
A LITTLE over a year ago, Sequent Computer Systems Inc. hit the invisible wall that seems to lie in wait for high-flying high-technology companies. Sequent, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., and makes superminicomputers, missed its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter of 1990 and spent the first three quarters of 1991 mired in red ink.
Sequent's troubles began with a significant decline its original equipment manufacturing business, in which Sequent computers are resold by the Unisys Corporation. That arrangement, coupled with the recession and some internal difficulties, left the company in a position where it "couldn't peel expenses fast enough," said Casey Powell, Sequent's chairman and chief executive. 
 So, in the third quarter of 1991, Sequent carried out a huge overhaul, paring its work force by 25 percent and canceling a major development project. The company now says it will report a return to profitability in the fourth quarter when it releases its results next week. And on Monday, Sequent announced a series of products and a strategic relationship that should help it return to its former fast-growing ways.
Sequent, founded in 1983, went public in 1987 when sales were $20 million, and posted annual profits for four consecutive years. In 1990, its last profitable year, Sequent earned $18.8 million on revenue of $248.8 million.
Analysts say Sequent could show earnings growth again in 1992 with just modest sales growth because the company has reduced its expenses so much. Sequent has put its house in order, these analysts say, and some are ready to be investors again in the nine-year-old company.
"I was really a skeptic," said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Research."But they have done a remarkably good job of fixing things. I recommended the stock this morning, and I feel good about Sequent now."
After trading for as little as $7.50 last year, Sequent shares have rebounded to the midteens; they closed yesterday at $16.50, up 25 cents, in over-the-counter trading.
Ms. Conigliaro said Sequent impressed her with "a backlog that is bigger by far than anyone could have expected in their wildest dreams." The backlog, estimated to be above $30 million, insures that Sequent will weather the seasonally slow first quarter.
In addition, Sequent "is on the right side of a lot of things" that are becoming trends in computing, she said. Among these are the use of industry-standard microprocessors; multiprocessing, in which computing is divided among a number of processors at once, and the Unix operating system software originally developed by A.T.& T. but now an emerging industry standard.
Indeed, Sequent, which was founded by 17 former Intel Corporation employees, was a pioneer in merging these industry trends into one computer. Its machines, which range in price from $53,500 to $467,500, use from two to six Intel 486 microprocessors, the chip commonly found in the most powerful personal computers. By running these chips in parallel, Sequent computers can outperform more costly minicomputers and mainframes.
Sequent computers are most often used to run relational data base management programs, like the Oracle Systems Corporation's products, which companies use to keep track of everything from payroll to product sales. While Sequent machines sometimes replace conventional minicomputers, they are increasingly used as information servers -- devices that both coordinate multiple networks of personal computers and reduce the load on a company's central mainframe. Having developed a "parallelized" version of Netware, Novell Inc.'s network operating system, Sequent can use its machines to orchestrate networks of thousands of personal computers.
The company "is well positioned as a leading supplier of very cost-effective superminicomputers for relational data base management," said Neil Weintraut, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. Other strong points for Sequent, Mr. Weintraut said, are its replenished product line, the link with Novell and its strengthened direct sales force. He rates the company a long-term buy.
On Monday, Sequent announced three computers in its Symmetry 2000 line, all using the latest higher-speed version of the 486 chip. Perhaps more significantly, Sequent announced that the Open Software Foundation, an industry group that includes I.B.M., had chosen its machines as the primary computers for development of multiprocessor versions of OSF/1, the foundation's version of Unix. Sequent machines were already the test platforms for Unix System Laboratories, the foundation's direct competitor, which is led by A.T.& T.
"The company had already established itself as the Intel-based multiprocessor platform of choice on the U.S.L. side; now they've garnered the same honor from O.S.F.," said Shao Wang, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
Mr. Wang upgraded Sequent from a sell to a hold last month and retains that rating, based as much on the uncertain state of the economy as on Sequent's prospects. But, he added, for a company that lost money in 1991 and might earn only 50 cents a share in 1992, "the valuation is not exactly cheap."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Decline Slightly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher on world currency markets yesterday in quiet trading.
Gold prices were slightly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $357.90 an ounce, off 10 cents. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 5 cents an ounce to a late bid price of $357.50. 
 Analysts said most of the day's activity centered on the Japanese yen and the German mark as traders anticipate the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers on Long Island.
Many expect them to take some action to support a higher yen, which in turn would help address Japan's trade imbalance with the United States and Europe.
"It would also give the Bank of Japan more room to cut interest rates," which would have a favorable effect on the dollar, said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
Others say the finance ministers from the United States, Germany, Japan, Italy, France, Britain and Canada may go as far as agreeing to coordinate interest rate moves and monetary policy, said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago.
The market had little reaction to new data showing housing starts fell 14.9 percent last year to their lowest level in 46 years. And the release of the Federal Reserve's so-called beige book, which said the economy ended last year in the doldrums, also failed to influence the dollar.
"The consensus is that by midyear we will recover, but the attitude is not by much," Mr. Malpede said.
In Tokyo, the dollar was unchanged at 123.34 Japanese yen. Later in London, it fell to 123.20 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 123.38 yen, down from 123.68 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8050, from $1.8080 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.8055 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.8045.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5905 German marks, up from 1.5865; 1.4090 Swiss francs, up from 1.4060; 5.4210 French francs, up from 5.4085; 1,195.50 Italian lire, up from 1,194.00, and 1.1556 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1551.

$6.8 Million Loss for Wang

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass., Jan. 22

 BODY:
Wang Laboratories Inc. reported a quarterly loss of $6.8 million on Tuesday, but the troubled computer company said it was encouraged that its revenues had stopped declining.
Results for the three-month period that ended Dec. 31 compared with a loss of $24.7 million in the comparable period a year earlier.
But for the second consecutive quarter, Wang reported an operating profit of $3.9 million. The loss came after deducting interest and taxes.
The results, moreover, were the first in more than a year in which the quarter's revenues exceeded those from the preceding quarter.
Revenue totaled $495.9 million in the quarter, the second of Wang's fiscal year. That was down from $544.2 million in the comparable period a year earlier, but up from $460.7 million in the first quarter of the fiscal year.
Richard W. Miller, chairman of Wang, said the company faced economic and market pressures similar to those confronting other computer makers.
"We are encouraged, however, by our second-quarter results," Mr. Miller said, "which indicate that Wang's revenues and financial performance remain stable despite these external adversities."
Wang has been trying to recover for more than two years. A key to Wang's future will be a new alliance with the International Business Machines Corporation. Under the alliance, Wang will sell a variety of I.B.M. computers, some under the Wang label.
Mr. Miller said those products would begin moving in the current quarter. As expected, he said, the second quarter did not include any significant revenues from I.B.M.

HEADLINE: English Bathrooms: Out of the Closet

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
The term water closet may sound like a quaint euphemism, but over the years it has also come to be a pretty fair description of the typical British bathroom. As often as not, it is a cramped, airless cubicle, a kind of architectural afterthought crouched at the end of a creaky hallway or hidden beneath the stairs of a 19th-century terrace house.
But in the last few years, the British bathroom has begun to come into its own. Not only are new houses equipped with larger and more luxurious bathrooms, but there is a growing trend to remodel and update old bathrooms, often using florid antique or reproduction fixtures that evoke the look and feel of Victorian manor houses. 
 And there has been a sudden explosion in the consumer market for showers and shower stalls, to either replace or supplement that most essential British fixture, the bathtub. The most elaborate are advertised as "power showers" because they employ hydraulic pumps, often noisy, to augment the chronically weak household water pressure. Built directly into bathroom walls, they cost $200 to $1,000, depending on spray options and flow rate.
"For years, Britons wouldn't hear of showers, partly because they liked their baths, and partly because we just don't have the proper water pressure like you do in America," said Stephen Quigley, the managing director of Richmond's, a large plumbing supply store in southwest London. In most English houses, water pressure is dependent on a gravity-fed tank in a loft or an attic.
"But I think the bath is going the way of the full breakfast," Mr. Quigley added. "It's a life style thing. People don't have time in the morning for a leisurely bath or breakfast."
In pushing out their bathroom walls and abandoning bathtubs for shower stalls, Britons may be doing something much more substantial than flirting with the latest trend in interior design. They are, in a way, tinkering with their own cultural plumbing, a trend that some consider vaguely unsettling.
"Perhaps there is a bit of snobbery about it, but I think the idea that a bathroom ought to be carpeted and wallpapered and painted in peach colors is absurd, even vulgar," said Gavin Stamp, an architect, writer and member of the Victorian Society, which works to preserve and celebrate 19th-century architecture. "Bathrooms do matter. But they ought to be well plumbed and solid: substantial, like the engine room of a ship."
Indeed, some essential breakthroughs in sanitary engineering and indoor plumbing took place in 19th-century Britain as a result of the work of Thomas Crapper, who invented the siphonless flushing mechanism, and the Rev. Edward Johns, who introduced his popular "dolphin" toilet to the United States at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876.
Moreover, some 19th-century English fixtures were extraordinarily ornate, a reflection of the Victorian love of machinery: enameled hand basins and fluted toilet bowls and gold and brass taps and fixtures. Some public restrooms were adventures in sanitary wonderland. For example, in one tank in central London in the late 19th century, the flushing water was held in a suspended glass globe in which an attendant kept goldfish. (The mechanics of the device assured that the goldfish would not be lost in the flush.)
Indoor toilets were not uncommon in British houses by the late 19th century, but the emphasis on bathing as a matter of general hygiene was much slower to catch on. Min Hogg, editor in chief of The World of Interiors, the magazine that perhaps best captures the eccentricity of British decorating, said the English seemed to develop a sense of the bathroom that differed from what was evolving on the Continent and across the Atlantic. "That's why the French have the bidet, and we do not, and the Americans have showers, and we do not," Ms. Hogg said.
Bathrooms were not common in working-class housing projects until after World War I, said John Pennell, the director of the British Bathroom Council, an organization that represents big manufacturers of bathroom products. Even then, they tended to be very cramped; they were quite deliberately made the absolute minimum size. Their design, he said, probably reflected some degree of class bias.
"I think most architects, who were middle class, had a difficult time being persuaded that bathrooms were really necessary for working-class people," Mr. Pennell said.
Over the years, the relatively spare, compact British bathroom has attracted the curiosity of foreigners. They have marveled at the absence of a bidet or shower, at the fact that the toilet is often sequestered in a tiny room all its own, and at the plumbing of sinks, which invariably have separate taps for dispensing hot and cold water. Beppe Severgnini, an Italian journalist who wrote "Inglisi," a social history of the English published last year by Hodder & Stoughton, said this meant that washing one's hands in England required choosing "between getting your hands scorched under the hot tap or frozen under the cold one."
Mr. Severgnini concluded that the British have what he called a "troubled relationship" with their bathrooms, underscoring the point by noting that the English commonly use more than a dozen euphemisms to describe a bathroom. Among them are loo, gents', ladies', lavatory, toilet, convenience, lav, water closet, W.C., bog, john, can, head, latrine, privy and powder room.
But Mr. Pennell and others argue that the British are changing. Although the recession has slowed conversions and remodeling, the British Bathroom Council estimates that nearly half of all British houses now have showers, as against only about 30 percent a decade ago.
One house with a "power shower" is that of David Deane, a London businessman, and his wife, Karen.
"The old bathtub, with its hand-held shower, was fine if you had an hour to spare," said Mr. Deane, adding that he fell in love with brisk morning showers on trips to the United States and had a shower installed in his house in 1987. "The problem was, the dribble of water you got was never enough to get the soap off. I used to keep a pitcher beside the tub, to fill up and bang over my head, to rinse off properly."
 As Mr. Pennell sees it, "The idea now is that the bathroom is part of the living space and ought to reflect the way people see themselves."
To that end, for example, Armitage Shanks, the largest British maker of bathroom equipment, now markets complete bathroom suites in a variety of styles and colors with names like oyster, chablis, peach and champagne. One suite, the Clivenden, is designed along Edwardian lines; it has fluted basins and a mahogany toilet seat.
There is also a big market for antique bathroom fixtures salvaged from junkyards and demolition projects. In the last two years, at least half a dozen shops offering reconditioned basins, taps and heavy fixtures, like re-enameled cast-iron tubs with claw-and-ball feet and rolled edges, have opened in London.
Because the fittings are not the same size as modern pipes, they are often difficult to install, and much heavier than modern appliances, a hazard in itself. A man who put a reconditioned antique marble tub into his Belgravia row house not long ago returned home to discover it in the basement, where it had halted after crashing through three floors on its way down from a loft bathroom.

HEADLINE: A Natural Hoarder Opens a Shop, and the Style is 'Neo-Flea'

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
THE shop sort of announces its personality as soon as you walk in the door:
"Wonderful old paint," reads the tag on a country pie safe, "$995." "Home-style delicious, $4.50," says a sign by some jars of applesauce. "Authentic country frame and photo, dated 1924, $225" catches one's eye. A Boston-terrier-shaped iron doorstop -- "$255 (rare)" -- stands on a table; another stands in the window. 
 Then there's the lineup of vintage soda bottles with names like Skipper, Crass, Whistle, Patio and Variety Club. They're $20 each.
"Aren't they just great and graphic?" said Jenny Eiger, the owner of Home Town, a new shop at 131 Wooster Street (Prince Street) in SoHo.
That's everything you need to know, and maybe a little more.
Selling an irrestible mix of what some people deem treasures and others junk, Ms. Eiger, who is 30 years old, embodies the acquiring ethos of her generation. She seizes on items that avid flea-market enthusiasts have gotten in the habit of hunting for: well-worn painted furniture, old toys, birdhouses, cast-iron doorstops, license plates, ($35 each at the shop) and felt banners, ($45 each).
And it doesn't come particularly cheap. It does, however, require a certain eye, and Ms. Eiger seems to have it. She hopes others will share in what she calls her "vision."
"You have to have one when you decide to open a store in a recession," she said.
Here's the vision: "New York City is nobody's hometown," she said. "Everyone is trying to create a little piece of home in their own urban apartment."
A self-described "hoarder by nature," Ms. Eiger's home happens to be a loft on lower Broadway. A part of the loft now serves as a holding area for items on their way to the store. Or back again.
"The store is really a facsimile of my house," she explained.
Tin boxes, green kitchen bowls, whirligigs, tiny Adirondack chairs and dog-shaped cast-iron doorstops that may be in transit to the store contribute to the informal homey look. Most are minus the price tags, of course.
It helps create an esthetic in which overscale snowshoes, a weathered wheelbarrow and an American flag as a room divider do not seem particularly outrageous. Not exactly "country" in style, the look is more just down-home and lived-in. One might call it "neo-flea" or "well-styled-flea."
A few things in Ms. Eiger's loft -- the wooden wheel that once steered her grandfather's boat, for example -- are there to stay. Other items, captured on trips upstate and points south and west of Manhattan, are already neatly stickered, bound for the store.
But nothing leaves without causing Ms. Eiger some angst. "Sometimes it's heart-wrenching for me to give something up," she said. "I feel responsible. I want to feel it's going to a good house. Sometimes I feel sad when someone buys something. I think, 'no one will love it as much as I do.' "
She's getting better at letting go.
Ms. Eiger opened the shop a few weeks before Christmas, after working for 10 years as a studio manager in a fashion photography studio and in advertising at Barneys New York.
"I did this on my own after working for lots of people my whole life," she said.
Ms. Eiger, who grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., recalled that people thought she was weird because she only liked "things that were old."
"My Dad was a C.P.A. and a lawyer, my Mom an English teacher, and my grandmother was an interior decorator," she said. Tin boxes were what she collected as a child. Now she has expanded her collecting to include, among other things, cast-iron bookends and vintage cameras.
Opening the store was like a personal mission, years in the making. "I did everything myself," she said. "I looked for six months for the right location. I choose everything myself. Do you know about Mom and Pop shops? Well, this is a Mom shop."
Ms. Eiger tends to keep one of everything for herself. In the store, a half dozen roulette wheels, at rest, span one of the freshly painted white walls. At home, a solitary one hangs on the wall. "That's the best one," Ms. Eiger said. "I couldn't part with it."
The value or age of a particular object is not what particularly appeals to Ms. Eiger. She goes for what she described as "visual appeal."
"I also like things to be functional," she added, "like tables people have put their feet up on for years," or chairs that look a little the worse -- or, to her eye, the better -- for wear.
"The 90's are all about staying home and being comfortable," she said. "I like furniture that is not going to get damaged no matter what. It's kidproof and familyproof."
Although Ms. Eiger does not do restoration, she does do some cleaning of objects. But not repainting. "Everything is as is," she said.
There are certainly others who share her taste. On a recent visit to the store, people were politely jostling each other. The fact that there are customers at all amazed her parents, who, in spite of their skepticism, have been ardent supporters of her venture. Her mother, Juliette, for example, is Ms. Eiger's traveling companion on buying forays.
Her father, Leonard, calls it Jenny's World, Ms. Eiger said.
But on the day she opened the store, Mr. Eiger stopped in early in the morning.
"Who would ever buy this?" his daughter recalled him saying about a glass jug filled with clay marbles.
Later in the day, Ms. Eiger telephoned her father and said, "Guess what the first thing I sold was?"
Now that really made her smile.
Home Town is open Tuesday through Sunday 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. Telephone: (212) 674-5770.

HEADLINE: Requiring Classes In Divorce

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON

DATELINE: MARIETTA, Ga.

 BODY:
BEFORE a very still and somber-looking audience of 80 parents, a social worker portrayed a slice of contemporary American life.
"I am a 6-year-old boy, and I live with Dad," said Aubrey Lee, the social worker, in his Southern drawl. "One hour before I am supposed to visit Mom, Dad says, 'You can't see Mom. The check didn't come.' " 
Mr. Lee looked hard at his audience, all mothers and fathers with pending divorce cases in this Atlanta suburb, and asked, "How do I feel?"
How a child feels in the turmoil of divorce -- before, during and after the breakup of the family -- was the subject of a four-hour seminar that brought these parents one morning last week to the Cobb County Juvenile Court. They were not there voluntarily: They were ordered by the court to attend.
"If you don't go, you don't get a divorce," said Judge Watson L. White, chief judge of the Cobb County Superior Court.
Here and in some other parts of the country, judges in divorce proceedings are sending warring parents to court-required seminars to open their eyes to the trauma of divorce for children. Their aim, they say, is to force parents to cease battle long enough to consider the repercussions for the innocent victims caught in their crossfire.
"The purpose," Judge White said, "is to make parents listen to experts who say, 'This is what is happening to your children, this is what they are feeling, and here are some things you can do to lessen the trauma.'
"Parents are so involved in hating each other. They tell a child the other is no good. Children don't want to take sides, but they are pushed and pulled and torn. We want to lessen the bitterness and help parents communicate with each other for the benefit of the children."
Judge White said he believed the program was having an effect. "Some couples are compromising and are settling their cases without a bitter court fight because they realize it would hurt their child and isn't worth it," he said. "We don't have statistics to back this up, but we know it's happening."
Cobb County's program, which is called "Children Cope With Divorce: Seminar for Divorcing Parents," began in October 1988 and has served as the model for similar programs that began recently in Atlanta, Savannah and Decatur, Ga. It has also been duplicated in Marion, Ohio, St. Petersburg, Fla., and Indianapolis.
"This is the wave of the future," said Judge Cynthia J. Ayers of the Family Law Division of the Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis, where the program began last July. "Fifty percent of all marriages end in divorce, and 70 percent of those families have children. Many people never consider the impact of divorce on their children."
The fast-paced curriculum touches on emotional, psychological, social and economic implications for children in a divorce. It also deals with how and what parents should tell children about a divorce, and how they can help them deal with separation and visitation.
The program addresses the needs of children according to their age and developmental level. It is a mixture of lectures, films and role-playing by a pair of seminar leaders, who dramatize common conflicts that arise in families as a result of divorce. The audience is encouraged to comment on the behavior of parents and children in those scenarios, and how they affect and often manipulate each other.
"Parents see themselves in our role-playing, and they begin to recognize things they typically do out of anger toward each other," said Bev Bradburn-Stern, the social worker who designed the seminar for Families First, an Atlanta social service and counseling agency that runs the program.
Supporters of the program concede that in four hours it can barely skim the surface of a difficult and complex subject. "Instead of four hours, it ought to be 40 hours," Judge White said. "I hope it will be expanded."
Nancy J. Parkhouse, a deputy court administrator for the Cobb Superior Court who is coordinator of the seminar, said: "It is an overview, but the main thing is awareness. It makes some very strong points, and hopefully they will stick in people's minds."
It was Ms. Parkhouse who brought the program to the attention of judges here. She said the concept for the seminar began several years ago in Wichita, Kan., where it is also court-mandated, but that a new curriculum was developed here.
The growing interest in this type of program is buttressed by research suggesting that divorce can have deep and long-lasting consequences for children. Some researchers have found that emotional scars can remain well beyond childhood, into adult life, resulting in anger, depression and fears of betrayal and abandonment.
Dr. Judith S. Wallerstein, a psychologist who has studied long-term effects of divorce, said that while the four-hour seminar was useful, she would prefer a more ambitious series of required seminars that wove together the needs of parents with those of children.
"You have to recognize how much parents are hurting," Dr. Wallerstein said. "You have to help them to feel less bewildered and to make informed decisions about custody and visitation. Still, the four-hour course sends a morally important message to parents: your children are of concern to society, and divorce has consequences for them. Not everybody knows that."
Judges say there have been complaints from lawyers about the program, especially at the beginning. "Lawyers thought we were intervening with their clients and were creating another bureaucratic step in the divorce process," said Judge Ayers of Indianapolis.
Judge White of Marietta added: "There was a lot of grumbling from lawyers at first -- they do not like new procedures -- but there was no organized resistance."
About 7,000 parents have attended the seminar here since it began. The program is largely supported by a $30 fee, which parents pay. The fee is waived for the 6 percent of parents who the court determines cannot afford it.
At the session last week, which was led by Ms. Bradburn-Stern and Mr. Aubrey, parents heard some basic facts about divorce in America, including these:
* More than one million children are affected by divorce every year.
* Half of those children will grow up in families where parents stay angry.
* Sixty percent of them will feel rejected by at least one parents.
"For children in a divorce, the family as they know it is no longer," Ms. Bradburn-Stern said. "That stability is now gone. Divorce is a process of loss. Children are scared.
"The family goes on after divorce, but it is restructured. How can you make it work, and make children feel loved and secure? Children need both parents. It is not easy to work that out. It takes time."
A few people in the audience dabbed at their eyes. Ms. Bradburn-Stern suggested that divorced parents create a business-style relationship with each other for matters concerning the children.
"Has anyone had the experience of doing business with someone you didn't like?" she asked. There was immediate laughter. "That is what this is like. You have to deal with the widget seller because you need a widget."
After the seminar, many parents said they had not wanted to attend, and in some cases were angry about being forced to do so. But they also said that in the end, they had found the morning useful.
"I thought, 'I don't need it, they won't tell me anything,' " said Patrick Brownlee, a restaurant manager who has two sons, 4 years and 19 months old. "But I learned I need to listen more to my kids, and not be so strict when they first come back after visiting their mother."
Jim Brown, a drafting engineer who has a 3-year-old son, said: "I don't advocate mandated programs, but this has a lot of value. I was aware that my son needs to be comforted by both his parents, but now I will make an extra effort."
Carla Kirby, a Juvenile Court clerical worker who has two sons, 1 and 2, said she had not looked forward to the program.
"I was apprehensive and didn't know what to expect," she recalled. "I did get something out of it. There is so much uncertainty when you get a divorce. This helps you know what to expect."

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXVI;
Minnesota Basking In Found Money

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 22

 BODY:
The downtown streets of the host city of Super Bowl XXVI are quiet, the climate-controlled skyway mall shopping areas less than bursting with activity.
Yet, the city awaits a mini-explosion of business beginning Thursday as tens of thousands of out-of-towners make their way to this city for a long weekend of marketing and glitz that happens to conclude with a football game on Sunday. 
 "Sixty thousand guests coming for three days," said Steve Davidson, a restaurateur, who will cater several major Super Bowl events. "All the hotels are booked up and everybody's got to eat."
 
Hotels and Restaurants Benefit
 Hotels and restaurants will be the prime economic beneficiaries of the boomlet coming to the seven-county Twin Cities area despite the recession. A University of Minnesota study predicts about $47 million in spending by the 58,000 out-of-town fans coming to the game (along with 6,400 other visitors believed to be coming sans tickets), including $9.4 million on hotels and $6.8 million on restaurants.
Spending on the six games played by the Minnesota Twins in the American League playoffs and the World Series was informally estimated at $18 million in October, the city's busiest convention month, when most guests coming to the area were forced to lodge outside Minneapolis and St. Paul.
But the Super Bowl, where 90 percent of the visitors come from elsewhere, is a different kind of economic event.
"For the middle of January, our slowest month, $50 million is gangbusters," said Greg Ortale, president of the Greater Minneapolis Convention and Visitor Association.
 
Booked Solid
 The area's 15,500 hotel rooms are booked solid from Friday through Sunday nights. Restaurant reservations are nearly as hard to get, unless you are Jim Kelly or Joe Gibbs.
But Ortale said the hotels were asked to require three-night minimum stays, not four, the norm for Super Bowl lodging, a strategy geared to speed booking for the hundreds of small and large groups that might have wondered how to spend an extra day in only the second cold-weather site to be host to a Super Bowl.
The average stay expected for visitors here is 2.5 days, down from 3.9 in Tampa, Fla., the warm-weather spot where last year's Super Bowl was played.
"For this month, we'd usually have an occupancy rate of 50 percent, but with the Super Bowl, we'll go up to 70 percent," said John Kelly, general manager of the Radisson Plaza, a downtown hotel. "We've been sold out of all 360 rooms since 1989."
 
No Warmth, No Beaches
 Local organizers have tried mightily to convince doubters that the area deserves the Super Bowl despite its freezing temperatures and foot-high snowfalls. No, they say, they cannot offer warm sun and beaches.
On one level, the Twin Cities are portrayed as a clean and friendly mecca of arts, sports and commerce, with networks of enclosed skyway shopping areas as warm as the Metrodome. But it also encourages its image as a winter playland, an identity enhanced by the opening Tuesday night of the St. Paul Winter Carnival ice palace, its 10 million pounds of ice rising 166 feet high.
"Some people around here wanted us to have 6 or 8 inches of snow so we can show we can live with it, and at 30 degrees and no snow, we can't celebrate winter," said Paula Gottschalk, executive director of the Minnesota Super Bowl XXVI, the task force that organized the Minneapolis bid for the Super Bowl and has organized local events (including handing out portable hand warmers).
But she was not upset that as of today, there was no snow falling and temperatures were in the relatively balmy 30's.
 
Showing Off the City
 Beyond what visitors spend during a Super Bowl -- and an estimated $60 million was spent by those attending Super Bowl XXV in Tampa -- the motive for being host to a Super Bowl is to show off the city for the regular business of tourism and conventions.
"It's quality of life and a city's image, factors that escape quantification," said the economist Robert Baade of Lake Forest College in Illinois, an expert in assessing the economic impact of stadiums and sports events.
The cumulative effect of, in the course of a year, being host to the Super Bowl, the World Series, the Stanley Cup finals, and, in March, the college basketball Final Four cannot hurt the area's viability, even in the midst of a nationwide recession, or the prospects for its new 200,000-square-foot convention center.
"We're not a cow town anymore, which we probably were as recently as 1970," said Wilbur Maki, the Univesity of Minnesota economist who performed the Super Bowl economic study. "We're also more than just a trade center for the Upper Midwest. We're a world city."

HEADLINE: MCI, Grown Big, Looks Abroad

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At the MCI Communications Corporation, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, they figure that this year is 8 A.D., or eight years after the formal divestiture of A.T.& T. The dark time before that is known as B.C. -- before competition.
But figured another way, this year is actually 10 A.D., 10 years after the initial agreement to dismantle the biggest company on earth. 
 Since then, industry competition is still expanding, more rapidly than ever, and MCI figures to benefit. New competition this year will arise overseas, where barriers are bound to fall in Europe and Asia, lowering prices for international long-distance calls and creating opportunities for former upstarts like MCI.
 
All Seek Foreign Accords
 The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, MCI and United Telecommunications' U S Sprint are all looking to reach agreements with giant foreign companies like Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, France Telecom, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and BT, the former British Telecommunications.
Such large foreign carriers will naturally want a foothold and an ally in the United States, if only to court lucrative corporate customers. "We think they'll come to us," said Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's president and chief executive. "A.T.& T.'s too big and their competitor in too many places, and Sprint's too small. So that leaves us and we'll be smiling."
Analysts agree, up to a point. "MCI is the premier competitor to A.T.& T.," said Robert B. Morris, a telecommunications analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But MCI itself may be getting too big, so they will have to watch out for smaller competitors, just like A.T.& T."
Now that A.T.& T., with its own aggressive discounts and marketing, has slowed MCI's gains in the domestic market, MCI has all the more need to expand its foreign business. Foreign alliances will aim first at providing services for large corporations to transmit huge amounts of data. But they may eventually help improve services for residential customers. The installation of more modern networks around the world over the next three years should make new voice, video and data services, like video conferencing and remote medical consultation, available in businesses and eventually the home.
The world's telephone companies, known in the business as PTT's, or post telephone and telegraphs, are mainly state-owned monopolies. But because of the unification of European markets that begins in earnest in 1993, the telephone monopolies will find European versions of MCI trying to offer cheaper services, especially to big business customers.
"The PTT's are just the Bell System with a foreign accent," said Daniel F. Akerson, an MCI executive vice president and a former executive of A.T.& T.'s long-distance service. "Anything you see happening here, you'll see overseas."
New competition will also come at home, as the very concept of a long-distance call is redefined. Today, a long-distance call is a call across the old Bell System borders -- more than 160 artificial divisions known as local access and transport areas. They have little relation to the cost of calls but were an administrative convenience for the old Bell System.
These artificial divisions mean that a 51-mile call in one jurisdiction may be local, while a 50-mile call elsewhere may be long distance. Sometimes, a local call costs more than a longer, long-distance call whose price is kept low by competition.
Iowa already allows some competition within these local access and transport areas, and Minnesota plans to. But the real money would be in crowded metropolitan areas, like the San Francisco Bay area. A call from San Francisco to San Jose, an hour's drive away, is still a local call, with charges by the minute. The price is determined only by Pacific Telephone with oversight by California regulators. MCI, U S Sprint and others are now banned from competing in such a lucrative market.
The last decade has seen how competition has already transfigured what was once called Plain Old Telephone Service. A.T.& T. enjoyed a near-monopoly in long-distance service, a total monopoly in local calls and high prices. Now it is out of short-haul calls altogether and has lost a third of its long-distance market to competitors, a market that last year was worth $61 billion, more than the annual revenue of Mobil.
MCI, which had about 1 percent of the long-distance market in 1982, had about 19 percent last year, or about 62 billion minutes of telephone use, according to Robert B. Morris, a telecommunications analyst at Goldman, Sachs. In 1991, it earned some $528 million on revenue of more than $8.5 billion.
MCI has been helped especially by its Friends and Family Progam, which offers 20 percent discounts to customers for, in effect, recruiting their friends to MCI.
Competition has also changed how consumers think about long-distance calls. Where once they put egg timers near the phones to remind chatty teen-agers to cut short their annual Thanksgiving talks with grandmother, long-distance calls, at least in the United States, now lack the glamour of extravagance.
Spurred by competition from MCI and U S Sprint, A.T.& T. has cut the cost of a 10-minute call from New York to Los Angeles by about 40 percent, or more than 60 percent adjusted for inflation. And new technology like digital switching and fiber-optic cables has made possible not only lower prices but also everything from the operation of office fax machines to the quick transfer of complex medical images between hospitals.
 
Origins of MCI
 All this hubbub in what was one of the most humdrum of utility services began in 1968 when William G. McGowan, an entrepreneur and the son of an Appalachian union organizer, helped found MCI, a microwave radio service that saved 80 percent on long-distance phone bills for truck drivers. Although aimed at a limited market, microwave transmission from tower to tower made possible a cheaper form of long-distance communication that was a clear threat to the 100-year-old A.T.& T.
The Justice Department suit against A.T.& T. followed shortly after a 1974 civil suit by MCI challenging the Bell monopoly. In 1982, A.T.& T., in order to end the lawsuit, agreed to spin off the local telephone companies and become a long-distance carrier. Two years later, Federal Judge Harold H. Greene carried out the company's breakup.
Hobbled but still active after a heart attack in 1986 and a heart transplant the following year, Mr. McGowan, 64 years old, has transferred day-to-day responsibilities to Mr. Roberts, 49, who added the chief executive's title last month.
"People forget what the Bell System was like," said Mr. Roberts, a former project director at Westinghouse Electric who joined MCI in 1972. "It was like a company that owned all the airlines, owned all the airports, plus the cabs, buses and subways from the airports."
With the phone company's dominance of both long-distance and local service, newcomers like MCI found it difficult to get customers. MCI and others could provide only limited long-distance service because they did not have access to the Bell System's local phone lines. "Our customers would get off our plane, but they couldn't get downtown because A.T.& T. owned the cabs, the buses and the subways and wouldn't let us on them," Mr. Roberts said
Now, with many so-called equal-access issues resolved by the Federal Communications Commission in favor of competition, MCI, Sprint and other carriers can compete on a more equal footing. Instead of having to dial cumbersome access codes with personal identification numbers, Sprint and MCI customers can now dial "1" plus their number -- the same as for customers of A.T.& T.
But A.T.& T. enjoys what MCI regards as unequal access in other areas. Credit-card calls, which are popular with business executives, favor A.T.& T. because its customers need only dial "0" and their number to begin the transactions.

Success, Then Anxiety, in Korea

BYLINE: By DAVID C. UNGER

 BODY:
South Korea's rush toward first world economic status has dazzled admiring outsiders. But it leaves many Koreans anxious that material advances may have come at a spiritual cost.
Three decades of thundering growth have revolutionized material life. In barely one generation, a nation of destitute peasants has become a nation of city dwellers addicted to cars and appliances. This new middle class threw off authoritarianism; democratic institutions are now taking root. 
 Seoul's diplomacy, long steeped in crude anti-Communism, has grown more sophisticated, yielding prizes like full relations with Moscow, economic ties with China, a United Nations seat and, most recently, reduced tensions with Communist North Korea.
As became evident on a recent visit, for many South Koreans these gains have not brought contentment.
Officials who served past dictators still hold office under President Roh Tae Woo, a former general. They seem uncomfortable with the tumult of free debate.
Executives of conglomerates like Hyundai and Daewoo complain of a weakened work ethic and pine for the paternalism of the past. They lament that recent wage gains, a product of more democratic labor relations, have dented the competitiveness of Korean exports. But productivity is again outstripping wage hikes. And South Korea's product mix keeps shifting upscale from clothing to ships to computers, suggesting more efficient use of an educated work force.
It's not just the powerful who fret. The former dissident leaders Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam worry that history may cheat them of their turn in the presidential Blue House. Both see this year's elections as a last chance. Kim Young Sam, now a Government stalwart, hopes Mr. Roh will anoint him as heir. Kim Dae Jung protests, as ever, the Government's failure to live up to democratic norms. But his criticism is undermined by a widespread belief that his own style is just as authoritarian.
Less-famous dissidents fear the formidable repressive apparatus that survives. A harsh National Security Law still restricts most forms of contact with North Korea. More than 1,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. And students continue to die at the hands of the police under suspicious circumstances.
Farm families are alarmed at U.S. pressure to permit rice imports. Without the income from rice prices protected at several times world market level, they fear they would be forced to give up the only way of life they know.
Almost all Koreans hope for an early end to the partition imposed on their nation in 1945. But some, noting Germany's recent experiences, fear the consequences of a too-sudden collapse in the North, perhaps following the death of Kim Il Sung, who is nearly 80.
Americans often carelessly lump Korea with Japan, or assume its history began with the Korean War. But Koreans are acutely conscious of their long cultural and political traditions. It was through Korean craftsmen and scholars that an isolated Japan first learned of Chinese civilization. Korea established a unified state earlier than any present European country and maintained its unity and independence for a millennium, until 1910.
The 20th century brought brutal Japanese colonialism, two devastating wars, partition of the Korean Peninsula and decades of dictatorship. Today wounded nationalism and intense pride play a prominent role in Korean life. Decent and educated Koreans suspect the U.S. of trying to prevent reunification and using exports to destroy the Korean way of life.
The Bush Administration has been adept in working out policies for a changing Korea, especially on the delicate issue of North Korea's nuclear plans. As South Korea develops its economic might, extends democracy and multiplies links with the North, Washington will need to broaden contacts north and south, showing due sensitivity to national pride. Korea, which has achieved so much, is worth the effort.

HEADLINE: Consumers Need Rules, Not Stunts

 BODY:
President Bush is about to declare a three-month halt to new Federal regulations, according to White House sources who choose to remain anonymous. And well they might. This idea is the purest campaign prattle.
The moratorium is said to be part of the President's economic revival plan, which he will outline in his State of the Union address next week. The underlying idea is that excessive regulation hampers growth. 
 For example, strict standards for waste disposal drive up the cost of the original product; likewise the new requirements for fuller disclosure in food labeling. Strict rules for issuing low-priced "penny stocks" make it harder for small ventures to get started.
A three-month breather, to take stock and revamp, would supposedly foster growth by freeing the private sector from unwanted surveillance. Also, regulatory measures that themselves stimulate economic activity, such as the approval of new drugs, would still be allowed, as would regulations with deadlines set by law.
There's certainly nothing wrong with regularly reviewing regulations to see if they are working as intended or need to be modified or even canceled. But a sudden halt can only confuse regulators and regulated alike, all the more so at a time of public alarm about the safety of personal products like breast implants and sleeping pills.
Mr. Bush is no doubt dismayed by the evidence that, during his three years in office, the volume of new regulation has soared back toward its level in the last year of the Carter Administration. He can blame his own effectiveness.
There has been a necessary growth of regulation to institute two new laws that Mr. Bush championed -- the Clean Air Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Also he picked good people, by and large, to run the regulatory agencies. Rather than undermine laws they are supposed to administer, as some Reagan appointees did, they enforce them.
Is the President now telling them they've done their jobs too well? Or pointing out that this is an election year, and he's feeling the heat from his backers in business?
A moratorium also raises questions about Vice President Quayle's vaunted Council on Competitiveness. It's supposed to keep an eye on overeager regulators. But it has only a small staff, and got bogged down in controversy when it tried to gut some widely supported environmental controls. So, faced with a storm of protest, the man who said he wanted to be the environment President now throws up his hands and says, O.K., we just won't have any regulations for a while.
The range of the moratorium's estimated benefits is a measure of the Administration's wishful thinking. One of those anonymous White House sources says it could save businesses $10 billion to $100 billion a year -- that is, no one really has the slightest idea. What's more, those supposed savings don't count their cost, in terms of diminished protection for public health and safety, as well as for consumers and investors.
After three years of Presidential inattention, three months of review seems an afterthought. Careful regulation is an honorable objective. But a freewheeling shutdown ignores modern reality. Increased regulation reflects the increased complexity of life.

Baker's Big Bash

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
America's $33-billion-a-year intelligence industry doesn't know what to tell President Bush about the central question facing three score foreign affairs bigwigs gathered in our capital this week: whether or not to pump serious money into embryonic Slavic capitalism.
The C.I.A. has just renamed its Soviet division to catch up with the times. (The first name suggested was Commonwealth of Independent States Office, but that led to the acronym "Kissoff," so it is called the Slavic and Eurasian office.) The spooks at Slav-Eu, headed by George Kolt, have long been high on Boris Yeltsin and his free-market reformers, and think that money to bolster the new states would be well invested. 
 However, the rest of the intelligence community, led by the State Department's Douglas Mulholand, is still grumpy about the rise in Moscow of the man it used to dump on as a "buffoon." The Yeltsin-bashers were mainly Gorbaphiles and Shevardnadzniks, enamored of the orderliness of central power, and now support only "humanitarian aid" -- mainly credits to buy Kansas grain -- secretly hoping Gorby's tidiness will make a comeback.
Where's Robert Gates, the new D.C.I., who once defied James Baker and took a hard line against the salvation of Communism?
He's torn. At the moment he is canvassing the entire Federal Government, looking for odd jobs and new bureaucratic missions to occupy his bloated agency, and needs the support of the Supreme Bureaucrat, James Baker, who can deliver O.M.B.'s Richard Darman. Secretary Baker arranged this week's diplomatic extravaganza to dramatize our interest in acting like a superpower -- while, in an election year, passing the tab to Japan and the Saudis.
The C.I.A. Director must rely on his former rival and State's attendant Yeltsin-demeaners to preserve his vast spookery. But at the same time, O. Ye Gates knows the risk to the U.S. of not helping the Yeltsinites in their hour of need: if the reformers fail, back comes sclerotic perestroika with a big army and we face a new time of global troubles.
It's a dilemma. If the C.I.A. advice is to provide only technical and emergency aid, that would suit the Bush-Baker inclination to badmouth foreign aid while piously deploring isolationism; but if the C.I.A. virtuously damns the politics and endorses the pro-Yeltsin opinion of its Slav-Eu experts, there may be no more clandestine cakes and ale.
I can sympathize with Mr. Gates because my own favorite Slav-euologists disagree.
Judy Shelton of the Hoover Institution was right in predicting "The Coming Soviet Crash" when all Western intelligence was wrong. She now holds that the reformers' flotation of the ruble is mistaken, and private investment will come only when spending is curbed, oil and food production are privatized, borders are opened and taxes reduced. With classic logic, this superb economist argues against government aid because only pain triggers basic change.
Anders Aslund accurately estimated the Soviet arms budget at an unsustainable 25 percent of G.N.P. at a time when the C.I.A. was blindly buying K.G.B. disinformation. Like Ms. Shelton, he resisted the siren song of Harvard's "grand bargaineers" to bail out Gorbachev with massive aid before Communism died and the Soviet empire broke up.
This free-market Swedish economist, who has the run of the Kremlin these days, tells me that supply-and-demand is working: fresh fish is on sale on Gorky Street for the first time in memory, at less than sky-high prices. And he says that armaments spending has been cut by 85 percent.
However, the Russian Central Bank is still pumping out inflationary credit to local banks locked into the old nomenklatura; as that is curbed, he thinks the time would be ripe to provide a $6 billion ruble-stabilization fund to spur capital investment.
Who's right, Judy or Anders? I don't know, and nobody can be certain; but the downside risk on helping now is little, and on not helping is great. So the prudent hard line is to help, and the President's $645 million pledge yesterday is not much help.
In making this painful choice, I am sending a message to our econo-spooks at the cookie-pushers' orgy: Make the aid call on its merits and let the pols take care of the politics.

'It Is Our Only Hope'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
Dov Frohman is one of Israel's high-technology business stars, a vice president of the California microcomputer company Intel and general manager of Intel Israel. Last year he won the Israel Prize for engineering and technology. A jolly man with a large beard, he has had an international career.
Twenty years ago in California Mr. Frohman invented the Eprom chip, a breakthrough that helped start Intel's phenomenal growth. He took a year off in Africa, teaching in Ghana and going up the Congo River in Zaire. Then he persuaded Intel, with much difficulty, to start operations in Israel. They have been a great success. 
 In a conversation the other day I asked him how Israel could provide employment for the Soviet Jews who want to come here. Some 325,000 have already arrived. Others are holding back because Israel's economy is weak and there are no jobs for them.
His answer was: Attract investment from abroad, especially in high-tech ventures. He said Israel had the asset of "qualified manpower, people of creativity, imagination. With globalization, everything in business is mobile except manpower. So companies are going to look for centers of excellence.
"So why don't we have more high-tech investment? The problem is political and economic stability. Why would a business want to go to an unstable place?"
The current peace negotiations with the Palestinians and neighboring Arab states are a major reason for hope, he said; even the fact that the parties are talking has changed the atmosphere.
"Peace is the great thing," Mr. Frohman said. "I don't think we can get accelerated growth unless we solve the problem."
Mr. Frohman is not alone in his belief that peace is a key to economic growth. Other business leaders have the same view. One is Aharon Dovrat, the founder of Israel's largest private conglomerate, Clal.
"Peace is a precondition to attract investment on any significant scale," Mr. Dovrat said. "It is our only hope.
"Give us peace, and it is a marvelous country -- with many reasons to attract investment. If Israel had had peace for the last 10 years, it would be approaching Switzerland.
"People won't send their money to a country that is full of unrest. The idea of attracting investment and at the same time building settlements on occupied land is completely crazy."
Ephraim Arazi, the founder of Scitex, Israel's biggest high-tech company, made a similar point on Israeli television recently. He said the country needs "a stable political atmosphere" and cannot have that if it goes on "playing a double game" in the West Bank -- not annexing it but not letting it be Palestinian territory.
"Menachem Begin understood that to make peace we had to give up territory," Mr. Arazi said. "He gave us a precedent. So let's do something."
An important American supporter of Israel, Laurence Tisch, the chairman of CBS, was interviewed by the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot. He said his companies would not invest in Israel now. The interviewer asked what would change that position.
"The peace process and privatization in Israel," Mr. Tisch replied. "An end to the Arab boycott and relations between Israel and the Arab states would create incredible investment possibilities in Israel.
"I hope the Israeli Government will understand the opportunity it has and will speed up the peace process."
It hardly needs to be said that the Government of Israel does not accept the industrialists' premise. Its policy is precisely to continue what Mr. Arazi called the "double game," not formally annexing the occupied territories but accelerating settlements in them.
The public is deeply divided. Polls suggest that a narrow majority would freeze the settlement process if that opened the way to agreement with the Palestinians.
But few people have probably framed the issue in the stark economic terms that are in the business people's minds: as a choice between continued occupation of the territories and economic growth. And Prime Minister Shamir, facing an election, is highly skilled at obscuring the choice -- at assuring Israelis that they can have it both ways.

HEADLINE: How to Make a Quick Economic Turnaround

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Let there be no mistake as to the causes of the current economic recession; understanding these causes will show us how to bring about a recovery. They are the past and current inappropriate monetary and fiscal policies, in order of importance. 
 From 1987 to 1990, the Federal Reserve had been tightening credit to fight a nonexistent inflation threat. The 1987 stock market crash and the mini-crash of 1989 were not enough to convince the Fed that its policy was wrong. It took the resulting recession and the dramatic fall of President Bush in the opinion polls to get it to lower interest rates.
In 1986 the discount and prime rates were 5.5 and 7.5 percent, respectively. Today they are 3.5 percent and 6.5 percent. The Fed has probably overreacted on the discount rate in this regard.
It is strange that during the Fed's tightening period, the voices of criticism were practically nonexistent; today many are calling for a further lowering of the discount rate. The Federal Reserve is now on the right track and should leave well enough alone.
As for fiscal policy, Congress and the Administration can correct the mistakes of the 1986 tax reform law by reinstating the tax deductibility of interest paid by consumers. The double taxation of interest income, as well as dividends, should be eliminated once and for all.
Congress and the Administration should follow this basic principle of taxing income only once and removing the tax on capital gains entirely. Dividends paid to stockholders should be a tax-deductible expense for corporations just as interest payments to bondholders are. Both interest and dividends are legitimate payments to long-term capital and should be treated the same.
By doing this immediately, Congress can help bring about a quick and dramatic turnaround in our economy. Bickering about taxing the rich and tax breaks for the middle class may score some political points, but they will delay needed policy changes and do very little for economic recovery and growth.

Tax-Cut Illusions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Don't Look for Jobs in Japan" (editorial, Jan. 6), you advocate stimulating the economy through further cuts in the interest rate and/or tax cuts and increases in government spending. Such policies have traditionally been used to pull the economy out of recession by stimulating demand. 
 But at a time when, as you say, Americans are already overconsuming, and when a disproportionate share of that consumption is of products made by other countries, such demand-based policies may do more to stimulate further the economies of those other countries than our own.
How many Americans, if they have extra cash in their pockets or can get a lower-rate loan, will use it to buy an American car? And of course at the same time lower interest rates make it even less attractive to put any of that extra cash into savings, which, as you rightly point out, is the real key to reinvigorating the American economy.

Reform Tax Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is a solution to correcting our depressed economy, but first we must identify its primary cause. It is the tax reform act of 1986, which put the crimp in the consumer real estate and automobile markets by the following changes:
(1) Raising rental residential real estate depreciation from 19 years to 29 1/2 years. 
 (2) Limiting investors in rental real estate to $25,000 of operating rental losses a year from unlimited losses prior to Jan. 1, 1987.
(3) Establishing limits on the deduction of consumer interest on loans on home real estate.
(4) Phasing out the deduction for consumer interest for loans on personal purchases such as automobiles.
These items were made too liberal in the early 1980's and needed to be corrected, but the adjustment was far too radical and had the effect of pulling the rug out from under the economy. We need to give relief by partially restoring these deductions on a temporary basis, if not permanently, to enable us to help pull the economy out of recession.
