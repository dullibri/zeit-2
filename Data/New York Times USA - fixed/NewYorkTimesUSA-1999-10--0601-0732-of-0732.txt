HEADLINE: No Republican, but Still a Thorn

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
At first glance, Patrick J. Buchanan appears sapped of the political potency that made him an important player in the 1996 Presidential campaign. His pitch then to the economically distressed now carries little appeal given the resurgence in New Hampshire. His comments about Hitler in his new book have drawn denunciations from all quarters.
In fact, Mr. Buchanan's failure to make a dent in polls of Republican voters practically drove him to the Reform Party. Even his bid for that party's nomination is hardly assured. Others with marquee names or fatter bank accounts -- Donald J. Trump, Jesse Ventura, Ross Perot -- may have an easier time navigating the byzantine, and costly, Reform Party rules for getting on state ballots. 
 And yet for all his apparent weaknesses, Mr. Buchanan may be the wild card of the 2000 campaign. He could cause incalculable mischief for both Republicans and Democrats because Mr. Buchanan has the unusual potential to strike a chord both among grass-roots conservatives and with union members who usually vote Democratic. He is, perhaps, the only candidate since George Wallace who has some appeal to those wings of both parties.
"He's an expert on getting attention for himself," said Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's Presidential campaign in 1996, "and he'll look to keep both parties in line on issues that he cares about like trade and his nationalist agenda."
Even if he does not ultimately win the Reform nomination next summer, Mr. Buchanan -- with his knack for forcefully and unabashedly speaking his mind -- could help drive the discourse in the coming months. As a longtime television commentator, he is a master at commanding television coverage -- and uttering the perfectly provocative sound bite.
The nightmare scenario for politicians on both sides would be for Mr. Buchanan to pop up on nationally televised debates next fall and bash both parties, much as he did in his announcement today.
Mr. Buchanan poses the biggest threat to Republicans because he still has a following in that party. On issues like human rights in China and national sovereignty, Mr. Buchanan could force Republican candidates to move to the right, something that could hurt them in a general election.
But the most daunting challenge for Republicans may be how to react to Mr. Buchanan. His hard-edged oratory at the Republican convention in 1992 frightened President George Bush's campaign. Some of the President's aides said Mr. Bush was more damaged by his handling of Mr. Buchanan -- giving him a prime speaking slot at the convention -- than by Mr. Buchanan's challenge itself.
Advisers to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner, said they were concerned that Mr. Buchanan, never warm to the Bush family, would use his new platform to upbraid the Governor.
Mr. Buchanan could also torment Democrats, particularly because of his appeal to labor. Even though he would have no formal role in the Democratic primaries, he could prod the Democratic contenders into stands that could hurt them in a general election, like making tougher environmental and worker safety regulations a priority to negotiating future trade treaties.
But there is another, more fundamental, reason for the Republicans to have more to fear. Except for 1976, when Jimmy Carter drew just over 50 percent of the vote, no Democratic Presidential candidate has ever drawn more than 50 percent since 1964. So the more divided the vote, the better for Democrats.
Mr. Buchanan's appeal to conservatives in a general election could also spell trouble for Republicans because it could enable Democrats to gain footholds in Southern and Mountain states where they might not have been competitive.
But for now at least, Mr. Buchanan has to get past Mr. Trump and others as he seeks the Reform nomination. That is why in his announcement today Mr. Buchanan did not dwell on topics like abortion and cultural values and concentrated on campaign finance reform, trade and other issues championed by the party's founder, Mr. Perot.
Yet Mr. Buchanan may have trouble convincing Reform members that he deserves their nomination. For all his emphasis on the party's issues, Mr. Buchanan hardly fits the mold of Mr. Perot -- or Mr. Ventura -- when he mentioned in his remarks that he had been a "Goldwaterite" and spoke with pride about his service to President Richard M. Nixon.
"The Buchanan candidacy has the highest likelihood of transforming the Reform Party from a party that connected politics to ordinary people to one that is ideological -- and potentially marginalized," said Steven J. Rosenstone, dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota and an expert on third parties. "With Buchanan you get an attitude and ideology, and that's a risk for the Reform Party."
Increasingly, Republicans appear uneasy with Mr. Buchanan as well. His support among Republicans has stood at about 4 percent in recent polls by ABC News.
"Pat Buchanan didn't quit the Republican Party as much as the Republican Party quit Pat Buchanan," said Gary Langer, ABC's polling director.
His strains with Republicans will probably make it far less likely that Republican candidates would cave to Mr. Buchanan, as they did in 1992.
"Let's assume George W. Bush is the nominee," said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican House member from Oklahoma who teaches at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "I don't see him being pushed."
Indeed, advisers to Mr. Bush insisted that they would never consent to include Mr. Buchanan in a candidates' debate.
If Mr. Buchanan wins the Reform nomination, he will get $12.6 million in Federal money because Mr. Perot drew more than 5 percent of the vote as the party's candidate in 1996. But while that would seem like a fortune to Mr. Buchanan's bare-bones operation, it would not go far in a general election.
"I like Pat a lot," said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who has made a cause of opposing new campaign spending restrictions. "But the notion that $13 million is a pot of gold is laughable on its face. That's about half a Senate race in New York. We're talking about running for President of the United States."

HEADLINE: For Gore and Bradley, A Search for Distinction

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley have a lot more in common than either would like to admit to Presidential primary voters.
Each will try to emphasize differences that matter to those voters when they debate for the first time in New Hampshire on Wednesday night. But in fact, the two Democrats have spent the bulk of their public service careers as generally liberal members of Congress, with a quite similar approach to the job. 
 Their likenesses start with their voting records, during Mr. Bradley's 18 years in the Senate and Mr. Gore's 8 years there, after serving 8 years in the House. Mr. Bradley, plainly seeking to run to Mr. Gore's left on issues from health insurance to gun control, was a bit more liberal in the eyes of old-fashioned liberals and environmentalists. But to some groups, like the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and conservative groups, their records were almost identical.
But a Congressional record, if it means anything at all, is more than a compilation of votes, and the Bradley-Gore similarities extended well beyond the yeas and nays.
Each was effective in learning a complex, "eyes glaze over" issue and putting it on the national agenda.
For Mr. Gore, there was global warming, arms control questions and computer technology. "I think my work on arms control made a contribution at a critical time toward the creation of a new consensus on strategic stability," Mr. Gore said in a recent interview. And he said his work on environmental issues also helped to generate a consensus, both for the Superfund program to clean up toxic waste sites and for addressing global environmental problems.
For Mr. Bradley, there was third world debt, international trade and tax simplification. He was central to the 1986 tax reform act that lowered tax rates and closed loopholes, which he pursued with "a single-mindedness that was sometimes irritating to my family," he said in an interview. But in the end, he added, "it became the symbol of doing very big things in a bipartisan way."
Neither man was known in Congress as an orator. But Mr. Gore rose to a dramatic occasion to explain his vote to authorize war in the Persian Gulf in 1991, when he broke with almost all other Democrats, including Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Bradley was unaccustomedly eloquent the next year in warning of deteriorating race relations.
Neither was especially chummy with colleagues, though Mr. Gore had more friends in the House than both of them put together had in the Senate. Mr. Gore's run for the Presidency in his first Senate term made him seem presumptuous to some senators, and he was snidely labeled Prince Albert.
That lack of loyal allies may be one reason why neither had a striking record of getting laws passed, though each had a few accomplishments. A more telling reason may be that neither served long enough to head a committee, though Mr. Bradley dealt impressively with Western water rights as a subcommittee chairman. In a similar position, Mr. Gore first began warning of global warming and the greenhouse effect.
In a campaign, each will try to make an issue out of past votes, especially as proof of comparative constancy and sincerity, as reasons to trust their promises for the future.
Mr. Gore, for example, has criticized Mr. Bradley for voting in 1992, 1994 and 1996 for school vouchers that parents could use to pay private and parochial school tuition. The New Jersey Senator said he supported only an "experiment," and today he opposes vouchers. That quarrel is intended to attract the votes of public school teachers.
Similarly, Mr. Bradley's insistence that he has been "a consistent and unwavering supporter of a woman's right to choose" whether to have an abortion is directed at another important Democratic primary constituency: voters for whom abortion rights are the prime issue.
Mr. Gore's current position is indistinguishable from Mr. Bradley's, but before he first ran for President in 1987 it was generally anti-abortion.
In the House, he generally opposed Federal funding for abortions for poor women on Medicaid. In the mid-1980's, the Tennessee Representative regularly wrote constituents who asked his views: "I have strongly opposed Federal funding of abortions. In my opinion, it is wrong to spend Federal funds for what is arguably the taking of a human life."
But by the time he was seeking votes in Democratic Presidential primaries in 1988, Mr. Gore was equivocating, and by 1992 he supported his party's position in favor of Medicaid financing for abortions.
The environment is an important point of comparison. Mr. Gore has built much of his reputation in that area, although when it came to voting records, the League of Conservation Voters judged him "right" just 64 percent of the time, compared with 84 percent for Mr. Bradley.
Mr. Gore is best known for big concepts, like global warming and the threat to the ozone layer. The legislative results were not always dramatic, although he led a successful effort to limit CFC's in the 1990 Clean Air Act and was deeply involved with the Superfund program in the House. But since the Clinton Administration has not been as dedicated to those concerns as Mr. Gore was as a lawmaker, they sometimes seem to do him little good today.
Mr. Bradley is known more for specifics -- for filibustering an effort to undo Federal protection of millions of acres in Utah, for securing the Sterling Forest preserve in New Jersey and New York and, most of all, for the 1992 California water rights legislation. That law forced farmers to pay more than a token price for Central Valley water and made the water available for urban use.
That legislation began as an issue that Mr. Bradley said "I knew nothing about" but was his to deal with when he became a subcommittee chairman. He studied it, held hearings, found allies and maneuvered the bill into law, using election year pressures to get President George Bush to sign it.
Mr. Gore was among an influential band of House Democrats who threatened in 1983 to oppose deployment of the MX missile unless the Reagan Administration would start talking to Moscow about arms controls. In the Senate he was among the advocates of reducing the use of multiple warheads.
One successful legislative effort that brought Mr. Gore recent grief was technology. In March he said he "took the initiative in creating the Internet." Republicans laughed him off the political stage for that one, with Dan Quayle saying if that was true, he had invented spell-check. In fact, Mr. Gore's efforts to promote supercomputing and high-speed communications networks are acknowledged by the developers of the process to have played an essential role.
Today, Mr. Gore makes his Internet boast in more convoluted language: "My work on technology included efforts to promote funding for the technologies that were used by people who expanded early prototypes of the Arpanet that later became the Internet." He grinned and added, "I hope I have buffered that adequately."
Mr. Bradley's greatest Senate accomplishment was the 1986 tax reform act that "nobody in Washington thought would really happen," as he put it in the interview.
Tax fairness was an issue he brought to Washington. "I had always been upset by a system where people who were able to use loopholes paid less than people who did not," he said. He put the idea in a book, pestered colleagues, worked with the Reagan Administration and Senator Bob Packwood, chairman of the Finance Committee, and ultimately lobbied the House by playing basketball with members in the House gym -- an activity he had avoided since his election in 1978.
But that was 13 years ago. Since 1986, he said, "billions of loopholes have come back in and rates have gone back up."
Mr. Bradley argues that his work on various trade measures, from the Uruguay Round to the North American Free Trade Agreement, played important roles in strengthening the economy. And he was an early critic of Moscow's economic policies in the last days of the Soviet Union.
One issue central to his Presidential campaign on which he was almost invisible in Congress is health insurance. In the 1993-94 fight over President Clinton's plan or various alternatives, the Finance Committee on which he served was a central battleground. He explained his inactivity by saying he followed the lead of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the committee chairman, who waited in vain for Republicans to compromise.
To one longtime observer of Congress, Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, what made both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley "considerably better than average Senators" was their ability to bring issues to national attention. "Other than Pat Moynihan," he said, "I couldn't pick someone better in the House or Senate to put an issue into play."

HEADLINE: Buchanan Bolts G.O.P. for Reform Party Run

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: FALLS CHURCH, Va., Oct. 25

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan put aside a lifetime of Republican fervor today and shifted his lagging Presidential quest to a run for the Reform Party nomination.
"Our vaunted two-party system is a snare and a delusion and a fraud upon the nation," Mr. Buchanan told a crowd of cheering supporters as he bolted the Republican Party, showing his fiery instinct for insurgency. "Our two parties have become nothing but two wings on the same bird of prey." 
 As visceral on the stump as ever, Mr. Buchanan, his campaign for the Republican nomination frozen in the single-digit doldrums, lambasted the two major parties as havens for big-money donors and "hollow" candidates who have "rigged the game" against him.
"We choose not to play our assigned walk-on role in their sham election," Mr. Buchanan declared to the delight of a partisan crowd that included Reform Party officials and loyalists from his three failed bids for the Republican Presidential nomination.
"Only the Reform Party offers the hope of a real debate and a real choice of destinies," he insisted in resorting to the alternative ticket created by Ross Perot as a lever of populist power in the 1992 Presidential election.
In a bizarre contest for the 2000 nomination taking shape between Reform Party factions, Donald J. Trump, the real estate developer, has quit the Republican Party and is threatening to challenge Mr. Buchanan, denouncing him as a "Hitler lover." Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, the party's major elected figure, openly questions Mr. Buchanan's switch of parties. While Mr. Perot is proclaiming neutrality, even the Buchanan supporters agree that Mr. Perot remains a quixotic figure.
As soon as Mr. Buchanan confirmed his third-party course, he was attacked by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner who is considered the candidate most likely to lose votes next year should Mr. Buchanan attract serious numbers of conservative voters.
Insisting that Mr. Buchanan left the Republican Party for no reason other than a failed candidacy, Mr. Bush criticized Mr. Buchanan's isolationist views, in particular his thesis that Hitler had initially presented no serious threat to the United States in World War II.
"Pat sees an America that should have stayed home while Hitler overran Europe and perpetrated the Holocaust," Mr. Bush contended in a statement expressing confidence that most conservative Republicans would not follow Mr. Buchanan. In the weeks before Mr. Buchanan's announcement, Mr. Bush had refrained from harsh criticism in the hope of keeping him in the party.
But Mr. Buchanan hardly apologized for his views as he rued the decline of "all the great empires of Europe" and the rise of "a superstate in Europe that pays homage to the great god Mammon" which, he said, ties up American soldiers in a "godless new world order."
"They call us isolationists, and that's one of the nicest things they call us," he declared, drawing laughter from the crowd at the Doubletree Hotel here in the western Washington suburbs, miles from what Mr. Buchanan termed "the Beltway elites."
"Well, if they mean I intend to isolate America from all the bloody, territorial, tribal and ethnic wars of the 21st century, I plead guilty!" he boomed, drawing the crowd to its feet in a wave of applause and cheers.
Once more offering himself as the unabashed candidate of America First policies, Mr. Buchanan vowed to "rescue our lady, America" from what he termed "the cultural and moral pit into which she has fallen."
"We need a timeout on legal immigration to ease the downward pressure on workers' wages," he maintained, "And to defeat the forces of separatism that threaten us and nations all over the world."
With fresh campaign logos and a new red, white and blue Internet site (www.buchananreform.com) the 60-year-old politician sought to retool his candidacy with a speech laced with the sorts of lines that first brought him success as a speech writer for President Richard M. Nixon.
The crowd roared as he denounced President Clinton as "our own Elmer Gantry, whose desecration of the temples of our civilization and personal misconduct disqualify him" as the nation's leader.
Supporters roared again as Mr. Buchanan declared, "The appeasement of Beijing is a bipartisan disgrace!"
And they stood and cheered as he bitterly denounced the Supreme Court and vowed to "herd the Justices back into the narrow stalls" of constitutionalism. "What is a self-governing people doing meekly waiting each week for nine jurists to tell us how we may live and how we should govern ourselves?" he demanded, playing to the libertarian instincts of the Reform Party even as he denounced the legalization of abortion in "that abomination they call Roe v. Wade."
Wielding a palette filled with shades of national sovereignty, Mr. Buchanan attacked employment quotas as un-American, declaring: "The backsliding toward hyphenated Americanism must end." In short order, he attacked the United Nations, global economic treaties and "I.M.F. bailouts of deadbeat dictators."
In abandoning a Republican primary contest dominated solidly so far by Mr. Bush, Mr. Buchanan set a course in which he must now fight state by state to win support for the nomination.
"We've got to get on 30 ballots," said Bay Buchanan, Mr. Buchanan's sister and chief strategist.
Ms. Buchanan noted the campaign had hired Matt Sawyer, an election law specialist who had helped Mr. Perot navigate the thicket of widely varying state election laws.
Beyond the 30 states on which Ms. Buchanan is focusing, the Reform Party was already established in 20 states where the Buchanan camp was counting on help from such party veterans as Pat Choate, Mr. Perot's confidante and former Vice-Presidential running mate. Mr. Choate has been openly piloting Mr. Buchanan's veer toward the Reform ticket.
Reform Party rules require a prospective nominee to try to qualify for the ballot in the 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, where the party does not have an automatic slot. The nominee will be selected at a party convention in July.
Mr. Choate conceded Mr. Buchanan might have a problem because of the opposition expressed by Governor Ventura, who is encouraging talk of a Trump candidacy.
"It's not helpful, but it will not keep him from getting the nomination," Mr. Choate said of Mr. Buchanan's chances, estimating that the enthusiastic crowd here of more than 300 people included a majority of the party's current state chairmen.
Republicans have asserted that money, not principle, prompted the switch by Mr. Buchanan. The Reform nominee will be entitled to $12.6 million in Federal campaign funds. But Bay Buchanan said that was not reason for the Reform venture, while Mr. Buchanan insisted that disgust drove him from the Republican Party.
"The Republican Party has been good to me," he told the crowd. "And I have tried to be loyal to it. But as John F. Kennedy said, 'Sometimes party loyalty asks too much.' And today, it asks too much of us."
Expressing anguish at quitting his life-long party, Mr. Buchanan nonetheless beamed in summoning his followers to a new course, using his old imagery of an assault on the castle of the establishment.
"You don't know this peasant army," he said, grinning. "We have not yet begun to fight."
Mr. Buchanan, ever a history buff, noted this was St. Crispin's Day -- a reference to King Henry V's defeat of the superior forces of France at Agincourt on this day in 1415. "Let's make a little history," he said, looking eager as he took up a different battle flag.

HEADLINE: To the Rear, March!

 BODY:
Early on, George W. Bush and some other prominent Republicans went through the motions of trying to prevent Patrick Buchanan's announcement that he was "ending my lifelong membership in the Republican Party." But in the end, no one seemed very upset by Mr. Buchanan's exit or by Donald Trump's simultaneous defection to the Reform Party. But while Mr. Trump's presidential dreaming had the feel of a self-indulgent lark, Mr. Buchanan's seems a blend of financial scheming, retro rage and perhaps a bit of self-delusion. Does anyone believe that Mr. Buchanan's "peasant army" really exists? It may be ready to storm the castle, but it certainly did not help its man in the G.O.P. polls.
Mr. Buchanan's failure to make the grade against Mr. Bush and John McCain will not matter, of course, if he can get hold of the party's $12.6 million in federal funds. Then Mr. Buchanan, a wealthy Washingtonian, will have all the money he needs to mount his faux-populist crusade against the "money boys and the Beltway elites." 
 Fittingly, he embarked on his departure with an allusion to the St. Crispin's Day speech in Shakespeare's "Henry V," a paean to what true leadership meant at the end of the Middle Ages. He then went on to promise battle on a number of issues that most Americans have already worked through. At a time when American culture and economic values are on the march around the globe, Mr. Buchanan wants to save America "before she disappears into a godless New World Order." His mission, he said, is to end the racial quotas that have helped minorities enter the mainstream and to force a "time out" in the immigration that perpetually revitalizes an immigrants' nation. He promised to keep America from entering "all the bloody, territorial, tribal and ethnic wars" of the 21st century, thus crippling the halting but vital effort to find international remedies to genocidal conflicts.
Such efforts to isolate America from the real issues of the 21st century should help isolate Mr. Buchanan. Already his views on why the United States should not have entered World War II against Hitler's Germany have drawn understandable outrage, not only from veterans but also historians. Mr. Trump, who sees himself as a possible antidote to the Buchanan forces, calls Mr. Buchanan a "Hitler lover." Mr. Buchanan has rejected such a label, but his warlike oratory draws fringe voters and surrounds his candidacy with the persistent whiff of racism and anti-Semitism.
Mr. Buchanan seems to believe that his divisive social views will open up pockets of discontent in the middle class and that his protectionist trade policy and promises of job protection can pull in suburban and union workers normally loyal to the major parties. First, of course, he must wrest the Reform Party from the likes of Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, Ross Perot, whose ambitions for the party are still fairly cloudy, and perhaps even Mr. Trump. Meanwhile, we have to wonder if the idealists who initially joined the Reform Party think that roster adds up to a rational definition of reform.

HEADLINE: Argentina After Mr. Menem

 BODY:
Argentine voters have clearly wearied of the flamboyant style of President Carlos Saul Menem, who rode the old populist party of Juan Domingo Peron to power in 1989 and has held office ever since. On Sunday they resoundingly elected Fernando de la Rua, the decidedly uncharismatic, non-Peronist Mayor of Buenos Aires, to succeed Mr. Menem after his second term ends in December.
Yet a more positive aspect of Mr. Menem's legacy was evident in the campaign and voting, which were notable for their democratic ordinariness in a country where presidential transitions have typically been accompanied by calls to class warfare and rumblings of military revolt. During his two terms Mr. Menem successfully weaned the military of its addiction to coups, completed Peronism's evolution from a demagogic movement to a responsible political party, and returned Argentina to the mainstream of international affairs after decades of protectionism and reflexive opposition to Washington and much of the modern world. 
 Many of Mr. Menem's achievements stemmed from his unexpected decision early in his first term to embrace free trade and monetary orthodoxy. Until then, Argentine democracy was chronically weakened by frequent bouts of hyperinflation that sometimes provided the excuse for military intervention. But the Menem years were also marred by charges of judicial manipulation and corruption. For many years, human rights issues stemming from the "dirty war" of the 1970's and early 1980's were shoved aside until public opinion forced the government to re-examine cases of military kidnapping, torture and murder.
Throughout all this, Mr. Menem retained much of his personal popularity. But the Argentine Constitution prevented him from running this year. the Peronists ran a candidate, Eduardo Duhalde, who seemed to portend a continuation of the past decade's cronyism without its reforms. The voters preferred Mr. de la Rua, who promised to halt corruption and end the impunity of the politically well connected from prosecution.
That will be his biggest challenge, and it will not be easy. Mr. de la Rua will have to work with Menem-era judges and a Peronist-dominated Senate. What he will most likely not have to worry about is military plotting or an opposition that does not respect democracy's ground rules. For that, Mr. Menem deserves much of the credit.

HEADLINE: John Chafee, Republican Senator and a Leading Voice of Bipartisanship, Dies at 77

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, the last of the Rockefeller Republicans and an increasingly isolated voice of internationalism and bipartisanship in his party, died on Sunday.
Senator Chafee died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., a Washington suburb, his office announced. He was 77. 
 His major domestic efforts involved the environment and health policy, and he was responsible for a vast expansion of Medicaid, the Federal health program for the poor, in the 1980's.
A Marine veteran of Guadalcanal and the Korean War, Mr. Chafee made his last major effort in the Senate this month in seeking to postpone a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. When the Senate went ahead and voted on the pact that would have banned underground nuclear testing, he was one of four Republicans to support ratification.
In his final Senate speech, on Oct. 13, he said, "We signed this treaty recognizing that discouraging other nuclear powers and would-be nuclear powers from testing these weapons would lessen the unthinkable possibility that the nuclear option would ever be employed."
Far from threatening American security, he said, the treaty "locks in a status quo in which the United States has an enormous advantage."
In partisan terms, his death will not change the Senate's 55-to-45 Republican advantage. Lincoln C. Almond, Rhode Island's Republican Governor and a Chafee protege, will appoint a successor to serve until Jan. 3, 2001. Among the early favorites is Lincoln Chafee, the Senator's son, who is the Mayor of Warwick. Lincoln Chafee was already a candidate for his father's seat after the elder Chafee announced on March 15 that he would retire when this term ended.
The most immediate impact in the Senate could be on environmental issues. Senator Chafee, as chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, has bottled up a number of pro-business changes in environmental laws that other Republicans want. Senator Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire, who announced this year that he was leaving the Republican Party but who still enjoys its seniority, is next in line for the chairmanship.
But a spokesman for Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, said today that it was "premature for any kind of discussion" of the chairmanship.
In a larger sense, Mr. Chafee's death leaves the Senate with only two relatively moderate Republicans in positions of power.
Senator John W. Warner of Virginia is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana heads the Agriculture Committee. But neither has been as eager as Mr. Chafee to work with Democrats or as ready to cross the Republican leadership.
In recent years the Senate has lost a significant group of Republicans who found it natural to seek bipartisan alliances: Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, John C. Danforth of Missouri, Nancy Kassebaum Baker of Kansas, Hank Brown of Colorado.
Today that talent, exemplified by Mr. Chafee, was cheered chiefly by Democrats. Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a frequent collaborator on issues like health care and welfare reform, said: "We lost one who was part of our centrist coalition, and the country has lost someone who was always putting his country ahead of party politics. He was part of a group that should be growing in numbers, not diminishing, but we become more polarized each year.
"The Senate and this country have lost a leader who put his country's interests before partisan politics."
President Clinton, who had hoped in vain for Mr. Chafee's help on national health insurance in 1993 and 1994, said today: "Rhode Island and America have lost a great leader and a fine human being, who in 23 years in the Senate and in his service as Secretary of the Navy, always put his concern for the American people above partisanship. When you think of the term 'bipartisan,' you immediately think of John Chafee."
And while some Republican conservatives have sniped at Mr. Chafee over the years, and even dumped him from the chairmanship of their party conference in 1990, their reactions today were warm.
Senators were visibly upset as they spoke and after they left the floor. One whose voice broke with emotion was Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, declined to speak to a reporter about a national security budget matter, saying he had just finished giving a Chafee tribute.
John Hubbard Chafee was descended from one of the "five families" of Rhode Island, Yankees who ran the state before immigrants changed its political complexion in the 30's.
He was at Yale when World War II began and he enlisted in the Marines, serving in battles at Guadalcanal and Okinawa, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He returned to Yale and went to Harvard Law School before being recalled to active duty in Korea in 1951.
He practiced law and served six years in the Rhode Island Legislature, becoming minority leader of the State Assembly. In 1962 he became only the third Republican elected governor in 30 years, squeaking through by 398 votes.
He was an unabashedly liberal governor. He pushed for anti-discrimination laws in housing and employment before the Federal Government passed them. He advocated the construction of Interstate 95, developed parks throughout the small state and pushed through a state plan of health care for the elderly before Congress enacted Medicare.
In Presidential politics, Mr. Chafee had opposed Barry Goldwater's bid for the 1964 Republican nomination, and in 1968 he backed Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York against Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. While Mr. Rockefeller got all 14 of Rhode Island's delegate votes, it was not nearly enough.
Mr. Chafee himself was victim of a political upset that fall, losing a bid for a fourth term as governor to Frank Licht. Mr. Chafee had halted his campaigning after his 14-year-old daughter, Tribbie, had died a few weeks before the election after being kicked in the head by a horse.
 But despite his support for Mr. Rockefeller, the Nixon Administration found a place for him, and he reveled in the post of Navy Secretary. His most striking decision was made on May 6, 1969, when he blocked any court martial of the commander and the intelligence officer of the Pueblo, which had been captured by North Korea in 1968.
They had been held prisoner for 11 months, and Secretary Chafee said, "They have suffered enough." Moreover, he concluded that the capture was the result of a failure shared by the entire Navy chain of command.
"The major factor which led to the Pueblo's only confrontation by unanticipated bold and hostile forces was the sudden collapse of a premise which had been assumed at every level of responsibility and upon which every other aspect of the mission had been based -- freedom of the high seas," he wrote. "The consequences must in fairness be borne by all, rather than by one or two individuals whom circumstances had placed closer to the actual event."
He resigned in 1972 and ran for the Senate against Claiborne Pell. But in a strongly Democratic state, he lost despite Mr. Nixon's landslide. After that Mr. Chafee returned to practicing law in Providence, until he ran again for the Senate in 1976 and won.
The Senate he joined in 1977 was a far less partisan institution than today's, and he could support President Carter and the Panama Canal treaty without repercussions from his Republican colleagues. And when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, Mr. Chafee eagerly proclaimed it a Republican victory, not a conservative one, and promised moderate support on major issues like the economy.
But he also moved forward with his own priorities. Year after year in the 1980's, as Congress cut the budget for other social programs, he engineered expansions of Medicaid, extending coverage to millions of pregnant women and children.
Taken together, the changes altered a basic concept of Medicaid, breaking the link that for more than two decades had tied Medicaid eligibility to the receipt of cash welfare benefits. As a result of his efforts, Congress allowed and in some cases required states to help pay medical bills for certain low-income people who were not receiving welfare.
Mr. Chafee helped write a provision of the 1996 welfare law intended to guarantee continued Medicaid coverage for families losing cash assistance.
Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, said: "Senator Chafee was involved in virtually every important change in the Medicaid program since the late 1970's. He led efforts to expand maternal and child health programs. He had an undying commitment to Medicaid recipients with disabilities. He made great efforts to preserve and strengthen the health care safety net, assuring adequate payments for community health centers that care for huge numbers of uninsured patients."
Despite fighting the Reagan Administration over military spending, he was elected to the Senate Republicans' third-ranking position, chairman of the Republican Conference, in 1984. He was ousted from that position in 1990 by the more conservative Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who in turn was pushed aside by more conservative rivals.
But that year he also played a central role in reauthorizing the Clean Air Act, one of the nation's landmark environmental laws. That was only one of the achievements hailed by environmentalists today. Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, cited that bill and also said Mr. Chafee played an even greater role later as a "one-man front line" defending laws against the "Republican far-right wing."
"No one will ever know how many bad things did not happen in the last three years because John Chafee was there," Mr. Pope said. At least one of Mr. Pope's evils was easy to identify. When Republicans recaptured the Senate in 1995, Mr. Chafee became chairman of the Environment Committee. He showed a chairman's power when he simply refused to bring up a rewritten version of the landmark Clean Water Act of 1972. The House-passed measure would have weakened or revoked a number of pollution control requirements.
In the 1990's, despite the loss of his formal Republican Party leadership position, his friend Senator Bob Dole of Kansas put him in charge of a task force to define Republican policy on national health insurance. The Chafee group rejected the idea of requiring employers to buy coverage for their workers, which was central to the Democratic plan, but instead advocated requiring people to get insurance, with Federal subsidies for those who could not afford it.
As the issue heated up in 1993 and 1994, Mr. Dole backed away from it. When Mr. Chafee, Mr. Breaux and others struggled, in dozens of meetings in a Capitol hideaway, to compromise with the Clinton plan, they could get no more than a handful of Republicans who would vote to break the Dole filibuster. Their effort, like Mr. Clinton's, foundered.
Mr. Danforth, a central ally in that cause and a frequent dinner companion during late Senate nights, reflected today that one of the best things about Mr. Chafee at that moment was that "when it fell apart, there was no bitterness." Mr. Danforth added: "He was a person who really wanted to make things better. He was the opposite of an 'aginner.' "
And while the big effort failed, elements of the Chafee-Breaux "Mainstream Coalition" plan reappeared in law in later years, and Mr. Chafee played a major role in getting a plan to insure more children -- though it was initiated by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah -- enacted in 1997.
But while Mr. Chafee clashed often with the increasingly conservative Republican Senate leadership, he was hardly predictable. Among his last votes was opposition to an effort to cut off debate on campaign finance legislation last week. He said the bill had been weakened too much.
He is survived by his wife, Virginia; four sons, John Jr., of Los Angeles, Lincoln, of Warwick, Quentin, of North Kingstown, R.I., and Zechariah, of Providence, R.I.; a daughter, Georgia Nassikas of McLean, Va.; three sisters, Janet Cushman of Quebec, Susan Welch of Bethany, Conn., and Alexandra Reynolds of North Kingstown, and 12 grandchildren.
Mr. Chafee's sense of history was central to his final public appearance, last Thursday night. He spoke at the Washington National Cathedral to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
He said: "Naysayers may ask, What difference does saving one train station or post office truly make in the future of America? My response is this: Preservation is not just about preserving brick and mortar, lintel and beam. It is about the quality of life, and the possibility of a bright future. Carl Sandburg expressed the danger of losing touch with our past when he said, 'If America forgets where she came from, if people lose sight of what brought them along, then will begin the rot and dissolution.' "

HEADLINE: Growers' Lament: The Crop's Bright Red, but So Is the Ink

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: ENTIAT, Wash.

 BODY:
In one way, the news this year from Bruce Grim's orchard, and from orchards all over this region that proudly calls itself the Apple Capital of the World, is very good news indeed. "Vintage!" Mr. Grim proclaimed as he plucked a red Delicious from a tree and sliced it open with a pocketknife. "Lots of crunch. Lots of snap."
"Great internals," he said, referring to the flavor and texture. "Terrific external, too," he added, appraising the color. 
 But wide agreement about the outstanding quality of this year's crop in the nation's top apple-producing state belies a disturbing trend: no one here seems to be making any money growing apples.
For the last several years, growers here have had to deal with some of their worst times ever, a result of stagnation in domestic demand, grocery-industry consolidation that gives large buyers the upper hand in negotiating price, and a flood of imports from China that has driven the price of apples used in making juice so low that last year many farmers, rather than picking all their product, simply let some of it rot in the orchard.
That the nation's economy is roaring along in so many other respects only makes the plight of those who grow this most American of fruits all the more frustrating.
"I keep reading about the big economic boom in Seattle," 150 miles to the west, on the other side of the Cascade Mountains, said Grant Daniel, a grower just across the Columbia River from Mr. Grim. "Well, there's no boom going on out here on these orchards."
Last year the state's apple growers saw their lowest return in three decades, with the typical family orchard, of 50 acres, losing between $70,000 and $100,000, according to the Washington Growers Clearing House Association, an industry group. The association says that 20 percent of the state's growers have gone out of business in the last five years and that another 20 percent, or 800 orchards, will do so over the next three years.
"A lot of people have financed this year's crop on the credit card," said Kirk Mayer, the association's manager. "They're basically trying to buy their orchard all over again from the bank. But it's a very uphill proposition."
Washington State grows about half of all the nation's apples, followed by New York and Michigan, with about 10 percent each. Growers of all apple varieties in those states and elsewhere around the country received an average of 17.1 cents a pound for their product last year, 18 percent to 29 percent less than in the three years before and, after adjustment for inflation, one of the lowest prices since the Great Depression, said Kraig Naasz, president of the U.S. Apple Association, a national trade group.
The decline in prices for juice apples, generally of lower quality than apples marketed for eating, has been even more stark. Having averaged $189 a ton in 1995, those prices have dropped consistently since then, to an average of $40 a ton last year; many growers around here say they got as little as $10 a ton.
The apple association, arguing that "a flood of cheap apple-juice concentrate imports from China is drowning much of our industry in a sea of red ink," filed a petition earlier this year with the United States Department of Commerce and the Government's International Trade Commission. The association argued that China, now the largest apple producer in the world, was dumping its product -- that is, deliberately undercutting American apples by selling at below-cost prices -- and sought punitive tariffs on the United States' Chinese apple-juice imports. A decision is expected later this fall.
In the meantime, though, many growers here either have given up or say they are on the verge of going broke. Many say, too, that they are particularly angry that even as the prices they receive have plunged in recent years, the cost to the consumer has actually inched upward slightly over the last decade.
It is not at all hard to understand just why that is happening. Consolidation in the grocery industry, for one thing, has clearly given an advantage to the buyers.
"When you have over 100 suppliers in the state of Washington alone competing for the business of 5 major buyers," Mr. Naasz said, "it's easy to see who has the leverage in those price negotiations, and it isn't the apple grower."
Not that the growers themselves are necessarily immune from responsibility for their plight. For one thing, they may simply have planted too many trees in recent decades, especially those that bear the benchmark red Delicious apple, still the No. 1 seller in the grocery store but typically so plentiful that it fetches a lower price than many other varieties.
Now some growers here, in a frenzied bid to carve out their place in "niche markets," are ripping Delicious trees out of their orchards and experimenting with exotic varieties that many people find far superior in taste and quality. And other growers are completely abandoning a fruit that long provided them a livelihood.
"I think apples are a thing of the past," said George Kapral, who has been growing them for 49 years. His 40-acre orchard once bore almost nothing but apples, but he has ripped out so many apple trees over the years in favor of pear that the share for apples is now down to 4 acres; next year, it will be 2.
Part of the problem is that American consumption of apples has leveled off at around 20 pounds a person per year (compared with 35 pounds in Canada and 50 pounds in parts of Europe).
"The competition is greater than ever before for a share of the customer's stomach," Mr. Naasz said. "There are all kinds of snacks out there."
Some food critics say demand has flattened because apples simply do not taste as good as they once did. The red Delicious in particular, they say, has been bred over the years for color and size uniformity, and has lost some of its flavor in the process.
In any event, Washington growers, trying to stimulate demand, have imposed a variety of fees on themselves for a promotional campaign to persuade Americans to eat an extra apple a day.
The weather here this year -- warm, but not too warm during the day, cool at night, with just the right amount of rain -- has combined with the area's rich volcanic soil to turn out a crop of ideal quality, although one that is expected to be a bit smaller than last year's. Taken together, those factors could lead to better prices as the apples come in at warehouses this fall, said Mr. Mayer, of the Washington Growers Clearing House Association. But, he said, it will take more than one good season to make up for the punishingly low returns of recent years.
Mr. Grim, who lost $63,000 last year growing apples on his 90 acres of orchards, said many suppliers felt particularly frustrated because they grew up in a time when big families made a fine living working orchards much smaller.
"It used to be that a family could raise their kids, send them to school, have a good life in this community, growing on 10 to 15 acres," said Mr. Grim, a third-generation grower. "Well, now I'm farming about seven or eight of those, and I'm not making any money at all."

HEADLINE: $50 Million Voted to Rebuild in Flood Area

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Reacting to weeks of complaints that state officials were slow to help victims of last month's flood, New Jersey legislators passed a bill today that dedicates $50 million to repair homes damaged by Tropical Storm Floyd.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed it into law less than two hours later, and said she would travel to Washington on Tuesday to ask Federal officials for more aid. 
 The flood relief, part of an $80 million emergency aid package, will provide grants of up to $15,000 to homeowners whose property damage is not covered by insurance or Federal disaster aid. The state will also set aside $20 million to help farmers whose crops were destroyed by the summer drought and $10 million to reimburse public agencies for overtime, supplies and other flood-related costs.
The state money is in addition to the $18 million in disaster aid already given to New Jersey residents by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. One agency official said he thought that state residents would ultimately receive $100 million in loans and grants.
During a fund-raising trip to the state last week, President Clinton announced that he would release $43 million in community block grants, scheduled for next year, to state officials and municipalities..
But Governor Whitman said today that the total amount of damage might reach $1 billion and that the state Office of Emergency Management had estimated that as much as $250 million in losses were not covered by insurance. The Governor has scheduled meetings with several Congressional and White House officials in hopes of persuading them to provide additional grantsto victims of the flood.
"These state grants are going to go a long way in helping New Jerseyans recover from the devastation of Tropical Storm Floyd, but the need is still great," the Governor said.
The state's decision to grant homeowners $50 million in disaster aid was a victory for residents and elected officials from the nine New Jersey counties declared disaster areas after flooding from record-setting rain destroyed 71 homes, 75 businesses and 105 apartments and damaged another 27,000 residences and 1,700 businesses. In the weeks after the flood, some residents were so angry they picketed legislative leaders and demanded assistance.
The leader of some of those protests, Mayor Frank Gilley of Bound Brook, said he thought the state's aid package was a good, although late, beginning. Assemblyman Gerald B. Green, Democrat of Plainfield, said that legislative leaders were trying to streamline the process to provide aid the victims of future disasters.

HEADLINE: 'My Hometown,' the Sequel;
Success Transforms Springsteen's Bleak Birthplace

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER 

DATELINE: FREEHOLD, N.J., Oct. 22

 BODY:
The big factories are gone now, and the old-timers no longer shuffle off to the Court Jester after swing shifts at the textile mill. The local kids these days are more likely to be at home watching "Seinfeld" reruns than down by the railroad tracks drinking beer on the hoods of their hemi-powered Plymouths.
For years, Freehold has been best known as the birthplace of Bruce Springsteen, a workingman's town that inspired songs like "Thunder Road" and "My Hometown." But what was once a quiet enclave of blue-collar families, farmers and factory hands has been transformed as Freehold has found itself at ground zero of one of New Jersey's most spectacular real-estate booms. 
 In a fashion that many Springsteen fans -- let alone longtime residents -- could never have imagined, what many people here seem to fear these days are not the shuttered plants and dead-end dreams of 20 years ago, but the encroaching cul-de-sacs, minivans and suburban sprawl.
"We weathered through all the jobs pulling out, Main Street looking like a bomb went off -- and those were rough times," said Dick Jasper, 41, a plumber. "But this is different. You can't mess with so-called progress. That's the American way."
While few new buildings have gone up in the tiny borough of Freehold, the region is exploding. In the last eight years, almost 2,000 single-family homes have been erected in Freehold Township, which surrounds Freehold the way a doughnut surrounds its hole. In Howell Township, to the south, the population has doubled to 50,000 from 25,000 in the last decade.
The boom has been kind to businesses in Freehold, where Main Street, with its charming restaurants and antique shops, attracts hundreds of people every weekend from the suburbs that stretch for miles on all sides. With developers flocking to the region, officials in Freehold have been able to start restoring several long-blighted sections of the borough.
Nonetheless, the building surge has created problems, residents say. Sleepy streets are now clogged with traffic. Property and school taxes have risen. People complain about garbage collection, parking and the flood of newcomers, including Mexican immigrants competing for jobs in a tight labor market.
More important, they say, the sociable, if stifling, small-town world that Mr. Springsteen sings about is slowly disappearing. People here are struggling to balance the commercial benefits of affluence with the possible damage it could do to Freehold's hard-working, nod-to-your-neighbor roots.
"We're stuck in the middle of the boom all around us," said Mike Wilson, the Mayor of Freehold, who, as a real estate broker, sees tremendous opportunity in growth. "You can feel the traffic. There are new people moving in. But things change; it's inevitable. Nothing remains the same."
In many ways, Freehold's history is the classic American small-town story. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it served as an agricultural hub for a region of independent farmers whose grain, corn and tomatoes fed a good portion of central New Jersey.
During the Industrial Revolution, Freehold, in Monmouth County, became a borough of textile mills and glass plants before the industries moved south in the 1960's and 1970's in search of cheaper payrolls.
It was the decline of this broad-shouldered era that produced Mr. Springsteen and his vision of Freehold as a close-knit but claustrophobic place where most people ground out their lives to the metronome of an hourly wage and from which only the brave or the lucky escaped.
But Freehold's most recent incarnation is twofold, officials say. It serves as both a cozy place for young families looking for starter homes and as a prettified, service-oriented weekend destination for the multitudes in the grid of housing developments on all sides.
To get a sense of just how much things in the Freehold area have changed, a visitor need only look at two old photographs outside Mayor Wilson's office. The first, an aerial shot taken decades ago, shows Freehold surrounded by a swath of swaying cornfields. Today, rows and rows of new hulking houses are packed together so tightly they look like bull-necked men stuffed in an elevator.
The second picture is of Main Street in 1988. The sidewalks are cracked and shabby. Many storefronts are dark and drab. Some are boarded up. These days, that once-bleak strip thrives with cafes, Victorian-style street lamps and sprightly coffee joints.
But such signs of Freehold's new affluence worry some old-timers, who fear that the people attracted to these places are not the kinds of folks who have always lived in Freehold. Some longtime residents are like Frank Federici, the owner of Federici's Pizzeria, who said that although his business had grown by 25 percent in the last few years, his new customers had changed the character of the borough.
"Sure, business has been better," said Mr. Federici, 75, who was born in the apartment above his restaurant (and is no relation to Danny Federici, who plays in Mr. Springsteen's band). "But I'm not sure I like it. I used to look out the window and recognize 99 percent of the faces. Now, it's less than half."
Part of the problem is that cheap land, a slower pace of life and bucolic touches like U-Pick-'Em pumpkin patches have drawn newcomers from places like Brooklyn, Queens and western Long Island. Many are prosperous baby boomers whose children are grown and who are looking to restart their lives in large, new, custom-built houses, said Dr. James W. Hughes, a dean at Rutgers University who published a study on New Jersey's emerging wealth and population centers last month.
"The blue-collar people in towns like Freehold may not have the same desires as the new McMansion owners in terms of parkland, tax levels, schools or expansion," said Dr. Hughes, who runs the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. "But if there's any bitterness, I think it's been mitigated by the strength of the overall economy."
Many lifelong Freehold residents would disagree. Ask them what they think about the city people, and many will say that everyone gets along. Scratch a little deeper, though, and hints of distrust and disappointment surface.
"The silly thing is this," said John Boyle, 65, a retired postman. "So many New Yorker types have come down here to live the country life that there's barely any country left."
One of the sorest issues is traffic, which, by all accounts, has become much more congested in recent years, largely because Freehold sits at the center of the highway nexus that links the subdivisions and strip malls around it.
"This town's gone crazy," said Mr. Jasper, the plumber, trapped in his mud-caked pickup the other day in a stalled line of New York-bound commuters that stretched down Route 537 in the early morning rush.
"I used to be able to do this drive in 10 or 15 minutes," he said as he looked in the rearview mirror, shaking his head at a man in a Ford Explorer behind him with a cellular phone wedged between his shoulder and his ear. "But now it takes so long, I ought to dump my truck and walk."
Another flash point is school levies. Because of the rapid population growth, the region has become inundated with school-age children. In 1997, the regional school system added a sixth high school, and in December, taxpayers will vote on whether to pay about $68 million to build additions to schools.
But in Freehold, where the population of 11,000 has barely budged, many people feel they are footing the bill for the explosion around them. "That's where you really feel this thing -- in your taxes," said John Wayne DuBois, 55, a retired municipal sewer worker. "They've gone sky high. With the regional system, you have one superintendent, six assistants and six assistant assistants, and you're talking big-time salaries there."
Mayor Wilson said property and school taxes in Freehold had increased at a modest rate of about 5 percent over the last four or five years. To people like Mr. DuBois or Doug Martin, a roofer eating lunch down the block from the American Legion, that seems like a lot.
"Hey, I consider myself lucky because the roofing business has been good to me the last few years," Mr. Martin, 51, said. "Still, my kids are in Catholic schools and I'm paying school taxes for a system I don't even use. I'm surviving. But, yeah, it's tough."
Adding to the burden of taxes, Mr. Martin said, is the increased competition for jobs brought on by immigration. He said that many people in Freehold have lost work recently to hundreds of Mexican immigrants who have come to the borough, attracted by the growth in housing construction jobs. Typically, he said, the immigrants are willing to work for lower pay than longtime residents in restaurant, construction and landscaping jobs.
"Look, no one wants to say that people can't work for a living," Mr. Martin acknowledged. "But some of these guys are illegals, and they're taking jobs from people who have lived here all their life."
Many of the immigrants know they are unwanted, said Aurelio Morales, 34, who came to Freehold from Sonora two years ago. But they stay because jobs in town are relatively well-paying and plentiful, he said.
"We want to work," Mr. Morales said. "Just live here and work."
Complaints of illegal immigration have increased to the point that the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service has appeared in Freehold several times to investigate, Mayor Wilson said.
Some complaints involve accusations that Mexican immigrants crowd several families into a single house, in violation of local ordinances. To deal with the problem, the Mayor said, the borough has established a $1,500 fine for any landlord who allows such overcrowding. In addition, borough officials have started working with local clergy members to ease a sense of fear and bias among some residents, Mr. Wilson said.
Immigration is just one of the challenges the new Freehold faces, but it seems to encapsulate the shift from small-town simplicity to suburban diversity and growth that has perplexed people who were born and grew up here.
"This is a great town and I would never leave it, never could leave it," Mr. Martin said. "But sometimes I look around and wonder what's happened to the place. It's actually hard to say. There's just not much here from when I was a kid."

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Charter Changes Will Protect the City's Gains

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Embarking on a last-minute campaign for changes in the City Charter, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday strongly urged New Yorkers to approve the revisions by telling them that the city could easily revert to a place of rampant crime and poverty after he leaves office.
Ending his relative silence of recent weeks on the subject, the Mayor told members of the New York City Partnership/Chamber of Commerce that voters' approval next Tuesday of the 14 proposals, including a cap on some city spending increases, would cement many of the successes of his administration. 
 "Every sense that someone has of logic, history, sociology, would say that after the end of this administration the city was going to go back in the other direction," Mr. Giuliani said in a 40-minute speech. "Why not? That's the way it was in the 60's, in the 70's, in the 80's, in the 90's."
"Please never, never forget the power of philosophy and ideas," he added later. "It was the power of ideas and philosophy that had this city deteriorating for 20 to 30 years, and it's the power of philosophy and ideas that has this city in a renaissance right now and we have got to make those things permanent. Charter revision gives us an opportunity to do some of that."
The proposed changes include imposing the cap on city spending increases tied to the rate of inflation, requiring a two-thirds vote by the City Council to approve any tax increases, establishing the Administration for Children's Services as an independent agency, creating a permanent organized-crime control commission and setting gun-free zones within 1,000 feet of schools.
Mr. Giuliani's passion in embracing the proposals, which were developed over the summer by a commission he appointed, and his insistence in asking voters to see them as an affirmation of his record, are something of a surprise. Just last week he chastised a reporter who asked about the charter, saying the rest of the city was more interested in the baseball playoffs.
At his daily news conference, which followed his address to the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Giuliani said the Yankees' participation in the World Series continued to play a role in his scheduling. "Notice that today, there's no baseball today," he said, explaining his timing of yesterday's speech. "No game tonight. Today's a rest day." And, noting that Election Day is next week, he added, "We're also running out of time."
Both supporters and opponents of the charter proposals expect an extremely low turnout in next week's ballot referendum, not because of baseball but because it is an off political year in which not a single major office anywhere in the city is being vigorously contested. Election officials expect 300,000 to 500,000 people to vote, between 10 percent and 15 percent of the electorate. The 14 changes must be approved or rejected as a group, not individually.
Mr. Giuliani himself had seemed to lose interest in the revision process after his commission decided to abandon consideration of a change he had sought: a special election for mayor to be held 60 days after the office becomes vacant. Under present law, the Public Advocate succeeds to the office, and if the Mayor is elected to the United States Senate next year, he would have to end his term a year early.
The Public Advocate, Mark Green, is a political enemy of the Mayor, who was loudly criticized for trying to change the city's basic governing document simply to thwart Mr. Green's ambitions. Mr. Green, who opposes the charter changes, toned down his opposition to the process after that proposal was dropped.
In his speech yesterday, Mr. Giuliani touched briefly on the issue of mayoral succession, saying he wished it could have been included on the ballot. "The succession issue I think is also important," he said. "And I think it's a shame that it can't be done right now. I think if it were done right now, it would imperil all of the other changes." He added, "For the future of the city, it should be done."
For most of his speech, however, Mr. Giuliani spoke of how the 14 proposed changes would help perpetuate his initiatives. He said that proposals creating the school safety zones and requiring all guns to have trigger locks would help keep crime down. He said the budget proposals would help sustain the city's strong economy.
"The ideas contained in the charter revision all help to assure that the gains that we have made in the last five years, which is a relatively short period of time in the history of any city or institution, will continue in that direction," he said.
The Mayor frequently strayed from his lectern during a presentation of graphs and charts concerning his policies. At one point, he moved in front of the projector, and when he was asked to move, he dryly replied, "I'm actually trying to create a shadow -- that's the whole idea of this."
Opponents of the charter revision process, including Mr. Green and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, have described the changes as ill-conceived and largely unnecessary proposals that could be accomplished through legislation or that are already in place, having been instituted by local law or by the Mayor's executive order.
Repeating his criticism yesterday, Mr. Vallone warned that the proposed changes would handcuff the City Council in setting tax policy and could encourage future increases in property taxes. "It would be consigning this city for evermore to having one of the highest real estate taxes ever because it makes it so difficult to do anything other than adopt the real estate tax," he said.
In an effort to drum up interest in the charter referendum, the Mayor's Charter Revision Commission has sent a pamphlet to every household with a registered voter, urging support for the changes. The City Council, whose members say the proposed changes will limit their budgetary powers, also sent out a flier to 375,000 likely voters, urging them to reject the changes.
Both mailings came under attack by civic groups who said that taxpayer dollars should not be used to support or oppose the charter referendum, but simply to inform voters about it.
The New York City Campaign Finance Board had already paid $1.5 million to distribute its own information booklet, which explains the changes and includes statements from all sides.

3,000 Honor Officer Killed in Line of Duty

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
About 3,000 law enforcement officers from around the country paid their respects yesterday to a police officer who was killed last week while trying to end a standoff with a barricaded suspect.
Cpl. Steven L. Levy, 35, was the first member of the Gloucester County Police Department killed in the line of duty. He was shot to death early Thursday during a domestic disturbance in Woodbury by a suspect who killed himself. 
 Corporal Levy was the first of three officers to enter the house where the gunman, Michael DeMore, had been barricaded for hours. It is believed that Corporal Levy was shot in the face when he lowered his bulletproof shield to break down a door. Mr. DeMore, 32, an unemployed truck driver who had a history of mental problems, was found dead several hours later from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head.

HEADLINE: Barbara Wolff, 58, City Official Active in New York Development

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Barbara Wolff, a veteran New York City official who was instrumental in setting up the city's business improvement districts program and in the commercial revitalization program that followed the blackout of 1977, died Oct. 15 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 58.
The cause was ovarian cancer, said George Glatter, a friend and colleague, who said Ms. Wolff had kept coming to her office until several weeks ago. 
 Ms. Wolff was assistant commissioner in charge of the neighborhood development division of the New York City Department of Business Services, a job she had held for more than a decade. The division develops and oversees economic programs designed to benefit neighborhood commercial streets, industrial areas and other economic centers in the city.
In that post and for some years earlier she played a leading role in creating the business improvement districts known as B.I.D.'s, which now number more than 40. They are self-financing organizations directed by local property owners and businesses. The districts offer a variety of services, including sanitation, security, promotion and marketing. The services are tailored to each district's needs and supplement the services the city provides.
The biggest districts include those for the Lower Manhattan, Grand Central and Times Square areas. The smallest are strips of commercial establishments in neighborhoods like the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn and the Steinway Street area of Queens.
The program has been credited with strengthening many commercial areas and some industrial ones by helping attract new businesses and persuading others to stay.
From 1977 to 1983, Ms. Wolff was with the city's Office for Economic Development as its director of commercial revitalization. Mr. Glatter, a deputy assistant commissioner in the business services department, said Ms. Wolff had directed the program, begun as a response to the damage inflicted on stores around the city in the looting that took place during the 1977 blackout.
The program has made use of Federal and city funds over the years to provide various kinds of aid to local businesses and groups.
Ms. Wolff was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter High School. She received a bachelor's degree from Simmons College in Boston and a master's degree in political science from the University of California at Berkeley.
She also worked for the International Labor Organization in Geneva, the United States Agency for International Development in Washington, the Parks and City Planning departments in New York and the City's Public Development Corporation, where she was a vice president.
She is survived by a brother, William Wolff of Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: In High Technology, the Grind Evolves

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
In May 1994, Jeff Treuhaft, 25, joined a little Silicon Valley start-up called Mosaic, later to be renamed the Netscape Communications Corporation. The pace was brutal -- 18 hours a day, seven days a week in the early months -- but the work was exhilarating.
"The really tough part was that my son was 9 weeks old when I started at Netscape," he recalled. 
 Five years later, Mr. Treuhaft has two more children and a tidy nest egg from the sale of Netscape this year to America Online. Like many former Netscape executives, he is stepping back from the front lines of the Internet business, working part time as an investor and adviser to a few start-ups.
Suddenly, Mr. Treuhaft finds himself free to play with his children, feed them lunch, even tag along on a school field trip to the pumpkin patch down the road. "It seems mundane stuff," he said, "but when you finally get a chance to do it, you appreciate it."
At Microsoft, Netscape's main rival in the infamous Internet browser battle, some have made similar personal choices. Brad Silverberg, a former senior vice president, took a sabbatical in the summer of 1997 to decompress after directing Microsoft's hurried march to catch up and then gain leadership in the Internet software business. He took a solo bicycle trip through the Canadian Rockies, spent time with his wife and two children and thought about all the personal things that had been shunted aside for work.
"Time is the one thing you cannot get back," said Mr. Silverberg, 45, who now works part time as an investor and adviser to start-ups.
The trade-off choices made in so many American households of personal life versus work, time versus money, are magnified in the Internet economy. The time pressure is so intense because a lead of just a few weeks or months over a rival can be a huge competitive advantage in the Internet land rush. And the financial rewards for the front-runners can be astronomical.
Still, if the Internet is going to be a transforming technology, like electricity, it must spread throughout the economy and society, as it finds new uses and new customers.
That process, inevitably, will take time. It means carefully building big Internet businesses, not just starting them. Internet "cruising speed" will become a valued skill and a competitive edge.
For both companies and individuals, that means pacing, in one way or another, in a race that is becoming more a marathon and less a sprint. As the Internet economy matures, high-technology companies are expanding programs and policies intended to help harried workers balance their personal lives and the demands of work. A greater use of flexible hours, part-time work, day care, sabbaticals and longer vacations are all part of that effort.
According to the Radford division of the benefits firm Aon Consulting, average vacation time offered by high-technology companies has steadily increased in recent years. Forty-one percent even offer full vacation benefits to new recruits during their first year of employment, and 10 percent of Silicon Valley companies now offer sabbaticals, Radford reports.
Cisco Systems, for example, gives all new hires four weeks of vacation at the start. After surveying its employees last year, Cisco is building a day-care center on its corporate campus in San Jose. "We found supply was low, demand was high and more and more high-tech companies are doing something in child care," explained Peggy Lynch, manager of benefits for Cisco.
Two years ago, I.B.M. introduced a program allowing people to work part time while still getting the benefits and opportunities of full-time employees. One person in the program is Marie Wieck, director of XML technology, a hot new field of Internet software programming. Ms. Wieck, 39, works 32 hours a week now instead of the 60 she used to. She still travels, but she typically is in the office only three days a week, giving her more time to spend with her two young daughters. "I'll keep doing this as long as it makes sense both for the business and for me," Ms. Wieck said.
Yet it is in Internet start-ups, not established companies, where the work regimen is the most grueling. The hours are still long in today's second-generation Internet start-ups, but the perspective of the young programming whizzes does seem to have changed a bit.
Lou Montulli, 29, was one of the first engineers at Netscape. After Netscape was sold, he moved on to another Internet start-up, Epinions.com. "I really like the energy of a start-up," he said, "because it's an environment where you can really make a difference as an individual."
But these days, Mr. Montulli is working 70-hour weeks instead of the 120 hours he often did at Netscape -- a single-minded commitment to work that he acknowledges contributed to the break-up of his marriage, to the daughter of Jim Clark, a co-founder of Netscape. "I'm just not emotionally equipped to work like that anymore," he said. "I have a life."
For people with children, however, 70-hour workweeks may not be their idea of balancing work and personal lives. And the stock-option wealth created by many high-technology companies has given people like Mr. Treuhaft and Mr. Silverberg the financial freedom to do what they call "serial balancing" -- shifting from stints of intense work to time off or part-time work, and back again.
"Balance is a very difficult thing to achieve, at least in parallel," Mr. Silverberg said. "To achieve great things in one's career typically takes a tremendous amount of focus and dedication. I've tried to achieve 'balance' in a more serial way, so that hopefully it will even out over the long haul. And thanks to Microsoft, I have the freedom to do that."
In Silicon Valley, Mr. Treuhaft takes a similar approach to his period of part-time work, viewing it as a recess. "I don't think I'd call this my career," he said. "It's more catching my breath, while still pedaling the bicycle."

HEADLINE: Berkeley Faces the 90's

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"High Tech Gets Low Priority in Berkeley" (news article, Oct. 25), on the loss of companies hatched in Berkeley, Calif., reflects a sad but true tale.
With the University of California campus as its main anchor tenant, Berkeley's bountiful brain power will continue to produce more successful start-up companies that will grow up and move out of town. 
 We residents can only continue to work toward a practical and enlightened local political stance that is more in tune with the realities of the new economy.
The city should invite the developers who helped turn around Emeryville and Alameda to consider refurbishing West Berkeley, whose location and local businesses make it a valuable latent asset.

HEADLINE: Index of Consumer Confidence Falls for4th Consecutive Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence in the economy has fallen in October for the fourth consecutive month amid concerns about falling stock prices, the Conference Board, a private industry group, said yesterday.
The board's consumer confidence index dropped to 130.1 from 134.2 in September. That is 3.5 percent below a 30-year high of 139 in June and the index's lowest level since January. 
 "Confidence sags every time the stock market sags," said Chris Rupkey, a senior economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 9 percent since Aug. 25, just after Federal Reserve policy-makers raised interest rates for the second time in less than two months.
Even after this month's decline, the confidence index is still more than the year-earlier reading of 119.3. That was also the last time the index fell four consecutive months.
Another factor in the decline may be rising interest rates. Low home-mortgage rates have benefited consumer spending in recent years by freeing up billions of dollars when homeowners refinanced their loans. As those rates have risen, interest in refinancing has dwindled.
Consumers' assessments of their situations, their expectations for the economy in the next six months and their perceptions of job availability also fell to the lowest levels since January, the Conference Board report showed.
The index gauging current conditions fell to 173.5 this month from 176.3 in September, and the six-month expectations index dropped to 101.1 from 106.2.
The share of consumers surveyed who saw jobs as "hard to get" rose to 13.3 percent -- the largest since January -- from 12.7 percent in September. Those expecting incomes to increase fell to 23.1 percent from a revised 26.8 percent a month before.

HEADLINE: A New Index Tracks Bribe-Paying Countries

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Transparency International, an independent organization that tracks corruption among government officials around the world, announced yesterday that it had added a new index to rank nations that appear to condone bribe paying by their companies doing business abroad.
The organization, based in Berlin, which released both reports, the Corruption Perceptions Index and the Bribe Payers Index, in Washington, found that once again officials in northern European countries were perceived to have the cleanest hands, while the highest levels of bribe-taking officials appeared to be in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet bloc. 
 When it came to countries whose companies pay bribes abroad, China was perceived to be the worst offender, followed by South Korea, Taiwan, Italy and Malaysia. No country's corporations were regarded as innocent of bribe paying. But the Europeans, Australia and Canada came out best.
The idea that corruption is a third world phenomenon raises tempers in developing countries every year when the Corruption Perceptions Index is published. The survey this year is the fifth and largest.
"There was a sense in some countries that we were a group from the richer north that was singling out the poor countries" said Frank Vogl, a former World Bank official and now vice chairman of Transparency International, which he helped found in 1993. "People said that basically there is a conspiracy of corruption between the takers of bribes and the givers of bribes, and it should be recognized. We thought we would create a Bribe Payers Index."
Both indices plot perceptions, not concrete evidence, though in different ways. The Corruption Perception Index is a "poll of polls," based on data from 17 surveys from 10 independent institutions that analyze business conditions around the world. The 1999 index includes 99 countries, up from 85 last year.
The Bribe Payers Index was based on a survey conducted for Transparency International by Gallup International in 14 leading emerging-market countries. They were Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Nigeria, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and Thailand. Gallup International, which is based in London, interviewed 770 senior executives in those nations.
Mr. Vogl said in an interview on Friday in New York that the two indices were "two sides of the same coin." He said it was fashionable now to be against corruption and to demand that developing countries clean house before aid was granted.
"But there is hypocrisy," he added. "Many major industrial countries do quite well on the C.P.I. Yet they are not discouraging their own firms from corrupting foreign governments."
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of industrial countries, has adopted a convention making bribery of foreign officials a criminal offense, member nations have not stopped the practice, Mr. Vogl said.
No country scored a perfect 10 on the Bribe Payers scale, where a low score indicates corrupt practices. The best rating was Sweden's at 8.3, followed by 8.1 for Australia and Canada. The United States, which has had a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act on the books for 22 years, scored 6.2. At the bottom, China registered 3.1.
On the Corruption Perceptions Index, the ranking by the perceived honesty of officials, there was one perfect score. Denmark scored 10. The United States had 7.5, behind the northern Europeans, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Transparency International, founded six years ago by a small group of people who had seen development aid fail to achieve its goals as corruption flourished, has 77 national chapters. Mr. Vogl said he was impressed less by that growth than by the explosion of public demand that governments and businesses stop corrupting one another. Concerns about corruption are finally becoming part of policy making, he said, pointing to the questions that Washington is now confronting about dealing with Russia.
"Five years ago, we couldn't get into the World Bank," Mr. Vogl said. "We were told that this was politics."
Now, he added, there is a "vast civil society movement" that is asking questions in many capitals about why health care or other services receive no money while officials buy airplanes.

Putting a French Touch on an Office Tower Lobby

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
An office building at Lexington Avenue and 57th Street is not where one might expect to encounter a little bit of Paris, a touch of Gustav Klimt and a dab of Danube, the new David Bouley restaurant in TriBeCa. But enter the recently renovated two-story lobby of 135 East 57th Street, a 32-story, 400,000-square-foot building at the northwest corner of Lexington, and that's just what the visitor sees.
"Lobbies set the tone," said Charles Steven Cohen, president and chief executive of the Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation, which bought the architecturally distinguished but once economically troubled building in late 1997 for $114 million. "This is a dramatic building at a key intersection, and we wanted to put our own stamp, our own imprimatur, on it, to try to stay ahead of the market. We tried to make it warmer, lighter, like a hotel or apartment house lobby. People are putting in more hours at work, so why shouldn't the workplace resemble the residential environment?" 
 So Mr. Cohen hired a Parisian decorator noted for residential work, Jacques Garcia, whose Paris office has also superintended commissions for Danube, including its French gold, cut-velvet draperies and its black-lacquered furniture. The $1 million lobby renovation, completed in the spring, is part of a larger upgrading that includes new lighting for the 30-foot-high circle of classical columns just outside the building, and a renovation to be completed in the spring of the vest-pocket park on the building's 57th Street side.
The lobby, a mix of Italian marble and bronze trim, includes two large golden murals by Gerard Coltat, an artist from Nice, France. The murals, of women, horses and mock skyscrapers, are intended to evoke the spirit of Klimt, the turn-of-the-century Austrian painter whose intensely sensual images were replete with gold and silver gilding. (Mr. Coltat's golden Klimtish visions also grace Mr. Bouley's Danube, which opened in September at Hudson and Duane Streets.)
The lobby also includes two large imported classically inspired statues, "Auguste" and "La Venus d'Arles," and fresh flowers in two bronze urns that copy Baroque-style vases in the Parc de Saint-Cloud just outside Paris.
Mr. Garcia's work is also featured in the French Designer Showhouse now running at 34 East 69th Street. He has worked on the Hotel Costes in Paris, designed the Sultan of Brunei's 60,000-square-foot residence on the Place Vendome, and restored a 17th-century Norman chateau, Champ-de-Bataille.
Mr. Cohen said he had turned to Mr. Garcia to create a sense of warmth not often found in large office-building lobbies. "We wanted to take the hard angles and surfaces of the modern and temper and soften them with residential touches," he said. "We wanted to bring a little bit of nature into the lobby, with the fresh flowers and the parklike urns, and make things lighter. The building's lobby was magnificent, but it was a cold place. We're making it warm. The original architects were great. We merely brought in other professionals to enhance the original designs."
The gray granite-clad building, loosely classical in style, was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox of Manhattan and won critical praise when it was completed in 1988, built by Robert Gladstone and his family. It is distinguished by a sweeping, concave facade that rises to the building's full height and wraps around a plaza on the corner of Lexington Avenue. On that corner are the classical columns, which critics said create a visual focus and anchor for the plaza that becomes the building's front yard.
Despite the building's architectural elegance, it has had a difficult history. The office tower was leased, but because of the loss in 1991 of two retail tenants -- the and D. F. Sanders housewares store and the clothing store Louis, Boston -- the owners could no longer pay operating expenses or interest on their $176 million mortgage, and the next year, the Gladstones turned over the building and the ground lease to the lenders: the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension System, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, represented collectively by the Boston Company Real Estate Counsel of Boston. Mr. Cohen bought the building from the lenders.
The building caters to many financial services tenants. Among them are Global Asset Management and the Boston Consulting Group.
New tenants include Tradescape, an E-commerce full-service broker, which leased 26,000 square feet, and Interactive Flight Technologies, which leased 5,000 square feet. Annual rents on new deals in the building range from $48 to $55 a square foot, Mr. Cohen said. A new retail tenant, the Greenhouse Spa, has taken 6,400 square feet on two levels on 57th Street.
Only two floors are vacant, Mr. Cohen said -- the 9th and 10th, each about 13,000 square feet, "and there is substantial interest in both."
Mr. Cohen has also hired the landscape architect Thomas Balsley, who designed Gantry Plaza State Park on the Queens waterfront, to renovate the vest-pocket park that is open to the public on the 57th Street side. The renovation includes accent lighting, art for the walls, new tables and chairs, a food kiosk, new plantings and a corrugated steel and red enamel wall behind a waterfall in the rear of the park.
"We want the park to be an inviting oasis," Mr. Cohen said. "The water now dribbles over the stone, and you can barely see it. The red will give it a nice punch."

HEADLINE: Bar Association Panel Urges Veto of CUNY's Remedial Policy

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
A commission of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York yesterday urged the State Board of Regents to reject a remedial policy adopted by the City University of New York that would bar students who do not pass English or mathematics tests from entering the university's four-year colleges.
"The proposed changes will have an unacceptably disproportionate effect on those very-low-income, minority and immigrant groups who are most dependent on CUNY to provide a leg up onto the economic letter," the panel, the Commission on the Future of CUNY, said in a 125-page report issued yesterday. 
 Calling the policy "too rigid," the commission said that CUNY had understated the impact its changes would have.
"The one-size-fits-all approach should not apply to an issue so critical to a student's college career," said Stanley M. Grossman, a New York City lawyer who is the panel's chairman.
The commission hopes that its prestige and its report will give the Regents ammunition to make the difficult decision to reject the City University's policy.
The Regents are scheduled to vote on CUNY's policy in November. The policy was approved by CUNY's trustees last year and again in January.
Isabelle Katz Pinzler, a former acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the United States Justice Department who was special counsel to the bar panel, said the commission sent copies of its recommendations to the State Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills, and to CUNY's chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, on Monday evening.
Jay Hershenson, CUNY's vice chancellor for university relations, said that the chancellor had met with the bar panel and assured it that "as standards at the senior colleges are raised, safeguards will be put in place to strengthen opportunities for educational advancement."
The 15-member bar commission, which included lawyers, educators and other public figures, said that state law gave CUNY a specific responsibility to serve the "special needs of an urban constituency" and that the remedial policy did not do that.
The panel said that the new policy would discriminate against members of minority groups and women and that both CUNY and the Regents must take into account the implications of the Federal civil rights law.
It also said that it was concerned that CUNY, which it called "grossly underfunded," would not have enough money to pay for the various programs it had said it would use to help students once remedial classes were closed. Had the policy been in use last year, more than 4,300 students would have been affected, the bar group estimated, calling CUNY's estimate that fewer than 200 students would be affected far too low. The group also expressed skepticism about CUNY's need to move so quickly.
"The commission submits that there are compelling reasons not to approve the proposed amendment on remediation in its current form and on the proposed timetable," the report said.
The report on CUNY, the first of two reports the commission plans to issue, is one of the bar association's occasional studies on public policy issues; previous topics have included a Congressional code of ethics and strategic arms control.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
SharesTrade Mostly Lower; The Dow Falls 47.80 Points

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell yesterday, led lower by retailers and four companies that are being replaced in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Two stocks about to join the ranks of the 30 component issues of the Dow industrials rose -- Intel was up 3/16 a share, to 71 7/16, and SBC Communications climbed 1 5/16, to 45 9/16. 
 The two others, though, slipped a bit: Microsoft fell 1/16 a share, to 92 3/8, and Home Depot declined 1 1/4, to 70 11/16.
Retailers fell after a report showed that sales growth slowed to two-tenths of 1 percent last week, from four-tenths of 1 percent the previous week. "Customers aren't going out and banging the doors down to buy apparel," said Brian James, an analyst with Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns retail stocks.
Wal-Mart Stores dropped 2 11/16 a share, to 53 1/4; Dayton-Hudson fell 4 3/4, to 61 1/16, and Kmart lost 1/2, to 9 3/8. Sears, Roebuck, the retailer Home Depot will replace in the Dow average on Monday, also fell 1 7/8, to 27.
The Dow average dropped 47.80 points, to 10,302.13. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 11.72 points, to 1,281.91. The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.48 points, to 2,811.47.
Along with Sears, the other stocks being removed from the Dow fell: Goodyear Tire and Rubber lost 3 15/16 a share, to 41 1/4, contributing most to the Dow average's loss. Chevron sank 2, to 88, and Union Carbide dropped 1/2, to 59.
The trading session was fairly heated, with an above-average 878.3 million shares changing hands on the Big Board.
The inclusion of Microsoft and Intel in the Dow "highlights the importance of technology in our everyday lives and the marketplace," said Michael Holland, chairman of the Holland & Company money-management firm.
Lucent Technologies, the world's largest maker of telephone equipment, gained 3 a share, to 62 7/8, after posting a fourth-quarter profit that surpassed analyst expectations by 2 cents a share.
Government bonds fell on concern that economic reports to be released this week will add to data that may prompt a third interest-rate rise by the Federal Reserve since June.
"The market is not ready to rally," said Sam Paddison, who oversees $12 billion in fixed-income assets at the First Capital Group in Philadelphia. As long as potential exists for another Fed increase this year, he said, the risk is for bonds to decline.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 11/32, to 96 22/32, pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, up to 6.37 percent, from 6.35 percent on Monday.
So far this month, yields on 10-year notes, a benchmark for mortgage and other loans, have climbed 35 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.23 percent. That is likely to send the rate on 30-year mortgages reported by Freddie Mac, the second-largest buyer of mortgages, to more than 8 percent for the first time in two months when it's compiled this week, analysts said.
A Government report scheduled for release tomorrow will probably show that employment costs rose in the third quarter, following the biggest gain since 1991 in the previous quarter. Another report may show that the economy expanded at a 4.5 percent annual pace in the quarter, up from 1.6 percent in the second quarter.
"Most people have already made their bets," leaving little room for big swings in Treasuries before tomorrow's reports, said Barbara Kenworthy, a portfolio manager at Prudential Investment Advisors in Newark, which has $145 billion under management.
Signs of growth and faster inflation could raise chances of a Fed rate increase next month, traders said. The Fed already raised its target for overnight bank lending by a quarter-point each in June and August, raising it to 5.25 percent.
"Unless the data surprise us over the next few days, the path of least resistance is for a tightening" next month, said William Dudley, director of United States economic research at Goldman Sachs Group.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Dow TakesOn a New, High-Technology Look

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE Dow Jones industrial average, whose performance has trailed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in recent years, dropped four lagging stocks yesterday and substituted four companies that have done much better.
By adding two high-flying technology companies, the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation, the editors of The Wall Street Journal, who determine the index's components, made it likely that the Dow will be more volatile than it has been. Whether it will also be a better performer is likely to turn on the question of whether large technology stocks remain market leaders. 
 Intel and Microsoft are the first stocks traded on the Nasdaq to join the Dow, ending the monopoly of New York Stock Exchange-listed companies in the average. The other stocks being added, effective on Monday, are Home Depot, the specialty retailer, and SBC Communications, one of the regional Bell phone companies.
The companies that are being dropped, all of which have been in the Dow since 1930 or earlier, are the Chevron Corporation; Sears, Roebuck & Company; the Union Carbide Corporation, and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.
Paul E. Steiger, the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, said the changes would make the Dow "even more representative of the evolving U.S. economy."
Since the last change in the components of the Dow, when four companies were added in March 1997, the index has risen 49 percent. But over the same period, Goodyear and Sears have declined in value while the other companies being taken out have risen less than the Dow. Over all, the companies being removed have declined.
By contrast, the four companies being added have been sterling performers. SBC is up about 65 percent; Intel has more than doubled and the other two have tripled.
John Prestbo, the markets editor of The Wall Street Journal, said that "stock performance is not a factor in deciding whether to take a company out, or which one to add." He said the editors had "made a conscious effort to get rid of duplicate companies," leading to the elimination of Chevron while the Exxon Corporation remained and to the dropping of Sears while Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stayed.
A calculation by this reporter indicates that had the four new stocks been added to the Dow at the time of the last change, in 1997, the Dow would have been up 71 percent since that change, significantly better than the 62 percent gain shown by the S.& P. 500. In fact, the Dow was up 49 percent over the period, leaving it well behind the S.& P. 500, although the Dow has done better in 1999.
At the peak this summer, the Dow would have topped 12,800 had the new stocks been in it. In fact, the high was 11,326.
The competition between indexes is more important now than it used to be because both Standard & Poor's and Dow Jones license their indexes for option and futures trading and make money based on how popular such derivatives are with traders.
The fact that Microsoft and Intel do not trade on the New York Stock Exchange had no effect, either on the decision to include them in the average now or on the decision not to add them earlier, Mr. Prestbo said. He noted that the Dow Jones transportation average had added Nasdaq stocks in 1991.
Still, the move served as a reminder of the inability of the Big Board, historically the place where large American companies traded, to attract the most successful technology companies away from Nasdaq. Frank G. Zarb, the chief executive of the National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent of the Nasdaq said, "The inclusion of these two Nasdaq companies makes the Dow more reflective of today's global economy."
The changes are likely to bring on substantial trading by index funds based on the Dow and by the managers of the so-called Diamonds, investment trusts that trade on the American Stock Exchange and mimic the Dow. With more than $1.1 billion in Diamonds, the managers will have to sell more than 500,000 shares of each of the stocks being removed and buy a similar number of each stock being added.
Until 1997, the Dow had just one large computer technology company, I.B.M. Then it added Hewlett-Packard, and now it is adding Microsoft, the dominant personal computer software company, and Intel, the leading maker of semiconductor chips for such computers. Because those stocks are relatively high priced, the technology stocks will make up 16 percent of the index. But that is below the 25 percent technology weighting in the S.& P. 500.
The 1997 changes to the Dow also added Johnson & Johnson Inc. and Travelers Group, now called Citigroup after merging with Citicorp. The companies taken out then were Texaco Inc., the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Woolworth -- since renamed Venator Group Inc. -- and Westinghouse. As is the case now, the companies that were removed had been poor performers in the years before they were taken out of the average.
Most of the 1997 rejects continued to lag the market since that move. Only Westinghouse, since renamed the CBS Corporation after taking over the television network, has outperformed the Dow since the last change. Of the four that were added, all but Hewlett-Packard have outperformed the index.
The Dow industrials are by far the most widely followed index of United States stocks, in part because it is the oldest index around, dating back to 1896 and with continual prices since 1914. The earlier version was dropped during World War I, and Dow Jones did not bother to make the new one continuous in terms of prices.
The definition of an industrial stock used by Dow Jones is a broad one, basically making all companies eligible except those that could be in the Dow Jones transportation or utility averages. The latter index has traditionally included electric and gas utilities, not phone companies.
While the S.& P. 500 is much broader, it dates only to the 1920's and is less well known. Ask money managers how they are doing over some period of time, and they will probably compare their performances to the S.& P. 500. But ask what the market is doing on a given day, and the same managers are likely to describe how far the Dow has moved.
Unlike most major indexes, which are weighted based on the market value of each company, the Dow is computed on a price-weighted basis. The closing prices of the 30 Dow stocks are added up and divided by a divisor, now 0.1974, which is adjusted whenever a stock in the Dow splits or when new companies are added.
As a result, the highest weighted stock in the Dow will remain the American Express Company, now worth about $144 a share. It will have a larger effect on the average than Microsoft, now worth about $92 a share, even though Microsoft has a market value -- and thus a weighting in the S.&P. 500 -- that is more than seven times that of American Express.
Yesterday, when stock prices were generally lower, two of the companies added to the Dow showed gains and another, Microsoft, was down only 6.25 cents. Of the companies dropped, all fell more than $1 except Union Carbide, which was down 50 cents.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: A Network of Their Own;
From an Exclusive Address, a Group for Women Only

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
For Janet Tiebout Hanson, leaving Goldman, Sachs after 14 years was "like stepping off a cliff." She had risen to vice president, after spending her entire professional career at the Wall Street firm, with all the power and prestige it conferred.
But having taken three years off to care for her children, Meredith, now 11, and Christopher, 8, Ms. Hanson found that being back at the investment banking firm was a huge disappointment. Changes in technology at the firm left her feeling out of touch, and she found her new position in marketing for the asset management division frustrating. "I wasn't special, and they weren't special," Ms. Hanson said. 
 Taking the plunge, she founded Milestone Capital Management in 1994. Now in Yonkers, it has nearly $3 billion under management, and she no longer has to commute from Bronxville to lower Manhattan.
Her experience set her to thinking. She had been one of just a few women professionals at Goldman, Sachs. Her male colleagues had honed networking over the decades into a science, whether it was schmoozing at the club or doing deals on the golf course. Those who ascended could rely on an endless supply of contacts to help them on their way.
But what about all the women who had left? Some had not worked for several years, staying at home with their children, and they found their Rolodexes out of date and their skills rusty. Others were thinking about starting their own businesses, in hopes of greater opportunities. All of them would benefit by pooling their contacts.
So Ms. Hanson created an organization two years ago called 85 Broads, a playful reference to the Goldman location at 85 Broad Street. There is nothing quite like the group. Other corporate alumni networks exist, though few are active. One exception is McKinsey & Company, which has a page of news and information about its 8,500 former consultants on its Web site.
Among other women's networks, the Financial Women's Association of New York has about 1,100 members. Female graduates of the Harvard Business School have set up clubs in several cities, including one in New York that caters to a "ready-made group" of 1,600 peers, according to Karen Page, founder of the Harvard network. Then there is the Committee of 200, an organization of high-profile professional women.
But Ms. Hanson's group is unusual in being a women-only corporate alumni network.
"The reason I can do this is that I made it out of Goldman into a successful entrepreneurial experience," Ms. Hanson said.
Already, about 70 former Goldman women have joined the club, including not only stay-at-home mothers but also many big names in American business and finance like Anne Cassells, the chief investment officer for Stanford University; Karen Cook, a partner at Steinhardt Management in New York, and Leelee Clement Doughty, an executive recruiter for Heidrick & Struggles in Los Angeles. Abby Joseph Cohen, the well-known managing director at Goldman, is an honorary member.
Last month, the group started its own Web site, www.85broads.com, as a way for women to connect outside of special events. Catherine Banat, a former Goldman professional with 7-year-old twins, a son and a daughter, is its volunteer president, having quit Lehman Brothers six months ago to decide what she should do next. Only members have access to the site. Logging on, they can find the names and phone numbers of former colleagues, many of whom have individual profiles on the site, and can exchange tips and informations.
The club is an attempt to replicate some of the aspects of the traditional old boys' network, in which phone calls are always taken and people are quick to make referrals. "Women haven't networked as well as they should -- or can," said Noreen Harrington, who worked at Goldman for 11 years and is a member of the group. "We're not always our best asset."
After leaving Barclays Capital last year as the co-head of fixed income for Europe, Ms. Harrington is trying to establish a money management firm with some others and expects to use contacts from the club as a way to share information.
Though the site is not fully off the ground, members are using it to share information about how to work for political candidates like Jon S. Corzine, the former Goldman co-chairman who is running for the Senate from New Jersey, and noting articles on current Goldman executives. There are places where they can peruse "favorite" lists of books and vacations, and the site even plans to create a chat room for Wall Street gossip.
Barbara Redinger, who left Goldman in the late 1980's, has not worked since her daughter, now 7, was born. "I'm trying to figure out how to take back some of my life without sacrificing my family's life," said Ms. Redinger, who lives in a Cleveland suburb. "I never thought I would miss pantyhose," she said with a laugh. Ms. Hanson is helping her find out what certification she might need to return to financial services.
For a suburban housewife with applesauce stains on her T-shirt, knowing that you can ask the advice of a former colleague who is still in the thick of the business can be a lifeline. Too often, women who have stayed at home for a while feel embarrassed about no longer being considered a heavy hitter. "You're no longer part of that club," Ms. Hanson explained.
It probably should not be surprising that this group was formed in the Goldman milieu. The firm has always boasted of recruiting the best and the brightest, and its new hires became very close as they went through its rigorous training programs. This was particularly true in the 1970's and 80's, when Goldman was much smaller and the atmosphere was more intimate.
Women professionals forged especially strong bonds as outsiders in a mostly male culture. "It was probably the most exciting time of my professional career," said Phyllis Esposito, who left Goldman in 1990 to found Artemis Capital with some other women investment professionals and is now a senior partner at Mathias & Company, a financial services consulting firm.
The networking group "is a tremendous source of individual and professional talent," she said. "We are proud to claim our Goldman heritage."
Former Goldman women still connect, although it may have been years since some last worked together and some had never met, according to Ms. Hanson. She remembers the "camaraderie and excitement" of a dinner she organized two years ago for about 30 of her former colleagues, at the Water Club restaurant on the East River.
Ms. Hanson says she realized the full power of networking shortly after she created Milestone, her money management firm. She was having lunch with Ms. Esposito, then a senior managing director at Bear, Stearns, who urged her to market her fund there. She did so, and now she credits Ms. Esposito's backing with helping Milestone get off the ground.
"It was a win-win for all of us," Ms. Esposito recalled.
But the number of women who are able to break through the so-called glass ceiling into the upper echelons of corporate America remains small, and Wall Street is particularly viewed as an inhospitable place to work. About 11 percent of Goldman's 693 managing directors are women.
Since networking on a professional level often involves connecting mostly with men, women often develop another network to talk to other women, according to Herminia Ibarra, a professor at the Harvard Business School. The other network represents a forum where there are enough women facing similar issues, like the difficulty of advancing or the challenge of raising children while working.
Ms. Hanson wants her group to serve as a resource for current Goldman women, too, many of whom may face the same quandary she did in deciding whether to take time off or leave. "My biggest hope for 85 Broads is that women at Goldman, Sachs will reach out to us in a way, informally," Ms. Hanson said.
"Where was this group 10 years ago?" she asked.
 
It's Not Rocket Science: Best Ways to Meet and Greet
People who don't belong to a ready-made career network like 85 Broads or the Harvard Business School alumni clubs may need to be creative in thinking about how to establish and use networks. While there are "various and sundry" networking groups, joining them is not always useful, according to Dee A. Soder, a career consultant for executives in New York at the CEO Group. "The people you want to meet and interact with are generally not going to go to those things," Ms. Soder said.
So what is the best way to meet and greet? Ms. Soder recommends focusing on organizations that you feel strongly about, whether it is Girls Inc. or City Meals on Wheels, because these groups can be a good way for like-minded men and women to get together. She recently attended a private reception at the Economic Club of New York, for example, where she made a variety of contacts.
People looking to connect should also not limit themselves to just one vehicle, says Herminia M. Barra, a Harvard Business School professor. Instead, she suggests exploring a broad variety of informal and formal ones, based on your interests and location. You might want to join a local alumni club, for example, as well as specific professional associations, depending on your job. But the more networks you join, the more worlds, opportunities and ideas you will be exposed to, she said.
Here, at least, women may have an advantage, Ms. Soder said. "Women are far more likely to have a variety of different people they know than men are," she said.

HEADLINE: First Lady Tries to Put Mayor on Defensive Over the Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
On Sept. 28 in Washington, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he would be against raising the minimum wage "until I saw that it had no impact on jobs." But by last Sunday, he said he expected to "eventually support" raising the minimum wage, although he wanted to see some studies first.
To Hillary Rodham Clinton's busy campaign spinners, the Mayor's comments were a classic "flip-flop." To the Mayor, it was the natural evolution of his position. Calling it a flip-flop, he said with irritation on Monday, "was one of the biggest canards I ever heard." 
 Whatever the point of view, Mrs. Clinton, who favors the wage increase, seems to have put the Republican Mayor on the defensive as he has tried to find a balance between following his party's orthodoxy and appealing to voters statewide. "The Mayor is now trying to climb out of the box, and we intend to make it difficult for him," said Howard Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's unannounced Senate campaign.
At the same time, Republican leaders said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani's expected support of the wage increase, whether rooted in politics or ideology, would help him with crucial voters upstate, an anticipated war zone as the Mayor prepares to run against Mrs. Clinton. "Without question, it helps him in the city of Buffalo," said Robert E. Davis, chairman of the Republican Party in Erie County, the largest Democratic stronghold outside of New York City.
Robert W. Giarrusso, the Onondaga County Republican chairman, said that if Mr. Giuliani supported a rise in the minimum wage, it would "definitely" help with voters in Syracuse. Stephen Minarik, the Republican chairman for Monroe County -- where Rochester enjoys a healthier economic climate than that of Buffalo -- said business owners in his area might not like Mr. Giuliani's support of the minimum wage, "but I don't think he would lose any support because the alternative is not good." By the "alternative," Mr. Minarik meant Mrs. Clinton.
The issue affects 643,000 minimum wage workers in the State of New York, according to statistics compiled by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Mr. Giuliani's likely race against Mrs. Clinton is expected to be extraordinarily close.
While it has long been standard for the Republican Party to oppose raising the minimum wage, it has always been a difficult issue for statewide Republican candidates in New York, where increasing the wage is popular. Former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, for example, was in favor of raising the wage during his unsuccessful 1998 campaign against Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat.
In the House of Representatives, where bills to raise the minimum wage to $6.15, from $5.15, an hour over the next two years have some bipartisan support, the leading moderate Republican in favor of the increase is Jack Quinn of Buffalo. Asked yesterday if Mr. Giuliani could count on support in Buffalo if he favored raising the wage, Mr. Quinn at first said, "I don't know." But then, he amended his comment: "Let me put it this way: It will be better if he supports the minimum wage."
In the Senate, a similar bill has been stalled because of opposition from Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, and other leading Republicans. Mr. Giuliani first discussed opposition to increasing the wage "at this point" while in Washington on a fund-raising trip for his Senate Exploratory Committee. "When he's down asking for Trent Lott's support and money in Washington, he says one thing," Mr. Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, said, "and then when he's in New York, he says another."
Mr. Giuliani's aides counter that Mr. Wolfson is deliberately distorting the Mayor's words. "We're surprised Mrs. Clinton has gone so negative so early," said Bruce Teitelbaum, the director of the Mayor's exploratory committee. "This is precisely the kind of negative campaign that turns people off, and that New Yorkers will reject."
Asked about the shifts in his position, Mr. Giuliani said: "I'm doing exactly what I said I would do. But you've got to pay attention and you've got to be intellectually honest to come to that conclusion."
Mr. Giuliani's aides later distributed a transcript of comments that the Mayor made in a television interview with Mark Shields on Oct. 9. When Mr. Shields asked Mr. Giuliani why he was opposed to raising the minimum wage, the Mayor responded, "No, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait -- I didn't say that." Mr. Giuliani then said that increasing the minimum wage was "a good thing that we have to look at, but you've got to understand that you're going to be costing, you could be costing some of those people jobs."
The Mayor has said he is particularly concerned that raising the minimum wage could hurt the city's welfare-to-work program. On Sunday, he said he had asked the city's Human Resources Administration and the Economic Development Corporation to study the proposed increase.
A recent study by Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University and David Card at the University of California at Berkeley found that increasing the Federal minimum wage has not hurt job growth, and Mr. Krueger said in a telephone interview yesterday that he did not expect raising the wage to $6.15 to hurt jobs, particularly in New York.
But Mark Wilson, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, said yesterday that other studies showed that increasing the minimum wage hurt low-skilled workers because employers were not willing to pay more money for their services.

HEADLINE: Former Treasury Secretary Joins LeadershipTriangle at Citigroup

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Robert E. Rubin, arguably the best-known financier of his generation and the recently retired Treasury Secretary, has taken a top position at Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services company.
Mr. Rubin, 61, a former top official of Goldman, Sachs & Company, said yesterday that he had joined Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, the chairmen and chief executives Citigroup, in what Mr. Reed described as a "three-person office of the chairman" that will oversee what has become the first true American financial conglomerate since the Depression. 
 The appointment came less than a week after the Clinton Administration and Congress agreed on a compromise bill that would overhaul the laws that regulate the financial industry, a measure that removes many of the restrictions preventing banks, securities firms and insurance companies from buying one another or engaging in one another's businesses. Both Mr. Rubin and Citigroup strongly supported the bill, which would greatly benefit the company. Mr. Rubin said he played a role in arranging the final compromise that will probably lead to the repeal of the so-called Glass-Steagall legislation. But he said that had nothing to do with his decision to join the company.
The appointment settles the speculation about what Mr. Rubin, who presided over the Clinton Administration's economic policy during one of America's longest economic booms, would do for an encore. Mr. Rubin also discussed jobs with American International Group, a leading life insurance company, and Warburg Pincus, a New York investment firm, before agreeing to join Citigroup, said people who were told about Mr. Rubin's negotiations. He also had discussions with Goldman, Sachs about serving on his old firm's board, people close to Mr. Rubin said.
Mr. Rubin declined to discuss his talks with other companies, and officials of those three companies also declined to comment. Citigroup officials said that while Mr. Rubin would be free to pursue outside endeavors, including a role in New York or national politics, he would not work for any financial company that competes with Citigroup.
Mr. Rubin will not become a third chief executive with Mr. Weill and Mr. Reed, who brought Citigroup together last year by joining Citicorp, one of America's leading banking companies, with Travelers Group, the large insurance company and investment bank. They have had a sometimes rocky relationship since then. But Mr. Rubin will head the executive committee of Citigroup's board, work full time at the company and participate in all significant managerial and strategic decisions, the three men said. Mr. Rubin will also have a corner office alongside Mr. Weill and Mr. Reed in the company's blond-wood and glass executive suite in midtown Manhattan.
"I really like the issues of managing a large institution, and I want to really get back involved," Mr. Rubin said in an interview. "I'd also like to fish, read books and play tennis, but life is a trade-off."
Mr. Rubin's role at Citigroup appears to be a delicate balance between his desire to take an active role in plotting the company's future and his wish to avoid becoming a chief executive with day-to-day responsibilities. No Citigroup employees will report to him directly. But Mr. Rubin plans to bring Michael Froman, his former Treasury Department chief of staff, to work at Citigroup.
The terms of his employment took five weeks of almost constant meetings to negotiate, people close to Mr. Rubin said.
"Bob has the best job in the company: no line responsibility, but he will be a full partner," Mr. Reed said during a meeting to announce Mr. Rubin's appointment at Citigroup's headquarters on the East Side of Manhattan. "He will not play a role as an executive officer of the company, as Sandy and I have to."
But after years as the Government's top economic official, Mr. Rubin brings to Citigroup a Rolodex of contacts that one bank analyst called priceless. To the extent that he is willing to use his contacts to promote Citigroup's banking business around the world, Mr. Rubin could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the bank.
Some analysts also saw the Rubin name on Citigroup's marquee as a draw for star bankers on Wall Street, potentially making the firm's Salomon Smith Barney investment bank a more formidable competitor to other firms, including Goldman, where Mr. Rubin spent the bulk of his career as a bond trader and senior executive.
"He has to be one of the most well-regarded individuals among senior Government officials and corporations worldwide. He can get a meeting with anyone he wants," said Joan Solotar, who analyzes Citigroup for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "They will win deals that they would not otherwise have won."
Mr. Rubin's return to Wall Street is not unprecedented. James A. Baker 3d, the former Bush and Reagan Administration official, joined Carlyle Group, a venture capital and buyout firm. Nicholas F. Brady, a Bush Administration Treasury Secretary, also followed Mr. Rubin's circular path from Wall Street to Washington and back. Mr. Brady now heads Darby Overseas Investments, an emerging-markets investment fund.
Citigroup, however, cuts a much higher profile. It has 100 million clients in 100 countries and is on course this year to earn $10 billion in net profits, far ahead of any of its rivals in the finance industry. It was also one of the leading forces in Washington pushing for an overhaul of financial laws, in part because Citigroup might have had to sell some of its businesses, including its insurance underwriting subsidiary, if Congress had not agreed to pass reforms this year.
Federal law requires retired Government officials to refrain from interceding with their former agency on behalf of a new employer for at least one year after leaving public service. The Clinton Administration requires its top officials to pledge that they will not lobby their agency for at least five years.
Mr. Rubin said that he would take a "belt and suspenders" approach to ethics questions, regularly consulting with a lawyer, if necessary, to make sure that his work for the company did not raise questions about influence peddling or conflict of interest.
"I don't think there should be any political sensitivity here," Mr. Rubin said. "I am involved in the business of this organization, not in lobbying."
Mr. Rubin acknowledged that even while he negotiating his own job with Citigroup, he had helped broker the compromise agreement repealing Glass-Steagall. He said he had a hand in urging Congress and the White House to preserve the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to channel a portion of their lending to poor, inner-city areas. The future of that act had been a sticking point between Republicans and the White House that held up agreement on the financial overhaul package.
"I care greatly about C.R.A.," Mr. Rubin said, adding that he was pleased with the final legislative compromise. "I did have conversations about that."
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Weill said that they had come to know one another while Mr. Rubin was in office and Mr. Weill was constructing Citigroup, the formation of which involved required extensive talks with regulators. Mr. Weill was also perhaps Wall Street's most active lobbyist on behalf of the financial services overhaul, in which Mr. Rubin played a guiding role. Though both men are avid Democrats and have spent their careers in New York financial circles, they said they had not been close friends before.
But both Mr. Rubin and Mr. Weill said that they had not discussed Mr. Rubin's future when Mr. Rubin was at the Treasury Department. Citigroup officials said that Mr. Weill first raised the offer of a job at the company in mid-September, more than two months after Mr. Rubin resigned his post.
"It would have been inappropriate to discuss that while I was in office," Mr. Rubin said.
Mr. Rubin, Mr. Weill and Mr. Reed all said that Mr. Rubin's role at the firm would go far beyond cajoling corporate executives and government officials to hire Citigroup bankers. He intends to help plot the company's strategy. He and the two Citigroup executives said they would be walking in and out of one another's offices all day, running the company as a troika.
Citigroup officials declined to discuss Mr. Rubin's compensation package, although details will have to be disclosed in a proxy statement next spring because Mr. Rubin will be a director. Asked about his pay, Mr. Rubin declined to comment. But asked whether it would top his $150,000 salary as Treasury Secretary, he deadpanned: "That's a fair assumption."
He does not need the money. When he entered Government service in early 1993, Mr. Rubin put his assets, most of which consisted of partnership shares in Goldman, into a blind trust. The trust at the time was valued at about $100 million, though it has possibly increased considerably in value given the bull market in stocks since then.
Yet by leaving Goldman and accepting cash in exchange for his shares, Mr. Rubin missed the windfall other partners enjoyed when Goldman became a public company earlier this year. Had he remained the top executive at Goldman, the assets would have increased at least threefold and totaled more than half a billion dollars.
Moreover, his old Goldman pay pales in comparison with what Mr. Weill and Mr. Reed now earn at Citigroup. Last year, Mr. Weill and Mr. Reed had total compensation, including stock options, valued at about $27 million each. Mr. Rubin seems unlikely to earn as much as either Mr. Weill or Mr. Reed because he does not have the same executive responsibilities. But his senior role in the company suggests that he could easily earn more than $10 million in salary, bonus and stock options each year.
One of the most intriguing aspects of the yesterday's announcement had more to do with the relationship between Mr. Weill and Mr. Reed than with Mr. Rubin's new job.
People at Citigroup have said that the two executives have had difficulty working together, a conflict that resulted in a formal division of responsibilities made public several months ago. Mr. Weill was perceived as the victor in that reshuffling, with Mr. Reed agreeing to focus primarily on specific areas of the company, including legal affairs and Internet strategy.
Mr. Reed was candid about their earlier conflict yesterday, though he said their relationship had improved.
"I think we found it difficult," Mr. Reed said. "The buzz word is control, and in this kind of thing you lose control. You can't make decisions -- you can't even schedule a meeting -- without talking with the other guy. We had an adjustment process."
He said that in recent months, he and Mr. Weill had begun to work together "reasonably well, even quite well."
"Our ability to reach out to Bob like this says we are beginning to figure it out," Mr. Reed said.

HEADLINE: Social Security Scare-Mongering

 BODY:
Social Security is one of the oldest weapons in politics. By charging that various Republican schemes would wreck the Social Security system, Democrats over the years have blocked tax cuts, a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and the recent G.O.P. proposal to replace part of the retirement system with private investment accounts. Now the Republicans seem to be making political headway using the same weapon against Democrats. They are advancing a ludicrous claim that deep Republican budget cuts are needed to stop a Democratic "raid" on Social Security.
The Republican argument rests on a fallacy that spending budget money today compromises the government's ability to meet its Social Security obligations in the future. Instead of squabbling over dollars in this year's budget, Congress can do more for Social Security by producing sound budgets that make the right investments while keeping the economy growing. A prosperous economy is the best guarantee that workers in the future will be able to afford paying for their parents' retirement. 
 In January President Clinton called for setting aside nearly two-thirds of the total projected federal surplus, from Social Security and other sources, to help retire federal debt over the next 15 years. That was a sensible proposal intended to increase the savings rate and lower future interest rates. But the argument this year is over whether a small amount of the $140 billion Social Security surplus in the current year should be used to avoid spending cuts in other programs. In fact, no damage would be done to the economy, to Social Security or to the federal budget itself if that happened.
Asserting that it is merely trying to save money for Social Security, the Republican leadership in Congress wants to cut spending by 1.4 percent across the board and block the White House's initiatives for money to hire new teachers and police officers. The leaders' approach has been so wrongheaded that yesterday it provoked a revolt in the party rank and file, and the cuts were being scaled back. But it is not necessary to slash programs to "save" Social Security. More to the point, there are better places to save money, by cutting billions of dollars in pork-barrel projects and eliminating some of the expensive tax breaks for special interests that have made big campaign donations to the party in recent years.
President Clinton is right to veto spending bills that do not meet priority needs in education, foreign aid, the environment, law enforcement and other areas. As the White House notes, the Republican budget schemes approved so far have already tapped the Social Security system's surplus, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The fastest way to achieve a budget agreement would be to agree to a sensible budget and stop scaring the public into thinking that a modest amount of additional spending would jeopardize Social Security.

HEADLINE: Bush Under Attack as He Sags in New Polls

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
After months of relatively smooth sailing toward the Republican primaries, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas found himself in less placid straits today, with his two main Republican rivals attacking him at the same time that several new polls suggested some give in Mr. Bush's lead.
Both developments dulled the shiny aura of inevitability that has enveloped Mr. Bush since he announced his Presidential candidacy in June. And while this moment was inevitable, political analysts said, it also confirmed that Mr. Bush has yet to face his most intense scrutiny, from competitors and voters alike. 
 Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, suggested that Mr. Bush would have to spend even more time mingling with voters in important primary states and scuffling with his opponents over the issues.
"It's time for him to gear up," said Mr. Simpson, who teaches at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "No one can stay loose like that and do what they have to do."
Mr. Bush's two most formidable challengers for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain of Arizona and the publisher Steve Forbes, made arguably their strongest efforts to date to rattle Mr. Bush's composure.
Mr. McCain, campaigning in California on Monday, accused Mr. Bush's aides of planting and abetting an unflattering newspaper article about him. He was referring to a front-page article in The New York Times on Monday.
"Apparently," Mr. McCain said, "the memo has gone out from the Bush campaign to start attacking John McCain."
Mr. Bush's aides said today that Mr. McCain's accusation was wholly unfounded.
Meanwhile, Ken Blackwell, the national chairman of the Forbes campaign, issued a statement today denouncing a new television commercial by Mr. Bush that asserts that he significantly reduced the growth of government spending in Texas. Mr. Blackwell cited independent analyses that showed a 36 percent increase in spending under Governor Bush.
"It's unfair and it's misleading for him to represent his fiscal leadership to be of a conservative nature, when he really makes Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton's Administration look like conservative fiscal managers," Mr. Blackwell said in a subsequent telephone interview. "There's an old saying in Texas: all hat, no cattle."
Mr. Blackwell called on the Bush campaign to withdraw or amend the advertisement, which began running in Iowa and New Hampshire this week.
Mr. Bush's aides said they would do no such thing. They said that the 36 percent figure failed to account for inflation, increases in population that strained state services and other factors, and that the rate of growth of spending was higher under previous governors.
They also accused the Forbes campaign of reprising the negative tactics that Mr. Forbes used against Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner in 1996.
"This misleading attack says more about Steve Forbes than it does about Governor Bush," said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign.
Aides to both Mr. McCain and Mr. Forbes have long maintained that the overwhelming early support for Mr. Bush was not built on any real knowledge among voters and that Mr. Bush was more vulnerable than he appeared. The attacks today may well have been set off by new hints of that vulnerability.
A poll of New Hampshire voters, made public this week by Research 2000, showed that in that state, which holds the first Republican primary early next year, Mr. McCain trails Mr. Bush by 12 points. Mr. Bush held a 35-point lead in a poll in August.
In addition, two national surveys made public this week suggested that in a hypothetical contest between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, Mr. Gore is gaining ground.
A Gallup Poll of 1,005 adults showed Mr. Gore to be 9 points behind Mr. Bush; a similar poll by Gallup just two weeks ago put the spread at 16 points. The margin of sampling error for each survey was three percentage points.
Mr. Bush, campaigning in Iowa today, said, "I think it's too early to be talking about the general election."
Mr. Bush's advisers said that other recent national polls did not show any dent in the Governor's lead and that they had always expected his lead to shrink, a development that political analysts called inevitable.
"Bush's numbers were stratospheric and unsustainable over the long haul," said Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist.
But Mr. Gillespie added that those numbers were still extraordinarily promising and that rivals who were waiting for Mr. Bush to hurt himself were now realizing that, with only three months before the first Iowa caucuses, they had to inflict the pain themselves. "It's gone from 'if he stumbles' to 'I've got to trip this guy,' " he said.
Mr. Bush is making his own adjustments, his advisers said, adding that his campaign schedule will grow lighter on fund-raisers and heavier on events where he meets with voters.
These advisers said such changes were planned long ago. But one adviser acknowledged that the race had become more volatile with the departures of Patrick J. Buchanan and Elizabeth Dole, which narrowed the Republican field and raised the profiles of Mr. Bush's challengers.
"Elizabeth Dole took 12 percent of the vote and threw it up into the air as a jump ball," said the adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "And there are really only three primary contenders clawing for that vote: Forbes, McCain and Bush."

HEADLINE: Giuliani's New Policy on Work for the Homeless Leaves Many Unanswered Questions

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
On an average night, 21,000 men, women and children bed down in the New York City homeless shelter system. In an average year, city data show, more than 80,000 different people use the shelters.
All those homeless people will be affected in some way by the Giuliani administration's plan to require that able-bodied homeless people work and meet other welfare rules as conditions of shelter. 
 There are many unanswered questions about how the city's plan will play out for various segments of the homeless population, from those who already work but do not earn enough to leave the shelter system, to families who often have to apply several times before they find shelter, and to the disabled and the mentally ill who, advocates for the homeless say, are often expected to work in some capacity.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani stressed yesterday that the work requirement will not apply to all the homeless. "This applies to people who are able-bodied, able to work who aren't working," he said.
Some homeless people say a job is not an automatic ticket out of the shelter system. Kenneth Lindo is not only able to work, he is also working. But 10 months after he entered the city shelter system, he is still sleeping in a shelter bed, commuting from the Bronx to his $5.50 hourly wage as a Wall Street messenger and looking for a room he can afford. He was saving to put down a security deposit but recently had to use much of the money for shoes and winter clothing, he said yesterday.
Under the state social services regulations that Mayor Giuliani wants to apply to shelter residents before the end of the year, people like Mr. Lindo who earn more than they would get from public assistance are required to spend the excess to pay for their shelter bed, up to the actual cost, which is more than $20,000 a year, according to city officials.
"It doesn't make sense -- they're supposed to be there to help you, not hurt you," said Mr. Lindo, 44, who was recently transferred from the 30th Street Men's Shelter near Bellevue Hospital Center to the Franklin Avenue shelter in the Bronx.
The Mayor's press office did not respond to a question yesterday about whether working shelter residents would be charged for shelter. In a recent interview, Jason Turner, Commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, said that question was "in flux operationally," but added his own questions: "Should the shelter system be just a free place to live? Is that the solution, to live in a homeless shelter?"
Questions also remain on how families will be affected by the new rules. In August 1996, stringent eligibility procedures took effect that cut the number of families allowed to enter the system. Last year, the average daily census was 4,800 families, down from 5,674 in 1995.
But though fewer families leaving the system were offered permanent housing by the city, the number of families applying for shelter remained steady, city records show. Many had to apply repeatedly to get into a shelter. One such parent was Lisa T., 28, a Bronx woman with a baby daughter who spoke about her case on condition that her last name be withheld. Ms. T. was living with a cousin and working as an attendant in a nursing home throughout her pregnancy but left her job when the baby was born and six months later, her cousin told her to move out, she said. Unemployed, her savings depleted, and her baby daughter showing symptoms of asthma, she turned to the city's Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx, the only portal for homeless families to enter the shelter system.
It took three applications, two denials and two stints of 10 days each in far-flung shelter hotels -- one in Harlem, one near La Guardia Airport in Queens -- before she and her child were assigned to a family shelter in the Bronx, she said. Though she had never been on welfare before, she was required to apply, because most family shelters, which are run by private, nonprofit agencies under contract to the city, are partly reimbursed through the residents' welfare grants.
She traveled to Brooklyn to notify her welfare caseworker when she was transferred from the Bronx shelter to one in Queens, she said, but mail from the welfare center continued to go to the first shelter.
She never received a notice telling her to appear for a recertification, and her case was closed, leaving her without the $109 monthly cash stipend she needed for diapers and clothes and extra food for her child, who was failing to thrive on the shelter diet, doctors at the Children's Health Fund said.
Under the new rules, however, the results could have been more dire: residents who lose welfare eligibility are no longer entitled to shelter, and their children could be taken into foster care, the city says.
"Over my dead body," said Ms. T., who found jobs as a home health attendant on her own, put her child in day care, and last spring, with the help of her shelter caseworker, obtained a government-subsidized one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx.
She said she does not think the new city policy is fair: "They kick me out of the shelter and the city take my daughter for something I got no control over? Thank God I'm out of that system."
Frederick Shack, the president of an group of 42 nonprofit agencies running family shelters under contract to the city, said that at any one time, 10 percent of the people in family shelters have been mistakenly cited for noncompliance with welfare rules.
It is also not clear how the new rules will affect the disabled.
Although the Mayor said that work would not be required for homeless people who are physically or mentally disabled, city welfare data reflect sharply tougher definitions of disability. In 1994, more than 20,400 adults on public assistance were considered disabled enough to be temporarily exempt from work, but in 1997, the number had dropped to 5,902.
Advocates for the homeless and those who run many of the smaller, specialized shelters for the mentally ill say many who are disabled are already being expected to work for public assistance, or they mistakenly lose their exemptions.
In one example cited by Ray Brescia, a lawyer with the Urban Justice Center, an advocacy organization specializing in mental health and homeless issues, a man with a long history of panic attacks and manic-depression was fired from a workfare job in a sanitation garage after he compulsively filled a canister with road salt, making it too heavy to lift. He lost his benefits, Mr. Brescia said, and under the new rules could have lost his shelter, too.

HEADLINE: Improbably, Silence Prevails As The Voice Awaits Its Sale;
Time and Competition Erode Weekly's Sharp Profile

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The Village Voice is for sale, but does anybody care?
The paper's scrappy union local has yet to stencil up a bundle of picket signs. Vitriolic petitions have not issued from the famously contentious staff. Corrupt politicians seem not to be gloating more than usual. Villainous landlords have not been caught cackling with glee. And thus far, even pundits have pretty much resisted bemoaning the end of an era since last month's announcement that Leonard N. Stern, the pet-food-and-real-estate magnate, is auctioning off The Voice and the six other alternative weeklies he owns. 
 "I was prepared for the staff to be concerned and nervous," said Donald H. Forst, 67, the former tabloid tough guy who, as Voice editor in chief, is perpetually spoiling for a fight. "But I have heard not a peep."
This is an improbable silence, given the superabundance of arias during the operatic past of The Voice. Who can forget the fun when Rupert Murdoch tried to replace the editor shortly after he bought The Voice in 1977.?
"The entire staff walked out and told Murdoch that all he'd bought was a bunch of typewriters," said Richard Goldstein, an executive editor, who has survived four owners at The Voice since 1966. Mr. Murdoch, of course, relented.
But in its new niche as a profitable giveaway, the alternative weekly -- which turned 44 yesterday -- has attained a settled middle age. The Voice is no longer the ground zero of new trends as it was when baby boomers ruled the roost, back when its reportage was indivisible from the movements it covered. It was The Voice that broke news on the rock revolution, the stirrings of psychedelia, the Stonewall uprising and the radicalization of feminism; and it was The Voice that led the charge to bring down Edward I. Koch, Geraldine A. Ferraro and the W-free George Bush.
But the effects of time, generational change and intense competition have conspired to erode the once-sharp profile of the perennial house organ of the counterculture.
And in eschewing newsstands for freebie boxes, the paper that practically invented the modern concept of listings has in a sense become its listings, including the legendary "Transgender Section" ("looking for an attractive she-male to join me on my vacation"), not to mention page after page of "Adult Bodywork" notices.
"I think the rest of the journalism profession doesn't take us as seriously now because we went free," said the Voice's take-no-prisoners political reporter, Wayne Barrett.
And now the paper is competing with itself: dozens of its own writers and editors, in leaving The Voice, have carried its sensibility to mainstream newspapers, magazines and broadcast media.
"Once, The Voice was pushing the envelope, but now the envelope is as big as they are," said former Mayor Koch, who was actually the lawyer for The Voice in the early days, later became a mayoral punching bag for its writers and, most recently, posed with the Rev. Al Sharpton, his new ally, for a cover story by Peter Noel.
"They are still at the cutting edge, but so is everybody else," Mr. Koch added. "There is not a thing they write about that you don't find in a mainstream paper."
But Mr. Forst, who ran the late New York Newsday, asserts that The Voice offers superior coverage of everything from the arts to the city's new immigrant groups, and he insists that the weekly's impact is greater than ever because its circulation has more than doubled since it dropped its cover price. (The Voice is now free in all five boroughs.)
And its staff points with pride to its coverage of the Russian banking scandal and the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, and they proffer recent awards from the New York Press Club and the Society of Publication Designers.
Yet many within the news media say without a trace of malice that The Voice means less to them than ever. "I find now that I leaf through it not expecting to find something that will lead to a follow-up by us," said Peter Landis, news director of the cable channel New York 1 News.
The Voice's coverage is no longer prime required reading in the run-up to the general election. The criterion for journalistic success "is very simple," said Dr. Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at New York University. "Does anybody pick it up? I think that more stories in The Voice go unfollowed these days."
Even Mr. Barrett -- the junkyard dog of city political reporters who has drawn blood from generations of elected officials, and not infrequently the wealthy friends of his publisher -- said that "The Voice does not have as much political impact as it once did."
Though he says he is proud of his recent journalistic provocations -- especially an influential 1998 revelation about Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's attendance record in Nassau County that benefited his campaign rival, Charles E. Schumer -- "now the soft stuff is up front," Mr. Barrett said, referring to the Voice's life style section. "And we don't have as big a news hole" for politics, he said.
The Voice is also battling rampant media fragmentation in its traditionally formidable gay constituency, as it is buzzed by the Internet and beset by print rivals like The New York Blade, Poz magazine and LGNY.
"There is no question in my mind, politically speaking from a gay perspective, The Voice has less clout than it used to," said Jeff Soref, co-chairman of the board of the Empire State Pride Agenda, the state's largest gay and lesbian lobbying group. "It doesn't set the agenda at all."
Nevertheless, the weekly still sees itself as a city institution and is fiercely protective of its establishment-bashing niche. In a sense, The Voice has waged journalistic war and won, thanks to "the many writers it has graduated to the mainstream media," said Professor Rosen, referring to the paper's former staff members at publications ranging from Vanity Fair and Esquire to The New York Observer and The New York Times.
In both its presence and its circulation of about 250,000, The Voice still rules the giveaway universe, despite competition from The New York Press, The New York Blade, LGNY and a swarm of other gratis publications. On some street corners, these rivals fairly obscure the battered red plastic street boxes of The Voice, which has 3,000 points of free distribution in the city.
The New York Press, the Voice's chief competitor, with a circulation of 115,000, is dismissive about the sale and, as might be expected, less than kind toward its rival.
"The writing in The Voice is patronizing, condescending and boring," said Russ Smith, 44, the paper's editor in chief. "People pick it up only for the listings and the ads."
Perhaps an unkinder cut, though, comes from the cartoonist Jules Feiffer, who said that "these days I pick up The New York Press more, because the personal tone reminds me more of the early Voice of Wolf and Fancher," referring to Dan Wolf and Edwin Fancher, two of its co-founders in 1955.
Mr. Feiffer, 70, still feels "rancor over the way I was treated," he said. After 42 years at The Voice, during which he captured one of its two Pulitzer Prizes, he quit the paper in 1997 after being informed that The Voice did not want to keep paying his $75,000-a-year salary.
David Schneiderman, 52, the publisher of The Voice, explained that "we got four cartoonists for the price of one."
"We constantly reinvent the staff," he added. "The only way to bring in new people is to remove old people."
Another Voice competitor, The New York Observer, took over the shelf space of The Voice at many Manhattan newsstands when the non-salmon weekly became a giveaway. A greater economic threat is Time Out New York, which, although it charges $2.50 for its listings and articles, competes with The Voice because its glossy pages are a magnet for advertisers, including big-ticket national campaigns.
In going free in 1996, with a circulation of 111,298, The Voice gave up $3 million in newsstand revenues but has pulled in more advertising dollars because its circulation has bulked up to 249,404.
Although The Voice still appeals to a cadre of graying Bohemian partisans, the median reader age is 31.7 years, putting it firmly in the desirable age-18-to-34 advertising segment. About 57 percent of its primarily single readers, who have an average household income of $43,410, are male; 30 percent of them are black and Hispanic; editors estimate that 15 percent are gay.
"People have been saying they don't read The Voice -- that it's not what it used to be -- since the 1960's," said James Ledbetter, New York bureau chief of The Industry Standard, an Internet publication, who wrote for The Voice for eight years. "But somehow The Voice always manages to find a niche that is necessary to large numbers of readers. A profitable niche."
Mr. Stern says he expects to sell his company at a considerable premium to the $120 million to $150 million it might have fetched before the age of media-acquisition frenzy. He said his company's pretax earnings were $16 million last year, or a 20 percent gross profit. (Those who have seen the prospectus say The Voice is projecting 1999 revenues of $32 million.)
After testing the market, Mr. Stern's investment bankers decided on the tactic of an auction, hoping to flush out nontraditional bidders.
On Oct. 15, more than a dozen media businesses, investment groups and Internet companies submitted bids, which are being kept confidential. A decision is expected by the end of November.
Even if the auction cannot command a premium price, a $120 million sale would not be a ho-hum payday for Mr. Stern, who bought The Voice for $55 million in 1985.
And so these days, as Mr. Stern prepares to rake in his chips, the staff of 152 and 37 part-timers in the mazelike eternity of rooms at 36 Cooper Square is counting on protection from its union, Local 2110 of the Technical, Office and Professional Workers of the United Auto Workers.
On a recent evening, 40 staffers gathered down the block at the Cooper Union to discuss the sale. The mood was "pretty confident; the union is very strong here," said Andrew Hsiao, 37, a senior editor who writes about immigrant activism and is a union shop steward.
"My worst nightmare is that some new owner will take the Martha Stewart approach," said the columnist Michael Musto, the Voice's reigning smartypants. "We hope they don't try to turn us into a formal dinner party instead of a rave."
But in this time of media tumult and owner uncertainty, perhaps the staff of The Voice yearns for some good old-fashioned validation.
"I hope the new owner appreciates how special we are," said Lynn Yaeger, the style section editor. "It's the most important thing. That someone gets us."

HEADLINE: A Horn of Plenty For Opera in Detroit;
How to Thrive in a Blue-Collar City

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 21

 BODY:
As an opera lover who sees several performances a month in Vienna and other European capitals, Astrid Eywo is used to occasionally sitting elbow to elbow with American tourists. But on Oct. 29 she will be the tourist, having flown here from Vienna for the opening of the Michigan Opera Theater's production of Jules Massenet's "Werther."
Mrs. Eywo is making the trip because she learned on the Internet that Andrea Bocelli, the blind tenor, would be making his North American opera stage debut in the title role here, with the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves. "You have so many big artists in Detroit," Mrs. Eywo said. "I am so looking forward to it." 
 Detroit is still a blue-collar city better known for cars than culture, much less opera. But the Michigan Opera Theater here is thriving. Its budget has nearly tripled in the last five years, it has moved into an enormous opera house and it has begun to attract international stars who usually appear in places like Chicago and San Francisco if they travel beyond New York at all.
While Government support for the arts has been fading, the Michigan Opera Theater is growing because of lavish support from three local businesses that also happen to be the world's three biggest corporations: the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. After two difficult decades during which their support for the arts sometimes lagged, particularly at the former Chrysler Corporation, all three auto makers now have record profits. They have been sharing some of their new wealth with cultural institutions in southeast Michigan.
The Michigan Opera Theater has also acquired a powerful and valuable ally: Jennifer Nasser, an enthusiastic fund-raiser and opera lover who is the wife of Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's new chief executive and president. Her work, both in persuading Ford to bankroll big opera events and in organizing her own galas to raise money, demonstrates how one influential supporter in a community can help put an arts group on a sound financial footing. At the same time, she and David DiChiera, the opera's founder and general director, have been trying to use the opera to bridge the deep racial animosity that divides the mostly black city of Detroit from its mostly white suburbs. The opera company frequently produces works with African-American singers. It has also renovated a cavernous downtown theater as its opera house and holds charity benefits there to encourage wealthy suburbanites to venture into the city.
The opera has used the auto makers' deep pockets partly to put on extravaganzas. The Three Tenors -- Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti -- made their only North American appearance together this year at a concert on July 17 at Tiger Stadium, sponsored by Ford for the opera's benefit.
Some purists view a "Werther" with Mr. Bocelli, who is best known for singing operatic arias and love songs in stadiums with microphones, as another potential extravaganza.
"We'll find out when he gets onstage whether he can keep up with someone like Graves and whether his voice can fill a hall," said Steven H. Cornelius, the music critic at The Toledo Blade. "Whether or not it was a good artistic judgment, it certainly was savvy marketing."
But other opera experts say the six coming performances of "Werther" demonstrate that the Michigan Opera Theater has established its artistic importance as well as its financial health. The appearance of Mr. Bocelli and Ms. Graves on one stage, combined with the decision by Steven Mercurio, a prominent conductor, to lead the performances, shows that the Michigan Opera Theater can do more than just hire a famous singer, said F. Paul Driscoll, the managing editor of Opera News, a New York-based monthly.
"It's not so much that Bocelli is appearing but that the Michigan Opera Theater is able to give him absolute, blue-chip support, and that's an indication of how far they've come," Mr. Driscoll said. He said he considered it one of the best regional operas in the country. Like many regional operas, it has no full-time orchestra or chorus, though its members regularly perform with the company and are paid.
Known more for Motown than Mozart, Detroit does not have an opera tradition. While the "Werther" performances have nearly sold out (some box seats, at $250, are left) last-minute tickets have often been available for other productions
In the late 19th century, Detroit had several opera houses that presented touring groups, and there were even a couple of short-lived attempts to set up local opera companies. The Michigan Opera Theater was started by Mr. DiChiera in 1971.
That was a difficult time in Detroit. The nation's worst riots of the 1960's took place here in 1967, leaving 43 dead and hundreds injured, mainly blacks shot by white police officers and National Guardsmen. The city's tax base was devastated by white flight to the suburbs during the 60's and 70's, when the city's white population plunged to 250,000 from 1.6 million. Foreign competition and high oil prices brought the local auto makers to the brink of financial collapse by the early 80's. Art Deco skyscrapers built in the 20's when Detroit was one of the world's wealthiest cities were abandoned to vandals; some of their broken windows still stare emptily across the downtown area, which is only now beginning to recover.
Through the 1970's and 1980's, the Michigan Opera Theater performed at a succession of local theaters. Mr. DiChiera, who had been a music professor at Oakland University in Detroit's northern suburbs, made a point of basing the opera in the city and tried to stage operas that would draw blacks, Polish-Americans and other large ethnic groups in the city and inner suburbs.
In 1989 the company was able to buy a magnificent but abandoned hall in the city center for just $600,000. Opened in 1922 as the 4,250-seat Capitol Theater, it was designed by C. Howard Crane, an architect who also designed Orchestra Hall, the home of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Although the Capitol was used for vaudeville and films, Crane built it just like a large European opera house, with similar acoustics and elaborate details.
Its neighborhood had been so devastated by 1989, however, that the purchase was widely questioned. "Everybody thought we were really insane, we had no touch with reality, this was such a forsaken area," Mr. DiChiera recalled.
To raise money for renovations, he turned to the auto makers. Philip E. Benton Jr., who was Ford's president, and his wife, Mary Ann, already on the opera's board, became chairmen of the fund-raising campaign.
Each auto maker made an initial gift of $1 million. Ford has become the opera's biggest supporter since then, although G.M. sponsors the spring season and DaimlerChrysler sponsors the separate dance series.
The Capitol Theater's one shortcoming was its small stage. So in 1990 the opera company bought a derelict commercial building behind the stage, tore it down and built an enormous opera stage for the hall, which was remodeled to seat 2,730 people with plenty of elbow room.
Renamed the Opera House, the building reopened in 1996. But the Michigan Opera Theater was running out of money and could not afford to paint the walls or carpet the floors backstage. At the first performance, the lights showed a fine haze of dust kicked up by the singers.
Mrs. Nasser, who had just joined the board, was appalled by the dust. "It hit the opera singers the worst, because they have to take in great gulps of air."
She asked Ford's huge real estate division, Ford Land, which owns much of the nearby city of Dearborn, Mich., to fix the problem. Crews installed dry wall, spread 22,000 gallons of paint, carpeted the backstage areas and furnished the dressing rooms. The dust disappeared.
Mrs. Nasser has thrown herself into opera events since then, organizing some without asking Ford's help. She has been successful partly by appealing to the strong inferiority complex that many Detroit area residents have about their city's cultural standing.
When the board decided to invite the Three Tenors for a fund-raising concert to pay off part of the Opera Hall's mortgage, Ford sponsored it, with all proceeds going to the opera.
Ford's contributions to the opera here this year total $2.5 million, making it one of the biggest corporate supporters of opera in the United States. The company has several reasons for doing this, said David G. Ropes, Ford's advertising and marketing director. The company tries to support civic causes in cities where it has extensive operations, particularly in its hometown. It also backs its executives' involvement in local institutions. And Ford wants to improve Detroit's reputation, to make it easier for the company to hire the best and the brightest.
"It has been difficult to recruit into Detroit over the years," Mr. Ropes said.
Mrs. Nasser attends the opening night of every opera here with her husband -- they are always in black tie in the Ford box -- and goes to frequent business meetings at the Opera House. She makes a point of telling other society matrons in the suburbs that the city's crime rate has fallen and that the area around the Opera House is particularly well patrolled by police.
The opera continues to emphasize ethnic diversity in its casting and productions. The crowds attending the opera are still mainly white, but, Mr. DiChiera said, "I look around at our audiences, they're getting younger, and with a growing representation from the African-American community, and for me, in Detroit, those are two main goals."
The Michigan Opera Theater still faces potential problems. One is its heavy reliance on the auto industry, which doesn't weather recessions well and might trim charitable giving during the next one. Mr. DiChiera said that with most of the opera company's construction debts now paid off, he hoped to build an endowment so the operating budget would be less dependent on gifts.
The company also depends heavily on Mr. DiChiera, 64, who manages almost every detail. He has not chosen a successor but said he hoped to put the opera on a financial footing that would make it easier for the board to find a replacement someday.
Detroit's downtown is beginning to revive, mainly because Dennis Archer, the Mayor since 1994, has tried to bring businesses back into the city. A new baseball stadium now stands almost complete across the street from the opera, and a new football stadium is about to rise next to the baseball stadium.
Noise should not be a problem, Mr. DiChiera said, because the opera has built itself an office building on the side of the facing the stadiums. Still, a parking shortage may loom.
Mr. DiChiera said the stadiums would help the opera in the long run, by persuading more people that it is safe to drive into the city again from the northern suburbs.
"I'd really rather deal with the problems of where people park," he said, "than the problem of getting people to come down."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Rally Ends 7-Day Slump In Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were up sharply for the first time in a week yesterday after the release of a weaker-than-expected report on durable goods orders for September.
Traders said, however, that prices were gaining even before the report was released. Early in the session dealers cited short-covering and technical buying as contributing to the gains once the December bond contract broke above the resistance level of 111 8/32. 
 Gains in the European bond market fed the initial rally in the United States on expectations that the European Central Bank would raise interest rates to stifle inflation when it meets on Nov. 4. The move is expected to benefit Treasury bond prices.
The 30-year Treasury bond gained 22/32, to 97 12/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.32 percent, from 6.37 percent on Tuesday.
Traders said the gains were limited ahead of today's data on gross domestic product in the third quarter coupled with the release of the September employment cost index. Many were also waiting for a speech in the evening by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to the Business Council, an organization of top corporate chief executives, in Boca Raton, Fla.
Yesterday's trading activity was also influenced by the Treasury's $15 billion auction of new two-year notes, which saw decent investor demand and may have even helped perk up buying interest in other maturities as well. Dealers had expected a high yield of about 5.95 percent for the new note, which was awarded at 5.935 percent, slightly below the when-issued yield.
Fears that the note auction could fall victim to continuing bearish sentiment over Fed policy concerns, especially with critical economic data to be released later this week, proved unfounded.
The slightly larger-than-expected 1.3 percent drop in September in durable goods orders buoyed the bond market. Since this was the first drop in five months, it was not considered worrisome for overall growth.
"Indeed," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "durable goods orders during the third quarter rose 8.5 percent above a year ago, which was the strongest pace since the end of 1997 and a rather clear indication that the current level of interest rates is not suppressing growth in a major interest-sensitive sector of the economy."
Today's scheduled third-quarter G.D.P. release and its attendant revisions, along with the release of the September employment cost index, Mr. Fine said, "inundate market participants with a torrent of data which can only be described as a pure case of statistical sadism."
He expects the G.D.P. to demonstrate continuing momentum, as growth over the last few years is likely to be revised noticeably higher, while the employment numbers will be carefully studied for signs of a pickup in labor cost pressures.
"Expectations of a further round of Fed tightening at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 16 are now fully incorporated into bond market thinking and rate levels," Mr. Fine said, "and another quarter-point must be deemed the most likely monetary policy scenario at this point, barring any evidence of a sudden, substantial slowdown in the economy or an imminent, severe contraction in the stock market."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods Slipped 1.3% in September

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Durable goods orders fell in September for the first time in five months as the Boeing Company booked fewer orders for its most expensive airliners and Hurricane Floyd caused some factories to close, Government figures showed today.
Orders for higher-priced, long-lasting goods like automobiles, machinery and weapons decreased 1.3 percent last month, to $204.9 billion, the Commerce Department said. Analysts said the decline, after an increase of 1 percent in August, signaled a pause rather than a slowdown in manufacturing. 
 "Once you take out aircraft, the report is still consistent with more growth," said David Wyss, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. "Manufacturing still looks pretty good."
The decline is the first since orders fell 2.4 percent in April. Even so, orders were 5.6 percent higher in September than in September 1998. Economic recoveries in Asia and Europe have increased demand for American exports and helped keep the nation's economic expansion on track to become the longest ever in January.
Orders for aircraft and aircraft parts dropped 17.9 percent last month, Commerce Department figures showed. While Boeing, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, reported receiving 20 orders in September, 7 more than in August, all were for less-expensive 737 narrow-body jets, according to information posted on the company's Web site. Boeing's August orders were dominated by sales of wide-body 747's.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts also declined as DaimlerChrysler and General Motors assembly plants were unable to get components as Hurricane Floyd moved along the East Coast the week of Sept. 12.
The decline in orders for automobiles "reflects some impact of Hurricane Floyd in September, but also a shift in consumer demand to light trucks after relatively stronger car sales earlier in the year," said Paul Taylor, chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.
Though auto orders declined in September, sales of cars and trucks rose almost 10 percent as the industry selling rate set a record for the eighth consecutive month.
The durable goods declines were offset by the fourth consecutive rise in orders for electronic goods, and gains in orders for industrial machinery and military equipment.
Nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft -- a gauge of business investment plans -- rose 3 percent in September after falling 1.3 percent in August.

HEADLINE: Iranian President's Talks in France Draw Protests

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 27

 BODY:
President Mohammad Khatami of Iran braved a storm of noisy protests by Iranian opponents and human rights groups today to seek closer ties with Europe in talks with the French President, Jacques Chirac.
Mr. Khatami, making the first trip to Paris by an Iranian head of state since the 1979 Islamic revolution, also discussed highly charged human rights issues, including French concerns about the fate of 13 Iranian Jews who have been detained on spying charges since early this year. 
 Several thousand Iranian dissidents demonstrated as Mr. Khatami arrived, and human rights groups protested elsewhere in the city, criticizing France's leaders for playing host to Mr. Khatami immediately after the visit of China's President, Jiang Zemin.
The United States welcomed Mr. Khatami's visit and said it expected France to bring up concerns about Iranian policies that Washington finds objectionable. The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said the visit was a sign that Iran wanted to rejoin the international community.
After three hours of talks, Mr. Khatami and Mr. Chirac agreed to do all they could to improve relations at the bilateral and European level and "to remove a few hurdles that remain," said Mr. Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna.
Mr. Khatami, describing his three-day trip amid heavy security as "a historic step," told reporters that he had had a fruitful meeting with Mr. Chirac in which he pleaded for a "pluralist world, one without domination and where all countries lived in peaceful coexistence."
Neither President spoke in public about human rights issues.
Both nations want closer economic and political ties, but Mr. Khatami faces hard-line Islamic opposition at home to an opening to the West.
It was the second time this week that Paris has had to walk a tightrope between defending human rights and seeking lucrative contracts abroad.
Mr. Chirac was heavily criticized this week for taking the Chinese President to his country home, where Mr. Jiang was filmed dancing with Mr. Chirac's wife, Bernadette.
As Mr. Chirac met Mr. Khatami, several hundred people protested outside Paris's law courts for the liberation of the imprisoned Jews.
Before Mr. Khatami's arrival, the police carried out a predawn raid on the headquarters of the dissident National Council of Resistance of Iran. Under a hail of stones, the police detained 39 members for a few hours and kept one of the leaders late into the night.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow and S.& P. Both Gain But Nasdaq Falls Slightly

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
After slumbering through much of the session, stocks sprang to life in the final hour yesterday to carry two of the major averages to solid gains.
There was no particular development to touch off the rally, which left the Dow Jones industrials with a 92.76-point gain, to 10,394.89, but analysts said strength in the bond market seemed to suddenly stimulate bargain hunters as the market awaited two crucial economic reports on Thursday. 
 "There's a feeling around that the bad news on the bond market may be over, with the yield on the long bond contained under 6.5 percent," said Charles J. Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S. G. Cowen Securities. The rate on that benchmark eased to 6.32 percent from 6.37 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500 did even better than the Dow, climbing 14.80, or 1.15 percent, to 1,296.71. The Nasdaq market, however, slumped on weakness in Internet and other computer-related shares.
Ebay, the biggest Internet auctioneer, dropped 13 5/16, to 138 11/16, after its profit report late Tuesday that some found disappointing. Amazon.com, which reported after yesterday's close, lost 5 5/16, to 75 15/16, during normal trading hours.
Financial stocks led the rally in blue chips, with J. P. Morgan up 7 1/8, to 128 1/2; American Express up 5 7/8, to 150 5/8, and Citigroup up 2 13/16, to 51 5/16, accounting for the bulk of the 0.9 percent advance in the Dow.
But investors also found value in some heavy-industry stocks that offset a plunge of 9 5/8, to 67, for Hewlett-Packard on analysts' concern that the computer maker's sales and profits will be shy of forecasts.
"Some of these groups have been beaten up pretty badly," said Timothy M. Stevenson, a portfolio manager at Meridian Investment in Malvern, Pa. He said bargain seekers were prominent in betting on financial stocks in advance of the Government's reports today on third-quarter employment costs and gross domestic product.
Thomas M. Galvin, chief strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the markets are braced for another hefty rise in the employment cost index and contended that if it proved benign for inflation, stocks could rally further.
 If the economy soon shows further signs of slowing from the unsustainably rapid third-quarter growth rate of about 4.5 percent expected to be reported today, the Federal Reserve might even be dissuaded from raising short-term interest rates for a third time since midyear. The Fed is to meet on Nov. 16.
Home sales have already softened, consumer confidence has slipped and yesterday the Government reported the first decline in orders for long-lived factory goods in five months.
Another stock group that bargain hunters fastened on was the airlines, which also benefited from a Wall Street prediction that Continental Airlines will curb its growth next year, reducing an oversupply of seats. UAL jumped 3 1/2, to 65 1/4; AMR 3 3/8, to 59 11/16, and Continental 1 3/4, to 38 15/16.
Of the stocks to be removed from the Dow industrials on Monday, Sears, Roebuck and Union Carbide rose by fractions, Goodyear Tire and Rubber lost another 15/16, to 40 5/16, and Chevron surged 1 7/8, to 89 7/8, after raising its dividend.
CVS, the drug chain, slumped 4 1/2, to 39, after disclosing lower profit margins while the JNI Corporation, which makes computer equipment, soared to 42 from 19 in its initial public offering.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 950.1 million from 878.4 million as advancing issues led declines by 1,739 to 1,311. New 52-week lows, however, swamped new highs by 248 to 30.

HEADLINE: How Taxes Subsidize Clinton-Giuliani Senate Race

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began taking questions at his daily news conference the other morning, Sunny Mindel, the City Hall press secretary, quietly passed a reporter a slip of paper suggesting a subject to raise. On the paper was a news article, but it had nothing to do with Mr. Giuliani or his administration. It was about upstate broadcast editors' complaints about Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for the Senate.
In July, at a public library in Bath, N.Y., a young aide traveling with Mrs. Clinton on her "listening tour" stood before a group of voters waiting for the First Lady to arrive. "I am Kevin, from White House advance," he announced to a stir of excitement, as he proceeded to prepare the crowd for Mrs. Clinton's arrival. 
 In the first instance, Ms. Mindel failed to coax the reporter into asking a campaign question. And the aide with Mrs. Clinton, Kevin Parker, later said that he had exaggerated his credentials: while he worked on White House advance teams, he volunteered his time for the First Lady that day.
But the two incidents illustrated, in a visible way, a striking similarity between Mr. Giuliani's and Mrs. Clinton's exploratory campaigns for Senate. Both are, to various degrees, being subsidized by the resources and stature of the governments with which they are associated.
Interviews with aides to both likely candidates suggest a common motivation for this: to save money. Faced with an extraordinarily long campaign, Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton are delaying the hiring of a campaign staff for as long as possible, conserving resources for what is expected to be a tremendously expensive television advertising campaign next year.
While there is a long history of the use of official resources by officeholders to aid in their re-election, the emerging race for Senator from New York is different, because Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton are not incumbents trying to stay in office. Instead, they are drawing on the resources of City Hall and the White House to pursue new jobs, and pushing their campaigns into what other politicians and lawyers say is an ethically murky area.
Aides to Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton say they have been scrupulous in following Federal, state and city laws that might apply to their situation. "There is no campaign as of now," said Bruce J. Teitelbaum, the director of Mr. Giuliani's political action committee. "Only an exploratory committee. So for the time being, we're doing just fine with the staff we have. Should there be any changes, we'll make the appropriate adjustments."
Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign press secretary, that the First Lady's exploratory committee complies "fully and completely with the law."
"There is a clear separation between the campaign and the White House," Mr. Wolfson said. "Campaign functions are handled by campaign staff."
But the lines appear fuzzier than the aides suggest. To different degrees, their campaigns have the advantage of Federal and New York City laws and regulations that ethics experts have long described as pockmarked and full of loopholes.
"There are going to be issues here," said Gene Russianoff, the senior lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a civic advocacy organization. Mr. Russianoff said that he had seen nothing that had struck him as crossing the line, but he added, "It's certainly fair game as a political issue."
Federal campaign contribution laws do not count the work of government employees who might arguably be helping out a candidate as in-kind contributions, said Trevor Potter, a Washington lawyer and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission. Similarly, the City Charter and the rules set down by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board prohibit the use of city resources for noncity purposes, but offer a fairly broad definition of what is considered legitimate public business. Press secretaries are exempt, said Mark Davies, the executive director of the board.
In ways that are sometimes obvious but often not, the result of this ambiguity can be seen played out almost daily in the two campaigns.
On Monday, Mr. Giuliani ordered two city agencies to conduct a city-financed study on what has surfaced as an early issue in the Senate race: a proposed increase in the minimum wage, which Mrs. Clinton has supported, and which Mr. Giuliani said he would support if a study proved it would not hurt New York's economy. In most full-bore campaigns, a study of this sort might be done by a campaign's issues department, providing the candidate with the statistics and arguments to back a position.
Mr. Giuliani has yet to hire any issues advisers, and the study is being done by the city's Human Resources Administration and the Economic Development Administration.
Mr. Davies, while declining to comment on this specific case, said that past examples in which elected officials had been accused of using their own staff to deal with a campaign issue that was arguably germane to their office had been judged as falling within the city's ethics regulations. "If it's within the elected officials' jurisdiction, that's just the power of the incumbency," Mr. Davies said.
For her part, the First Lady's daily campaign strategy conference call of top advisers typically includes Ann Lewis, the White House communications director. The First Lady also regularly turns to Sidney Blumenthal, another White House aide, for campaign advice.
Federal ethics law prohibits the use of government resources for nongovernmental functions. "The problem would come if she were using White House staff for what was clearly campaign purposes, and the government was paying for it," Mr. Potter said.
But Mrs. Clinton's campaign aides said that kind of business is conducted outside normal work hours, and thus does not fall under the purview of Federal ethics regulations.
Travel costs are also ambiguous. Mr. Giuliani is typically accompanied on his campaign trips by Ms. Mindel and his chief of staff, Anthony V. Carbonetti.
Mr. Teitelbaum said the travel costs of some of those trips are covered by the State Republican Party. But, he said, when Mr. Giuliani went to California to deliver a speech at the Reagan Library, in which he paid tribute to the former President and appeared to lay out some of the ideological framework of his campaign for Senate, that was considered part of his mayoral responsibilities, and was financed by City Hall.
Mrs. Clinton travels with a personal aide, who is her liaison to the White House and Secret Service. She is also typically accompanied by an official White House photographer, whose travel and salary are paid for by the White House. "We are not using those pictures," Mr. Wolfson said. "Those pictures are taken for archival purposes. That is for documenting history."
The extent to which this is going on is difficult to measure precisely, given the often unclear distinctions between government work and campaign work. Campaign finance reports, which will give an accounting of what the committees are paying for, will not be filed until January.
Mrs. Clinton appears to have set up a more extensive paid campaign organization than Mr. Giuliani has. The First Lady has 12 people on a full-time staff. Mr. Giuliani has four, Mr. Teitelbaum said.
Thus, one reason Ms. Mindel, who is paid $120,000 a year as City Hall press secretary, tried to offer a reporter a question is that the Mayor, unlike Mrs. Clinton, has yet to hire a campaign spokesman. Two weeks ago, when Mrs. Clinton gave a speech attacking Republican policies without mentioning Mr. Giuliani by name, it was Ms. Mindel who offered a response, attacking the First Lady for not living in New York.
Ms. Mindel said she was merely responding to reporters' needs. "I find it somewhat ironic that you would ask me that," Ms. Mindel said. "I responded to questions that came to me."
But in other, similar cases involving officeholders during a campaign, press secretaries have gone to considerable lengths to avoid a public role in the campaign. "I pretty much stayed out of it," said Cristyne F. Lategano, who was Mr. Giuliani's communications director during his 1997 mayoral bid. "If it were a campaign-related issue, such as how much money did you raise, I would obviously steer clear of that. That's why we had a campaign office."
Mrs. Clinton hired Mr. Wolfson as her exploratory committee spokesman in June.
Mrs. Clinton's White House press secretary, Marsha Berry, has declined to answer questions about Mr. Giuliani. But Mrs. Clinton has received political support from the other wing of the White House. Joe Lockhart, the President's spokesman, recently mocked Mr. Giuliani for staging a trip to Arkansas.
Mr. Parker's advance work, on the other hand, offered a glimpse at a less obvious way in which White House connections help Mrs. Clinton.
Since the campaign has yet to hire people to plan logistics for daily events, Mr. Wolfson said, it has relied on volunteers, many of whom, like Mr. Parker, also work on contract as advance workers for the White House. As a result, Mrs. Clinton is enjoying the voluntary services of people at the top of their profession.

The Long Dark Night

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
It was peculiar. The women kept pointing to their heads.
"I would ask if they had any health problems," said Zohra Rasekh, a senior health researcher for Physicians for Human Rights. "They would not mention anything specific. But they would point to their heads. Some would say, 'Yes, right here.' 
 "And I would ask, 'What do you mean?' And after a couple of interviews I was really shocked to see how everybody would say the same thing over and over. They would say: 'Well, I'm going crazy. I have bad dreams. I don't want to live anymore.'
"It was so easy to notice this prevalence of depression, even if you weren't trained to recognize it. The women were very down. Some would start crying. They felt they were without hope. Some said they wanted to kill their children and then kill themselves."
Ms. Rasekh, who has interviewed more than 160 Afghan women, said she believed the majority of the women living under the viciously oppressive rule of the Taliban were now caught in the long dark night of severe depression. They are not permitted to work or go to school. For the most part they must remain at home, indoors, as in a prison, their windows covered or painted black. If they do go out, it must be in the company of a close male relative, and within the claustrophobic confines of the all-encompassing burqa.
They must remain quiet. Their footsteps are not to be heard. Their breathing is only grudgingly tolerated. These are women who barely register on the most fundamental gauges of existence. They are not alive in any real sense. They are there but not there. Barely there. How could they not be depressed?
There is a growing fear among top officials of Physicians for Human Rights and other groups that recent overtures to the United States by Taliban officials, including offers to discuss the status of the terrorist Osama bin Laden, will undermine efforts to bring some kind of real relief to the suffering women of Afghanistan.
The Taliban control most of Afghanistan, but because of opposition from the United States and other countries they do not hold Afghanistan's seat at the U.N. And, in fact, the U.N. has threatened to impose economic sanctions against the Taliban if their leaders continue to harbor Mr. bin Laden.
Eleanor Smeal, the president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, which has been trying to focus international attention on the conditions faced by women in Afghanistan, said she feared "there will be a peace negotiation" that could lead to an agreement under which the hideous treatment of women by the Taliban "will become accepted."
She said: "If this can be accepted, just passed off as culture or religion, then there are no human rights for women that could ever be guaranteed. The United Nations has declared that women's rights are human rights. If you can take away the right to employment, the right to education of any kind, the right to move about freely, then what rights do you have? What are the inalienable rights that women have?"
Ms. Rasekh acknowledged that everyone in Afghanistan had been affected by the devastation wrought by so many years of warfare and religious fanaticism. But the conditions that currently prevail for women are "so terrible, so horrible," she said, that they cry out for special attention.
"Even before the Taliban it wasn't the best health system in the world," she said. "But there were trained doctors, male and female, and women could visit male doctors, specialists."
Now, she said, most of the experienced doctors have left. Women doctors for the most part are barred from practicing. And women patients, with very few exceptions, cannot be treated by male doctors.
She said a few decrepit facilities had been set aside, ostensibly for the treatment of women patients, but they were not even minimally adequate. She mentioned a diabetic woman who died because she couldn't get insulin shots, and a woman who was in an automobile accident and died because a hospital wouldn't admit her.
Ms. Rasekh spoke of her own sadness and sense of helplessness as she continues to try to do what she can to help.
"Every day you hear these sad things," she said. "You see them and you feel helpless. I am not the same person that I was."

HEADLINE: A Cruel Plan for the Homeless

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is deplorable that our City of New York, recognized worldwide as a paradigm of humanitarianism, should be burdened with a compassionless Mayor who would force homeless men, women and children into the harsh winter streets ("Giuliani to Order Homeless to Work for Their Shelter," front page, Oct. 26). It is unrealistic to assume that work is ready and waiting for the healthy unemployed homeless who are uneducated and unskilled, let alone those who are mentally ill or physically disabled. Will guidance and training be provided to help the homeless in their transition to the work force? 
 Until better times, advocates for the homeless should be provided with strong moral and financial support in their efforts to help the unfortunate New Yorkers who will face the bitterest of winters at the hands of Rudolph W. Giuliani.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Comments by Gore and Bradley at Candidates' Forum at Dartmouth

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a candidates' forum involving Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley last night at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, N.H., as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription agency.
Q. What is the one most compelling reason that I should voter for you rather than your opponent? 
 MR. BRADLEY -- I think there's only one reason to vote for me as opposed to anybody else -- whether it's the Vice President or whether it's a Republican candidate, and that is because you think that my leadership would improve the quality of life for millions of Americans today, that you agree with my vision of where the county should go, that you share the values that I espouse, and that you recognize that by your participation in the process that America can become what I've laid it out to be. So if you care about fundamental campaign finance reform, if you care about increasing the number of people in America with health insurance, if you care about racial unity in America, if you care about reducing the number of children in poverty in America, and you care about managing the economy so that growth takes more and more people to higher economic ground, then I would hope you'd feel that I would be your candidate. . . .
Q. There's a great deal of cynicism in the country about politics and politicians. . . . What, as president, would you do to restore confidence in the American political system?
MR. GORE -- I understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward President Clinton, and I felt it myself. I also feel that the American people want to move on and turn the page and focus on the future and not the past. He's my friend. I took an oath under the Constitution to serve my country through thick and thin. And I interpreted that oath to mean that I ought to try to provide some -- as much continuity and stability during the time that you're referring to as I possibly could. . . .
. . . I would like to have your support for me because I want to fight for you. A President can fight for all the people. And I think campaign finance reform ought to be passed. I think all candidates ought to be open, give out their income tax returns, sources of income. I favor public financing of elections. . . .
I don't accept any PAC money. I strictly abide by the $1,000 limit, and I have the smallest average contribution in the race.
Q. I like your proposal . . . for guaranteed child health care for every child in the United States. . . .How do you plan to fund it?
MR. BRADLEY -- In this country, we ought to be able to cover people with health insurance. . . .
So I'm glad that you've looked at the proposal and you see that it covers all children; that it brings many adults who don't have health coverage into the system now; that it provides a drug benefit for the elderly. And I also am glad that you took a look at what it costs, because I think that a politician who doesn't put out what something costs when he says, "I want this program or that program," is just, you know, politically posturing.
Ours will cost between $50 billion and $65 billion a year. It will come either from the surplus -- we have a trillion dollar surplus over the next 10 years, and that's enough to take care of this program . . .
Q. I am the parent of a child who has diabetes. . . . If you were to implement health care reforms . . .Who chooses what's covered?
MR. GORE -- We've just had a big increase in our research for juvenile diabetes, and I'm hopeful we can find a cure for that and cancer and other diseases.
I think the decision-maker ought to be the people who are getting the care. That's why I strongly support an H.M.O. Patient Bill of Rights, so that the decisions on specific care are made by doctors and not by faceless bureaucrats who don't have a license to practice medicine and who don't have a right to play God. . . .
I've put out a health care plan that reaches coverage for almost 90 percent of the American people. It gives coverage to 100 percent of all children. The cost is $146 billion over ten years, and a prescription drug benefit is provided under Medicare for $118 billion over ten years. . . .
Q. Since the process of changing the system remains in the hands of incumbents, how can the American voter force change in this area, and what would you do specifically to advance real reform?
MR. GORE -- Let me take ten seconds to finish my last answer. Medicare cannot be an afterthought. The only way to fix Medicare fairly is to set aside 15 to 16 percent of the surplus to do it now. Otherwise, you're putting Medicare at risk.
Senator Bradley said . . .that he would speak to this issue later on, but if you spend the entire surplus on the first campaign proposal, then that does not leave money that should be allocated for Medicare.
Now, I feel very strongly that we have to have campaign finance reform. I support the McCain-Feingold bill. I supported it before it was watered down. I thought the Republican senators attacking John McCain on the floor of the Senate ought to be ashamed of themselves. I think that this is causing serious problems. . . .
Twenty years ago, I supported and proposed and co-sponsored in the Congress a bill to provide for public financing of elections. I support that today. . . .
I follow a higher standard in my campaign. I do not accept any PAC contributions. I strictly abide by the $1,000 contribution limit. I think it's very important to set a higher standard because what I want to do as president -- if you elect me president, I promise you I will fight my heart out to get meaningful campaign finance reform and get the influence of big money out of our political system.
Q. Would you comment on the behavior of the '96 Clinton-Gore campaign as it relates to fund-raising?
MR. BRADLEY -- I think there were obviously some irregularities that have been addressed. I'm not going to get into the details at this stage of the game, because I want to not only answer your question, but I want to get back to the question that was asked over here. . . .
We both have ideas of what should happen: no soft money; public financing of elections; free TV time for people in the last six weeks of an election. How is it going to happen?
First, it requires a grassroots movement. One of the reasons I left the United States Senate was to build a grassroots movement for fundamental campaign finance reform -- something called Project Independence. We got over a million signatures across this country. That's not a movement, but it's a beginning. . . .
Second, people in finance, in business, in religion and in academic life have to step forward and say, "The current system is not working, we demand a change, because it's not working for us."
And third, you need a president that is going to make campaign finance reform one of the top three or four or five issues because he recognizes how it is connected to our ability to insure more Americans, to our ability to reduce child poverty.
From my perspective, there is no issue that is so linked to other issues as campaign finance reform.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Expand Anti-Discrimination Rights for Illegal Immigrants Working in This Country

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has announced that it will extend broad anti-discrimination rights to illegal immigrants for the first time, a policy some critics said could be hard to enforce and others contended would encourage illegal immigration.
The commission said illegal immigrants who were fire or discriminated against because of their race, sex, age or religion should enjoy the same remedies as legal workers: back pay, punitive damages and even reinstatement, but reinstatement coming only if they have first obtained legal work papers. 
 The new policy faces several enforcement problems, among them that illegal immigrants might be too scared to file discrimination complaints with the E.E.O.C. and are likely to have a hard time obtaining official work documents.
The commission said it would not ask illegal immigrants who brought discrimination charges if they had work documents.
The commission said it issued the new policy because it wanted to insure that employers who knowingly hired illegal immigrants were not free to discriminate against them without facing any penalties.
But critics of the Administration's immigration policies attacked the decision, insisting that extending remedies like reinstatement and back pay to illegal immigrants would only encourage more such people to enter the United States.
"This whole policy is creating an atmosphere hostile to removing illegal immigrants from the labor force," said Daniel Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington group pushing for stricter limits on immigration.
Ida Castro, the commission's chairwoman, asserted that without the policy, which was announced on Tuesday, unscrupulous employers would feel encouraged to hire illegal aliens with an eye to exploiting them. The policy would discourage such exploitation, Ms. Castro said.
"If you let employers just breach civil rights requirements for a group of workers such as undocumented workers," she said, "then you're indirectly supporting the hiring of this group and the violation of our laws."
Several critics suggested that the Clinton Administration pushed the E.E.O.C. to embrace this new policy as a way to win support for Vice President Al Gore's campaign among three important Democratic constituencies: labor unions, minorities and immigrant groups.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which endorsed Mr. Gore two weeks ago, has pushed hard for this policy.
Administration and commission officials said politics had nothing to do with the new policy.
John Hiatt, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s general counsel, said the labor federation had long pushed for this policy partly because of concerns that failing to crack down on discrimination against illegal workers could create an atmosphere that allowed discrimination of documented workers.
The new policy continues a trend in which the Federal Government has extended more and more protections to illegal immigrants. They are covered by minimum wage laws and occupational safety laws. In the past five years, the National Labor Relations Board has ruled that employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants are prohibited from firing them if they support unionization.
Attracted in part by contingency and other fees, some lawyers have aggressively moved to file suits charging that employers have violated minimum wage laws for illegal immigrant workers. Some business organizations voiced fears that lawyers might seek to do the same in filing discrimination claims.
E.E.O.C. officials said they adopted the new policy after encountering what they said were horrific examples of discrimination against illegal immigrants. These officials described one immigrant who was dismissed after refusing to provide sexual favors to her boss. Officials also described instances in which managers retaliated against illegal immigrants by firing them after they sought to report racial discrimination or sexual harassment.
Seeking to avoid a clash with the nation's immigration laws, the E.E.O.C. said it would push for reinstatement for illegal immigrants who had been discriminated against only when those people had first obtained papers authorizing them to work in the United States. But the commission said it would recommend back pay whether or not the immigrants had working papers.
Commission officials said the new policy would help not only illegal immigrants, but also their co-workers. "If employers were not held responsible for discriminating against unauthorized workers, it would create an incentive for unscrupulous employers to employ and exploit these workers," the commission said.
Illegal immigration has been controversial in recent decades; many Americans say illegal immigrants are an unwanted public charge while others say they are hard workers who contribute to the economy.
Frank Sharry, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a Washington group that promotes immigrants' rights, praised the E.E.O.C., saying, "This new policy says that if you're working, we're not going to be complicit in giving employers an open door to using your illegal status to hit workers over the head with discriminations."
Mr. Sharry said the new policy was bound to create controversy because it pitted two fundamental concerns: the desire to limit illegal immigration and the desire to combat discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age or religion.
Businesses can fire illegal immigrants because they do not have work papers, but one fear some business executives expressed is that if they hire illegal immigrants without knowing of their undocumented status and later dismiss those workers upon learning of that status, the angered workers might file discrimination suits, charging that they were fired because of their race or sex.

Industrial Park to Be Built

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Salem County and Public Service Electric & Gas Company said yesterday that they had formed a partnership to build a $100 million industrial park in Oldmans, N.J., that would attract warehouse distribution and manufacturing companies and create thousands of jobs.
The utility contributed $4.7 million to the project, and Salem County officials secured a $5 million grant from the New Jersey Economic Development Fund. 
 That money will be used to purchase the 143-acre site and build roads, sewer and water connections to the undeveloped parcel, said Josephine Anderson, a spokeswoman for P.S.E.& G.
The park is expected to create up to 3,150 jobs and generate more than $126 million in annual tax revenues.
The developer, Matrix Corporation, is expected to begin construction in mid 2000 and complete the project in about a year and a half.
No tenants for the park have been secured yet.

Northern, Southern, Sleepy and Dynamic

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI

 BODY:
This old river town, with a site of uncommon beauty and a populace of uncommon civility, has a reputation as a stick-in-the-mud all the same. Mark Twain suggested that he'd like to come here for the apocalypse because it was always 20 years behind the times. Decades later, John Gunther detected "a certain stately and also sleepy quality" in the place.
Even Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio, a member of the city's (and the nation's) longest-lasting political dynasty, told me when I ran into him at a football game that Cincinnati has "an inbred resistance to rapid change." Longfellow, on the other hand, described this as the "Queen City of the West," and in hard times Cincinnati has clung to that phrase like a life raft. 
 The most celebrated outcropping of the city's conservatism in recent years was the indictment on April 7, 1990, of the Contemporary Arts Center and its director on obscenity charges arising from an exhibition of 175 Robert Mapplethorpe photographs. A few of them depicted explicit homoerotic subjects. Much less attention was paid when a local jury, largely working-class in makeup, acquitted both defendants six months later.
Which was par for the course. People also tend to overlook the city's cultural traditions, especially its rich musical heritage, and its record of innovation in many fields. It had the first professional baseball team: the Cincinnati Red Stockings, now the Reds, founded in 1869. John A. Roebling's suspension bridge across the Ohio River, which remains in service to this day, opened in 1866, 17 years before the Brooklyn Bridge.
It was in Cincinnati as well that Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise of the Plum Street Temple, born in Bohemia, gave shape to modern Reform Judaism through the Hebrew Union College, the Central Conference of American Rabbis and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. The rabbi called his Byzanto-Moorish temple "my Alhambra."
Play-Doh was invented here, and Formica, and soap that floats. Rather more significantly for human well-being, Dr. Albert Sabin developed his oral polio vaccine while working here, and Dr. Henry Heimlich perfected his life-saving maneuver for choking victims.
In recent years, a galaxy of groundbreaking architects, including Frank O. Gehry, Michael Graves, Peter Eisenman, Cesar Pelli and Harry Cobb, have designed new buildings for several local institutions, notably the University of Cincinnati. The Contemporary Arts Center, focus of the Mapplethorpe flap, and not some elite organization in California or New York, gave the highly regarded Iraqi-born architect Zaha Hadid her first big commission in the United States.
Mr. Gehry's Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, which opened on Sept. 23, looks like one of those cartoon buildings that are jumping off their foundations, almost ready to burst. The red-brick structure is defined by its bulges and the metal grids of its windows. It forms a vivid if startling gateway to the university, which Herbert Muschamp has described in The New York Times as "one of the most architecturally dynamic campuses in America today."
 
An Early Boom Town
A little bit Northern, a little bit Southern, Cincinnati comes close to the national average by a number of standards, including cost of living and median family income.
Before the Civil War, some Cincinnatians with extensive business dealings in the South defended that region's Peculiar Institution. But local abolitionists helped thousands of slaves escape across the Ohio River to freedom, defying apostles of the status quo. Lyman Beecher, a fiery Presbyterian preacher, spent two decades as president of a seminary here, and his daughter, Harriet Beecher Stowe, drew on her experiences in Ohio and Kentucky in writing the enormously influential anti-slavery novel "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
That history will be celebrated in an $80 million National Underground Railroad Museum, now in the planning stage. It will be a major element in the ongoing reinvention of the riverfront, the place where the city began. A pair of new sports stadiums will be there, too -- one for the Reds, to be finished in 2003, the other for the football Bengals, to open next year. (Pittsburgh, 400 miles or so back up the Ohio River, is building its own pair.)
The Ohio was one of the main highways west, and that made Cincinnati a boom town in the years after the Revolution. Founded in 1788, it was given its name by Arthur St. Clair, Governor of the Northwest Territory. Having fought as commander of the New Jersey militia at the battles of Trenton and Princeton, among others, and attained the rank of major general, St. Clair became a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of Revolutionary officers founded by George Washington. The society was named for Cincinnatus, a Roman patriot who returned to his farm after saving his city in battle, and this city, in turn, was named for the society.
Like the floodwaters that have often plagued it, Cincinnati spread slowly up and out from "the Basin," as the locals call the flatlands along the river, first into the adjoining valleys, then onto the hillsides.
As a Cincinnati Web site (www.insiders.com/cincinnati) puts it, "the steamboat changed Cincinnati almost as much as the apple changed Adam." By the 1840's, it was the sixth-largest American city and the center of the young nation's pig-processing industry. People called the city Porkopolis, and visitors complained of the smell. The English novelist Anthony Trollope wrote of "a stench that surpassed in offensiveness anything that my nose had ever hitherto suffered: the odor of hogs going up to the Ohio heavens."
 
After the Pigs
The porkers are gone, of course, remembered only by the flying pigs atop a dubious monument at Sawyer Point. But one of the companies founded to make use of pork by-products like lard lives on as Cincinnati's primary economic engine: Procter & Gamble, the nation's largest producer of products for use in the household.
P & G's twin post-modern headquarters towers dominate the eastern part of downtown Cincinnati. It has a new chief executive, Durk I. Jager, reputedly installed to shake things up, and the company still reaches into every city, town and hamlet in America with Tide, Ivory, Pampers, Crisco, Folger's, Old Spice and dozens of other brands.
Cincinnati is also home base for Federated Department Stores, the retailing leviathan that operates more than 400 stores nationwide, including Macy's, Stern's and Bloomingdale's in the New York area; Chiquita Brands, the world's biggest banana company, which forced The Cincinnati Enquirer to run a front-page apology and pay a $10 million settlement last year after the paper accused it of illicit operations in Central America, and Kroger, which grew from a single grocery store started in 1883 by Barney Kroger, with $372 of his own and $350 borrowed from a friend, into the nation's biggest supermarket chain.
General Electric, which makes more jet aircraft engines than anyone else in the world, makes many of them in a huge plant in suburban Evendale. And who could overlook the weirdly named Fifth Third bank, formed in a 1908 merger between institutions that insisted on retaining their identities?
But Cincinnati missed what may have been its biggest economic opportunity. At the turn of the last century, it was the world's biggest manufacturer of carriages; when a couple of entrepreneurs named Henry Ford and J. W. Packard came looking for capital to start their auto factories, the local bankers turned them down. So they went to Detroit instead.
The main east-west railroads, and eventually the main east-west superhighways, bypassed Cincinnati. Like people in St. Louis and other older cities in the Midwest, Cincinnatians watched as Chicago became the region's principal hub and their city fell into the second division.
An economic development expert from North Carolina hired recently to make an independent appraisal told local businessmen, "You have the remnants of a great city here," Cincinnati magazine reported.
Having already missed the information technology boom, business and medical leaders here are now working hard to make the city a leader in biotechnology. Led by Procter & Gamble and the University of Cincinnati, a task force is talking about the investment of years of effort and hundreds of millions of dollars. A study released by the group cited among the city's assets its quality of life; but in entrepreneurial culture -- the willingness to take a chance -- the study ranked this region 18th among 21 nationally.
 
A Teutonic Flavor
Perhaps because the region reminded them of the Rhineland, Germans flooded into the Ohio Valley in the 1840's and 50's, eventually constituting a quarter of Cincinnati's population. German-language newspapers were founded, beer gardens sprang up in every neighborhood and German was taught in the public schools. All that came to a swift end with World War I.
But the Teutonic flavor lingers. The arty neighborhood north of downtown is called Over-the-Rhine. Oktoberfest (inexplicably scheduled for mid-September) is one of the city's many annual fetes. Graeter's ice cream, dished up in shops around the city, is another, super-delicious survivor of the city's Germanic past.
Zoology is a German passion, too, and Cincinnati has long boasted one of the nation's premier zoos, under Edward J. Maruska, its widely respected executive director. Lately it has opened a new Manatee Springs exhibit, home to Douglas and Stoneman, a pair of the endangered cowlike marine mammals from the Florida coast.
The most important legacy, however, is the city's love of music. The May Festival, which dates from 1873, grew out of Saengerfests, or songfests, that were given starting in 1849, with up to 2,000 volunteer chorus members. The Music Hall, a sauerbraten Gothic palace that seats 3,400 people, with spectacular chandeliers and a lovely lobby in cream and gold, was completed in 1878 as a home for the festival. It now houses the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Cincinnati Pops and Cincinnati Summer Opera as well.
A distinguished roster of European conductors have taken charge of the festival, which still concentrates on choral music. Among them have been Eugene Goossens, Fritz Busch, Josef Krips and Max Rudolf. In 1906, Edward Elgar traveled to Cincinnati to conduct his "Dream of Gerontius."
Since 1974, Americans have been at the festival's helm: Cincinnati-born James Levine until 1979, James Conlon for the two decades since then. Maestro Conlon is one of those American musicians who have made their careers largely in Europe (mostly France and Germany, in his case), but Cincinnati recognized his gifts early. Now he is the principal conductor of the Paris Opera and the Cologne Philharmonic, but he nonetheless returns to Ohio each year.
The Cincinnati Symphony, founded in 1895, also has a distinguished history, having had Leopold Stokowski, Fritz Reiner and Thomas Schippers as conductors; Schippers, who died young, was a great local favorite who also worked at Bayreuth and, notably, at Spoleto in Italy. The Spaniard Jesus Lopez-Cobos is the current music director, and the orchestra, which plays a full September-to-May season, remains more adventurous than most.
This year the Cincinnatians are playing Glinka, Korngold, Honegger, Nielsen, Griffes, Scriabin, Weill and Zwilich in addition to more conventional musical fare. In January, they will present, in an afternoon and two evenings, a concert version of Wagner's "Lohengrin."
The Pops, probably the best-known such ensemble after Boston's, has gained an international reputation under Erich Kunzel. It has made no fewer than 65 records for Telarc, which have sold more than seven million copies worldwide and earned the charismatic Mr. Kunzel enough in the process to buy houses in the Bahamas and on Swan's Island off the Maine coast.
In the summer the Pops moves to Riverbend, a complex along the Ohio River five miles east of town that was designed for the orchestra by Michael Graves.
 
A Focus on the Arts
Cincinnati's theatrical pride and joy is the Aronoff Center for the Arts, built in the heart of downtown to a design by Mr. Pelli. It has three halls that can house everything from touring Broadway musicals to the productions of the Cincinnati Ballet to small-scale experiments.
The Playhouse in the Park, a professional company with the good fortune to perform in a leafy aerie overlooking the city, will present 10 productions this season, ranging from "Much Ado About Nothing" to "Wit," Margaret Edson's 1999 Pulitzer Prize winner. The small but enterprising Ensemble Theater performs in a converted bank building in Over-the-Rhine; Edward Albee has directed several of his plays there. And the Cincinnati Opera puts on nine performances of four operas every June and July ("Pelleas and Melisande" is one of the features in 2000) in the Music Hall.
As for the visual arts, the city has not one but two important museums -- the Cincinnati Art Museum and the Taft Museum -- both linked with the remarkable Taft family. The fact that both lent important works to the Ingres exhibition in Washington and New York this year, a connoisseur's show if ever there was one, suggests the quality of their best holdings.
It's worth digressing into politics for a moment to sketch in the story of the Tafts. Alphonso Taft was Secretary of War and Attorney General under Ulysses S. Grant. His son, William Howard Taft, a 350-pounder who had to have a special bathtub installed in the White House, was the 27th President and the 10th Chief Justice of the United States; he much preferred the latter role.
"I don't remember that I ever was President," he once remarked.
President Taft's son, Senator Robert A. Taft, a leading isolationist, came close to the Republican Presidential nomination in 1952. His son, Robert Taft, with no middle initial, also served in the Senate. And his son, Bob Taft, is the current Governor of Ohio. The Governor likes politics better than his great-grandfather did. How was he getting on in Columbus?, I asked. "I love being Governor," he replied happily. "I'm having a ball."
Mrs. William Howard Taft was an early supporter of the Cincinnati Art Museum, which has grown into a comprehensive collection housed in a Doric temple in Eden Park, atop Mount Adams. It has just chosen a new director, Timothy F. Rub, who has been director of the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. The museum has good modern art, including a splendidly graphic Matisse called "Romanian Blouse" (1937) and a Warhol portrait of Pete Rose -- a k a Charlie Hustle, the Reds' tragic hero, who set an all-time record with 4,192 hits, only to be denied admission to the Hall of Fame because he had gambled. But its Old Masters are its real glory.
A vast Benjamin West, "Ophelia and Laertes," was bought in London by Robert Fulton, the steamboat man, then brought to Cincinnati by Nicholas Longworth, the founder of another local dynasty, as early as 1828. Closer to our own time, the Emery family enriched the collection with a fine Mantegna, a small but lustrous Botticelli and one of the best Bronzinos I know, a cool, austerely beautiful portrait of Eleanor of Toledo and her son.
This year the museum is showing the extensive survey of Jim Dine's early work that was organized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. Mr. Dine is one of several well-known artists from Cincinnati, including Tom Wesselmann and John Henry Twachtman.
The Taft Museum, quartered in a handsome Federal house overshadowed by the skyscrapers downtown, was given to the city by another branch of the Taft family, which produced several ambassadors, a mayor and a member of Congress. Its highlights, for me, are its fine Hals portraits; a brilliantly colored Gainsborough, "Edward and William Tomkinson," and a great late Turner, "Europa and the Bull," in which the figures vanish in a shimmer of gold and blue.
Across town, the old Union Terminal, a railway station that looks like a Bakelite Art Deco radio rendered in concrete, has been turned into the Cincinnati Museum Center. A landmark of Deco architecture, it continues to evoke the drama of travel in the golden age of rail, while sheltering a history museum, a children's museum, a museum of natural history and science and an IMAX movie theater under its soaring half-dome.
Its ice cream parlor is sheathed in Rookwood tiles. The Rookwood Pottery, Cincinnati's contribution to the Arts and Crafts movement, was founded by Nicholas Longworth's granddaughter, Maria Longworth Nichols. (Her nephew, Nicholas Longworth 3d, was the Speaker of the House and married Theodore Roosevelt's sharp-tongued daughter, Alice, who called Cincinnati "Cincin nasty.") You can see other, better Rookwood tiles in the Federal courthouse, which is named for Justice Potter Stewart of the Supreme Court, a Cincinnati native, and on the facade of the Dixie Terminal.
In addition, the Art Museum shows 30 superb Rookwood vases.
 
A Vertical Idea
What everyone in Cincinnati who has anything to do with the arts is awaiting is the construction of Ms. Hadid's new Contemporary Arts Center on a street corner near the Aronoff. It will be a strongly vertical building, fitted into a tight space, that strikes some people as a Klee magic-square painting in three dimensions. A broad ramp ascending one side of the building is reminiscent of the escalators at the Beaubourg in Paris, except that visitors will be able to peer through holes into the galleries, which are to be arranged on seven levels.
The center has no collection of its own; it exhibits pictures and objects from elsewhere, like the group show of young Brooklyn artists, including James Hyde and Karen Arm, that has been on this fall.
As Ms. Hadid arrives on the scene (her building will open sometime after 2001), the city's best-known woman of the last 15 years, Marge Schott, is fading away. She was ordered on Sept. 5 by Major League Baseball to sell her interest in the Reds -- not because of what she did but because of what she said. Her Reds won a lot more than they lost, and her St. Bernards, Schottzie and Schottzie 02, were a side issue. The problem was impolitic remarks like "Hitler was good in the beginning, but he went too far."
Her departure, wrote Tim Sullivan in The Cincinnati Enquirer, marked "the end of an error."
 
Cincinnati Sojourn
 
Cincinnati is 644 miles from New York City. Here is a sampling of local attractions, as well as other information about the city:
 
Where to Stay
 
THE CINCINNATIAN, 601 Vine Street, (513) 381-3000. Designed by the city's favorite fin-de-siecle architect, Samuel Hannaford, and thoroughly rebuilt in 1987, this is now Cincinnati's pre-eminent hotel. A period lobby opens into a sunny atrium painted in post-modern colors, Tuscan ocher and pale sky blue. With only 143 rooms to look after (a few of them a little small), the staff has time to provide personal service, and does. Double room: $240 weekdays; $180 weekends.
 
OMNI NETHERLAND PLAZA, 35 West Fifth Street, (513) 421-9100. The decor is the thing in this Art Deco classic, built in 1930 and embellished with Rookwood tiles, chromium torchiers and a sea horse fountain. A 1983 renovation swept away a half-century's wear and tear, and the place sparkles as it did when Churchill and Roosevelt stayed there. The food in the pretty lobby restaurant, Orchids, doesn't live up to the surroundings. Double room: $210 to $230 weekdays; $130 to $150 weekends.
 
WESTIN, Fountain Square, (513) 621-7700. The location is perfect, the tastefully redecorated rooms have plenty of elbow room, and the hotel can even claim a footnote in history: the infamous "Jerry Springer Show" originated from the premises in its early days. But service can be dire. My bags were lost for two hours between curb and room, while undertrained, overcheerful people assured me every 15 minutes that they were "on the way up." Double room: $109 to $220 weekdays; $105 to $135 weekends.
 
Where to Eat
 
CAMP WASHINGTON CHILI, 3005 Colerain Avenue, (513) 541-0061. Created in 1922 by a Bulgarian immigrant, Cincinnati-style chili took the town by storm. This improbable passion has never abated, and now there are three chains with 150-odd outlets, plus independents. All serve "three-way" (chili made with cocoa, cinnamon and allspice, served atop spaghetti, with a crown of grated Cheddar cheese); I prefer four-way, with chopped onions, and homely old Camp Washington does it best. Lean over when you eat; the stuff stains.
 
MAISONETTE, 114 East Sixth Street, (513 721-2260. This is the Maisonette's 50th anniversary year. You can return to the 1960's in this traditional, formal, softly lighted place, ordering things like Dover sole along with the city's famously stodgy movers and shakers. Don't. If you ask, the chef, Jean-Robert de Cavel, will send out a succession of light, inventive dishes like a crab salad that incorporates seaweed, juicy red and yellow tomatoes, melon and a lemony dressing. Superb desserts and wonderful wines.
 
THE PALACE, Cincinnatian Hotel (see above). The best of the city's hotel dining rooms serves the closest thing Cincinnati has to New American cooking. The menu includes seasonal regional offerings like a soft-shell crab po' boy as well as many standard items like grilled swordfish. When I was there, a special card offered a half-dozen first-rate South African wines, which would have been startling in New York, let alone the Midwest.
 
JEFF RUBY'S, 700 Walnut Street, (513) 784-1200. A brash transplant from New Jersey, Jeff Ruby wore spats to the opening benefit at this addition to his chain of Cincinnati watering holes. Beef and lamb is dry-aged in a glass-walled cooler (cf Gallagher's, New York), and smokers can enjoy their Delmonico steaks and Bibb salads, their Jordan cabernet or Ducru-Beaucaillou and their cigars in the Toots Shor room.
 
TRIO, 7565 Kenwood Road, Kenwood, (513) 984-1905. A lot of the culinary action in Cincinnati is in the suburbs, and Trio stands out from a slew of other restaurants there for its mostly American wine list (three Ridge zinfandels, 36 selections by the glass, gentle prices). The food runs the middlebrow gamut from meatloaf to designer pizzas to fine wood-grilled salmon; I liked the grilled shrimp on narrow noodles with a Thai sauce.

A Bankruptcy In Japan Gets The Attention Of 'Vultures'

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The vultures are coming! The vultures are coming!
The "vultures" are investors who specialize in buying bankrupt and distressed assets, and two of the top vultures are the Rothschild Recovery Fund, a private equity fund run by Rothschild Inc., and Japan Recovery Capital Partners, which is managed by a joint venture of Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Bank. 
 On Friday, they are expected to announce a reorganization of Nikko Electric Industry, an automotive parts supplier that has the distinction of being the first Japanese company this century to be put into bankruptcy by its employees.
Such investors, most of them Americans, have been circling Japan for the last few years, but most have limited themselves to making investments related to real estate.
So Rothschild's move to take over Nikko Electric is yet another foray by a foreigner that would have been unthinkable in the Japanese economy even two years ago.
"I think this will open a new direction for other bankruptcies and distressed corporations in Japan," said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., senior managing director of Rothschild Inc. and an eminence grise of the American bankruptcy system.
But Mr. Ross and his partners intend to modify the standard American blueprint for reorganizing a bankrupt company. They are inviting some of Nikko Electric's biggest suppliers, which include Delco Remy International, Komatsu, Isuzu Motors and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, to become investors along with them.
"That would make it more like the Japanese system, where customers and vendors traditionally have counter-invested in each other," Mr. Ross said. "We're trying to blend American techniques with the historical way things are done in Japan."
The plan runs counter to current trends in Japan, where even the most staid companies are starting to shed their cross-shareholdings.
Rothschild and Japan Recovery say, however, that giving Nikko's customers a stake in the potential upside of the deal will insure their good will -- and continued business.
Whether they can coax Nikko Electric's lenders into writing off a substantial portion of the outstanding debt may be a bigger challenge.
The Nikko Electric bankruptcy is known in Japan because of the unusual way the company ended up under the administration of a court-appointed trustee. Japan is one of the few countries in the world where employees can petition the court to put their company under its care without management's agreement; Nikko Electric's employees did just that earlier this year.

HEADLINE: Stock Mutual Funds Post Rise In Cash Inflows for September

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The net flow of cash into stock mutual funds is picking up from subdued levels earlier in the year, official industry figures and private estimates showed yesterday.
The Investment Company Institute said flows of cash into stock mutual funds rose to $9.38 billion in September from a revised $8.91 billion in August. Previously, the institute put the August number at $9.21 billion. Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a company based in Santa Rosa, Calif., that tracks fund data, estimated that stock fund flows soared in October to $22.5 billion. The figure, based on activity through Tuesday, could change. If the Trim Tabs figures turn out to be on track, it would be the second-best month this year for flows into stock funds, trailing only the $25.84 billion in April. 
 After a strong start in early October, redemption activity picked up in midmonth when the market headed downward after some unsettling news on inflation, but money began pouring back in later in the month, Mutual Fund Trim Tabs said.
"People were fairly calm" as stocks headed lower, said Carl Wittnebert, director of research. He said Trim Tabs estimated that some $5 billion to $10 billion of short-term trading money tended to head for the exits on a downturn, but the vast majority of investors seemed to be using "buy and hold" strategies.
Mutual Fund Trim Tabs tracks flows for about 90 fund groups representing 20 percent of fund assets and uses a statistical method to estimate flows for funds over all.
Year to date, the institute said stock funds had taken in a net $121.08 billion, trailing the 1998 pace of $138.64 billion by about 12.7 percent.
Hybrid mutual funds, which include both stocks and bonds, had an outflow of $1.14 billion in September, the institute said, after an August outflow of $816.6 million.
Taxable bond funds had an outflow of $2.21 billion in September in contrast to an inflow of $462.8 million in August. Flows into taxable bond funds for the first nine months were $16.12 billion, just over one-third the $46.04 billion of a year earlier. Municipal bond funds had an outflow of $1.75 billion in September, compared with an outflow of $1.47 billion in August. Money market funds had an outflow of $14.90 billion in September in contrast to an inflow of $27.91 billion in August.
The institute said the increased flow into stock funds in September was especially notable in aggressive growth and global funds.
Assets of stock funds fell by $41.57 billion, to $3.30 trillion, in September, a month-to-month decline of 1.2 percent, reflecting volatility in stocks.
Total assets of stock, bond and money market funds fell nine-tenths of 1 percent, to $5.98 trillion, in September, from $6.03 trillion in August.
The annualized rate of redemptions for stock funds, as a percent of average net assets, was 23.9 percent, compared with 23.7 percent in August and 20.2 percent in September.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Have a Broad Rally; Dow Climbs 227.64 Points

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A benign report on labor costs sparked a broad-based rally on Wall Street yesterday, as investors eagerly bought stocks, again believing that inflation is under control.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.64 points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,622.53, extending Wednesday's 92-point gain. It was the Dow's biggest advance since it rose 235.24 points Sept. 3. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surged 45.73 points, or 3.5 percent, to 1,342.44, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 72.70 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,875.22.
Even so, some analysts suggested that the wave of buying was an extreme investor reaction to fairly modest Government data.
"The market was looking for an excuse to go up," said Bernie Schaeffer, chairman of Schaeffer's Investment Research.
Stocks shot higher after the Labor Department said its employment cost index rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter, slightly lower than the increase of nine-tenths of 1 percent many economists expected.
Economists regard the index as a significant barometer of inflationary pressures, so the lower-than-expected gain led to hope that when the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Market Committee meets Nov. 16, even if it raises short-term interest rates to ward off inflation, the increase could be the last for a while.
"The issue is not closed, of course," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America, noting that the Fed will also carefully monitor next week's employment report for October. "But inflation pressures are not problematic at this time."
Bond prices rose for a second consecutive session, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbing a full point to a price of 98 10/32. That sent its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to 6.25 percent from 6.32 percent late Wednesday.
The retreat in bond yields, which earlier this month rose enough to lure some investors away from stocks, gave equities some additional support yesterday.
Bank and financial services stocks advanced for a second consecutive session, as traders reacted to the hope for stabilizing interest rates. Citigroup rose 3 a share, to 54 1/8, and American Express soared 10 3/8, to 161. Chase Manhattan was up 5 13/16, to 88 9/16.
While investors focused on the employment cost numbers, they largely ignored a Government report that the nation's gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 percent from July through September, the fastest pace this year. On a less optimistic day, the G.D.P. report could have prompted selling, analysts said.
"There seems to be a sense that whatever the Fed does, once we get it out of the way, the market can move higher," Mr. Schaeffer said.
In Nasdaq trading, Amazon.com fell 4 15/16 a share, to 71. The on-line retailer said late Wednesday that while its third-quarter results topped expectations, losses more than tripled from a year ago as it spent heavily to expand its menu of offerings.
MCI Worldcom rose 6 1/16 a share, to 83 5/8, after reporting that its third-quarter operating profits nearly tripled, compared with the period a year earlier.
Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by a 7-to-3 margin on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled a robust 1.13 billion shares, compared with 894.4 million traded in the previous session.
Overseas, the Nikkei stock average in Japan rose two-tenths of 1 percent. The rally on Wall Street also helped to raise European markets, lifting the DAX index in Germany 2.1 percent, the FT-SE 100 index in Britain, 1.7 percent, and the CAC-40 index in France, 1.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Small Employers Describe Health InsuranceConcerns

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The rising cost of health insurance is hitting small employers particularly hard, with premiums for the smallest companies rising 9.2 percent last year, according to a new survey.
Researchers said this was one of several ominous trends in employer-based health insurance. "The fact that we really haven't seen any change in the percentage of employers offering coverage during an all-time boom economy is cause for worry," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, the health research group that co-sponsored the survey of 1,939 companies. "This is as good as it gets." 
 Sixty percent of all small firms offered their employees health insurance in 1999, a percentage that was statistically unchanged from 1996, the survey found. Virtually all big employers -- defined as those with 200 employees and more -- offered health benefits.
The study, released at a news conference today in Washington, provides an annual snapshot of health insurance provided through the workplace, which is how most Americans get their health benefits. It showed that the managed care revolution has all but overwhelmed conventional, fee-for-service coverage: only 9 percent of Americans with job-based coverage are enrolled in a traditional plan, down from 73 percent in 1988.
By comparison, 28 percent were enrolled in health maintenance organizations and 38 percent were in preferred provider organizations, the most popular type of health plan last year. In contrast to H.M.O.'s, preferred provider organizations allow patients to go beyond the plan's list of participating doctors, if they are willing to pay more, and do not require patients to go through a primary care gatekeeper to see a specialist.
The shift to managed care is widely credited for having helped control health care costs for several years, but the survey confirmed that premium prices are beginning to rise again. Over all, in the year ending in the spring of 1999, premiums for employer-sponsored health coverage increased 4.8 percent, the biggest jump since 1994. Researchers said this was relatively modest compared with the double-digit increases of a decade ago, but still more than double the rate of inflation.
Moreover, said Larry Levitt, a Kaiser analyst, "the most fragile part of the health care system is getting hardest hit." Companies employing three to nine workers reported the highest increase in premiums: 9.2 percent. By comparison, companies with more than 200 employees reported a 4.1 percent increase in premium costs.
Mr. Altman said, "These increases will make it even harder for small businesses to provide health insurance for their employees in the future." Several researchers said that such strains in the employer-based system help explain why policy makers in Washington are searching for alternative means of helping the uninsured. The Census Bureau reported last month that 44.3 million people are uninsured.
Researchers also found that companies who finance their own health insurance reported substantially lower premium increases than the firms that bought it from insurance companies. Jon R. Gabel, one of the researchers, traced this to "catch-up pricing," with insurers trying to restore their profitability after several years of "underpricing" to get a bigger share of the market.
The survey released today was based on telephone interviews with human resource and benefit administrators at a random sample of companies and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. For several years the survey was conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick, but was turned over last year to the Health Research and Educational Trust, a nonprofit research group, which now conducts the survey with Kaiser.
Researchers also asked employers about the "patients' rights" proposals being debated in Congress this year, and found that a majority supported such measures as the right to external review, when a health plan denies care, and even the right to sue. But support was generally higher among small employers, particularly on the right to sue, which was backed by 61 percent of small employers, while more than half of the biggest firms opposed it.
Nearly three-fourths of all employers said they were worried that health care costs would rise faster than they could afford, and 65 percent said they were "somewhat" or "very" worried that they would have to switch health plans because of costs. By contrast, only 26 percent said they were "somewhat" or "very" worried that they would have to switch because of concerns about the quality of care.

HEADLINE: Nigeria Gets U.S. Help, but Bigger Plan for Africa Snags

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
As President Clinton met today with Nigeria's recently elected President and pledged a tripling of aid to the country, his Administration's biggest initiative for Africa -- a bill that could ease Africa's access to the American market -- seemed imperiled in the Senate.
Mr. Clinton's afternoon meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo was an effort to show new American political support for a country tormented for decades by corruption, military dictatorship and violence. But when Mr. Obasanjo arrived here, he joined the parade of new democratic leaders who wanted to talk tariff rates and debt forgiveness. And during an afternoon news conference with Mr. Clinton, he spoke about Nigeria's new commitment to "a level playing ground" for investors, making sure that "investment can be secure." 
 Mr. Obasanjo's main goal was to reduce or reschedule more than $30 billion in debt. Paying down the interest and the principal takes up a huge part of Nigeria's gross national product. At the news conference, Mr. Clinton said, "It is neither morally right nor economically sound to say that young democracies like Nigeria, as they overcome the painful legacy of dictatorship or misrule, must choose between making interest payments on their debt and investing in the health and education of their children."
But under the debt-forgiveness plan for the world's poorest nations that Mr. Clinton announced last month, Nigeria would be only a partial beneficiary. The country has such large oil reserves that little of its debt would be forgiven outright. Instead, payments to the world's major powers and to the World Bank would largely be delayed.
But even as he was meeting with Mr. Obasanjo today, Mr. Clinton was trying to save the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which would reduce or eliminate duties on a range of products produced in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly those made with American-produced fabrics.
Until today, the bill appeared to be sailing toward easy passage. But late this afternoon, aides to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said the bill could be pulled from the Senate agenda on Friday because of a dispute with Democrats over amendments. This also threatened a similar trade bill for Caribbean nations, which is attached to the African bill.
On Tuesday, bipartisan support for the trade bill -- which would mean a great amount to sub-Saharan countries but would have a barely measurable effect on the American economy -- appeared extremely strong. The Senate voted 90 to 8 to cut off a filibuster led by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who fears the effects of African imports on his state's politically powerful textile makers.
On Wednesday, however, Mr. Lott said he feared that Democrats would try to to attach a raft of unrelated amendments to the bill. So he invoked a parliamentary maneuver to block Democrats from offering amendments.
That infuriated Democrats who had hoped to offer amendments on raising the minimum wage, a patients' bill of rights and a Medicare prescription drug bill -- all initiatives that Mr. Clinton has supported, and which Democrats hope to turn into campaign issues.
Mr. Clinton has been calling around on Capitol Hill -- including to Mr. Lott -- to save the bill. White House officials are clearly concerned that he not be accused of doing too little, the charge that Republicans leveled after the defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty two weeks ago.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, who supports the bill, today angrily denounced the Republican procedural tactics. He said the debate now revolved around any senator's fundamental right to offer an amendment.
Aides to Mr. Daschle said that barring a last-minute compromise, all 45 Democrats would probably vote against a second motion to cut off debate on Friday.
About 50 Republicans are expected to vote to end the filibuster, but a spokesman for Mr. Lott, John Czwartacki, said that if the majority could not muster the 60 votes necessary to cut off debate, the majority leader would pull the bill from the Senate floor agenda.
Mr. Czwartacki signaled that Republicans were ready to turn Mr. Clinton's own accusations of isolationism against Democrats if the procedural vote failed.
"If there is no cloture, the Democrats will have succeeded in bowing to the worst elements of isolationism in their own party," Mr. Czwartacki said.
Democrats said they were willing to pay that price to stand up for the larger procedural principles of the Senate.
"This is a sham," Mr. Daschle said on the floor. "There is nothing deliberative about the Senate today. They want to make this a legislative assembly line. You take something up, you vote it up or down, and you move it along."
Tonight, Mr. Lott and Mr. Daschle met to discuss a compromise, but it was unclear whether they would reach agreement before Friday's vote.

HEADLINE: In 2 Leaders' Words: An Outline for Hope in Nigeria

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday with President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, as provided by the Federal Document Clearing House, a transcription service:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
By President Clinton
 President Obasanjo, Mrs. Obasanjo, members of the Nigerian Government, welcome to the White House. The President has served his country in many ways, including a previous term as President, which was distinguished by his insistence on a peaceful transition to a successor chosen by the people. His recent election marks an even bigger turning point. 
 Since its birth in 1960, Nigeria's progress has been thwarted over and over again by military leaders with little concern for the 110 million people. . . . It is very much in America's interests that Nigeria succeed, and therefore we should assist them in their success. We intend to increase our assistance to Nigeria to expand law-enforcement cooperation and to work toward an agreement to stimulate trade and investment between us. We intend to do what we can to help Nigeria recover assets plundered by the previous regime.
But we must do more to realize the promise of this moment for Nigeria and for Africa. I want to mention just three issues. First, we need to recognize that barriers to trade are barriers to opportunity for Africans working hard to catch up to the global economy and for Americans who want to work with them. That's why it is vital that the Senate approve the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which is now pending and on which I spent much of the afternoon working.
The second concrete step we can take, as President Obasanjo has reminded us, is to help relieve the crushing debt burden that is making it so hard for developing nations to get on their feet. It is neither morally right nor economically sound to say that young democracies like Nigeria, as they overcome the painful legacy of dictatorship or misrule, must choose between making interest payments on their debt and investing in the health and education of their children. As Nigeria undertakes its reforms, I will support generous debt rescheduling through the Paris Club and encourage other countries to take further steps.
Finally, we must keep doing our part to bring an end to Africa's remaining conflicts. Many of you have heard about the unspeakable atrocities visited upon the people of Sierra Leone. Nigeria spent billions of dollars leading the international force that ended civil wars there and in Liberia. And for that, the whole world is in its debt. . . .
 
OPENING STATEMENT
By President Obasanjo
 Mr. President, it's just for me to take this opportunity, on behalf of my Government and the people of Nigeria, to express our deep appreciation for your concern and for your support for the new dispensation in my country for democracy. We thank you for your commitment and the commitment of your country to insure that democracy will continue to be nurtured and to be sustained in our country and in our part of the world. We believe that democracy is a process and not an event. And therefore we must continue to work to expand, to widen and to deepen the process of democracy, which we are committed to do.
We also thank you for the understanding you have shown for the commitment and the sacrifice which our country and our people have made and which we continue to make for peace and stability in our subregion and our region of Africa. We do this knowing and believing that peace is indivisible, and if there is no peace in any part of our subregion, it has implications for us.
We also thank you for the commitment you have made -- that while we make our commitment, you will continue to support our commitment. Because our own commitment, which will make peace and stability an enduring feature of that part of the world has significant contribution to the world of peace, to the world of harmony, to the world of order and stability, which is so dear to all of us, and which, of course, is of strategic importance and interest of the United States of America. . . .
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
MR. CLINTON: Thank you. We will now alternate questions between the American and the Nigerian press members here. . . .
Q. Nigeria lost a lot of money through a lot of -- I mean, our leaders' looting the Treasury and bringing the money not only to the U.S., but to Switzerland. What is the U.S. going to do about it to recover that money, the money in this country and the money that is in Switzerland? . . .
MR. CLINTON: Well, first I'll answer the question you asked me. I think it's important that we do whatever we can to help Nigeria recover money that was looted from the country and that belongs to the people of Nigeria.
The Attorney General came to our meeting today, Attorney General Reno, and we are working with the Government of Nigeria, and I will do whatever we can legally do to help recover funds that are in this country and whatever we can do to assist in recovering funds that may be in Switzerland or elsewhere.
You know, we have -- I may have to get some help -- some voluntary help from the Swiss. You know, the laws are different in different countries. But we think there are quite a number of things we can do here and we're committed to working with the Nigerian Government to do that.
MR. OBASANJO: Thank you very much. The only thing I can add to that is that the Swiss authorities have already frozen some accounts in Switzerland. And other steps that have to be taken will be taken as a result of what they have done so far. . . .
Q. In Oslo, sir, what do you expect between the meetings with Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Barak? And what are the next steps? And are you looking for any concrete results?
MR. CLINTON: Well, first of all, I think it's a good thing that we're going to have this trilateral meeting, and it's just another step along the way. They've been making good progress, and they're working hard. I wouldn't want to raise expectations excessively about what the results of this meeting will be. But they have put themselves on an aggressive timetable, and they have a lot of tough issues to work through.
And since the United States has, at least in my time, primarily played a role as a facilitator, with greater or lesser degrees of intensity and initiative, including the Wye talks, when no one slept for nine days, I think that it's best for me not to speculate about what the substantial results will be.
Let me say this. I believe that both these leaders want to make peace. I believe they're committed to it. And I believe they know they're down to the difficult issues now.
And -- but I also believe they're imagining what a final agreement would look like, what they could live with, what would -- and what would be good for the other side and, mostly, what would preserve the integrity of their principles and the long-term peace of the region. . . .
Q. Mr. President, you have the largest democracy in Africa. What are the initiatives you hope to make it sustainable? And at the same time, also, as far as that constellation is concerned, what are some of the measures your Government is doing to attract businesses and investors to invest in Nigeria?
MR. OBASANJO: To invite investment into Nigeria, we have to create conducive environment for business to thrive. We have to create conducive environment for investors to want to invest in Nigeria, because investors have choices. Therefore we should make them choose to come to Nigeria.
And what are we doing? First of all, we are eliminating corruption as a way of life in Nigeria. You know, not many, if at all any, honest businessmen will want to rush into a corrupt atmosphere to do business. So we have to remove corruption, and we are doing that. We have to provide a level playing ground for all participants, so that there is equity, there is fairness, there is justice, and you can go in and compete. That we have done.
The rules and regulations must be clear, so that you know what it is. There must be transparency. There must be openness. . . . We are fighting against crime. Crime, in such a way that life and properties can be safe and secure, in such a way that investment can be secure.
These and all the things we are doing -- the rule of law -- so that when you have to seek arbitration by the court, you can be sure that you get fair deal from the court. We are doing all that we need to do to make the investors feel that all of the things put together, Nigeria is a better place to invest than any other place of comparative economic situation.

HEADLINE: Mayor Needs Old Magic in San Francisco Race

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
For an hour, it was 1995 again, when Willie Lewis Brown Jr. was the newly minted Mayor and San Francisco was dazzled by his possibilities.
Mayor Brown played the crowd at City Hall like Mozart on the piano, vowing to right what's wrong and better what's right, and tempering the high notes with quiet moments and meaningful pauses. And when he was finished on Monday with what he called this "last state of the city address to be given by any Mayor in this century," the chamber, so packed a person could faint, erupted in the loud, long applause usually reserved for a Broadway hit. 
 Then 1999, one week before the mayoral election, came rushing back. In the hallway outside the chamber, someone held a newspaper with the latest San Francisco Chronicle poll. It showed Mr. Brown gaining 33 percent of the vote, far short of the 50 percent plus one vote needed to win the election on Tuesday.
Nearby stood Frank Jordan, the former Mayor, who is one of Mr. Brown's three main opponents, drawing a crowd as he wondered aloud where the $1 billion increase in the city's budget over the last four years had gone.
Near him lingered Tom Ammiano, the president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, who entered the race less than two weeks ago as a write-in candidate. Mr. Ammiano was exulting over the newspaper poll, which put him in a statistical tie for second place without even being listed as one of the candidates.
Given the polls, a run-off election in December seems likely. And while the prevailing thought is that Mr. Brown, who entered office as Mr. San Francisco, would win that race, no one is taking his victory for granted. The fact is, San Francisco's Mayor, a master of the political universe who spent three decades in the California Legislature (15 years as the Assembly Speaker before a new two-term-limit law forced him from office in 1995), is no longer Prince of the City.
Despite a booming economy, low unemployment and plunging crime rates that mirror the national trend, voters in politically obsessed San Francisco are not happy. And while this is not as surprising as it sounds -- San Franciscans are notoriously hard to please, not having re-elected a mayor in 16 years -- Mr. Brown, as colorful and irrepressible as the city considers itself, has disappointed voters on all sides.
To his more liberal constituents, he is too cozy with developers and other big business interests. To more conservative voters (a conservative here is a moderate Democrat anywhere else in the country), he does not pay enough attention to quality-of-life issues like traffic and is too close to the fringe groups that give San Francisco its reputation as a hotbed of radical chic.
Trying to cater to competing constituencies is a tricky business. Earlier this month, the Mayor ordered the confiscation of supermarket shopping carts that homeless people use to haul their possessions, on the grounds that they were stolen property. The move was seen as a response to merchants' complaints.
But even with public compassion towards homeless people at a seemingly all-time low, publicity about the operation brought outrage and sympathy. Mr. Brown stopped the operation before it began, both denying he had ordered it and claiming it was misunderstood. That, in turn, caused the more conservative pundits and business people in the city to label the Mayor a waffler.
The hard truth for Mr. Brown is that many San Franciscans believe the city is not better off than it was four years ago. Half the voters in the latest poll said that homelessness, considered the city's No. 1 problem, has gotten worse during the Mayor's term. A third of the voters said that the city's trouble-plagued public transit system, known as Muni, has deteriorated, while only 23 percent said it had improved. And 43 percent of those polled say that a major problem, the lack of affordable housing, has worsened, while only 14 percent said the condition had improved. The Mayor's administration has also been plagued with accusations of cronyism and corruption in several city agencies.
Until last week, at least, Mr. Brown had the edge among liberals. Both of his leading opponents until then -- Mr. Jordan and Clint Reilly, a political consultant and Mr. Jordan's former campaign manager, who has spent more than $3 million of his own money on his campaign -- are considered more conservative. So the Mayor concentrated his heaviest campaigning in the more traditionally conservative Asian neighborhoods. But the write-in candidacy of Mr. Ammiano, a former teacher who is gay, has thrown the liberal vote into question.
The Ammiano campaign, as it exists, has galvanized disenchanted voters who had planned to sit out the election, his supporters contend.
"Everyone I know was sitting around saying, 'Gosh, who am I going to vote for for mayor?' " said Tim Redmond, executive editor of The Bay Guardian, a liberal weekly newspaper that repeatedly urged Mr. Ammiano to run.
Mr. Redmond estimated that several thousand voters who had planned to stay home or vote for a fringe candidate would write in Mr. Ammiano. "All of this pent-up frustration has been released because all of a sudden people have a place to go with it," he said. "I haven't seen this kind of excitement in a while."
The Brown campaign seems resigned to losing some support.
"There is no doubt that we're disappointed that Tom Ammiano has entered the race and will probably help the more conservative candidates by doing so," said P. J. Johnston, a spokesman for the Mayor's re-election team.
In response to the threat, the Mayor's campaign brought the liberal heavy-hitter the Rev. Jesse Jackson to town on Tuesday. The Mayor and Mr. Jackson made a series of stops in neighborhoods like the Castro, the largely gay district, to remind voters of Mr. Brown's long civil rights credentials. Mr. Jackson's presence certainly attracted attention, though he tried to deflect it to the Mayor.
"Willie Brown is the real thing," Mr. Jackson would say, as passers-by vied to shake his hand.

Economy Expands Briskly, With Labor Costs Benign
The American economy turned in its best quarterly performance of the year this summer, expanding at a brisk 4.8 percent annual rate. That virtually guaranteed enough momentum to carry the nation to its longest economic expansion in history early next year. 
 Much to Wall Street's delight, inflation was mild, with the cost to employers of wages and benefits up only modestly. Page A1.
 
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, called the economy's recent growth rate unsustainable but said the rise in long-term interest rates appeared to be containing the risks of inflation. Addressing business executives on the pitfalls facing the economy, he gave no clear signal on whether he planned to raise interest rates for a third time this year. C6.
 
Stocks and Bonds Rally Smartly
Investors eagerly bought stocks in response to the benign labor report. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.64 points, to 10,622.53, The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surged 45.73 points, to 1,342.44, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 72.70 points, to 2,875.22. The bond market also rallied, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbing a full point to a price of 9810/32 . C8.
 
In Los Angeles, a Contrite Publisher
Faced with a rebellion by distraught and angry newsroom staff members, the publisher of The Los Angeles Times, Kathryn M. Downing, said her own "fundamental misunderstanding" of editorial principles led her to sign an agreement sharing the profits of the Oct. 10 issue of The Times's Sunday magazine with the Staples Center, the topic of the issue. C2.
 
Health Insurance Costs Rise
The rising cost of health insurance is hitting small employers particularly hard. Premiums for the smallest companies rose 9.2 percent last year, a new survey found. C8.
 
A.M.A. Creates Internet Company
The American Medical Association and six other medical societies have created an Internet company to publish consumer information on health care and help doctors communicate with patients by E-mail. C2.
 
At I.B.M., Flexible Transistors
I.B.M. researchers will report today that they have developed flexible transistors that can be embedded in thin curved surfaces. C2.
 
CBS Earnings Top Expectations
CBS said it earned a better-than-expected $47 million, or 7 cents a share. It cited strong television, radio and outdoor advertising. C7.
 
Insurer's Profit is Up 17.6 Percent
American International Group said it earned $1.27 billion in the third quarter, a 17.6 percent increase from the 1998 period of 1998. C19.
 
MCI Worldcom Shows Strong Gains
MCI Worldcom said that its third-quarter profit more than tripled as demand for data services surged. The company, which is acquiring Sprint in what will be the largest corporate takeover ever, said net income rose to $1.1 billion, or 55 cents a share, exceeding analysts' forecast of 54 cents. MCI Worldcom shares surged $6.0625, to $83.625. C6.
 
Offer for Air Canada Sweetened
Onex raised its offer for Air Canada by more than half and took steps to insure that a new, merged carrier is Canadian-controlled by removing American Airlines as a partner. C4.
 
Vulture Funds Circling Over Japan
Vulture funds -- which specialize in buying bankrupt and distressed assets -- have been circling Japan for years. Now Rothschild Inc. is moving to take over Nikko Electric. C4.

Bradley's Gestalt Therapy

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H.

 BODY:
Thanks to this week's presidential debates forums, town halls, whatever you want to call them -- we now know that Bill Bradley's idea of a great leader is Jimmy Carter ("integrity"), Woodrow Wilson ("the ability to see around corners") or Mikhail Gorbachev ("courage"). Who could not find this interesting? Once again, Mr. Bradley demonstrated that he is a new kind of candidate, a man who skips the predictable tributes to Lincoln and F.D.R., and instead names three former heads of state so high-minded their constituents practically ran them out of town on a rail.
How many of you watched the debates on TV? (I don't want to see any hands from people who taped. Sure, you're going to watch them later, right after all six hours of "Middlemarch.") No matter. We'll boil them down for you. We have nothing better to do with our time -- in fact, we can travel right up to New Hampshire and watch them on the spot, in a large hall where people are not permitted to click over to the Weather Channel when Steve Forbes starts explaining his economic agenda. 
 The Democratic debate was actually the only game in town involving more than one serious presidential candidate. Republicans were stuck watching Senator John McCain jockeying with a whole bunch of peculiar people with single-digit poll numbers and a lot of time on their hands.
George W. Bush was forced to skip the event in order to watch his wife receive an award in Texas. Family is very important to Mr. Bush, who was undoubtedly looking forward to arguing foreign policy with Mr. McCain, and hearing more about his experiences as a heroic prisoner of war. But he apparently did not have enough clout to get the ceremony scheduled on another day. This is yet another reminder that Texas has a weak-governor system.
Al Gore has a personality without a thermostat, and when he tries to look animated he practically crashes into the wallboard. On Wednesday he hijacked the auditorium early on, begging for a chance to do a pre-debate Q.-and-A. ("This person has a question! Do we have time for his question?") He tossed in a little Spanish and a long joke, and made endless attempts to create Clintonesque mind-melds with the audience. ("How old is your child, Corey? . . . Are you unionized, Earl?") At the end, he refused to be dragged offstage. ("Can I say one more word? I would like to stay!") He bore an uncomfortable resemblance to the kid who asks the teacher for more homework. Mr. Bradley, lounging on his stool, arms folded across his chest, looked like the high school athlete watching the class nerd volunteer to stay and clap erasers.
"His gestalt is the gestalt of the time," said the Bradley adviser Rick Stengel. "This elbowing back and forth, that's history."
Either due to excess gestalt or lack of a good retort, Mr. Bradley refused to fight back when Mr. Gore attacked his health insurance plan, saying it would cost $1.4 trillion and eat up all the money for the rest of the Democratic agenda. That made the vice president look like the stronger candidate -- overstimulated, yes, but aggressive. If Mr. Bradley keeps refusing to grab the initiative, he is going to undermine the media-wide ban on use of basketball analogies and force somebody to start recalling how, when he was a Knick, he preferred passing the ball to making the critical shot.
But what, by the way, ever happened to Mr. Gore's own budget-busting Big Idea for HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE NATION, which he bellowed at every opportunity back when he was working on the theory that shouting a speech made it more interesting? The campaign contends it's still there, although on Wednesday night it had dwindled away to "we've got to focus on preschools."
Once you weed out 80 percent or so of the Gore-Bradley debate -- the parts where they agree with each other and the parts where each man starts talking about "dreams" -- you get down to some very interesting questions. Do Americans want a Big Idea, if it costs a lot of money? Which one? Is anybody willing to suggest trade-offs -- eliminating the new aircraft carrier we're building in Trent Lott's district? The new fighter planes we're building in Richard Gephardt's district?
There's plenty of time, the World Series is over, and we're actually finally about to enter the 2000 election year. Let the games begin.

HEADLINE: Strong Summer Apt to Propel Economic Boom to a Record

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The American economy turned in its best quarterly performance of the year this summer, virtually guaranteeing enough momentum to carry the nation to its longest economic expansion in history early next year.
Strong growth often leads to shortages and rising prices. But as the economy expanded at a brisk 4.8 percent annual rate in the June-September quarter, inflation turned out to be mild and the cost to employers of wages and benefits rose only modestly. The news of robust growth with little evidence of higher inflation was so popular on Wall Street that the value of stocks and bonds soared. The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 227 points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,622.53. Other indexes chalked up similarly impressive gains. 
 The stock market's sharp rise reflected an expectation that the Federal Reserve's policy makers -- who have raised interest rates twice this year out of concern that the economy might be overheating -- may be less likely to do so yet again at their next meeting, on Nov. 16. And even if the Fed does push rates slightly higher again next month, analysts say, it now appears more likely to refrain from further increases in the succeeding months unless inflation shows signs of clearly worsening.
The Commerce Department, at the same time as it provided its fresh snapshot of the economy, also released a sweeping revision of its past data, stretching back to 1959. The revision is intended to make the Government's measures of economic performance reflect the new electronic technologies that are now so important. The new numbers showed the 1990's to be a decade of stronger economic growth than originally reported, although not stronger than any of the last four decades. Page C1.
What distinguishes the performance of the economy in the 1990's is the length of the expansion, which began in March 1991 and will surpass the 106-month record set in the 1960's if it lasts until next February.
Clinton Administration officials cited the latest growth numbers as evidence of the success of their economic policies. President Clinton called the 1990's expansion "the soundest in decades." And Martin Baily, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, linked the economy to what he described as the Administration's success in shifting the budget from deficit to surplus.
"The private sector is generating the strong growth," Mr. Baily said, "but good economic policies have created an environment for growth."
Caveats, however, punctuated the euphoria. "What we have here is consumption and investment growing faster than income," said Albert Wojnilower, an economic consultant in New York. "How are people doing this? They are borrowing money, counting on the gains in the stock market and in the value of their homes to help them carry their debt."
Separately, the Labor Department released its employment cost index for the third quarter yesterday. This is the Government's broadest measure of labor costs, covering benefits as well as wages, salaries and bonuses. It is closely watched on Wall Street for evidence that rising labor costs will force companies to raise prices, a prospect that often prompts traders to sell stocks and drive up interest rates.
But despite the strong economy and the labor shortages evident in an unemployment rate of only 4.2 percent, the index rose by only eight-tenths of a percent and 3.1 percent over the last 12 months.
The broadest measure of the economy's performance is the gross domestic product, which tracks the rising value of all goods and services produced in the nation. Growth had slowed in the second quarter, to a 1.9 percent annual rate, but bounced back sharply in the third quarter, with the G.D.P. rising by $106 billion to an inflation-adjusted $8.88 trillion.
The largest component of that growth was consumer spending, which rose 4.3 percent from the second quarter. But a big part of the increase in output resulted from businesses deciding to build up their inventories rather than draining them as they did in the second quarter. They carried out this stockpiling in anticipation of future sales, particularly sales of new car models, and also as a precaution in the event of Year 2000 computer-related disruptions, analysts said.
"Much of the inventory expansion came from motor vehicle stockpiling at the dealer level," said Brent Moulton, associate commissioner at the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. "But manufacturers also stockpiled, mostly durable goods -- aircraft, appliances, machinery and equipment."
Stepped-up investment in computers, software, trucks, buses and aircraft also played a big role in the third-quarter jump in economic growth. And an increase in spending at all levels of government contributed to the rising economy. But strong growth in the future seems uncertain to many economists. They expect the economy to start slowing by early next year and point to what they see as the first signs of that slowing.
The housing market has weakened as mortgage rates have risen, they note. Vehicle sales have edged down from their summer peak, and consumer spending, though still strong, has grown more slowly since last fall.
"We have experienced four consecutive months of declines in consumer confidence, and debt is inordinately high," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's DRI. "That has to take its toll."
The puzzles in today's reports were the mild labor cost increases despite widely reported labor shortages and the slower rise in a price index that the Commerce Department uses to calculate economic growth. The index rose at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter and 1 percent in the third.
"Whatever merchandise is in short supply because of the strong economy is brought in from abroad, and that helps to hold down prices," Mr. Wojnilower said, noting that imports rose in the third quarter.
Business executives insist that they have difficulty raising prices because of growing competition in a global marketplace. What is more, labor costs are not rising rapidly enough to force price increases -- for a variety of reasons, economists say.
One involves inflation. Because it is mild, workers are demanding smaller increases. The widespread availability of temporary workers means that employers are not under pressure to raise wages to fill jobs. Bonuses and profit sharing have increasingly replaced raises. And manufacturing employment has declined by 500,000 jobs since March 1998, with many of the displaced workers taking service sector jobs at lower pay.
Nancy Lazar, an economist and partner at the ISI Group, a Wall Street firm, cites mergers as still another explanation for mild labor cost increases. "The reason workers are not pressing for higher wages," she said, "is that mergers are running high and so are layoffs as companies combine operations. Layoffs keep labor on the defensive."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Helps a Campaign Hoping for Help in Return

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y., Oct. 28

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani today endorsed the Republican candidate for Erie County executive, Joel Giambra, who if he wins will overturn longtime Democratic control of one of the most powerful jobs in upstate New York. Mr. Giambra would also be of pivotal importance to Mr. Giuliani in his expected campaign for United States Senate next year.
Polls show that Mr. Giambra's 20-point lead over the Democratic incumbent, Dennis Gorski, has narrowed to 10 points in recent days, changing what many thought would be a debacle for Mr. Gorski into something resembling a race. But whether Mr. Giuliani's endorsement mattered was a frequent question here today, including from the Mayor himself. 
 "Actually, endorsements, I don't know how much value they do have," Mr. Giuliani said while standing next to Mr. Giambra at an Italian restaurant, Pranzo's, across the street from the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.
No one at the endorsement lunch, attended by some 70 businessmen and women from Buffalo and the surrounding Erie County, questioned that Mr. Giuliani's agenda stretched far beyond Tuesday's election. "The politics of it are clear," said Sal Martoche, a friend of the Mayor, a Buffalo lawyer and the former United States Attorney for the Western District of New York. "He's friend-raising right now."
When the Mayor was asked if it would be good to have Mr. Giambra as county executive should Mr. Giuliani run for the Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, he replied that "it will be great to have Mr. Giambra in office as the Mayor of New York City. Whether I run for something else in the future, it'd be terrific."
Although George E. Pataki carried Erie County during his re-election last November, the county is home to the biggest Democratic organization outside of New York City. There is speculation that if Mr. Giambra defeats Mr. Gorski, there will be upheaval in the local party. As county executive, Mr. Giambra would lead the largest government in upstate New York and a political apparatus that could help Mr. Giuliani as he seeks support in an area where voters traditionally view the mayor of New York City as a politician out of touch with their concerns.
Mr. Giuliani called Mr. Giambra's candidacy "a chance for a new direction in Erie County" and praised his proposal for a 30 percent cut in property taxes over the next four years, then compared Mr. Giambra to himself. "I think the emphasis on trying to straighten out county government reminds me of the things that I had to do when I became Mayor of New York City," Mr. Giuliani said, adding that "to see economic revitalization occur in Erie County the way it's occurring in New York City, which he can bring about, will be very, very exciting for all of us."
Mr. Giambra returned the compliment, saying, "I'm learning a lot from the Mayor," and proclaiming "this is not just about politics."
Mr. Giambra, a former Democrat who became a Republican in 1998 to run for county executive, has incurred enormous wrath from his former party. Steve Pigeon, the Erie County Democratic Party chairman, this week called Mr. Giambra "a Benedict Arnold" and "an opportunist" who "walked away for 12 pieces of silver." He also said Mr. Gorski was behind in the polls because "the economy is flat upstate and you have a 12-year incumbent and he's the closest neck to strangle."
Mr. Gorski, in an interview today in his office looking out over Lake Erie and Canada, said he found political endorsements "repulsive" and the "height of arrogance" because "you have somebody from out of town telling people in the community who to vote for, knowing full well he knows very little or nothing about the community in question."
Mr. Gorski also said that the only time he sees Mr. Giuliani upstate "is when he comes up with Republican candidates."
As for his direct opponent, Mr. Gorski said that Mr. Giambra is "not capable" and "I don't think he understands the dimensions of this government."
Mr. Giambra, 42, is the City of Buffalo comptroller, but his two-year community college degree has become a campaign issue. "I admire people who had a greater ability to pursue higher education than I did," he recently told The Buffalo News, adding, "I don't think that made me any less of a person or any less able to be a leader."
On Sunday, The Buffalo News for the first time did not endorse the 55-year-old Mr. Gorski, saying that although he had done an "excellent job" keeping the county's finances in order, he was not an innovative leader. The newspaper instead supported the election of Mr. Giambra, saying that his vision and tax cut proposal "more accurately depicts the kind of leadership that Erie County needs at this time."
Mr. Giuliani also spoke today at a meeting of the Niagara County Mothers Against Drunk Driving, saying, "I respect what you do tremendously" and "I am an ally of yours."

HEADLINE: Fed's Chief Calls Cooling Unavoidable

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, called the economy's recent growth rate unsustainable today, but said the rise in long-term interest rates appeared to be containing the risks of inflation.
With less than three weeks to go before the central bank next meets to consider monetary policy, Mr. Greenspan gave no clear signal that he planned to raise interest rates for a third time this year, but expressed enough concern about the pitfalls facing the economy to leave open the possibility. 
 In a speech to business executives in Boca Raton, Fla., Mr. Greenspan said there was a compelling case that huge investments in technology were driving a lasting increase in productivity growth, dampening inflationary pressures even as demand for goods and services grows at a robust pace.
But Mr. Greenspan warned that the growth rate of productivity would inevitably level off, leaving the economy vulnerable to a resurgence in inflation. He repeated his long-standing warning that the economy was running out of workers so fast that continued strong growth could lead to a surge in wages and then in prices. And he suggested that the growing trade deficit might crimp the flow of cheap capital into the United States from abroad.
"We do not have enough experience with technology-driven gains in productivity growth to have a useful sense of the time frame in which market pressures contain demand," Mr. Greenspan said.
"Moreover it is not clear as yet how much cumulative impact the rise in real long-term interest rates over the past two years will have on demand," he said. "Going forward, the Federal Reserve must monitor not only this response, but also the evolving capacity of our economy to meet higher levels of demand."
Much of Mr. Greenspan's speech to the corporate executives was given over to the topic that has preoccupied him for the last several years: the degree to which technology is reshaping the way business operates, making the economy more efficient and allowing higher growth rates with less inflation risk.
Mr. Greenspan said there remained a debate among economists about whether growth in productivity -- or output per worker for every hour worked -- was truly improving over the rather sluggish trend that began around 1970. But he said he was increasingly convinced that the improvement was for real.
"Although it is still possible to argue that the evident increase in productivity growth is ephemeral, I find such arguments hard to believe, and I suspect most in this audience would agree," Mr. Greenspan said.
The problem, Mr. Greenspan said, is that no one knows whether technological advances will continue at their current breathtaking pace, or whether businesses will be able to capitalize on them to offset increased costs. So far so good, Mr. Greenspan said -- there was no sign of trouble in the economic data released by the Government today.
"All the same, the rate of growth of productivity cannot continue to increase indefinitely," Mr. Greenspan said. "At some point it must, at least, plateau. Should, at that point, labor market tightness result in faster growth of nominal wage rates, there would be no offset from accelerating productivity. As a consequence, unit costs would likely rise, pressuring profit margins and prices."
Mr. Greenspan left no doubt that he was particularly concerned about the shrinking pool of available workers. The number of people seeking jobs has declined over the last two years and is heading lower as the economy hums along, he said.
Mr. Greenspan pointed out that under widely accepted economic theory, sustainable noninflationary growth cannot exceed the combined growth in productivity and the labor force. He suggested that the economy was currently in violation of that rule, a situation that cannot go on forever.
"Market pressures must eventually emerge that work to contain such unsustainable growth," Mr. Greenspan said.
Still, reining in the economy, Mr. Greenspan said, "may already be significantly advanced" because of "upward pressure on real long-term market interest rates, especially as economies abroad strengthen."
The problem for the Fed, Mr. Greenspan said, is that it can no longer assume that it knows when the economy is at risk of overheating. The Fed must not only make judgments about when demand is entering a danger zone, he suggested; it must now also gauge whether productivity improvements are increasing the economy's capacity to handle greater demand, and indeed the degree to which improving productivity stimulates demand.

HEADLINE: A Clearer View of the Economy;
TheCommerce Department Answers Its Critics

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
With millions of Americans enjoying today's prosperity, some experts have complained that the Government's methods for measuring the economy have failed to capture its true strength and dynamism. Now the Commerce Department has responded with confirmation that the critics have been at least partly right.
But the revised numbers on the economy's performance in recent decades, published yesterday, still fall short of the prosperity achieved in earlier booms since World War II. The "New Economy" that many proclaim remains a vision rather than a reality. 
 True, the economy has grown faster in the 1990's than Federal statistics have acknowledged. Spending is stronger; investment is greater; productivity is higher; inflation is a little lower. It all adds up to an economy that produced an estimated $8.76 trillion worth of goods and services last year, according to the revised statistics, or $248 billion more than under the old method of calculating economic growth.
But the revision stopped short of recording a breakthrough to the promised land of a new economy -- one in which new technology is bringing about a transformation that makes the economy capable of productivity advances and economic growth reminiscent of the golden era of the 1960's.
"Growth is a couple of tenths of a percentage point higher, particularly in recent years, but there is no change in long-term trends," said Steven Landefeld, director of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, the bookkeeping agency that published the revision of the statistics, reaching all the way back to 1959.
It is not simply that pockets of overlooked production have been belatedly discovered and incorporated into the gross domestic product. There was some of that, but, more important, the Government has provided a clearer view of the economy's performance by giving much more credit than in the past to computer software and banking improvements.
Moreover, downward revisions in the Consumer Price Index -- already present in the unrevised data since 1995 -- have been applied back to 1959, a process that raised the economy's inflation-adjusted "real" growth rate.
Illogical bookkeeping has also been fixed. The personal savings rate, for example, has been raised to 3.7 percent of income in 1998 from nearly zero by listing Federal contributions to the pensions of Government workers as savings rather than payments to social insurance.
"That does not change the trend in savings, which has been steadily downward," Mr. Landefeld said.
The main goal of the revision has been to capture in the numbers what the Federal statisticians say they believe to be the true strengths and characteristics of a modern economy. "The economy is still the same as it was before, but computer software and also banking are playing much larger roles, and with this revision we are measuring their contributions more accurately," said Brent Moulton, an associate commissioner of the bureau.
Economists on Wall Street found the revisions pleasing. "They show us that the economy has been growing somewhat faster than we had thought and inflation is slightly lower, and that revised mix is exactly what you like to see," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist for Prudential Securities.
Nothing jumps out of the bureau's new methods with greater force than computer software, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of all the revisions.
For years experts have held that software and the computers in which software is installed have enhanced the nation's productivity, making the sort of contribution that the spread of the automobile did in the 1920's. But until yesterday, the bureau had not quantified software's rising contribution or raised the growth rate of the economy as a whole to reflect software's importance.
That new recognition is at the crux of the "New Economy" argument. The rapidly advancing electronic and information technologies, so dependent on software, are viewed by this camp of economists and forecasters as transforming the way Americans do business. As a result, they are generating a breakthrough in economic growth that should be sustainable for years.
The bureau's fresh look failed to endorse this rosy perspective. Even in the strongest period of the current expansion -- the last four years through the third quarter of 1999 -- the G.D.P. rose at an average annual rate of 4.1 percent, up four-tenths of a percentage point from the earlier figures. But there were similar spurts of even stronger growth in the 1980's, 1970's and 1960's.
And the comparison is flawed. Most economists gauge an economy by comparing not just expansions but entire business cycles, with each cycle including a recession as well as an expansion. By that measure, the American economy in the 1990's has grown at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent, up half a percentage point after the revision. But nearly 3 percent turns out to be no stronger than the 1970's and 1980's and significantly weaker than the 1960's.
"The 60's were unprecedented, and they still are," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's DRI, a data gathering operation.
There are some differences. While the overall growth rates for the last three decades are similar, the latest data show that more of the economy's growth in the 1990's was generated by improvements in output per person rather than simply by putting more people to work. The reverse was the case in the 1970's and 1980's.
But the revisions do suggest that the long expansion of the 1990's, with its combination of healthy growth and low inflation, could continue for a while.
Until recently, the Federal Reserve and most economists believed that the economy could grow over the long term at no more than 2.5 percent without suffering from shortages and inflation. Now the upper limit appears to be 3 percent or a bit higher, says Robert M. Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
That is roughly the rate of growth since 1990. Implicit in this new higher growth rate is an upward adjustment in the productivity growth rate. Productivity measures the value of what a worker produces in goods or services during an hour on the job. When that output rises, partly because of advances in technology, so does the productivity growth rate.
That rate had advanced at a robust annual average of 2.8 percent from 1947 until 1973. And then for reasons never fully understood, the average plunged to 1 percent or so for nearly 25 years. There has been a partial rebound since 1995, and the revisions suggest that the average has lately been roughly 2 percent, or even a bit more. Complete productivity data, however, will not be available until the Labor Department incorporates the higher output in its own calculations.
"The productivity slowdown remains in place, it is just less than it was, as these revisions suggest, for which we should be grateful," said Jeffrey Madrick, an author who has written extensively on productivity.
Mr. Solow agrees. "When productivity grows at 1 percent a year it takes 72 years for the standard of living to double," he said. "At 2 percent, it takes just 36 years. It is possible that we are at that level now, although I will not take that to the bank until the 2 percent survives the next recession."
In the Commerce Department's new approach, software purchased by business, previously listed as an expense, becomes an investment, retroactive to 1959. The difference is considerable. A $100 software purchase counted the old way as an expense was included in the value of the final product sold by the company, like the steel that goes into a car. But that same $100 worth of software, properly counted, should be added directly to G.D.P., the bureau concluded.
Software is now classified like computers -- as a long-lasting investment capable of generating revenue for a company.
And indeed software helps to generate such things as greater revenue from telephone tolls and improved results from an automated, more efficient assembly line. The $100 value, once added to G.D.P., is subtracted or depreciated only gradually, over the three to five years considered by the bureau to be the life of a piece of software.
Banking is the other big change. Its contribution to G.D.P. had been measured indirectly, by computing the number of hours worked by the nation's bank employees and inferring a dollar amount. But as new technology has spread through the banking industry, hours have declined. Banking activity and revenue, however, have risen. So the bureau changed the yardstick. The new one is transactions: the number of checks cleared, the number of ATM transactions, the number of loans made.
The conceptual changes also coincided with various revisions that pop up every few years when more complete data on such things as wages, retail sales, consumption, profits and investment become available as a supplement to the surveys used to determine the quarterly growth numbers.
"What we are seeing here, apart from conceptual changes," said Martin Baily, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, "is a stronger economy than we had thought because of improved data collection."

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Says King Family Is Ready to Sell Papers to U.S.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The family of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has indicated a willingness to sell 80,000 pages of the slain civil rights leader's papers to the Library of Congress for $10 million below their appraised value, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus has said.
The chairman, Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, said he had discussed the purchase of the papers from the final six years of Dr. King's life with his widow, Coretta Scott King, and his sons, Dexter King and Martin Luther King 3d. And he has introduced legislation authorizing the purchase. 
 "All three seem willing to pursue that course," Mr. Clyburn said. "We are still in negotiation but I feel relatively sure that if we can get the authorization done, we can move forward and get a number we can ask Congress for."
Mr. Clyburn said Sotheby's auction house in New York last week appraised the 80,000 pages of King documents at $30 million. He said lawmakers had asked officials from the Library of Congress to inspect the papers this week and tell Congress that they are worth $30 million.
The Washington Post reported in Friday's editions that the Library of Congress had tentatively agreed with the King family to a sale price of $20 million.
Officials at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, in Atlanta, where the documents are housed, did not return telephone calls seeking comment on the negotiations. The talks were first reported this week by Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Congress.
Mr. Clyburn said Republican and Democratic leaders in the House were supportive of the idea. He said he was hopeful that both the authorizing legislation and the actual appropriation to buy the papers could be approved by Congress before it adjourned for the year in the next few weeks.
If the deal envisioned by Mr. Clyburn is completed, it would be the most Congress has ever paid for a manuscript collection for the Library of Congress.
Jill Brett, a spokeswoman for the library, said the largest previous outlay by Congress was $1.5 million in the early 1930's for the Vollbehr Collection of about 3,000 books from the 15th century, including one of three perfect copies of the Gutenberg Bible. Adjusted for inflation, that would amount to $14.6 million today.
Most of the documents in the library's manuscripts collection have been donated, Ms. Brett said, including the papers of 23 Presidents and 38 Supreme Court Justices.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Five Republican Candidates' Debate at Dartmouth

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a Republican Presidential candidates' forum last night involving Gary L. Bauer, former president of the Family Research Council; the publisher Steve Forbes; Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah; Alan Keyes, a radio commentator and former Assistant Secretary of State, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription agency. The candidates answered questions from an audience at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, N.H.
 
Q. Should the Republican Party be more inclusive by encouraging pro-choice voters to support their candidates? 

MR. McCAIN -- I worry a great deal about the unintended consequences of sending a message that we are not an inclusionary party.
I am a proud pro-life person. I have a 17-year record on that issue. But I believe that we must begin a dialogue and a discussion on the issue of abortion. Both pro-life and pro-choice people believe very strongly that we need to eliminate abortion. . . .
I and my wife, Cindy, are proud adoptive parents. We need to encourage adoption in America. We need to match up those children that have no families with those families that have no children. We need to improve foster care dramatically in America. We can work together. And my party, which is proud of its pro-life position, and I am proud of it, should send the word: We want you in our party. We can have respectful disagreements on specific issues, and we can work together on this one.
 
Q. There's growing concern that the control of health care is shifting from physicians to the bureaucrats of insurance companies and H.M.O.'s. Yet . . . physicians still bear the burden of liability for the care they are allowed to provide. . . . How would you propose to rectify this imbalance between the control of and responsibility for providing health care?
 
MR. BAUER -- I was very troubled when the leadership of my party in the Congress got themselves into the box of taking the position that average Americans shouldn't have the right to sue an H.M.O. if it provided inappropriate medical treatment. Now, I'm against big bureaucracy in Washington making health care decisions. I just have an aversion to bureaucrats. But it's not just Government bureaucrats. I don't like H.M.O. bureaucrats and insurance company bureaucrats either. And I think we need to level the playing field.
We need to make real reforms: medical savings accounts, allowing deductibility for insurance payments. Big companies can do that now; individuals can't. There are many things that we can do, and we need to do them now before we have a system where bureaucracy is making all of the decisions in health care; accountants making decisions instead of doctors.
 
Q. How do you plan to continue with the war on drugs?
 
MR. KEYES -- Well, it seems to me the first thing that we should understand is that we're not dealing with a material problem, we're dealing with a moral problem. When I was born in 1950, we didn't have a huge plethora of laws dealing with all kinds of drug use and abuse, and yet we also did not have an enormous drug problem in this country. The reason that we proliferated the laws is because the fundamental discipline that was prevailing in our society when I was born has broken down.
And I think sometimes we get all caught up in discussing what steps we will take to deal with the consequences of this problem; we don't want to deal with the problem. And the problem is very simple: You can't sustain self-government without self-discipline, and the drug problem is a symptom of that. . . .
And I think that the obvious solution is the one that stares us in the face, but we don't want to implement it because it requires that we look at the truth about our situation. We don't have a drug problem, an economic problem or any of these other problems, only that we say we have. We have a moral crisis. We have a crisis that goes to the heart of the question of whether or not we're a people that still acknowledges that there is a difference between right and wrong which we must pass on to our children and enforce, even if it means that we ourselves must accept inconvenience.
 
Q. What is the best policy, and I'm talking about domestic policy, you feel America is embarked on now, and why? And . . . what is the worst policy in your opinion, and why? And what would you do to put us back on track?
 
MR. HATCH -- I would say the best policy that I've seen . . . I came up here and campaigned for Ronald Reagan in 1980. . . . Reagan brought about a revolution that was really an important one, because he reduced marginal tax rates from 70 percent down to 28 percent by 1986. That's what's been driving this economy ever since. This President's taking credit for it, but literally that's what's doing it. Plus the fight for the balanced budget amendment, which I led for six or seven times since then.
Plus the appointment of Alan Greenspan, who has done a terrific job. I'll give this President some credit, too.
But plus, the first time in 30 years you had a Republican Congress has enforced a balanced budget on the American people. And let me just say this, The President deserves some credit, too, because he appointed Robert Rubin, who I think did a tremendous job. And he's been more pragmatic than other Democrats, so we can at least manipulate him into doing what's right occasionally. At least that's what we're trying to do. . . .
I think that The worst thing that I've seen in public policy in many years -- it's hard to say, because there have been a lot of worst things -- but one of the worst things I've seen is the way some of our Federal judges have become activists on the bench. They have usurped the powers of the other two branches of Government and have started to become superlegislators. on the bench in black robes. And they have violated the real role of judging, which is to interpret the laws, not make the laws.
 
Q. What we're watching is sort of a nomination process that reminds me more of an auction, where the nomination goes to the highest bidder. I'd really like to be able to ask this to the candidate who's not here, but I can't do that. Mr. Forbes, as nominee of the Republican Party or as President, what would you do to keep the future nominations from being bought?
 
MR. FORBES -- I share the frustration that Governor Bush is not here tonight. He didn't come to a debate last week because he had a fund-raiser. A couple of weeks ago, his plane got delayed, he had a choice between a fund-raiser and going to a school in Rhode Island with underprivileged kids. He chose the fund-raiser. So perhaps in the future at a forum like this, if we call it a fund-raiser, he might show up. . . .
I believe that in -- on the funding side, we should have a system in America where individuals can give as much as they want to a candidate as long as there is full and prompt disclosure.
The establishment loves these current rules because, unless you are blessed like me with independent resources, they have ways of shutting you out. And all 67,000 lobbyists in Washington, they have all rallied around Governor Bush. They want a coronation, not a real contest. And that's fundamentally wrong.

Ads to Help Consumers

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Television commercials about a program for Connecticut consumers to choose their electricity suppliers are to begin next week.
Donald Downes, chairman of the Department of Public Utility Control, said competition among suppliers is expected to cut rates 10 percent to 15 percent beyond savings mandated by the state for the next four years. 
 The ads are part of a $4 million public information campaign.
Utility regulators acknowledge that the change, which takes effect next year, will be confusing for people who are used to their local utility monopoly -- and not used to thinking about where their electricity comes from.
A consumer's guide to electric choice is scheduled to be mailed to all homes and businesses in Connecticut.
Beginning Jan. 1 residents and businesses of 24 cities and towns most in need of economic development will be allowed to choose their electricity suppliers. The program goes statewide July 1.
More information is available by calling the state public utility department at (888) 922-DPUC (3782) and on a Web site, www.dpuc-electric-choice.com.

Some Haunted Houses Never Change

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
If the ever vigilant Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is truly determined to snuff out inflation aborning, then he can do no better than to take sharpened pencil in hand, make his way to the nearest theater showing 'House on Haunted Hill" and strike fearlessly until the film's feeble pulse beats no more.
"House on Haunted Hill" is a sorry reincarnation of the 1950's William Castle horror film in which an eccentric millionaire played by Vincent Price offered five strangers $10,000 each to spend the night in a spooky old mansion. 
 In the new version, the ante has been raised to $1 million apiece, which is why Mr. Greenspan may choose to become involved. Even allowing for inflation of roughly 570 percent in the 40 years since the original opened in New York on March 12, 1959, the reward for foolhardy courage in 1999 should come to only $57,113.47, the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis calculated yesterday.
But some things have not become devalued over the years -- words like junk, for example. "House on Haunted Hill" was pronounced junk in these pages in 1959. And it is still junk.
All the special effects in the world cannot compensate for an inability to generate tension, establish and sustain pace or create any character whose survival is worth rooting for.
Directed by William Malone from a screenplay by Dick Beebe and bearing such well-established names as Robert Zemeckis and Joel Silver among its producers, "House on Haunted Hill" is dead on arrival. This film wastes the talents of actors like Geoffrey Rush and Peter Gallagher in hollow roles and relies heavily on its sets and special effects to do the work that should have been accomplished by its director and writer.
The new version harks back to 1931, when the towering cliffside, seaside premises, helpfully described in the film's publicity as having been designed "in the monolithic style of Albert Speer, the infamous architect of the Third Reich," were home to the Vanacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane.
But one night, when the evil Dr. Vanacutt was performing surgery without benefit of anesthesia, the inmates got loose, fire raged out of control and death ran rampant.
Cut to the present, when the wealthy, nasty, mischievous theme-park magnate Steven Price, played behind a mustache by Mr. Rush in a role tailor-made for James Woods at his malevolent best, arranges to hold the birthday party for his not-very-beloved wife (Famke Janssen) in the old place.
But the guests, invited to compete for a total of $5 million if they survive till daybreak, turn out to be a surprise, all somehow related to the old institute or to each other. It seems that the premises are not at rest.
Mr. and Mrs. Price and their guests are in for a long night. But the real ordeal is reserved for the audience.
"House on Haunted Hill" is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes copious amounts of blood, dismemberment, body parts, shootings, stabbings, nudity and language unsuited for the better birthday parties.
 
HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL
Directed by William Malone; written by Dick Beebe, based on a story by Robb White; director of photography, Rick Bota; edited by Anthony Adler; music by Don Davis; production designer, David F. Klassen; produced by Robert Zemeckis, Joel Silver and Gilbert Adler; released by Warner Brothers. Running time: 96 minutes. This film is rated R.
 
WITH: Geoffrey Rush (Stephen Price), Famke Janssen (Evelyn), Taye Diggs (Eddie), Ali Larter (Sara), Bridgette Wilson (Melissa Marr), Peter Gallagher (Blackburn), Chris Kattan (Pritchett) and Peter Graves (himself).

U.S. AppealsTrade Ruling on Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The United States filed an appeal today against a World Trade Organization ruling that invalidated $2.5 billion in tax breaks to American companies with overseas subsidiaries.
The Foreign Sales Corporation provisions of the United States tax code, which give income tax relief to corporations that export through offshore subsidiaries, were challenged by the European Union as illegal subsidies to American companies. 
 Trade officials of the 15-nation European Union were jubilant over the victory, partly because of reverses they suffered when the United States successfully challenged Europe's banana import limits and its ban on hormone-fed beef, which have led to punitive tariffs on $300 million of European products.
The stakes are much higher in the tax case both because of the amount of money involved and because, if upheld, the ruling, which was made on Oct. 8, opens up a new area of conflict -- a country's control over its domestic tax laws.
The tax provisions at issue benefit major corporations like Boeing, Microsoft and General Motors.
In filing an appeal, the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said in a statement that the trade panel "committed multiple legal errors on both substantive and procedural issues."
Current United States law allows domestic companies to establish corporations in offshore tax havens, allowing manufacturers to get the tax exemption on products that generally are made in the United States. There are 3,600 such companies in the United States Virgin Islands.
The European Union argued that this law violates trade rules that goods sold for export may not be treated differently from those sold on the domestic market. Such distinctions are considered export subsidies, which are illegal under World Trade Organization rules.
In a 294-page ruling, the trade panel agreed. Such subsidies "are prohibited," concluded the panel, made up of Crawford Falconer of New Zealand, Didier Chambovey of Switzerland and Prof. Seung Wha Chang of South Korea.
The trade body's appellate review will take up to 90 days, delaying enforcement of the ruling until at least the end of January.
Under the ruling, the trade panel had given the United States until Oct. 1, 2000, to change its law, concluding that was adequate time for Congress to act. It agreed with American arguments that global trade agreements were not meant to dictate member-country tax systems but said that "certain W.T.O. rules do have implications for specific tax practices of members."
This is the second time such United States tax provisions have been challenged in the global trading system. Similar provisions were found to be an illegal subsidy under the trade organization's predecessor body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1981. They were replaced by the Foreign Sales Corporation rules in the early 1980's to comply with the objections.
The European Union argued that the economic effects of the new provisions remained the same.
Ms. Barshefsky maintained that existing tax breaks do not give United States companies an unfair advantage. "A careful review of the history of this issue, the fact of record and the applicable W.T.O. legal rules concerning income tax measures should result in a reversal of the panel's decision," she said.
To qualify for tax relief under the provisions, an American company must meet a number of criteria, including a minimum level of direct costs abroad for certain sales activities, including advertising and order processing.

BYLINE: By Rudolph W. Giuliani; Rudolph W. Giuliani is Mayor of New York City.

 BODY:
Next Tuesday, New Yorkers have a chance to make permanent many of the remarkable successes our city has enjoyed over the past six years. Fourteen proposed changes to the City Charter will be on the ballot, all designed to insure that New York City never returns to the days of high crime, high taxes and cyclical fears of bankruptcy.
Of course, not everyone agrees with these proposals. Charter revision is always a controversial process, and this year has been no different. What is different this year, however, is that the criticism hasn't been focused on the true issue: the changes that the commission I appointed has recommended. 
 Rather than discussing the proposed changes on their merits, critics first attacked the commission's timing. They complained that it had conducted its work too quickly, over the course of a single summer -- surely a candidate for the "only in New York" file. Since when is completing a job well in a timely manner a bad thing? After all, the United States Constitution was drafted in a matter of weeks. Surely, we could improve our City Charter within such a time frame -- and we did.
Critics reserved their loudest wails, however, to protest a change the commission didn't even recommend: implementing a special election to fill mayoral vacancies before the 2001 election. In short, these critics prejudged the Charter revision process and were proved wrong.
Now the critics have resorted to an even weaker argument: that while the commission's proposals are good ones, it would be better to adopt them through legislation. Funny that some of the people making this argument are members of the City Council, a body which has had ample opportunity to adopt many of these measures but either failed to do so or acted only after the Charter Commission issued its report.
More than a year ago, I submitted to the City Council a tough gun-safety bill that would require trigger locks on all guns purchased in New York City and impose tough criminal sanctions on violators. Although this bill would save lives, especially children's lives, the Council sat on it -- until the Council members realized that it would be on the ballot as part of Charter revision. Only this month, the Council adopted such a bill, but without the stiff penalties provided for in the Charter proposal.
Similarly, the Council has refused to make the Administration for Children's Services -- which in its four years has vastly improved child welfare and facilitated more than 11,000 adoptions -- a permanent city agency. The Charter proposals would do that.
And certain members of the Council have threatened to weaken the city's ability to fight organized crime, despite successes at the Fulton Fish Market and in the private carting industry that have saved New Yorkers $750 million a year by eliminating the "mob tax." That's why the Charter Commission proposed an Organized Crime Commission as a permanent fixture of city government. But putting this proposal on the ballot hasn't motivated the Council to act.
This record points to the purpose of the Charter revision process: to give citizens a vote on reforms that elected legislators have not put in place.
Critics further claim that the commission's budget proposals -- to limit city spending increases, to require a two-thirds vote to raise taxes and to create an emergency fund out of city surpluses -- would hamstring future administrations and somehow force them to raise property taxes (which, for legal reasons, would not be subject to supermajority vote).
Not true. First, the property tax is the one tax that politicians are least likely to raise, because it directly affects so many of their constituents. Second, if these budget reforms become permanent, we should not need to raise any taxes, because we would be spending less and holding surpluses in reserve for emergencies.
Indeed, over the past six years we have lived by these fundamental principles of fiscal restraint, and there have been no tax hikes whatsoever.
We've also ended the cycle of free spending, bankruptcy, bailout and more free spending that plunged the city into one fiscal crisis after another.
The result is a healthy economy, 325,000 new jobs, and an improved bond rating. A yes vote on Charter revision will make many of those changes permanent by imposing some much-needed fiscal discipline on city government.
We've come a long way as a city since the early 1990's. Let's make sure we never go back.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Cracks in Canada's Glass Ceiling;
Women Get Some Top Posts, but Few Boardroom Keys

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
In the early 1990's, Barbara G. Stymiest, a partner at the accounting firm Ernst & Young here, was irritated to discover that her Toronto golf club reserved Saturday morning tee times for men, on the assumption that wives could play all week long.
But that golf rule has long ago been changed, and Ms. Stymiest has just become president of the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
 In the last decade, as social and economic changes have swept the country, women have suddenly begun appearing at the pinnacles of corporate Canada.
By some measures, they have been more successful than their American counterparts. Women now run two of the three largest companies on Canada's Financial Post 500 list: General Motors of Canada and the Ford Motor Company of Canada. Over all, women now run 10 of the largest companies in Canada. By comparison, just three of the companies on the Fortune 500 list -- and none of the top three -- are run by women.
And as Canadian women have moved from minority to majority status on college campuses, the trend seems likely to continue.
Despite these gains, waves of businesswomen are still bumping against certain Canadian glass ceilings as thick as the ice on a hockey rink. Disillusioned in part with a stodgy corporate culture here, the number of Canadian women entrepreneurs tripled over the last two decades, to 777,000 in 1997. And, with only 6 percent of boardroom seats occupied by women, Canada lags behind the 11 percent rate in the United States.
Then there is the big fish/little pond phenomenon. The Canadian economy is about one-twelfth that of the United States. And some people say that Canada's "branch plant economy" is responsible for the relatively high number of women running major companies here. Of the 13 largest Canadian companies with women as chief executives, 9 are subsidiaries of United States companies.
"Canada is seen as a good training ground that is relatively safe," said Ronald J. Burke, a professor at the York University School of Business here. "The norms in our country are modestly supportive of women. Our culture is not that different from American culture, so it is not a risky transition."
Many Americans working in Canada are startled by the prominence of women in business in a country sometimes equated with social conservatism.
"I have had more dealings with women at very senior levels, including president and C.E.O., here in Canada than I had when I was working in the United States," said Bobbie A. Gaunt, a Pennsylvania native who 18 months ago left her post as general marketing manager for Ford in Detroit to become president and chief executive of Ford Canada. "I never felt my gender surprised anybody."
The president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is Nancy Hughes Anthony. The Quebec Securities Commission has a chairwoman, Carmen Crepin. Margaret J. Barrett is president of the Bank of Montreal Mortgage Corporation, a company with a $33 billion portfolio, or 10 percent of the Canadian market.
If the college pipeline is any indicator, Canadian women will continue to advance in business in the 21st century.
Women, who earned 38 percent of all Canadian college degrees in 1972, earned 58 percent in 1997. A similar transformation -- with women now accounting for the majority of college students -- has taken place in much of the industrialized world, including the United States.
In the area of "business, management and commerce," Statistics Canada, a Government agency, reports that 51 percent of full-time and part-time undergraduate students in the 1996-97 school year, the most recent data available, were women. (The relative enrollment of American women in comparable programs was slightly lower.)
But Canadian women lag behind men in some fields that promise high earnings in the economy of the future. Women account for only one-quarter of Canada's computer programmers and computer science students. But by 1997-98 women made up 38 percent of all those pursuing Masters of Business degrees in Canada. By contrast, the American figure was 29 percent.
As the pressure of women in the pipeline builds at companies in Canada, many women have been bailing out and becoming entrepreneurs.
Annette Verschuren, for example, a native of Canada's hardscrabble Cape Breton region, left a Canadian company, Imasco Ltd., when she felt that she was not going to reach the top. She persuaded an American arts and crafts retailer, Michael's, to enter the Canadian market. After running the Canadian operations of Michael's for three years she was hired away to become president of a subsidiary of an American chain, Home Depot Canada, now with 44 stores.
Carol M. Stephenson left her job as chief executive of BCE Media, a satellite communications unit of Bell Canada's parent, last summer to became president and chief of Lucent Technologies Canada Inc., a subsidiary of a United States company. "The old boys' network," she said, "is alive and well -- it has not disappeared. The new phenomenon is that women are doing more networking. Most of us who are leading companies in Canada know each other, we talk with one another."
In the spring, the Women's Executive Network, a group that promotes contacts among women across Canada, surveyed 350 senior level women in Canada's five largest cities: Toronto; Montreal; Ottawa; Vancouver, British Columbia, and Calgary, Alberta. Just over half of the respondents said that men had better networking opportunities, but 74 percent said they had not taken up activities like golf to make more contacts. The reason in part was a lack of time: 6 in 10 said they earned more money than their husbands, but, on average, estimated that they did 53 percent of the housework.
Much of the networking happens spontaneously.
"The moment I arrived in Canada, Maureen Kempston Darkes hosted a party to welcome me to Canada," Ms. Gaunt, the Ford president, said of the local General Motors president. "It struck me as unusual in two ways: we are major competitors, and the 35 to 40 women there were university presidents, C.E.O.'s of companies, judges, senior partners in law firms, accounting firms."
Canada, a country sometimes called America Lite, is seen as a safe place for a corporate career climber to punch an overseas ticket. Americans head four of the nine largest American subsidiaries in Canada that are run by women.
American women executives here bridled when asked whether Canada was a softer assignment than elsewhere in the world.
"I asked to come to Canada," Ms. Gaunt said, noting that the Ford operation here, which employs 17,000 people, is the auto maker's third-largest foreign subsidiary, after those in Britain and Germany. The significance of her post is reflected back at world headquarters: after a year of running the Canadian operations, Ms. Gaunt also became a Ford corporate vice president.
Country-hopping can eventually result in a top job in the big pond. Cynthia M. Trudell, for example, a Canadian chemist for G.M., worked her way from Ontario to Michigan to England before landing in Tennessee this year to become president of Saturn, the first woman to run a major American auto division.
Some executives say that working in Canada requires -- and offers -- significant versatility.
"In the U.S., the scale is so much bigger, I would get stuck at the top of the sales silo or the marketing silo," said Sheelagh D. Whittaker, chief executive of EDS Systemhouse, the Canadian subsidiary of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation. "Here, I deal with treasury issues, human resources issues, policy issues."
The difference in scale is also one reason women have made slower advances into corporate boardrooms than in the United States, according to two surveys by Catalyst.
"Bigger boards tend to have more women on them," said Professor Burke of York University, who worked on the survey. "Canadian companies are small and have smaller boards."
In Canada, only 36 of the 500 largest companies had women on their boards; in the United States, 86 percent did.
"Canada also still has more of its major companies in traditional areas -- mining, oil and gas, wood products," he added. "They tend to be more male dominated, old boys' dinosaurs not used to capable women."
Most respondents in the Women's Network survey of executive women said that various forms of discrimination prevent women from winning fuller representation on boards.
"In Canada, there have been a lot of appointments of female C.E.O.'s as the heads of very large corporations," Micheline Bouchard, president of Motorola Canada Ltd., said. "I don't know if we have reached a critical point where we are no longer an oddity."
Reflecting the new trend, The National Post, a national newspaper, recently published a six-page advertising supplement sponsored by Canadian companies eager to showcase the women executives in their ranks. The theme was: "Performance, not gender, counts."
But old habits and stereotypes die hard. Ms. Whittaker, the E.D.S. president, sometimes finds it convenient to screen her calls by pretending to be her secretary. If the caller is someone she wants to talk to, she puts the person on hold, waits a moment, then picks up with her "executive" voice.

HEADLINE: Impasse in Senate Delays Action On Africa-Caribbean Trade Bills

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Senate today temporarily set aside a package of trade bills for African and Caribbean nations while Republican and Democratic leaders tried to break a partisan impasse over several unrelated amendments.
The bills would reduce or eliminate duties on a wide range of goods made in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and the Caribbean, mostly those assembled with American-produced fabrics. President Clinton and a large majority of legislators support the measures. 
 But Senate Republicans who back the legislation fell 15 votes short of the 60 needed to cut off a filibuster led by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who fears that African imports would hurt his state's textile industry.
The vote could doom the measure for the year, just a day after Mr. Clinton stood beside Nigeria's President at a White House news conference and renewed his call for its passage.
The measure's supporters, who include a wide array of religious, international and business groups, expressed alarm that political wrangling jeopardized trade bills that could give a badly needed lift to lagging economies in Africa and the Caribbean region.
All 40 Democrats present today, most of whom endorse the trade bills, voted against ending the filibuster. They were protesting a parliamentary move by the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, to bar amendments, like raising the minimum wage, that Democrats want to attach to the package.
After the vote, Mr. Lott sidetracked the trade package until next week while he and the Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, negotiate a compromise to allow the contested amendments to be considered elsewhere -- on a bill that seeks to change the nation's bankruptcy laws. This would leave the trade package relatively unfettered.
Mr. Lott said compromise must be reached by Tuesday, when the Senate is to vote again on whether to end the filibuster, a process called cloture. If the divisive amendments are not attached to another bill by then, he said, the trade package will be sacrificed.
"If we don't get cloture on Tuesday then it's dead," Mr. Lott said of the legislation. "We just don't have the time to grind down the Hollings filibuster."
Mr. Lott warned that if the Democrats did not change their votes, he would blame them for killing the trade bills. "They've got to live with that anti-free-trade, isolationist vote," Mr. Lott told reporters.
Mr. Clinton, his top national security aides and Senate Democrats have accused Republicans of isolationism in light of the Senate's rejection two weeks ago of a treaty to ban underground nuclear testing. Republicans today seemed only too happy to throw the charge back at the Democrats on the trade issue.
Members of the House, which approved a version of the Africa trade bill, 234 to 163, in July, urged the senators to strike a deal. "This bill is too important to let partisan politics stand in the way," said Representative Ed Royce, a California Republican, who is a sponsor of the House bill.
But Democrats say Mr. Lott's maneuvering has denied them a fundamental senatorial privilege, the right to offer amendments.
On Thursday, Mr. Daschle angrily criticized Mr. Lott's tactics and vowed to the hold the trade bill hostage: "We will never let this legislation pass if we can't offer an amendment, not because we don't support it -- I strongly support it -- but because I even more strongly support the right of every single Senator to be partners in the legislative process."

HEADLINE: Scaring the Salaryman Isn't the Japanese Way

BYLINE: By Andrew Gordon; Andrew Gordon is director of the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Mitsubishi Motors just announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs. Last week Nissan, now owned by Renault and answering to its tough-minded foreign boss, pledged to slash 16,500.
Similar reports from Tokyo for the past year have been greeted by American and British economists as signals that at last the famous Japanese practice of permanent employment is vanishing -- a profound, traumatic transformation that they insist Japan needs. 
 But there is less to the trend than meets the eye. Reading past the headlines, one discovers that Mitsubishi's cuts will not take full effect until March 2004. Even Nissan's new chief operating officer, Carlos Ghosn, known to the world as "The Cost Killer," will spread out the downsizing over three years. And Japan's companies are making many of their adjustments through attrition, hiring freezes, voluntary retirement buyouts and reassignment of employees to subsidiaries. What is striking about what is happening now is not that it represents a change in the way companies deal with workers, but that it shows remarkable continuity in nearly desperate economic times.
For decades, American analysts have been predicting that a change in the Japanese ways of doing business was imminent. In good times, like the 60's or 80's, labor shortages and affluence were expected to lead employees to reject the status quo and start job hopping. In bad times, like the 70's or 90's, the pressure of the bottom line was expected to lead bosses "finally" to a proper market-based system of employment.
The analysts who make these predictions do not understand the deep historical roots of Japan's employment practices, roots sunk in its legal system, the structure of schools, its systems of job recruiting and skill development, its decades-old cooperative relations between companies and unions, and the implicit expectations we call culture.
On the very day of the Nissan announcement, a back-page story in Japanese newspapers showed how firm the grip of these roots can be. The game maker Sega had fired a 35-year-old man for "lack of ability." He protested with a lawsuit, and the courts ruled in his favor. They called the termination an "abuse of the right to fire," decided the company had made "insufficient effort to train the employee" and ordered Sega to pay back wages.
Japan does, of course, need economic reform. But the country's current crisis is rooted in a paralyzed financial system and stagnant consumer demand, especially at home. It is not a crisis of unproductive or lazy systems of industrial production.
The financial system needs a thorough housecleaning, not only more transparent and effective regulation, but also internal reforms to insure that banks make more serious risk assessments when they start lending aggressively again. The country also needs public works spending and tax cuts to get commerce moving faster.
But it is probably a good thing that the Japanese system resists the sort of change that would please the economic seers who thrill to misleading reports about huge employee cutbacks. A working person's prescription for change would first note that the cuts that have taken place, timid as they are by American standards, have shaken the confidence of consumers. Job security and stable wages, and public policies to insure them, could reduce fears and make people feel more comfortable about buying, increasing domestic demand and promoting recovery.
It is worth remembering that for several decades, with the familiar employment system in place, the productivity of Japanese industrial organizations and their ability to cope with shocks -- like the oil crises or the tripling of the value of the yen against the dollar -- was the envy of the world.

HEADLINE: Armenia's Tragedy

 BODY:
The terrorists who assassinated several of Armenia's top political leaders on Wednesday do not appear to have been motivated solely by the government's controversial willingness to talk peace with its neighbor Azerbaijan over the disputed province of Nagorno-Karabakh. A statement broadcast as a prelude to their surrender cited a hodgepodge of grievances against Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian, one of their victims, including a loss of national pride, corruption and economic decline. The Nagorno-Karabakh war, however, is a factor. The assassinations will set back the peace talks. It is this war, moreover, that has kept Armenia in misery, degrading the economy and fueling corruption.
Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan. The war broke out in 1988, when Nagorno-Karabakh sought greater autonomy. Then in 1991 it bid for independence. Armenian soldiers helped carve out a corridor linking the region to Armenia, and took control of nearby Azeri villages. Fighting killed at least 30,000 people and displaced a million before a 1994 cease-fire. But the dispute continues to cripple both countries' economies. Both spend disproportionately on the military. A blockade of tiny Armenia by Azerbaijan and Turkey has idled half the nation's industry. Azerbaijan wants to develop its oil reserves, but foreign companies are reluctant to invest or build vulnerable pipelines in an unstable region. Also, under a 1992 American law passed largely at the urging of the Armenian-American community, American companies cannot get loans for drilling or construction in Azerbaijan while the blockade continues. 
 Last year when Armenia's president, Levon Ter-Petrosian, appeared ready to make peace with Azerbaijan, Mr. Sarkisian and other hard-liners overthrew him to prevent any compromise. But as Prime Minister, Mr. Sarkisian realized that peace was the key to many of Armenia's problems, and began talks with Azeri leaders. Many Armenian nationalists accused him of selling out.
The issue continues to burn because of 1915. That year, hundreds of thousands of Armenians were killed or starved to death by Ottoman Turks. The massacre reshaped the culture as dramatically as did 70 years of Soviet Communism. To Armenian nationalists, negotiating with Azeris, who are ethnic Turks, is a sign of weakness. As long as the nationalists can use violence to veto any possible end to the war, they are dooming future generations to suffer.

HEADLINE: Senator Leads Move to Block Ruling on Strip Mines

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Led by Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Congressional delegation is planning 11th-hour legislation to block what environmentalists call a landmark Federal court ruling that severely restricts the state's strip mining of mountaintops.
After a White House meeting on Thursday on the ruling, which state officials warn will ruin the coal industry, participants from environmental groups said the Clinton Administration decided not to oppose the West Virginia delegation's effort to reverse the court decision. 
 "The White House staff told us President Clinton will not oppose this because it was a provision favored by Senator Byrd," said Anna Aurilio, staff scientist with the United States Public Interest Research Group, a civic advocacy organization.
Ms. Aurilio complained that this would violate the Administration's pledges to block anti-environmental legislative riders in the final days of the Congressional session.
White House officials denied that the pledge would be broken. An environmental official from the Administration said that any legislative action should be short-term and that the White House favored studying whether additional environmental controls were warranted for the problem.
The Oct. 20 ruling by Chief Judge Charles H. Haden 2d of Federal District Court in Charleston found that clean water and surface mining laws were being violated in the blocking of hundreds of miles of streams by rock waste dumped into nearby valleys during the strip mining of mountaintops. The technique involves shearing the mountaintops with explosives to get at the underlying low-sulfur coal, with mining wastes bulldozed into surrounding valleys.
This evening, as pressure grew here and in the state over the ruling on "mountaintop removal," as the technique is legally known, Judge Haden issued a temporary stay affirming his basic decision but allowing the state time to appeal. Lawyers familiar with the struggle speculated that the judge issued the unusual stay to head off Congressional actions that might weaken the environmental laws.
"If there is any life form that cannot acclimate to life deep in a rubble pile, it is eliminated," Judge Haden ruled in ordering West Virginia authorities to curb much of the waste dumping to protect vital waterways. "No effect on related environmental values is more adverse than obliteration."
Responding to the suit by the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and individual citizens, the judge found that state regulators had loosely interpreted environmental law to allow the waste dumping in established streams that flow much or all of the year and are supposed to be protected by buffer zones. Federal regulations, he ruled, are clear in restricting dumping to areas of smaller streams that flow only temporarily after rainstorms and snow melts.
The decision has been denounced as devastating by Gov. Cecil H. Underwood, a Republican, who ordered a hiring freeze and 10 percent budget cut to prepare for negative effects on the state economy. But one of the successful litigants, Patricia Bragg, a valley dweller near a mountaintop mine in Pie, W. Va., said the state, after years of failing to enforce the law, was trying a "political ploy" to divide miners and other residents in the coal region.
"The mountaintop mining has gotten closer and closer to our communities in the hollows," Ms. Bragg said, describing a chain of problems, from cracked walls to spoiled wells to the endless boom and dust of explosives.
"The problem goes beyond the environment to the very people the coal industry comes in and hires," said Ms. Bragg, the wife of a retired miner. "We're the workers, but we're also the victims."
With coal industry and union officials warning that the state's mining could be destroyed, the state Congressional delegation said today that it was "continuing to aggressively pursue all possible legislative options." A rider to one of the remaining appropriations bills is considered the likely vehicle in the closing days of Congress.
Last week, Mr. Byrd and Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, both Democrats, and the state's House delegation called on the Administration to join in the state's plan to appeal the ruling. They warned that the decision would "have a dramatic effect on the lives of thousands of coal miners."
But environmental groups insisted that pro-industry officials were trying to panic the Federal authorities into a legislative reversal of the ruling. Judge Haden, in an unusual postscript, complained on Wednesday that "people are interested in engaging in hyperbole" about the ruling's effects.
"Under a valley fill," Judge Haden declared in his ruling, "the water quality of the stream becomes zero. Because there is no stream, there is no water quality."
William M. Eichbaum, a vice president of the World Wildlife Fund who helped draft the mining controls as a Federal official, said the state and the coal industry had "overblown" the judge's ruling.
"I'm concerned Senator Byrd is putting this at such a high level, refusing to deal with all sorts of other issues, that the Administration will be put in a very difficult position," Mr. Eichbaum said.
Mr. Byrd's office denied that the Senator was pressuring the Administration beyond the merits of the issue, in which the state delegation insists that Judge Haden ignored the intent of Congress in passing the Clean Water and Surface Mining Control laws.
The director of the Federal Office of Surface Mining, Kathy Karpan, said she had received the first reports of job layoffs in the state.
"The industry is going to come to a virtual halt," Ms. Karpan warned.
In carrying out the ruling, she said, state officials estimated that only 3 of 62 previous mountaintop mining projects could go forward.

HEADLINE: Hurdles to Tobacco Pact Seen at Global Meeting

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 29

 BODY:
More than 100 nations agreed this week on the need for a global treaty to control tobacco sales, but some of the big hurdles to such a pact quickly became evident.
Health officials meeting here over the last five days outlined their ideas about what topics a treaty should deal with. The initiating agency, the World Health Organization, says tobacco is responsible for the deaths of four million people a year from cancer, bronchitis, emphysema and cardiovascular diseases. 
 At the closed-door meetings, two of the largest tobacco exporting countries, the United States and Japan, supported general guidelines instead of specific and enforceable provisions, according to activists who sat in on the sessions. A request for a copy of the United States position did not receive a response.
"The Japanese started their presentation by reminding the meeting that two-thirds of their industry is owned by the Government," said Lucinda Wykle-Rosenberg, of Infact, a Boston-based group.
At a news briefing, representatives of the watchdog groups said tobacco-exporting nations had not joined together to block the treaty. But several representatives said they feared that the tobacco industry would insert itself once full-fledged negotiations got under way.
Activists are campaigning for a tough document that would include a global ban on advertising, a crackdown on cigarette smuggling and elimination of subsidies for tobacco growers. They also want strong labeling requirements and strict protection for young people.
The United States, nongovernmental groups said, indicated that it would not support a comprehensive ban on tobacco industry advertising because of Constitutional protections for free speech.
"The U.S. delegation's opening salvo was that the notion of an advertising ban was not on the table," said Judith Glanz of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, D.C.
The World Health Organization has spearheaded the negotiations. This week's meeting was the first round to examine what issues could be included in the treaty, which produced a list of 13, including such areas as advertising, tax, labeling and subsidies. These deliberations will be followed by a second round in March to winnow the list.
Mapping out the treaty will take place among the 191 W.H.O. member governments in May. "Everybody who has taken part in the deliberations here has spoken strongly for the idea of a Framework Convention," chairman Kimmo Leppo, director of Finland's Health and Social Affairs Ministry, said at a final news briefing. "There was not a single dissenting opinion in this respect."
But others at the meeting said that health ministry officials were prominent at this meeting but that as negotiations progressed, officials from ministries with competing interests, like economics and trade, would get involved. And that could disrupt the progress of the talks.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Surge Again, With Nasdaq in Lead

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks extended their powerful rally yesterday as the Nasdaq composite index moved into record territory and blue-chip stocks pulled to within 5 percent of the record they set in August.
Seventy years ago to the day, on the historic Black Tuesday, the market crashed 11.7 percent. 
 Trading was heavy yesterday, surpassing a billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the second consecutive day, and analysts were also cheered by another session, rare for much of this year, in which far more issues rose than fell. Long-term interest rates eased again, as much as one-tenth of a percentage point for many Treasury securities.
"We got a follow-through from the euphoria" produced by economic data released on Thursday and reassuring words by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Andrew M. Brooks, chief trader at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. "What a difference a couple weeks make."
At midmonth, the Dow Jones industrial average was more than 11 percent below the peak reached on Aug. 25, qualifying the downward move as a correction, and it seemed destined to slip below the 10,000 mark and possibly deteriorate by 20 percent into a bear market.
But the index, which rose 107.33 points yesterday, or 1 percent, to 10,729.86, has posted 7 hefty advances in the last 10 sessions as investors and traders acted on a round of generally buoyant profit reports, Government statistics suggesting that inflation remained subdued and a growing belief that Mr. Greenspan would decide that only one more increase in short-term rates would be needed.
Mr. Greenspan told top corporate officials on Thursday evening that the rise in rates this year had clearly begun to work, and his comments seemed to nudge market sentiment closer to a toss-up about whether the Fed will raise rates at its policy meeting on Nov. 16.
A poll by Reuters yesterday found 18 economists expecting a quarter-point increase and 12 predicting that the central bank would leave rates alone. Confirming the Greenspan view, the Commerce Department said yesterday that new homes were sold in September at the slowest pace in nearly two years.
Other positive developments have been the agreement in Washington to lift Depression-era barriers on the banking, securities and insurance industries, and the drying-up of tax-motivated selling by mutual funds as they approached the end of their bookkeeping year.
"We're seeing a number of things that undercut or at least mitigate the inflation fears," said Clare W. Zempel, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, citing among other things the Government report on Thursday showing that upward pressure on wages and benefits was lower than expected over the summer.
Treasury prices also responded favorably to the data and Mr. Greenspan's comments. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 1 5/32, to 99 16/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.16 percent from 6.25 percent on Thursday. The price climbed 2 1/2 points during the week, the biggest weekly gain since Oct. 2, 1998.
In another good weekly performance, the Dow added 260 points after a 450-point surge the previous week. The record for the average -- which will add Microsoft, Intel, Home Depot and SBC Communications and remove Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Sears & Roebuck, Chevron and Union Carbide on Monday -- is 11,326.04, set on Aug. 25.
Nasdaq's surge yesterday was even more impressive, 91.21 points, or 3.17 percent, to 2,966.43, handily surpassing the record of 2,915.95 set on Oct. 11. Intel set the pace, rising 5 1/4, to 77 7/16, after it said it could satisfy demand for computer chips. Microsoft, Cisco and Sun Microsystems were also big contributors.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 20.49 points, or 1.53 percent, to 1,362.93, which is 4 percent below its July 16 peak.
The resurgent optimism was reflected in a spectacular market debut by Akamai Technologies. The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., provides a service that speeds delivery of Web pages but it had no revenue, much less profit, in 1998. Its shares, offered by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter at 26, began trading at 110 and traded as high as 166 before closing at 145 3/16.
Financial stocks mostly took a breather after a string of gains -- American Express, down 7, to 154, was the biggest drag on the Dow -- and Lockheed was battered after announcing a 50 percent reduction in likely earnings next year and the departure of its president. Its shares dropped 2 15/16, to 20, after trading as low as 16 3/8.
Paper stocks were outstanding, with International Paper jumping 4 3/16, to 52 5/8, to make the biggest positive contribution to the Dow. Bowater and Champion also spurted more than 4 points each while Georgia-Pacific rose more than 3.
Overseas markets were sharply higher, with major indexes up 3 percent in Tokyo, 3.9 percent in Hong Kong, 2.95 percent in Paris, 1.7 percent in London, 2.3 percent in Mexico City and 2 percent in Toronto. Frankfurt was 0.85 percent higher while Sao Paulo, Brazil, was unchanged.

HEADLINE: Clinton, at Rally in Philadelphia, Is Doubtful About Endorsements

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 29

 BODY:
President Clinton raised doubts today about whether Presidents can sway the results of local elections, even as he came to the aid of a Democratic mayoral candidate here who is in danger of losing City Hall to a Republican for the first time in half a century.
"I want you to know I came here not as President to tell you how to vote," Mr. Clinton said at a rally at LaSalle University for John F. Street, a City Councilman in a tight race. "But I hope you will listen to me as someone who has tried to be a good friend to Philadelphia." 
 As the President made a spirited endorsement of Mr. Street, the candidate smiled broadly at his side. Philadelphia voters are registered 4-to-1 Democratic, but Mr. Street's campaign is facing a strong challenge from a Republican businessman, Sam Katz, only four days before Tuesday's election.
What should have been a runaway election for Mr. Street has turned neck and neck in public opinion polls. Both local newspapers have endorsed Mr. Katz, whose campaign has shown an appeal among Democrats that is making Mr. Street's backers anxious. Mr. Katz, who is white, is even challenging Mr. Street, a former City Council president who is black, for the support of Democratic black and Hispanic voters.
Although Mr. Clinton's own campaigning days are over, he clearly cannot get the excitement of campaigning out of his blood. Besides his visit here, the President in recent days has taped a radio advertisement for Mr. Street, lent his name to campaign mailers and, in a telephone call to the host of a local radio talk show, pressed for the election of Mr. Street. In that conversation, Mr. Clinton warned that a Republican victory in the mayoral race here could be bad news for Democrats in next year's Congressional and Presidential elections.
In his speech today, the President said he was mystified by newspaper accounts of the campaign that portrayed Mr. Street, who is 56, as lacking vision and charisma. "This is a young, vigorous, brilliant, committed public servant," Mr. Clinton said. "You heard him up here today. His heart is on fire for the children and the future of the city. He has all the experience in the world."
The President recalled that former President Ronald Reagan had visited Arkansas to endorse the Republican challenger when Mr. Clinton was running for re-election as Governor, and said the endorsement had little effect on the outcome. Mr. Clinton's last endorsement effort, when he went to New Orleans last month on behalf of William J. Jefferson, the Democratic candidate for governor of Louisiana, was similarly fruitless.
Last week Mr. Jefferson, a 52-year-old Congressman who sought to become Louisiana's first black governor, lost soundly to the incumbent, Mike Foster, a Republican. With this in mind, Mr. Clinton said he purposely did not pull out his "big, whoop-de-do political speech." He even offered a back-handed compliment to Mr. Katz, saying that he was campaigning well and "singing a good song," but would be judged in the end on whether he could deliver.
Mr. Street and Mr. Katz have debated three times, outlining their differences on school vouchers, economic development and other issues. Although the campaign has been remarkably free of attacks, Mr. Street has sought to cast his rival as a Republican who is new to politics and out of touch with the city's needs.
Mr. Katz, 49, has played up his experience in business, where he has been a sports world deal-maker, and stresses his genial personality.
"People get excited when they find out I can tap a keg with the best of them," Mr. Katz said in an interview in The Philadelphia Inquirer, adding that he had "danced the chicken dance in the German American Festival."
Mr. Street's backers were confident that Mr. Clinton's 11th-hour appearance would be enough to attract undecided Democrats -- the group that both campaigns agree will be critical in determining the successor to Mayor Ed Rendell, who is retiring.
"When you have the President in town, it has to make a difference," said Joseph Rauscher, president of the Philadelphia Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., whose members are telephoning registered voters on Mr. Street's behalf. "The man is loved by just about everyone in this town."
Even Bob Barnett, the campaign director for Mr. Katz, is a Clinton supporter. But Mr. Barnett, a Democrat who campaigned for Mr. Clinton and served in his Administration as head of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, said his former boss was right that local issues, not a Presidential endorsement, would decide the race.
"When President Clinton leaves, the abandoned car on the street is still there," Mr. Barnett said. "This is not about foreign policy or the nuclear test ban treaty. Philadelphia has not reacted well to people coming in from out of town to tell them how to vote."
The Katz campaign considered it a day like any other. While the President lavished praise on Mr. Street, Mr. Katz spoke at a center for the elderly. Later, he greeted voters at a bar and appeared on a local television station's "meet the candidates" night.

HEADLINE: September New-Home Sales Fell

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell in September to the lowest level in almost two years as higher mortgage costs cooled housing from the robust pace earlier this year, Government figures showed today.
New single-family home sales fell 12.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units after dropping four-tenths of a percent in August, the Commerce Department said. September's was the slowest pace since December 1997. 
 Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.76 percent this week, more than a full percentage point above the rates earlier this year, according to Freddie Mac. Potential home buyers are also bidding up prices. The median price in September for new homes was 5 percent higher than at the beginning of the year.
A separate report today showed that manufacturing is picking up in the Midwest. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago's monthly index rose to 58.8 in October from 53.8 in September. Readings above 50 mean the number of manufacturers who said business improved was larger than the number saying it deteriorated.
The purchasing managers' report showed that new orders, production and employment are increasing at Chicago-area factories. For the first time in five months, fewer manufacturers said they paid higher prices for raw materials, probably because of declines in oil prices. The index of prices paid for raw materials fell to 65.4 last month from 71.0 in September.

HEADLINE: Flat-Tax Follies

 BODY:
The Republican presidential candidates who debated in New Hampshire Thursday night did not quarrel much. But it was especially discouraging that they embraced a flat tax to replace the progressive income tax. In the 1996 G.O.P. primaries, Steve Forbes made the flat tax a centerpiece of his campaign, only to have Bob Dole demolish the idea by pointing out the absurdity of lowering tax rates on rich people like Mr. Forbes and raising them on the middle class. This week Mr. Forbes said he was delighted at the revival of his issue. But Republicans would do well to drop it or risk being seen as a servant of the privileged.
The current economic boom has benefited the wealthiest Americans while the working class has struggled to stay even. That is one reason the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut scheme, weighted heavily toward the rich and vetoed by President Clinton, stirred so little support over the summer. Contrary to Alan Keyes's overheated description of the income tax as slavery and a Marxist-Leninist plot, progressivity in tax rates has been accepted by Americans at least since the Civil War. 
Except for Mr. Keyes, the flat tax was embraced in one form or another by all the other debaters, including such otherwise sensible Republicans as Orrin Hatch and John McCain. The candidates dwelled on the bewildering complexity of the current tax system. But as Gary Bauer noted, it is not the overall tax rate that makes the tax system confusing so much as the array of tax breaks, deductions and definitions of income in the tax code. Flat-tax advocates say they would eliminate many of these deductions, but they disagree over which ones. Such steps might demystify the system, but having the rich and the middle class pay the same marginal rates would make the end result unfair.
Gov. George W. Bush, who did not participate in the debate, has said he favors a "fairer and flatter" tax, but he has not yet specified what he means. The best point scored in the debate was by Senator McCain. He noted that what keeps overall rates high is the ability of powerful business groups to get tax breaks in return for campaign donations. "Every time we pass a tax bill," he said, "we add another special loophole and a special deal for the special interests." Mr. McCain may be getting some traction for his idea that the soft-money ban he is pushing in the Senate would actually bring about tax relief for average Americans.
Taxes have been at the center of American presidential campaigns at least since 1980, when Ronald Reagan won by promising a sweeping tax cut. It is healthy to have a quadrennial discussion on whether to cut taxes or spend government funds on health, education and social programs. But the idea that the flat tax is needed in order to simplify the tax code is disingenuous, when the basic result would ease the tax burden on the super-rich. That cannot be what most Americans want.

HEADLINE: Holiday Masquerade At the Pumpkin Patch;
Poor Crop Tests Farmers' Wits

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: DOVER, N.Y., Oct. 23

 BODY:
It took the Rivera family two interminable hours to drive from the Bronx to a farm that had escaped the great pumpkin shortage of 1999, but the reward was a bonanza. "We'd heard of the shortage, so we were glad to see these fields were full," said Jamie Rivera, a New York City police officer.
His 8-year-old son, Jamie Jr., pointed to the 10-pounder he had picked for his grandmother. "And that one, that's for my teacher, Mrs. Grant," he said of the tiny pumpkin at his feet. 
 Generations of Dutchess County residents and citified interlopers have made an annual pilgrimage to pick a patch of pumpkins at Dykeman's Farm here, near Pawling. And this year's customers have not been disappointed. They can stumble over 2,000 pumpkins in the Dykeman family's eight-acre field on Pleasant Ridge Road.
By taking heroic measures to beat last summer's drought and save their cash crop, the Dykemans have enabled Halloween pumpkin pickers to engage in one of the obligatory rituals of autumn, along with leaf peeping, apple picking and trick-or-treating. "Irrigation saved our crop, but a lot of other farmers were hurt," said Henry Dykeman, 71, the family patriarch.
Halloween, America's fastest-growing holiday as measured by consumer spending, is helplessly dependent upon its symbolic gourd. And so, the Halloween boom has created an insatiable need for the pumpkins of New York, which happens to be -- who knew? -- the nation's second-largest pumpkin-growing state, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.
But months of extreme weather have been disastrous for the state's pumpkin supply. The shortage has not only caused wholesale pumpkin importation and instances of vegetable subterfuge, but has also unleashed pumpkin handle deception in the jack-o'-lantern wars at the New York region's farm stands and garden centers.
There are fewer pumpkins right now because of the scorching summer heat and severe drought of June and July. The brutal weather kept seeds from germinating, discouraged bees from pollinating pumpkin flowers and shriveled root systems. Worse, many of the surviving pumpkins ripened prematurely in August and September; they rotted well before Halloween.
Then, in September, many farmers were devastated by floods brought on by Tropical Storm Floyd. "Pumpkins just hate standing water," said Pete Gregg, a spokesman for the State Department of Agriculture and Markets in Albany, "so we got a lot of flat-sided, misshapen pumpkins. And many were discolored with grayish fungus that customers don't find desirable."
As a result, "it's an off year in terms of yield and quality," Mr. Gregg said, "and many pumpkin farmers in the lower Hudson Valley and Long Island were severely affected."
Agriculture analysts have estimated that this year's harvest from the nation's 74,000 acres of pumpkin fields will be more than 50 percent below average. In New York State, drought-related damage to all crops has cost farmers $186 million, Mr. Gregg said.
Now, this fall, the Halloween-minded have discovered that pumpkins are smaller, often more expensive "and there are fewer of them," said Tony Mannetta, director of Greenmarket, a nonprofit organization that operates 28 open-air farmers' markets in New York City.
"My advice has been to shop early," Mr. Mannetta said, "because pumpkins are not available to our customers in nearly their ordinary abundance."
Abundance was hardly in question at Dykeman's Farm. "We got all paranoid about the shortage, but here we don't have to worry," said Jack Bonacorso. He had arrived with his picking crew -- his wife, Donna, and daughters Bryana, 8, and Kayleigh, 6 -- from nearby Wingdale.
"Halloween without a pumpkin," he said, "would be like Christmas without a tree."
Nearby, Heather Bassano, 9, hugged her favorite pumpkin and said she was going to paint a face on it. Erin Ryan, 8, her best friend, said she would be carving hers. "Picking these is so much better than getting them at the A.& P.," said her mother, Charlou Ryan.
At the farm stand, George Kuklevsky and his 10-year-old son, Simon, had just put their six pumpkins on the scales: they weighed 100 pounds and cost $40. "I figured with the shortage, they'd make us pay through the nose," Mr. Kuklevsky said. But at Dykeman's, the price, 40 cents a pound, "was the same as last year," he said.
The beastly weather of 1999 was more of a blow to New York's farmers than it might have been only a few years ago thanks to "the growing industry of Halloween," as Mr. Gregg put it.
The state's pumpkin acreage increased by nearly 20 percent from 1992 to 1997, the last year for which figures are available, according to the Federal Department of Agriculture. It has calculated that New York, with 5,388 acres harvested in 1997, is second only to Illinois, with 7,631 acres harvested.
Although there are spot shortages around the region, small, locally grown pumpkins are generally available. But there is a scarcity of the large, perfectly formed jack-o'-lanterns essential to success in the Halloween competition among roadside stands, garden centers, nurseries and vegetable markets.
Therefore, merchants have relied on ingenuity to save their season. For example, Mr. Gregg said, New York has seen a wholly unpublicized influx of pumpkins from Canada, "where there was no drought and no Floyd."
Even at humble farm stands, authenticity is not a certainty this season. "Some of the roadside stands that make their money from pumpkin sales had to buy their supply," said Dave Tetor, the Dutchess County agriculture program leader at the Cornell Cooperative Extension in Millbrook.
Furthermore, some pick-your-own pumpkin fields have run out of produce and have purchased imported "ringers." "People want the fun of finding them in the field, and if you don't have any pumpkins left you have to plant them at midnight," Mr. Tetor said.
Even cosmetic reconstruction has not been unheard of in this season of crisis. Drought-induced brittleness has caused some growers to experience problems "with the handles on the pumpkins," said Jean M. Warholic, executive secretary of the New York State Vegetable Growers Association, a trade group. "Some customers won't look twice at a pumpkin without a handle. We won't ask whether anyone glued them back on."
When Henry Dykeman started his pumpkin-picking operation in 1974, "we were the only one doing it within a 25-mile radius," he said, "and now everyone is copying us."
Mr. Dykeman and his wife, Jean, own the farm along with their 45-year-old son, Wright, and Wright's wife, Beth.
"Last summer we irrigated the fields for 70 consecutive days, for 20 hours a day," said Wright Dykeman. "I ran out of ambition before I ran out of water."
The Dykemans say it was the hottest, driest summer in memory, and the experts concur. "I've been in Dutchess County 27 years and this is the worst drought I've seen," said Mr. Tetor. "Not every farm has Mr. Dykeman's soil, or his irrigation capability."
Many farmers were not so lucky. "I lost my whole pumpkin crop," said Eugene Froehlich, 55, a vegetable farmer who has grown pumpkins for 25 years on his family farm in Montgomery, across the Hudson from Dutchess County. "It was like planting them in the desert."
Pumpkin farming "is a gamble every year," said the elder Mr. Dykeman, noting that in addition to drought and flood, the neighboring deer population devoured "1,000 of my best pumpkins." Mr. Dykeman smiled, shook his head, then said, "A farmer has to depend on the Lord."
Standing amid rows of pumpkins, Mrs. Ryan made it clear, however, that she would not be dependent on Dykeman's Farm for her pumpkin pie. That "will come out of a can this year," she said. "All the work that's involved with a real pumpkin, it's not worth it -- it tastes exactly the same."

HEADLINE: Nassau County Republicans Pass Budget With Large Tax Increase

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., Saturday, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Faced with a weekend budget deadline and elections on Tuesday, the Nassau County Legislature early this morning approved a new budget for the year 2000 that would eliminate this year's $300 million deficit, cut spending next year by $45 million and, for the first time in seven years, impose a major increase in property taxes.
The final vote was 14 to 4, with only Democrats dissenting. One Democrat was absent. 
 The county's portion of the tax bill for the average homeowner will increase by $90, or about 9 percent, said the Presiding Officer, Bruce Blakeman.
The vote on the budget was the latest twist in a long political saga in Nassau, one of the wealthiest and most populous suburban counties in America, whose powerful Republican political machine has been rocked by disastrous deficits.
At a time when many state and municipal governments have prospered because of a booming economy, Nassau's spending in the last two years has created so much red ink that the county's bonds have been downgraded to a level hovering just above junk.
Mr. Blakeman, along with other Republican members of the County Legislature -- all of whom are up for re-election -- have promised to eliminate waste in county spending.
Mr. Blakeman said that money raised through the sale of bonds covered by anticipated revenues from the settlement with the tobacco industry would serve to reduce a large portion of the $300 million debt. He said he expected a deal on the bonds to be completed within the next two weeks.
Threatened with a revolt by voters on Tuesday, the Republican lawmakers turned against their fellow Republican, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, who is not up for re-election until next year, and rejected his proposed $2.2 billion budget for the year 2000, declaring it "irresponsible" and "just another house of mirrors."
Mr. Blakeman said that the 14 Republicans in the 19-member Legislature reached final agreement on their own budget about 7 P.M. Friday and submitted it to the full Legislature early this morning for a final vote. "As a result of our efforts, Nassau will be entering the new year leaner than it has ever been," he said. "When we shredded the administration's proposed budget a month ago, we pledged to examine county spending, line by line, eliminate waste and cut to the bone," Mr. Blakeman said. "In fact, we've cut into the bone."
The final vote, which came just after 1 A.M., was not without opposition, however. Democrats said they were never provided copies of the Republican budget to study, and received only a verbal briefing on its contents during a short meeting Friday night with Mr. Blakeman in the office of the minority leader, Judith A. Jacobs.
"We never saw any paperwork," Ms. Jacobs said. "We never had any public hearings. We are really captives here, so we all decided to vote against the budget."
"We have been left out of the entire process, so we can only question the validity of their figures and the need for any tax increase," Ms. Jacobs said. "What property owners are being asked to do today is pay for years of mismanagement by the Republicans.
"We Democrats refuse to be a rubber stamp," she continued. "We represent 350,000 people, all of whom have been left out of this budget process. We can only hope that the budget works. No one wants to see the county go under."
Mr. Blakeman said the spending cuts for next year totaled $45 million and would force county commissioners and department heads to "manage more efficiently and do more with less." The cuts range from beepers and cell phones to 33 patronage jobs.
Among the cuts are $4.5 million in overtime cost in 13 departments and $2.5 million in general expense cuts in 23 departments and agencies.
Some departments, including Minority Affairs and Human Rights, are to be merged, permitting the elimination of three directorships, which will bring a savings of hundreds of thousands of payroll dollars, Mr. Blakeman said. "However, the consolidation plan will have absolutely no impact on the services," he said.
Also planned for consolidation are the Department of Drug and Alcohol Addiction Control and the Department of Health. The Department of Commerce and Industry will be merged with the Planning Department, eliminating two top-level patronage jobs. The Police Department will lose $4.1 million in budgeted spending on commercial and other expenses. Mr. Blakeman said, however, that these cuts would have no impact on police services. Mr. Blakeman said law enforcement unions had done their share by agreeing to $6 million in cuts.
"Weeks ago we promised to prepare a fiscal blueprint that would eliminate wasteful spending, make county managers more accountable, minimize the need for large tax increase, all with the aim of putting our county on a sound fiscal footing," Mr. Blakeman said. "Tonight we have made good on that promise."
Mr. Gulotta, who had declined to engage in any debate with the Legislature over his budget, has said only that he welcomed its recommendations. He did not return calls to his office late Friday night for comment on the Legislature's budget package. In any event, the Republican majority is veto-proof.

Big Trouble
 By Dave Barry.
 255 pp. New York:
 G. P. Putnam's Sons. $23.95. 
 A lot of people have been killing a lot of trees lately. Maybe that's why it comes as something of a cultural colonic to discover that Dave Barry has created that rarest of all literary creatures, the genuinely funny mystery novel. "Big Trouble," Barry's first foray into fiction, begins with the author acknowledging his debt to Carl Hiaasen, whom he terms the master of the "Bunch of South Florida Wackos genre." Barry also includes a warning to youngsters about "adult language" in his book. "I did not necessarily want the characters to use this type of language," he contends, but "some of them just went ahead and did. That's how some characters are."
Barry is apparently somewhat squeamish about using truly obscene words in front of a c-h-i-l-d. This cloyingly peculiar morality bodes well for him as he embarks upon this maiden voyage of every mystery writer: embracing the vital, convoluted, god-like work of demarcating right from wrong in the shell game of life. He also, quite naturally, evinces concern about his ability to come up with a serviceable plot. Upon this matter he consults the Three Wise Men -- Stephen King, Elmore Leonard and the aforementioned Hiaasen, all of whom tell him the plot's not too important just as long as you keep killing trees.
It is almost poignant that Barry, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has numerous best sellers under his belt and who has had a television sitcom based upon his life, would find it necessary to consult these icons of imagination, but such is the daunting nature of fiction. It unmasks the author more ruthlessly than any other form of writing. In Barry's case this is a blessing -- we see, possibly for the first time, what a charming, witty, insightful storyteller he truly is. As a writer somewhere once observed: "Plots are for cemeteries."
Far be it from me to demystify "Big Trouble," in terms of, well, plot. There are more important spiritual matters in this book to entertain the reader, like "a man wearing an official Greg Norman golf shirt, official Greg Norman hat and official Greg Norman slacks"; a highly agitated, abusive husband who believes the family dog is Elizabeth Dole coming to suck out his soul; the funniest portrayal of the wasteland that is sports talk radio that has ever been written; a hit man who blows away a large pet python named Daphne at Miami International Airport (a mildly jarring note for animal lovers like me, who probably would've been Buddhists if it weren't for Richard Gere); two arms merchants from an "extremely tribal nation whose economy was based primarily on revenge"; and a cop who tells a thug who wants to know if he gets his gun back: "Of course you do! Just as soon as we run a couple of tests and a giant, talking marshmallow is elected President."
In the great visceral Florida-focused tradition of Hemingway and John D. MacDonald, Dave Barry succeeds wildly with "Big Trouble." He is a welcome leavening agent in the artery-clogged, overly intellectualized and spiritually constipated genre that we now refer to as mystery fiction. Maybe more important, there is a comforting element of Kurt Vonnegut-like cosmic integrity to Barry's work that keeps his crazy characters credible and -- if not always humane -- at least almost human.

INSIDE SUDAN
 Political Islam, Conflict, and Catastrophe.
 By Donald Petterson.
 209 pp. Boulder, Colo.:
 Westview Press. $25. 
 Peace talks to end one of the world's oldest civil wars collapsed in Nairobi, Kenya, last July. On the same day, rebels and aid workers in southern Sudan reported that the Government's sole bomber had dropped a shell that spewed a green gas. Within a week, doctors said, hundreds of people were seriously ill. Elsewhere in southern Sudan, fighting between the northern Islamic Government and Christian and animist southerners had cut off more than 160,000 refugees from the foreign aid they needed to survive.
There was no international debate on what to do, or any urgent message from the Oval Office. Unlike the refugees of Kosovo, the four million people driven from their homes in Sudan receive only marginal world attention. The deaths of 1.9 million southern Sudanese since 1983 remain a little-known statistic.
News reporting from Sudan has long been difficult. Government and rebel restrictions make covering the country practically impossible. Reporters are usually able to get in only by accompanying aid workers, and see only those areas where aid agencies can operate.
If there is little daily journalism coming from Sudan, there are even fewer books, and like most news dispatches they have focused on the humanitarian catastrophe. Bringing a veteran diplomat's perspective, "Inside Sudan," by Donald Petterson, is a welcome addition to the limited number of publications on 20th-century Sudan.
Petterson became the United States Ambassador to Sudan in 1992, four years after the military coup that brought the current Government to power. He left in 1995, before conditions in Khartoum had become so tenuous that the United States Embassy was closed and moved to Nairobi. Petterson's tenure is an important chapter in American relations with Sudan.
A veteran diplomat specializing in Africa, Petterson had served in Zanzibar, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Somalia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Even though he acknowledges that Khartoum was one of the least desirable assignments in the Foreign Service, he welcomed the challenge of engaging a government that was at odds with Washington on almost everything.
Sudan and the United States have never been on very good terms. Political and economic chaos began in Sudan with independence in 1956. Two years later, Sudan's military took power in the first of four coups. But the mostly black, animist or Christian southerners, forever fearful of Arab and Muslim dominance in the north, had already taken up arms in 1955, and except for a hiatus from 1972 to 1982, they have fought steadily for an independent nation.
The Sudanese Government refused to join the United States in opposing the Soviet Union in the 1960's and broke off diplomatic relations with Washington from 1967 to 1972 to protest American support for Israel. From 1972 to 1983 relations improved, but Washington reduced aid in 1985, after the war in the south reignited and the Government proved increasingly dictatorial. The coup in 1989 activated an American law that cut off all assistance except for food and medicine.
So Petterson started out with little diplomatic leverage. As he explains here, he also learned upon his arrival that the embassy had lost radio contact with the United States Agency for International Development office in the southern town of Juba. A month later, a military officer reported that four Sudanese employees of the embassy had been executed for treason.
Petterson protested the executions, but in what he describes as an amazing lack of concern for human rights, Hasan al-Turabi, the head of the National Islamic Front and the real power in Sudan, replied that the men were unimportant and that Washington would soon forget about its dead employees. Turabi would be proven wrong. Three years later the Government nominated a general who was involved in the executions to be Sudan's Ambassador to the United States. Washington and Petterson rejected the nominee, setting off another crisis.
Petterson recounts his meetings with government and rebel leaders, always saying the encounters ended cordially despite an inability to agree on anything. Ever the diplomat, he splits the blame for the war evenly between the warring sides. The southerners want independence and an end to Islamic law. The Government believes in unity and political Islam.
Aid workers are the heroes in the book, struggling to stave off starvation in huge refugee camps that often come under attack. But Petterson glides over how both rebel and Government troops siphon off aid for their war effort.
And, unfortunately, his book leaves out volumes. He doesn't tell us where the Government or the rebels in such an impoverished country get the money for a 16-year civil war. He doesn't discuss the extensive and highly prized oil fields discovered by an American oil company along the line where Sudan could logically be bisected.
While Petterson describes regional peace efforts, he offers only a few sentences on the geopolitics. He briefly mentions Ugandan and Eritrean support for the rebels, but does not note Sudanese backing for the renegade Lord's Resistance Army, which raids elementary schools in northern Uganda, kidnapping hundreds of children and turning them into soldiers or sex servants. There is also no mention of the chattel slavery still practiced by Arab tribes.
Finally, "Inside Sudan" fails to deliver any revelations on United States policy. Petterson states over and over again that Sudan aids terrorists and commits human rights violations, but he doesn't provide any details that have not already been reported in the news media. Similarly, he repeatedly says that there was no support for any greater American role in Sudan than diplomatic engagement and nonmilitary aid, but he doesn't lay out what other options were discussed.
At one point Petterson encounters Sudanese opposition leaders who had hoped that following its victory in the gulf war, the United States would turn its attention to Sudan. Petterson soberly convinces them that this was not about to happen. Now that the United States has, after Kosovo, established a doctrine of using military intervention for human rights purposes, one wonders if those same men are fruitlessly getting their hopes up again.

 BODY:
Call it the calm before the electoral storm. As the city cranks out dollars and spin for the Presidential sweepstakes, the bigger news at the moment is the return of boom times. Northern Virginia's high-tech hub, arguably the epicenter of the Internet, is fueling a robust economy.
The real estate market has gone wild and hotels and museums are being renovated at a breathtaking clip. Cloaked in its racy Michael Graves scaffolding, the Washington Monument symbolizes a capital in flux. The cultural season is in full swing with a raft of shows at art museums -- the new sculpture garden at the National Gallery of Art is the jewel in this top-heavy crown. 
 Washington's generally mild weather means street and cafe life well into November. A fixture on the local Sunday scene is the Dupont Circle Farmers Market, 21st Street between P and Q Streets NW, where vendors sell organic goat cheese and heirloom fruits and vegetables from 8 A.M. to 1 P.M. through November.
And when pumpkins are history, holiday revels begin with the Christmas Pageant of Peace and the lighting of the National Christmas tree on Dec. 8 at 5 P.M. on the Ellipse, E Street between 15th and 17th Streets NW. Bleacher seats are sold out, so it's standing room only. Singers, bands and choruses will perform free nightly on the Ellipse from 6 to 8:30 until Dec. 30, except Dec. 24 and 25. The tree stays up until Jan. 1. Information: (202) 208-1631.
 
Events
At the newly renovated Phillips Collection, 1600 21st Street NW, Duncan Phillips, who in 1921 opened his Dupont Circle home to the public and, in that instant, founded the nation's first modern-art museum, gets his due in a 350-work show "Renoir to Rothko: The Eye of Duncan Phillips." The show, on view till Jan. 23, includes such works as Renoir's "Luncheon of the Boating Party," Picasso's "Blue Room" and Arthur Dove's "Flower Mill II." Admission $7.50 (free on Wednesday). Closed Monday; (202) 387-2151.
Fans of Annie Liebovitz's celebrity shots in Vanity Fair can delve deeper in "Women," at the Corcoran Gallery, 500 17th Street NW, through Feb. 28. The exhibit covers portraits of a broad spectrum of American women, from politicians to strippers to scientists. Closed Tuesday. Suggested admission is $3, but $5 timed tickets are necessary for "Women"; (202) 639-1700.
The National Museum of African Art, 950 Independence Avenue SW, examines sartorial customs in "Hats Off: A Salute to African Headwear," including a red feathered Cameroon headdress and a chief's hat from Congo, through Dec. 26.

Ernest Hemingway comes alive at the National Portrait Gallery, F and Eighth Streets NW, in "Picturing Hemingway: A Writer in His Time," photographs, memorabilia and paintings of the writer and his cronies. Also worth seeing is "Edward Sorel: Unauthorized Portraits," featuring his sly caricatures of Presidents and other celebrities, and "Tete-a-Tete: Portraits by Henri Cartier-Bresson," chosen by the French photographer for a show in Paris when he turned 90 last year. The first two run through Jan. 2, and "Tete-a-Tete" to Jan. 9, when the gallery will close for renovation until 2003. Free; (202) 357-2700.
The ornate Elizabethan theater at the Folger Shakespeare Library, 201 East Capitol Street SE, will look familiar to anyone who has seen "Shakespeare in Love."

Sightseeing
Claes Oldenburg's witty oversized eraser -- the kind with a brush on one end -- sets the mood at the National Gallery of Art sculpture garden (on the Mall between Seventh and Ninth Streets). Come Nov. 15, the garden fountain will be transformed into a skating rink. It will be open daily, except holidays, weather permitting, with skate rentals available; (202) 737-4215.
The big news at the National Zoo, 3001 Connecticut Avenue NW, is a trio of 4-month-old Sumatran tiger cubs, which can be seen from 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. The zoo is open daily and is free; (202) 673-4800.
The often balmy fall weather makes pedaling the monuments a favored pursuit. An easy route starts at the Lincoln Memorial, 23d Street between Independence and Constitution Avenues, follows the Reflecting Pool east to the Washington Monument then bears right along the paved path closest to the southern edge of the Mall to the Tidal Basin and Jefferson Memorial. All monuments are open daily, free. Big Wheel Bikes, 1034 33d Street NW, rents bicycles; (202) 337-0254.
Fall is ideal for a stroll around Georgetown's handsome streets. Amble along P Street to No. 3271, where Jacqueline and John F. Kennedy lived when they were newlyweds. A block or so over, off R Street, Dumbarton Oaks, 1703 32d Street NW, is still vibrant (gardens open 2 to 5 daily, free); (202) 339-6410. For a restorative, Patisserie Poupon, 1645 Wisconsin Avenue (near Q Street), has pastries and homemade French ice cream. Closed Monday; (202) 342-3248.
Though too far to walk from Georgetown -- unless hiking is your thing -- the Washington National Cathedral, Massachusetts and Wisconsin Avenues NW, offers rest and respite for the weary. You can get lost in the cavernous interior, and on the south grounds, through a door right out of a Grimm's fairy tale, is the Bishop's Garden, a lush oval of evergreens, boxwood and herbs. Cathedral tours lasting 30 to 60 minutes are given Monday through Saturday from 10 to 11:30 A.M. and 12:45 to 3:15 P.M. and Sunday from 12:30 to 2:45 P.M.; (202) 537-6200. Suggested donation, $3 and $1 for children.

Bistro Bis, serves sophisticated French comfort food (vegetable tarts and escargot ragout).
An uproarious sequence in the movie "Dick" put the Watergate Hotel, 2650 Virginia Avenue NW, back on the map -- that and an overhaul of the 250 rooms and suites and a new name, Swissotel Washington. Rooms have mahogany and red chintz furniture, taupe bedspreads and marble baths. Doubles: $179 to $595; (202) 965-2300, fax (202) 337-7915.
Budget: Popular with finicky parents of students at the nearby George Washington University is the St. James Suites, 950 24th Street NW, on Washington Circle.

Where to Eat
Already one of the city's top Northern Italian restaurants, Galileo, 1110 21st Street NW, has added Laboratorio Galileo, a new glass-walled kitchen and dining area, where a lucky few can watch the chef, Roberto Donna, work and indulge in a multicourse meal for $95 a person. The Lab menu varies, but past hits include leek custard with black truffle and prosciutto, and rockfish with pig ears and shallots. Reservations for the Lab at least six weeks ahead are suggested.

Goldoni has a new pale-hued home at 1120 20th Street NW, but the chef Fabrizio Aielli's modern Venetian cooking is as dazzling as ever: he dares to pair chocolate-scented pasta with rabbit ragout and eggplant with a sweet-sour glaze. The second level feels more private. Dinner for two with wine, $150; (202) 293-1511.
Mr. Aielli's week-old showcase, Teatro Goldoni, 1909 K Street NW, dishes up pasta and Venetian seafood like lobster with black truffle sauce to a backdrop of harlequin glass and an open kitchen. Dinner for two with a glass of wine, about $110; (202) 955-9494.
In just a few months, Equinox, 818 Connecticut Avenue NW, at Pennsylvania, has become a hit with the White House crowd. The chef, Todd Gray, conjures up lush pan-carmelized duck foie gras and barbecued salmon with corn and red peppers. Dinner for two with wine, around $100; (202) 331-8118.
Also new and justly popular is Johnny's Half Shell, 2002 P Street NW, which flies in French bread from New Orleans for its oyster and soft-shell crab po'boys. Corn pudding, seafood gumbo and Manhattan clam chowder are tops, too, and at lunch, the hot dog with onions and blue cheese ($5.95) steals the show. No reservations. Dinner for two with wine, about $85; (202) 296-2021.
The wood-oven pizzas at Pizzeria Paradiso, P Street between 20th and 21st Streets NW, are dead ringers for the crisp-crusted pies of Naples. Rounding out the menu are paninis, inventive salads, an extraordinary antipasto and homemade gelato. Dinner for two with wine, around $30; (202) 223-1245.
The serene tea shops known as Teaism are hip places for steaming pots of tea (there are more than a dozen green teas alone) and Asian-inspired meals. At breakfast, candied ginger scones are the choice. Lunch and dinner revolve around tea-smoked salmon, sandwiches, homemade soups and addictive chocolate creme brulee. Dinner for two around, $25. Outlets at 2009 R Street NW, (202) 667-3827; 400 Eighth Street NW, and 800 Connecticut Avenue NW, (202) 835-2233, where dinner is not served.

 BODY:
As described in Michael Lewis's article (Oct. 10), Jim Clark is a walking study of the way asset bubbles are formed: give the markets some mystical technology, a few outrageous claims and venture-fueled quick growth, then stand back and watch the feeding frenzy.
Lewis's acceptance of the principles of the "high-tech economy" does not allow us to measure Clark by his tangible accomplishments, or maybe I'm just old-fashioned. Netscape, for example, was supposed to be a technology giant to challenge Microsoft -- now it's basically a provider of chat-room software. 
 Clark's new venture, Healtheon, is now a company of millionaires because of its promise to make health care more efficient. Has it done it? Does it even need to now?
Clark and his Silicon Valley followers are uncannily good at creating new bubbles. They are even better at being far away, working on the next "new thing" when the bubbles pop.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Prescriptions for a Troubled Patient: The Theater

 BODY:
Earlier this month, nine American playwrights gathered in Provincetown, Mass., to discuss the future of American theater. The meeting, organized by the Provincetown Repertory Theater, was recorded before an audience in the town hall. The moderator, Steven Drukman, who is writing a history of American avant-garde theater, began by asking whether there are two separate theater cultures in the United States: nonprofit and commercial Broadway. Here are edited excerpts from the session.
JOHN GUARE. Broadway has always been the marketplace. It was where "Death of a Salesman" was done, where O'Neill worked, where "The Glass Menagerie" and "A Streetcar Named Desire" came. And then suddenly there was an Off Broadway, which became a much more viable place for serious plays. Broadway is the place where tourists come. When I was a kid at Yale Drama School back in the 60's, you dreamed about having a play on Broadway. I don't think anybody dreams that today. You dream of having a play at the Seattle Rep, or Louisville, or the Goodman or Trinity Rep. That's where the theater is, and that's healthy.
The only dangerous thing about it is that so much of the for-profit theater is learning to use the not-for-profit theater as a way of developing for-profit pieces. Another major problem is that so many producers are becoming fearful. The question is not where are the new playwrights? Or where are the new actors? It's where are the new producers who know how to produce a play, understand the writer's intention and protect that?
TERRENCE McNALLY. I do dream of having a play on Broadway, John. It doesn't mean my dream is going to come true. But it's a valid dream. Broadway theaters are still the best real estate in Manhattan in which to have our plays performed. It's easy to bash Broadway.
I don't think we have two theaters. What has happened is that the plays that used to be done on Broadway, by writers of my generation, we've taken over Off Broadway. There was room for us when I began writing. Now, the younger generation finds it very hard to get established even Off Broadway. The Off Broadway movement was a significant change in our theater. But something has to be done about the economics of all theater, where they are less and less willing to take chances on the Terrence McNallys.
LANFORD WILSON. I have a play that could possibly come to Broadway from the Hartford Stage and it terrifies me that theater people seem to know more about West Ireland than they know about the Midwest.
PAULA VOGEL. When we talk about the future of the American theater we have to talk about the future of our economic structure. There is none supporting the theater. And that is becoming an increasing concern. Not only is it exorbitant to produce in New York, it's exorbitant everywhere. And the funding is tied up with the attitude of government officials, who can do a kind of benign censorship. So I think the whole economic infrastructure is at risk.
JON ROBIN BAITZ. I was having breakfast recently with someone who's a rock star and he's a friend. And he was sort of stoned. He looked at me real queer and said, "Why would a young person become a playwright?" He just didn't understand it. It had no context.
People are making little movies now for very little money. When you can make a smart, sexy movie for under $100,000 on digital video, it becomes what the theater might have been. It is evidence that the culture might have moved past the theater for now, to some extent. And maybe it will come back to the theater.
CHRISTOPHER DURANG. As long as I've been around the theater, which is 25 years, everyone is always saying the theater is dying, blah-blah-blah. And yes it is. On the other hand, will it really end? If somebody wants to make a movie, maybe they're not meant to be a playwright.
BAITZ. I'm not saying it's over. I'm saying that this priesthood of being a playwright is sort of straining to survive.
DRUKMAN. But are you making a smart, sexy little comedy for under $100,000?
BAITZ. I can't write about sex. I would if I could. There's just a white noise in here.
WENDY KESSELMAN. But Robbie, if you have to write about something, you have to write about it. For many people, the theater is the only way to really write that. It can be put into a film but it's never quite the same. And I agree with Terrence about the dream -- now, having been on Broadway as the adapter of "The Diary of Anne Frank," revived in 1997 , I can't wait to go back.
AUGUST WILSON. Having had six plays on Broadway, I would hate to see playwrights abandon it. I think it's vital, primarily because the American people see it as the mecca and because the straight play, or the honest, serious playwright, should be represented there.
However, when you talk about the future of the American theater, the question that comes to my mind is what is American about the American theater? We have, in American theater, an art form that is based on European dramatic values, an age-old dramaturgy that is handed down from the Greeks. That is the art form that I work in and one that I embrace.
America is a society that is multiracial and multicultural. Yet the values of the American theater are based on European-American values. Values of other cultures are not seen as valid. As an example, the theaters that seek to preserve and promote the values of African-Americans do not have relationships to the funding sources because they do not meet the sociological criteria of being European-American. If we're going to have something that is called an American theater, then we have to allow room for the esthetic values of Hispanics, for Asians, African-Americans, for all the racial and cultural groups that make up this society, as well as for the age-old tried-and-true values of the European-American.
The theater is a tool by which one makes a speech, if you will. And you can look at it in terms of the First Amendment right to free speech and the Constitutional guarantee of that. But the lack of access to funding that will allow you to make that speech can be considered a prior restraint.
DRUKMAN. That point is indisputable. But I think what Robbie was getting at is that this new, disaffected youthful artist will get together a group of people, a camera and a sound person. There isn't a comparably active, new avant-garde theater culture that is getting into the theater, which is reflected in Robbie's friend's comment, "Why would you ever be a playwright?" I'm not sure that's only a question of access.
VOGEL. Playwriting isn't a calling as much as it is a hazing process, in which one is actively discouraged by lack of funding, by poverty, by lack of access. Off Broadway is an impossible goal for playwrights who do not fit the mold of, yes, European dramaturgy.
DRUKMAN. How experimental are we allowing ourselves to be? And are plays getting edgier, or are they becoming more homogenized?
A. R. GURNEY. All really good theater has an element of anarchy underneath it, of chaos, of real darkness. I think that's why we go to the theater, to see people put on masks and try to put shape on that darkness. And that can be frightening not only to the standard bourgeois audiences that go to plays, but to the people who fund plays. And that's a serious thing. When a play becomes too dangerous, too tricky, then the odds are it might not be produced.
AUGUST WILSON. We are all contemporary playwrights and the plays we write are much different from plays that were written in, say, 1930 and 1949. That is because we have built on the tradition of American theater, which was at one time experimental. So the experiment proves the value of the tradition: the playwright sits down and uses or discards at will that which he is given by his predecessors.
If you look at American society in the last 30 years, we have made tremendous changes from the time when I was a young man until now, when I am in my middle age. I don't think there is a theater that has kept up with that change.
One of the things that playwrights wrestle with, to my mind, is the influence of television. We cannot go backward. Television is here. I think that playwrights are in the process of trying to figure out how to absorb that influence and to make dramatic art out of an influence that wasn't there in the 1920's.
GUARE. I was teaching at a university a few years ago and there were two people in the class who were remarkably talented, where you just say, "Ah, there is a future for the theater." They had gone so far into debt to take this writing program that when their two years were up, both of them went out to California just to get work in episodic television to pay off the enormous debt they had incurred. And they are lost because they are both now very successful. They have learned to work in a corporate voice and feel that the theater is elite because it's the voice of one playwright. They like the comfort of working on a half-hour comedy that goes into 50 million homes. Those two people will never come back to the theater. Now the amount of money that it costs just to go to Yale or N.Y.U. makes your future impossible, because you incur an extraordinary debt that then paralyzes your life paying that off.
AUGUST WILSON. There is something disturbing about what you're saying.
GUARE. Which is?
AUGUST WILSON. I never took a course, for instance, or went to school. I think there is something called an artist and either you want to be an artist or you don't.
GUARE. But what I'm saying is I don't think we live in a society that gives people the confidence to be an artist. I think that you're very, very, very rare.
AUGUST WILSON. It's something that you have to claim though. And you pay your dues or you do whatever is necessary. I'm sure that Picasso could have made more money in graphic art, but he was an artist.
VOGEL. It's still a matter of access. I don't think that film is necessarily the enemy. A while ago I had probably the most extraordinary teaching opportunity I'll ever get. I did a playwriting workshop for women in maximum security at an adult correctional institution. Those women did much better than my graduate playwrights. They had to. They wanted to. But they had never seen a play. They had never gone to the theater. We could only approach what theater was by talking about television and film, which was storytelling they know. So a lot of this to me is access.
Theater is unmediated between a living and breathing audience and a living and breathing actor on the stage. There are no lenses in between us. There is no director's cut. It's really about a community dialogue and that is why I think that access is made difficult in this society. Those women in maximum security don't become playwrights because they would tell us a thing or two about realism.
GURNEY. I think it has again to do with funding, but a different kind of funding, namely funding for our schools. Just the way the symphony orchestra is having a great deal of trouble now, because the high schools are not able to fund school orchestras and kids don't get a chance to pick up an instrument and learn what it is to be a part of an orchestra. It's the same thing with school drama programs. Somehow the schools have got to introduce the arts.
DRUKMAN. Are there ultimate taboos in American playwriting? Are there things you feel you shouldn't or mustn't----
DURANG. No elephant dung.
AUGUST WILSON. I can't think of a taboo I would impose upon myself. If I did, I'd write a play about it.
BAITZ. I think race is still a taboo. Even though people do write about it, it's very, very difficult, because there is so much rage and guilt. It's the great subject in this country, this race rage on all sides.
KESSELMAN. There is another interesting taboo I've come up against and that's children. If you portray children as having deep, serious emotions, you are absolutely lambasted.
LANFORD WILSON. Children know that they are lying and performing for their parents. But we can't write that.
KESSELMAN. The play I'm talking about involved a brother tormenting his little sister. When we had discussions with children in the audience -- "Have you ever done such a thing?" -- they were just thrilled to tell how they put their sisters in trunks and everything else.
AUGUST WILSON. I want to get back to something that Jon Robin Baitz said. I agree with you. I think race is a great subject and an important subject because it deals so much with the history of this country and the aftermath of that history, which we are all a living part of. Obviously I don't find it a taboo.
BAITZ. For me, I guess, the question is, Am I qualified to know what's in my heart? Am I qualified to speak for myself, even?
AUGUST WILSON. When you say race, you are not just talking about African-Americans. You are a member of a race also.
VOGEL. When we talk about writing about race, I keep going back to when Anna Deavere Smith told me that strangers are much more likely to talk to each other about sex than race. It's absolutely true. In another conversation she said white writers have to do the race work. It can't just be writers of color, in terms of reading and thinking it through. And that is when I started thinking about this. It's not a matter of research. It's a matter of thinking it through carefully so that you can stand on the ground from where you write in terms of race. I think that white writers -- whether it's guilt or not wanting to go through that journey -- we're in the state of denial.
BAITZ. To me, I feel that black people and white people in this country are still terrified of one another on a basic, almost a -- to steal a David Hare phrase -- mineral level. I want to write about that. I think we understand one another even less as the century ends. And the divide becomes even bigger. So, as a taboo, the longer you're silent, the harder it is to grasp.
LANFORD WILSON. Well, art is born out of, among other things, necessity. Writing a play for me is like walking down this landscape of the self. Many things that you confront sometimes are not the best parts of yourself. But you have to be willing to deal with them so that you emerge at the end with a brighter and stronger spirit, ready to go through the next journey.

THE renewal of Atlantic City's Northwest Inlet oceanfront neighborhood, which since 1987 has transformed a ragged urban wasteland into a bright new enclave, is being extended inland to 20 adjacent blighted blocks.
The latest redevelopment program, for what is known as the "uptown area," calls for filling the vacant lots and replacing the smattering of shuttered buildings bounded by Adriatic, Massachusetts, Atlantic and Tennessee Avenues with 600 mixed-income, rental and for-sale housing units. The first single-family-home project, which is to start in December, will start with eight houses based on original designs by Frank Lloyd Wright for American System Built Homes, the architect's early 20th century version of prefabricated affordable housing. The rest of the 40-home first phase, which will be called Washington Square and will also be based on Wright designs, may ultimately include a total of 135 homes. 
 Following a national trend, 214 of the 600 new residences will replace an equal number of public housing units in two of the area's existing mid-rise projects, which will be razed. Twenty-two replacement units currently under way are for-sale, side-by-side two-family houses. The remaining 192 units, mostly rentals, will also be side-by-side two-families.
Like the Northwest Inlet, the uptown redevelopment program, which is expected to cost $200 million and take five years to complete, is being spearheaded by the state's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, with the city as a partner. The authority was created under a 1984 law to channel casino money into urban-renewal projects.
The redevelopment program, said Mayor James Whelan, is "an opportunity to rebuild another neighborhood and will go a long way in removing blight and redefining Atlantic City as a place where people want to live."
It will also enhance the corridor leading to the inlet and the nearby casinos, a corridor that now entails "passing through some rough neighborhoods," said James Kennedy, executive director of the casino authority. "It was the logical next place to develop," he said.
Washington Square, he said, will be "a selling point," given its link to Wright. "In a town that has seen a lot of its history torn down the project will create a neighborhood that could have been built in 1917," Mr. Kennedy said.
Financing for the overall uptown redevelopment includes $90 million that will come from the city's 12 casinos, each of which must put 1.25 percent of its gross annual gaming revenue for 25 years into bonds issued by the authority at below-market rates for projects the authority approves.
Atlantic City also received a $35 million federal grant for the public housing component, Mr. Kennedy said, adding that the rest of the funds would come from the city and the proceeds from sales of units in the project.
Mayor Whelan said the redevelopment approach for the uptown area would be different from the one used in the inlet. "There," he said, "everything was knocked down and rebuilt, because there wasn't a lot worth salvaging."
This time, he said, the redevelopment will fit into the neighborhood; commercial, residential and community structures -- such as churches -- that are solid will remain. Because of planned road improvements, such as the widening of North Carolina Avenue, some businesses will be relocated, but to somewhere else in the neighborhood, the Mayor said.
Another departure is Washington Square. Many say the project will bring a distinct housing product to the city and, it is hoped, a bit of national fanfare.
While not replicating the original American System Built Homes, the houses will be based on its designs and be updated. And they will be put in use for the first time on the East Coast, according to Taliesin Architects, the firm that traces its heritage back to the architectural practice started by Wright in 1893. The firm, which will execute the designs for Washington Square, is part of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and has its southwestern headquarters, along with the foundation and an architecture school, at Taliesin West, a 600-acre campus in Scottsdale, Ariz.
THE project's up to $15 million 40-home first phase will be constructed by a joint venture between Claremont/ NFF of Far Hills and the Rubicon Companies L.L.C of West Orange. Paul Cocoziello, who is Rubicon's president and is credited with the idea of bringing American System Built Homes to the city said: "We saw it as a perfect fit."
Taliesin allows the use of the designs for a licensing fee, which Mr. Cocoziello paid. His firm is able to build such homes in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.
In 1917, Wright, designed American System Built Homes in an effort to make homes affordable to moderate-income people. They were intended to fit on urban infill lots and to be built as modular or prefabricated homes.
The architect teamed with the Richards Company, a lumber company in Milwaukee, which precut, numbered and bundled wood panels and marketed them as housing kits that could be trucked to and assembled on the buyer's lot. The venture lasted until 1920, when it was cut short by the poor economy after World War I. It resulted in 11 homes in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas costing $1,200 each, according to Nirmal Mangal, a Taliesin architect in charge of the Washington Square project.
These homes differ from Wright's Usonian Homes, which while also considered affordable, were designed for specific clients in the post-World War I years. Sixteen Usonian homes can still be found in New York communities, particularly Pleasantville in Westchester County.
The Washington Square homes will reflect Wright's original designs for American System Built Homes, but follow current construction codes, said Mr. Mangal.
Mr. Mangal said his firm got involved with the project because "we want to continue to address Mr. Wright's issue of affordable housing." The homes, which are spacious, "still look contemporary," he added.
While the Washington Square homes will be modified for their seashore setting and will feature such modern amenities as a garage, Mr. Mangal said the architect's trademark uses of large overhangs, sloped or flat roofs and earthtone colors would be visible. The houses will also have front and rear porches to encourage interaction among residents. Construction of all the houses will be a combination of stick-built and prefabrication, Mr. Mangal said.
Construction of the first homes, with two and three bedrooms and 1,260 to 1,630 square feet, is to start after the Atlantic City Planning Board approves the project, which is expected next month. They will rise on a vacant lot along Tennessee Avenue and will sell for $125,000 to $150,000.
There already is a list of six people who want to buy the homes, said Alvin Taliaferro Jr., executive director of Vision 2000, a community-based organization that is the project's nonprofit sponsor.
Some of the Washington Square homes will also incorporate Wright's designs for wood trim, light fixtures and furniture. They will be reserved for nonprofit groups, like Vision 2000, said Mr. Kennedy of the casino authority.
Meanwhile, he said, his agency continues to acquire land -- some of which it or the city's public housing authority already owns -- for the rest of Washington Square as well as for the overall uptown redevelopment project.
Mr. Taliaferro said neighborhood residents "are excited so far about the first project." As for the overall redevelopment, he added, "we will work to insure community residents are served."
Development continues in the Northwest Inlet, where 600 homes have been built and 400 more are planned. One project under way along Gardner's Basin lagoon is Smugglers Cove, which consists of five separate components meant to preserve Atlantic City's maritime history. The components include six homes, each with 1,400 square feet on average, that will feature architectural details, like wide roof eaves, evocative of bungalows in the 1920's and 10 waterside lots for sale at $150,000 whose buyers must build homes according to certain architectural guidelines.
Mr. Kennedy said that redeveloping the Inlet and uptown areas was "like a giant puzzle."
"We started on the outside with the more desirable and valuable waterside land and now are moving to the city's center," he explained.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In /Morristown, N.J.;
Presence of the Past in a Lively Downtown

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
HISTORIC Morristown, twice George Washington's headquarters in the Revolutionary War, is in the midst of a downtown revival as retail chains return and the demand for housing soars after years of stagnation.
"Five years ago, many of our stores and offices were vacant," said Mayor John J. DeLaney. "Now we have 150 new businesses and new apartment buildings are being leased before completion." 
 "People call from all over the world, looking for houses," said Kathryn R. Godby, a local independent real estate broker. "Multinationals in the area, including AT&T and Allied Signal, are transferring people into Morris County and telling them that Morristown is a good place to raise families."
And the central business district, consisting of Park Avenue, South Street, Speedwell Avenue and Washington Street, is buzzing with a mixture of small shops, banks and chain stores. Its five dozen restaurants do a thriving lunch trade on the 60,000 people who funnel into town daily to work in offices in this Morris County seat. Some of those offices are headquarters or major facilities of 70 Fortune 500 companies, according to Michael Fabrizio, executive director of the Morristown Partnership, a quasi-public economic development agency.
Among the more popular restaurants are the Grand Cafe (French) on Washington Street, Settebello Il Caffe (Italian) on Cattano Avenue and La Campagna (Italian) on Elm Street. The Community Theater of Morristown, which holds 80 performances annually in a partially renovated old 1,200-seat movie house, keeps restaurants busy on many nights and weekends.
The Mayor credits the Morristown Partnership with polishing the town's image by adding new street lights, renovating sidewalks and curbs and recruiting major chains, such as Starbucks, GapKids and Footlocker, to fill vacancies. The town also benefits from the arrival three years ago of New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct rail service, which bypasses Hoboken and shortens the trip into Penn Station by one third, to one hour.
The downtown radiates from a trapezoidal green that was set aside by the town's first Presbyterian settlers, who arrived from New England in 1715. Large, older homes on tree-lined streets, 30 houses of worship, national historic sites and good schools are among Morristown's attractions.
Last week just 23 houses were on the market, ranging in price from $135,000 for a home that needs work in the Second Ward to $795,000 for new construction on Overlook Road, near the Spring Brook Country Club, most of which is in Morris Township.
Housing prices have risen by more than 10 percent over the past 12 months, according to Phyllis Lunetta, a broker at Coldwell Banker on South Street. Homes in the historic district, which begins at the green and encompasses nearly half the buildings in town, fetch the highest prices. Some of those houses have sold for nearly $800,000, with the new owners investing an equal amount in upgrades.
"People want to be able to walk to everything," Ms. Godby explained. "And they like purchasing something unique."
LIKE many other buyers, John M. Russo, a training manager at a credit union in nearby Bedminster, willingly paid a premium for his 1920's three-bedroom colonial on Georgian Road, on the fringe of the historic district in July. The house, which has wide, chestnut moldings, a richly detailed wooden mantel over the fireplace and original brass doorknobs, cost $368,000.
"I wanted an old house with character, a real downtown with small shops and good restaurants, and easy access to highways," Mr. Russo explained. "I had already lost one Morristown house by not bidding in time. This house came on the market at 11 A.M. and by 3 P.M. we were signing a contract."
Morristown has a total of 550 condominium units, mainly in 10 complexes of 20 or more units. The largest is the 141-unit Windmill Pond town-house complex, off James Street. which was built in 1980 with two- and three-bedroom units. A three-bedroom is currently listed at $274,900.
Mayor DeLaney said that 50 percent of Morristown's residents are renters. The largest new rental project is the two-year-old Chancery Square, a 131-unit complex of one- and two-bedroom luxury units on Cattano Avenue. Rents range from $1,100 to $1,800 and the building was filled shortly after the apartments were put on offer, the Mayor said. In older structures, such as the 270-unit Jacob Ford Village garden apartment complex off Valley View Drive, one-bedrooms rent for $690 to $900 and two-bedrooms for $750 to $1,200.
Just south of the historic district, on Washington Place, is the three-acre Washington Headquarters site, with its Headquarters Museum (which houses Revolutionary War relics) and the Ford Mansion, where Washington wintered in 1777 and 1780 while his troops were camped in nearby Jockey Hollow in Harding Township. The park and Jockey Hollow are two of four Morristown area historic sites administered by the National Park Service. The others are the New Jersey Brigade Encampment in Bernardsville and the 20-acre Fort Nonsense site, off Ann Street in Morristown, where in 1780 the Continentals built earthen fortifications that they regarded as busywork. Admission to the Headquarters Museum, Ford Mansion and Jockey Hollow, which are open daily from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., is $4 for adults, free for children under 16.
The other major historical site is the 7.5-acre Historic Speedwell Village, off Speedwell Avenue. It is on the National Register of Historic Places as the site of the 19th-century Speedwell Iron Works and the place where the telegraph was perfected by Samuel F. B. Morse and Alfred Vail in 1838.
The eight buildings include the Vail House mansion, which shows life in the 1840's, and the S.S. Savannah Exhibit, with artifacts from the first steamship to cross the Atlantic (in 1819). Speedwell is open Sunday and Thursday 1 to 4 P.M. Admission is $5 for adults and $3 for children under 18.
Morristown is completely surrounded by Morris Township, which shares the 4,500-student Morris School District. It has three K-2 schools, three 3-5 schools, Freylinghuysen Middle School for grades 6-8, and the 1,300-student Morristown High School, which is also attended by students from nearby Morris Plains.
In addition, the district has the K-5 Normandy Park Multiage Magnet School, where students are not marked and are allowed to progress in accordance with their abilities, rather than their ages. In addition to its regular public schools, Morristown is home to the Unity Charter School, a 90-student K-8 public school that stresses environmentalism.
Computers are introduced in kindergarten, with at least one terminal in every elementary school classroom. The middle school has more than 100 computers for its 900 students and the high school has nine computer laboratories.
Morristown High School offers 14 advanced placement courses in English, history, the sciences, mathematics and foreign languages. Among its many amenities are television and radio studios and an indoor swimming pool. The school competes in 27 interscholastic sports, including baseball, soccer, football, track, fencing, field hockey, hockey and lacrosse.
Dr. Dwight R. Pfennig, the Superintendent of Schools, says that the high school has produced two winners of the prestigious Westinghouse Science awards, a competition whose name was changed in 1998 to the Intel Science Talent Search, and last June's 270-student graduating class earned more than $1 million worth of scholarships. Five students were semifinalists in the National Merit Scholarship test and 88 percent of the graduates went on to higher education. On the SAT Morristown seniors scored a joint verbal/mathematics average of 1,059, which was 54 points above the state's average and 43 points over the national average.
LOCAL private schools include the 300-student k-8 Peck School on South Street, with annual tuition ranging from $11,550 to $15,400; the 440-student 6-12 Morristown-Beard School on Whippany Road, with tuition of $17,700; the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic school for nursery through grade 8, where tuition is $2,620 for parishioners and $3,024 for nonparishioners, and the Montessori Children's House on Cutler Street for pre-k-6, which costs $4,575 for half-day students and $7,700 for full-day students.
Although most residents rate Morristown positively, it is not without problems. The highway system that eases the commute to work in Morris County and New York City also snarls traffic during rush hours, as motorists leave the two Morristown exits off Interstate 287, heading for nearby communities.
Municipal taxes have been raised by 12 percent in each of the previous two years and are expected to rise by 6 percent this year, as the town attempts to pay off a $100 million debt incurred over the last 20 years. Racial tensions are near the surface between a group in the mainly minority Second Ward and the municipal government over a former junkyard in a flood zone that residents want used for low- and moderate-income housing and a community center. And development pressures in the historic center of town are pitting preservationists against developers who want to build high-rise apartment complexes.
"We have traffic because we have activity," says Mayor DeLaney. "And the development pressures in the Second Ward and the Historic District are both good, because it shows that people are involved."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property;
Reckson Invests Heavily in Its Manhattan Portfolio

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
FOR several years after breaking out of its home base on Long Island, Reckson Associates Realty Corporation conspicuously avoided New York City. In a 1996 interview, Scott Rechler, the company's president, defined its operating territory as "within a 50 mile radius of Manhattan with Manhattan and the boroughs carved out."
But now the company is not only heavily invested in Manhattan but is continuing to buy New York properties at a time when many other real estate investment trusts have been lying low because of the depressed prices of their shares. Earlier this month Reckson said it had reached an agreement to acquire 1350 Avenue of the Americas, a 540,000 square foot office building at 55th Street, for $126.5 million. 
 That boosted the company's Manhattan portfolio to 3.5 million square feet, out of a total of 25 million square feet in the New York metropolitan area.
Mr. Rechler now says that greater exposure to the other suburbs of the metropolitan area convinced him that the Long Island economy he grew up in is unique and isolated from the city. Westchester and Fairfield Counties and the New York City suburbs of New Jersey, he said, are much more closely linked to the city, making it an advantage to own property both locations.
"As we expanded in the rest of the tristate area, it became clear how important Manhattan is to the marketplace in terms of tenant flows," he said. For example, he said, 1350 Avenue of the Americas will be marketed as a high profile Manhattan satellite office for suburban-based companies because of its location and the ability to divide the floors into smaller spaces.
He said that population and office space statistics supported the argument that the Long Island economy was more self-sustaining than others in the city's suburbs. While Long Island has about 25 million square feet of office space for a population of 2.7 million, he said, Westchester County has a similar amount of office space, but a population of only about 800,000. This, he said, shows that Westchester is strongly linked to a larger, regional economy.
As a result of identifying this linkage between New York and its western and northern suburbs, Mr. Rechler said, Reckson is the only area REIT to own Class A office space both in the city and along its fringes.
But Mr. Rechler concedes that doing business in Manhattan has been a different undertaking than the company's operations in the suburbs.
Reckson grew out of a family-owned development and management company based in Melville, N.Y., that was transformed into a REIT that sold shares to the public for the first time in 1995. As it went on to make acquisitions in Westchester and Fairfield Counties and in New Jersey many of its early targets were similarly family owned and managed businesses. Reckson acquired the F.D. Rich organization in Fairfield County, Halpern Enterprises in Westchester and Sym Heller in New Jersey and used them as the basis for its expansion in those markets.
Some of these companies had been weakened by the recession of the early 90's and were happy to join forces with a REIT that had access to capital. But the wealthy, proudly independent real estate barons of Manhattan were not about to give up their independence to a suburban upstart.
Mr. Rechler said he had spent a year trying to buy an existing, family-run company in the city without success. "We met with all the major landlords," he said. "But in Manhattan, the major players are celebrities in their own right."
RECKSON'S opportunity came when Tower Realty Trust, a Manhattan-based REIT that had not found favor on Wall Street, became available. Recksonoriginally planned the acquisition in conjunction with another REIT, Crescent Real Estate Equities of Fort Worth, but pressed ahead on its own when Crescent retreated, paying $680 million in stock, cash and the assumption of debt for Tower's 4.6 million square feet of property.
Tower was a mixed bag of Class A and B properties in Manhattan with additional office developments in Arizona and Florida. In the last year, Reckson sold the Class B properties, which included buildings at 286, 290 and 292 Madison Avenue and 90 Broad Street, to S.L. Green Realty Corporation, a Manhattan-based REIT specializing in such properties. The Arizona and Florida projects were also sold.
That left Reckson with a core of Class A properties, including buildings at 100 Wall Street, 810 Seventh Avenue and Tower 45 at 120 West 45th Street. Since then the company has also acquired the building at 919 Third Avenue between 55th and 56th Streets.
Tower's management did not come with the deal and analysts said the success of the transaction could depend on finding a manager savvy in the ways of Manhattan real estate.
Even if Mr. Rechler had been successful in acquiring one of the privately owned real estate companies in Manhattan, keeping the management in place might not have been as successful as in the suburbs. When Vornado Realty Trust, a Saddle Brook, N.J.-based REIT, bought the Mendik Company in early 1997, its chairman , Bernard H. Mendik was named co-chairman of Vornado along with Steven Roth. But that arrangement only lasted about a year and a half, before Mr. Mendik resigned.
Subsequently, Mr. Mendik said he preferred to operate independently rather than as part of a corporate structure.
Mr. Rechler chose Philip M. Waterman 3d, a managing director of Tishman Speyer Properties, to manage Reckson's Manhattan operations. The privately held Tishman Speyer manages and has partial ownership in such well known New York landmarks as Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building.
Mr. Waterman, who is known as Tod, said he had been initially skeptical that he would be given the latitude to manage the business in Manhattan. The glamour of the market, he feared, would be too much for executives in Melville to resist the temptation to get involved.
But Mr. Rechler said his job was to manage the broad swath of Reckson's business, not the particulars of any individual market. "I'm a big delegator," he said. "As long as we are the landlord of choice in our markets, I don't have an interest in the details."
Although the price of Reckson's shares, like most REIT's, has been battered by the stock market -- it was trading recently at about $18 a share, near its low for the year -- the company is still actively shopping for property. The company keeps its war chest funded by selling properties that are not core to its business or where it stands to make a tidy profit. In addition to the Tower dispositions, the company recently concluded the sale of some industrial properties for $310 million.
Mr. Waterman said there were still some bargains to be had in Manhattan, despite the current high values established properties are fetching. He said Reckson is looking for complicated, messy deals that other REIT's tend to avoid.
He noted that the Tower deal had to be restructured after Crescent withdrew as an active participant. The building at 919 Third Avenue involved acquiring a mortgage that was in default from a group of Japanese investors. The long distance negotiations will eventually give Reckson ownership of the property at a discount from its face value, he said, but it is not as uncomplicated as some investors prefer.
The deal to buy 1350 Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Rechler said, included negotiations involving 50 members of the Minskoff family, which had been unsuccessful in previous attempts to sell the property. "We only allocate time and capital to complicated investments," he said. "We think the ability to execute these transactions is a competitive advantage."

HEADLINE: The Father of Parks, and Traffic

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
ROBERT A. CARO was running late, terribly late. Driving from the Bronx to Long Island to interview Robert Moses for what would become the book "The Power Broker," Mr. Caro had gotten hopelessly stuck in traffic -- on the very network of bridges and expressways that Moses had built.
Although the incident happened some three decades ago, Mr. Caro still describes it as if it were yesterday. In an animated interview last week, his eyes flashed as he leaned forward, perched on the edge of a wide plush chair beside a marble fireplace in his apartment on Central Park West. 
 When he belatedly arrived at Moses' cottage in on that long-ago day, Mr. Caro recalled, he apologized for the delay and tried to explain about the snarled roads. But the imperious Moses would not hear of it.
"Traffic jam -- on the Long Island Expressway?" Moses thundered incredulously. "At this hour?" Then he slammed his hand down on the table with a startling bang and roared: "Nonsense!"
"End of discussion," Mr. Caro recalled.
Their session that day was one of seven interviews that Moses granted before he broke off his cooperation on the book, closed his files, ordered his aides to clam up and otherwise did his utmost to thwart the determined young author.
Ultimately, of course, Mr. Caro got the last word -- an epic 650,000 last words, to be exact. This month is the 25th anniversary of the publication of "The Power Broker" (Knopf, 1974). Despite attacks by Moses and other critics over the years, the book has become as much of an icon in the literary and political science worlds as any of Moses's monumental projects is in the field of public works.
Although the book is subtitled "Robert Moses and the Fall of New York," it is also about the rise of Long Island and Moses's role in molding suburban life here. "The Power Broker" forever changed the perception of Long Island as well as of its Master Builder.
"Long Island is shaped the way it is largely because of Robert Moses," Mr. Caro said. "Long Island is a perfect example of how political power shapes people's lives every day."
The Island played a seminal part in Moses's career and in the birth of Mr. Caro's book. What would become Moses's statewide empire, extending to hydroelectric power plants on the Canadian border, really began on the Island. His creation of Jones Beach State Park in the 1920's as a playground for the sweltering working-class families of the city was a phenomenal smash hit with the public and politicians alike. Moses followed it with numerous other parks across Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and the system of parkways and expressways to get there.
"His dream of Jones Beach and the other state parks was really quite wonderful," Mr. Caro said. "He preserved open space, and Long Island still enjoys it today. It is one of the most noble uses of power to create something worthwhile that I ever heard of.
"But" -- and in Mr. Caro's view it is a gigantic but -- "Moses also had this vision of Long Island exemplified by the automobile and the roads, and he wanted single-family, low-density suburbs." The result was endless sprawl, stunted mass transit, ailing village downtowns, traffic congestion and a shortage of varied housing.
Spurning the pleas of other planners, whom he despised, Moses blocked forever the use of the Long Island Expressway's median for a new commuter rail line. He stubbornly persisted as the champion of the automobile, Mr. Caro said, long after it was clear that "by building more highways, you would only create more congestion." He and other critics say that the rail line could have spawned adjacent apartment houses offering modest-priced rentals and enough density to promote thriving village centers while still allowing for single-family homes nearby and good train service for all.
"If Moses hadn't done certain things that were only his decision, Long Island would have a spine," Mr. Caro said. "Long Island would be a very different place today."
There would be more apartments that are sorely needed by retirees, singles, young couples and lower-paid service workers, he said. Traffic would be reduced.
"There would still be congestion, but not nearly as much," he said, "and there would be the amenities of downtowns -- bookstores, museums, live theaters."
Moses had strong ties to Long Island. When not at his home in Manhattan or his headquarters on Randall's Island beneath his Triborough Bridge, he spent much of his time living near the water in Oak Beach and in his office in Belmont Lake State Park.
Numerically, Moses was involved in far more projects in the city. His works there included the United Nations headquarters, Kennedy International Airport, Shea Stadium, Lincoln Center, Riverside Park, the Central Park Zoo, the Grand Central Parkway, Stuyvesant Town and Co-op City, to name but a few.
"But Long Island is probably the place you can see, in the clearest form, the shaping from his hand, because he was working on a tabula rasa," Mr. Caro said. The Island "was ripe for the imposition of a vision."
Like Moses, Mr. Caro found Long Island to be the stage for a turning point in his career. A Princeton graduate, he developed as a star reporter at Newsday and became increasingly intrigued at how often he encountered the vast Moses octopus.
"Nobody knew how he got his power," he said. "I would sit at Newsday and get a press release saying something about City Parks Commissioner Moses -- and what did that have to do with parkways on Long Island? -- or about Triborough Authority Chairman Moses -- and what did that have to do with upstate electric plants? This was man who had never been elected to anything and had more power than people who had been elected."
A Carnegie fellowship and an advance of a few thousand dollars (he says he no longer remembers the exact amount) from Simon & Schuster propelled Mr. Caro into starting the book, which he estimated would take nine months. But he did not finish it until seven years later, nearly going bankrupt in the process. To scrimp, he and his wife, Ina, sold their house in Roslyn and moved to Riverdale in the Bronx and still had trouble making the rent. She worked to support them and also helped in the reporting.
After Mr. Caro drafted a major portion of the book, his editors praised it but said it was not marketable. "They said, 'Nobody's going to buy a book about Robert Moses,' " he said. "It was a terrible night."
But when it came out, the book got a sensational reception. It won the Pulitzer Prize for biography and garnered numerous other awards. The former Times reporter David Halberstam said it was "surely the greatest book ever written about a city."
The executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, Dr. Lee E. Koppelman, who was among Mr. Caro's hundreds of sources, said: "If I were limited in a political science course to assigning only one book, without hesitation, I would say this is the book. It's the definitive book on New York politics and on the universal clues to how politics operates."
"The Power Broker" has been extolled as a groundbreaking work of history, biography and investigative reporting. It is required reading at hundreds of colleges for courses ranging from political science to urban planning to transportation to journalism.
Knopf does not disclose sales figures, but the book has accomplished the rare publishing feat of remaining in print continuously for a quarter century, in both hard cover and paperback. "It's still a big thrill to see it in the bookstores, to see people reading it," Mr. Caro said.
Moses, who died in 1981 at the age of 92, loathed it. Although the book hailed him as "America's greatest builder" and credited him with $27 billion worth of projects in 1968 dollar values, the book also portrayed him as antidemocratic, corrupted by power, ruthless, vindictive, underhanded and racist. The book says he sabotaged mass transit, enforced de facto segregation by race and class, bulldozed neighborhoods and callously displaced half a million New Yorkers under the banner of slum clearance, urban renewal, road construction and assorted other civic improvements.
In his own defense, Moses issued a rebuttal. "I raise my stein to the builder who can remove ghettos without moving people," he said, "as I hail the chef who can make omelets without breaking eggs."
Other critics called the book "tendentious," "endlessly repetitious" and lacking historical perspective. Dr. Barbara M. Kelly, curator of the Long Island Studies Institute at Hofstra University, praised the book as highly informative but said: "I think he is overly hard on Moses. If you look at our beaches and compare to what happened to Atlantic City or Cape Cod, the man has been redeemed."
Robert W. Greene, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former reporter and editor at Newsday who describes himself as a friendly competitor and admirer of Mr. Caro, said that "he captured Moses brilliantly," but added: "I would argue that Moses, for all his occasional faults, was a magnificent planner. I think his longterm effect was positive, while Bob makes a more negative assessment, but those are judgment calls."
Kenneth Jackson, an urban history professor at Columbia University, has said that the book ascribes too much significance to Moses. Federal highway and housing policies and societal trends were as much responsible for the rise of modern suburban structure as anything Moses himself did, the professor said.
And some critics have said that the racial lines in Moses's policies should be viewed as reflecting an era in which the white establishment in general fostered separation for blacks, as evidenced by Federal housing rules and the segregated military.
But Mr. Caro stands by his book. Even with the benefit of a quarter century's worth of hindsight, there is nothing he would delete, he said, and there has even been talk of restoring about 400,000 words that were cut from the original manuscript, though that apparently will not happen. "I really can't bear to go back," he said.
While the subtitle's reference to "the Fall of New York City" might seem dated in an era of falling crime, the Wall Street boom and the Disneyfication of Times Square, Mr. Caro said it accurately described the city's prior decades of decline. He views the persistent problems of discrimination, unemployment, poverty and slums as products, in part, of Moses policies.
"Academics are always writing these articles attacking one aspect or another of the book," Mr. Caro said, shrugging off the criticisms.
He is especially emphatic on the racial issue. He recalled that Moses referred to minority groups and the poor as "the animals." His book recounts how Moses barred a rail spur to Jones Beach, then built low overpasses over many of the parkways to keep buses out. And when some buses with blacks circumvented those obstacles, they were given a hard time on required permits and were shunted off to more distant beaches.
"With past immigrant groups, the city always made this effort, with the Irish and Italians, to reach out and bring them into the fabric of the city," Mr. Caro said. "Because of Moses, that really was not done for 40 years" for black and Hispanic residents.
Mr. Caro himself voices mixed feelings about Moses. "I was awed by him, astonished by his intelligence, by his ability to see a whole vast area as a region," he said. Unlike anyone before or since, Moses was able to build many major projects, he said. "But I was also horrified to see the destruction in East Tremont," a Bronx neighborhood devastated by the construction of Moses' Cross Bronx Expressway.
"You knew you were in the presence of genius," Mr. Caro said, "but you also knew you were in the presence of a genius who had gone blind. He opened the Triborough Bridge, and it just made things worse for traffic. He opened the Whitestone, and it made things worse. He opened the Throgs Neck, and they still got worse. Then he wanted the next one at Oyster Bay. If he had his way, he would have built bridges every few miles all the way to Orient Point."
If Moses saw himself as society's great omelet chef, Mr. Caro took as his mission the examination of the shattered shells and broken yolks. "If you really want to show power in its larger aspects, you need to show the effects on the powerless, for good or ill -- the human cost of public works," he said. "That's what I try to do, show not only how power works but its effect on people."
The success of the Moses book unleashed Mr. Caro on an even bigger subject who wielded power on a national and even international canvas: Lyndon B. Johnson. He is several months from completing his third volume on Johnson -- the first two were award winners -- and a fourth installment awaits.
Mr. Caro, who turned 64 yesterday, still works hard but enjoys the comfort of a second home in East Hampton -- which keeps him in touch with Long Island's ever worsening traffic jams.
Some things about Moses remain a mystery -- why, for example, the man who built 416 miles of green, leafy parkways never learned to drive. If there is a Rosebud answer, it has been lost.
"As he became powerful, of course he was chauffeured everywhere," Mr. Caro said. "For him, driving was a different experience than for most of the rest of us."

HEADLINE: Hiding a Secret? Not From Your Garbageman

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: COPIAGUE

 BODY:
THERE is perhaps only one other professional who knows as much about you as your bartender. This stranger knows something about your spouse's morning habits; he knows the cuckold, the insomniac, the moneyed, the repossessed and the hammer-toed. He knows your brand of breath mint and he knows your shoe size.
This stranger is your garbage man. Specifically the suburban garbage man. And the suburban garbage man knows many things about you because he spends the dark hours of the day auguring your tea leaves and coffee grounds, piecing together your private life by the public disposal of your detritus. 
 "Pretty much we just lift it," says Pete Giammona, 32, a nimble-minded, nimble-footed sanitation man who has been driving a garbage rig for his entire adult life. "But we know more about people than the city sanitation guys because we're, like, intimate with their waste. Out here, it doesn't sit around in Dumpsters or big plastic piles, it sits in front of your house so there's no doubt about who it belongs to. And when you're lifting the same people's garbage over and over again, you start noticing things."
Mr. Giammona and his two-man crew comb the suburban streets of Babylon in a large Mack truck. They begin in dark morning hours when the drunks return home and the working stiffs climb into their leased cars, steaming mugs of coffee in hand.
What they hear in these boisterous good times is a quiet desperation enveloping the suburbs, a profound longing to be something more, at least a little bit more than your neighbor. And some go hungry in this pursuit, the trash men say.
"You see some guy's got a Lexus in his driveway, but his wife's making him TV dinners," Mr. Giammona says as a robed man who had forgotten it's Tuesday chases his truck down, trash bag in tow.
One unassailable economic postulate of the street cleaner holds that the better the times, the fuller the garbage cans. And the garbage man says you're creating more rubbish than ever, a certain sign of the high-flying economy.
The government numbers confirm his calculations. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, American households created 151 million tons of garbage in 1980, about 180 million tons in 1987 and 216 million tons in 1997 -- 1,600 pounds per person. And it is anticipated that 1999 will be a record-setter for refuse. And suburbanites with their nice lawns and two car garages, create most of the nation's waste.
"The more affluent, the more effluent," says Nick Artz, an engineer with Franklin Associates, an environmental consulting firm that crunches garbage numbers for the Federal Government.
Garbage men, of course, don't have the time to ruminate about your pecuniary habits, but they are catching a subtle whiff riding in on the economic winds. It is a scent hardly noticed by the cigar-soaked nostrils on Wall Street. Consumers are spending, but they're spending money they don't have.
"Let's put it like this," says John Chase, a gargantuan man who hangs off the back of Mr. Giammona's Mack truck and goes by the handle Chocolate Thunder. "You seeing this house here, they threw away a whole dinette set. You got the boxes that the new dinette set came in. It came from Wal-Mart, not Ikea. That says to me that they're trying to save some money because they already spent most of the money they had."
According to the latest economic data, people are still spending feverishly. But that same data support Chocolate Thunder's analysis -- people don't have much in the bank. The trash man's economic forecast slants toward the belief that people will become more parsimonious with their pennies, causing a downturn in the economy. And while Wall Street middlemen are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for their expert opinions in this area, the three men on a garbage rig are paid $15 an hour and charge no consulting fee.
A trash collector is not just an economist and a a demographer bundled up in muscle and topped off with a dash of Brut cologne. He's also a social worker.
Through the course of their route, the trash men will exchange greetings with a half-dozen elderly people. "Old people get lonely in the suburbs," Mr. Giammona says. "They're alone in their houses and a lot of them are too old to drive. Some days we might be the only people they see. And when they stop coming to the windows, you know something's wrong."
The sanitation worker almost always knows when Grandma has died. Whenever you see a couch tossed to the curb, an armoire in the alley, a settee in the street, it usually means that the matriarch has gone to meet the Maker.
"The grandson don't even care that he's throwing antiques away, he's just trying to empty the house out as fast as he can so he can sell it," Chocolate Thunder says.
As the sun begins to rise, the trash men gather around to inspect a lawn strewn with discarded bookshelves, clothes and cheap furniture. "Either the sheriff's been here, or they slipped out in the middle of the night," Mr. Giammona said. "Either way, they couldn't make the rent."
"Yeah, and they had babies too," tisked Chocolate Thunder in sympathy as he pitched a miniature sneaker into the maw of the compactor.
The suburban trash man knows where the immigrants live, especially the poorer ones. He knows that as many as five families live in a single family home so they can make the rent. "Rule of thumb is two people equal an extra garbage can," the shorn-headed Giammona says. "So when you're seeing seven or eight cans, you know there's a lot of people crammed in a house."
And then there is the housewife with the pill problem and two dozen cats. It seems like every subdivision has one, says Chocolate Thunder. "You can smell that house all the way down the street, and that's saying something, because I got my face stuck in the back of a garbage truck."

HEADLINE: The Market: Inventory Down, Prices Up

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
BY some accounts, the house on New Rochelle's Van Meter Fenway was a mess, the sort of home that should have gone for a relative pittance to anyone who was ready to stomach perhaps $100,000 in repairs.
The house, according to real estate agents, needed everything: a shoring up of its foundation, a new kitchen, new flooring, new landscaping, a hard-core paint job on the outside and a new roof to replace the one that had caved in over the screened-in porch. 
 In a less frenzied real estate market, the house might have taken a year or more to sell. But within a week of being listed at $265,000 early last summer, it had more than 30 offers.
Ultimately, the house sold for $335,000, and little wonder: In New Rochelle, as in many communities within the New York metropolitan area, homes for sale, many brokers say, seem to have simply vanished.
To be sure, the problem appears more severe in certain communities and for homes within certain price ranges. And real estate agents report that there are still houses that are taking months to sell, usually because they are unusual properties that have highly specialized features, or because they are seriously overpriced.
For the most part, however, the New York metropolitan area appears to be in the midst of an inventory drought that many real estate professionals say they have never seen before. As a result, they say, homes coming on the market are more often than not spurring bidding wars that frequently leave both buyer and seller gasping in disbelief. In New Rochelle, for example, overnight price increases of 25 percent are no longer uncommon.
"We're not negotiating here -- it's like an auction," said Hiedi Ross, a sales agent for the local Century 21 King David office. She said that one of her current clients, a couple who have a mortgage commitment of $650,000, can't seem to land a house because they are persistently outbid by at least $20,000 every time a house comes up within their price range.
"We've never seen the market like this," said Gerald Ziering, president of the Century 21 King David office. "In most markets you usually have an inventory surplus that keeps moving along with the market, but in this case the surplus was eaten up about a year ago, so now there's nothing that we're carrying forward."
Of course, much of the inventory crunch can be pegged to a strong economy, as well as years of relatively low interest rates. But real estate brokers cite other factors as well.
First, because of rising land values, new-home construction is virtually nonexistent in many areas of suburban New York and the city itself, especially the most desirable sections; for the same reason, many homeowners are deciding to stay put and renovate rather than move. A contributing but statistically untrackable factor, brokers and others knowledgeable about the market say, is that the flush economy is spurring homeowners, mostly in the suburbs, to try to sell homes on their own rather than listing them with a broker and paying a subsequent fee. Brokers, meanwhile, are reacting to the inventory crunch by increasingly asking that listings be considered exclusives rather than sharing listings with their peers.
All this has already fostered a mountain of anecdotes. There are tales of brokers who used to routinely have dozens of listings at a time but now are hard-pressed to come up with enough to count on one hand; open houses that have long lines of potential buyers snaking out the door, and brokers who are slashing commissions -- perhaps by half -- to get listings. There are stories of smaller real estate firms that have gone out of business for lack of listings, as well as sellers who have become so overwhelmed by multiple bids for their homes that they have whisked them off the market. And finally, there are examples of just how dispirited many potential homebuyers have become.
"For the last three sales that I've had, the first question I was asked was how long had the house been on the market," said Katy Anastasio, the founder of Anastasio Associates Inc. Realtors in Huntington, N.Y., which has been in business since 1980. "It seems that if a house is on the market for longer than a week, then people wonder if there is something wrong with it."
In some communities, the current inventory drought apparently has less to do with fewer houses coming on the market overall, and more to do with lightning-fast turnover, which has caused so-called standing inventory to reach dismally low levels.
For example, Linda Hodge, a broker at the Greenwich, Conn., office for Preferred Properties, said that brokers in her area actually had slightly more listings for single-family residential properties -- 1,910 listings versus 1,899 -- through the first eight months of this year than they did for the same period last year.
"It's not so much that inventory is low, as it is responding to market turnover," said Ms. Hodge. "It's a turnover situation because houses that were once just satisfactory are moving faster than before."
Ebie Wood, regional manager for Houlihan Lawrence in Pound Ridge and South Salem, N.Y., agrees.
"We probably have the same amount of homes coming on to the market as in the past, but now they're coming on at time where there are a lot of serious buyers who are not lingering when they see a house that meets their needs," she said.
Still, many real estate agents report that they are actually seeing far fewer listings than before. Moreover, they report that the drought doesn't appear to be tied to the fact that fall is a time when generally fewer houses go on the market. For example, Ms. Anastasio said that in her area, which is the north shore of western Suffolk County, there are currently only about 150 listings of houses for sale, as opposed to 350 at the same time last year. Ms. Ross added that over the last six months of this year, brokers in New Rochelle had only 182 listings, a number that traditionally would have been perhaps 500 or 600.
CERTAIN types of homes appear to be especially scarce. For example, a year ago, Evelyn Atanas, the founder of the 15-year-old Atanas Realty in Williston Park, N.Y., had some 20 homes to show in central Nassau County that were priced in the low $200,000's. But now her least expensive home is a "tiny" house in Mineola, for $249,000; most of her listings are priced at $279,000 or more.
In New Jersey, the supply of town houses and condominiums that are relatively close to New York City is especially tight.
"In a healthy market we would probably have about five months of town-house inventory, which means we would have 75 listings for every 15 reported sales," said Jacelyn Botti, regional vice president for Weichert Realtors in central New Jersey. "But now we have less than a 30-day supply of such homes, which means we have fewer listings than we do reported sales."
What about Manhattan?
In general, "we've been in a low inventory situation for years," said Lawrence Sicular, an appraisal analyst for Brown Harris Stevens, which handles mostly blue-chip properties. Nevertheless, Mr. Sicular added that supply -- relative to demand -- appears to be substantially tighter for certain types of properties versus others, and is now generally tightest for larger apartments, which have also experienced the largest price jumps over the last few years.
Since April, Mr. Sicular has conducted a monthly inventory survey for his firm of the most expensive sections of the Upper East Side and Central Park West. And he cautioned that his results are often based on relatively small sample sizes, because certain types of apartments for sale, such as prewar six-room units, are relatively rare to begin with. Nevertheless, in his most recent survey, taken last week, he found that there are now roughly 28 percent fewer Classic Six prewar co-op apartments -- with two bedrooms, a dining room and a maid's room -- for sale in those neighborhoods than there were in April. On the other hand, he said, the supply of similar postwar apartments in those neighborhoods has grown 110 percent, while the number of 1,500-square-foot or more lofts downtown has grown 34 percent since July.
In general, however, Mr. Sicular suspects that the inventory crunch in Manhattan has eased a bit since Labor Day, for seasonal reasons and possibly because a jittery stock market has put some potential buyers at bay.
In northern Manhattan, "We're in a situation where demand for one- to four-family homes has far exceeded supply," said R. Kenyatta Punter, the founder of a real estate firm with the same name. "We started to see signs of an inventory problem in the fourth quarter of 1998, and it's been a tight market since then."
As an example of how tight the situation has become, Mr. Punter, who is also president of the Greater Harlem Real Estate Board, said that open houses in his area now bring, on average, 50 to 75 attendees, whereas in 1997 attendance might have been 15 to 20 people.
"By Monday, it's not atypical now to receive 10 offers from an open house, whereas in 1997 you might solicit just two or three offers," he said, adding that the inventory crunch has also caused prices in his area to rise 20 to 25 percent since January. He said that a brownstone in the Hamilton Heights area near City College that had an asking price of $500,000 in February is now in contract for $625,000.
In the brownstone communities surrounding Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, and Park Slope, Christopher Thomas, director of the Brooklyn offices for the William May Company, said that there is currently less town-house inventory available, compared to last fall, but that the number of co-op apartments for sale has probably stayed about the same.
"The increase in prices here has been driven heavily by the lack of inventory," Mr. Thomas added. According to his figures, Brooklyn town houses that were selling for between $1.7 million and $2 million this time last year are now available for $2.3 million and up. As for co-op apartments, prices have risen, on average, some 15 percent since January, he said.
The inventory crunch may, however, be easing, according to Jeffrey G. Otteau, president of the Otteau Appraisal Group in East Brunswick, N.J., who said that a sharp drop in the number of sales contracts in New Jersey suggests that buyers may be resisting paying the higher prices.
Some of the buying resistance, Mr. Otteau said, is seasonal: Most local buyers tend to buy in the spring and summer months, so that they can move before school begins. Nevertheless, he added, his firm is now seeing cases of sticker shock.
"Buyers are looking at significantly higher prices for less desirable homes than what we had available six months ago, and that has created price resistance," he said.
Mr. Otteau added that the resistance helps explain why home sales in New Jersey -- as measured by signed contracts --- appear to have dropped dramatically since last summer -- some 40 percent -- as well as why prices appear to have peaked. By comparision, Mr. Otteau said, sales from the summer to the fall last year dropped between 15 and 20 percent, less than half the rate for this year.
THE only exceptions to the sharp drop in sales, he said, appear to be entry-level houses that cost less than $250,000, and homes in so-called secondary markets, those markets that consumers tend to settle for when they can't afford the more desirable primary markets. According to Mr. Otteau's figures, housing prices in New Jersey's primary markets have jumped between 15 and 20 percent over the last year, but they have risen only 5 to 10 percent in the state's secondary markets
Nancy Hodes-Stempler is a home shopper frustrated by the price jumps in her area, as well as the dearth of inventory.
Along with her husband, 2-year-old son, and brother, Ms. Hodes-Stempler now lives in a rented five-bedroom, three-bathroom house in Fresh Meadows, Queens. After four years of renting, the family is ready to buy a home. But Ms. Hodes-Stempler and her husband couldn't afford to buy the home they live in -- a house that went on the market this fall for $389,000 and that received a successful bid, for $375,000, in just two weeks. Nor can they afford anything else in Fresh Meadows.
As a result, the couple are now looking on Long Island, where they hope to find a home that costs roughly $300,000, to balance the higher taxes there.
Ms. Hodes-Stempler has seen dozens of houses since August, through a dozen different real estate agents. Still, she feels as though she is being shown the same recycled inventory. "Agents are acting like all their listings are fresh, but usually when they call, I've already seen the house," she said.
In mid-October, Ms. Hodes-Stempler did hear of one house that fit her needs: a four-bedroom Cape on a large lot in New Hyde Park that was listed for $299,000, and that would have had an annual real-estate tax payment of just $3,900. But by the time her broker was finally able to get her an appointment to see the house, it was too late: the owners had already accepted a bid. Still, Ms. Hodes-Stempler liked the house enough to send the owners a check for $1,000, to hold her own bid.
"It's not a mad land grab here, but it is sort of desperate," she said. As an example, she pointed to 30 or so real estate agents and their clients who were parked on the lawn of her rented home when she came home from work one day a few weeks ago. They were waiting to see a house that Ms. Hodes-Stempler thinks would have sold for roughly $100,000 less just two years ago.
Real estate brokers say Ms. Hodes-Stempler's experience isn't unusual. Indeed, they claim that many consumers have become unusually aggressive at getting the house they want.
Take the couple who attended an open house that Ms. Atanas, the Williston Park broker, recently sponsored in Mineola. The open house was for a three-bedroom Colonial that was priced at $235,000, a rarity, by any measure, in central Nassau County.
According to Ms. Atanas, the first day the house was on the market, its owners received three offers, all full-priced. In the end, however, the owners accepted a bid from a couple who refused to leave the house until they knew they had it.
Ms. Atanas called a mortgage broker that she works with, who pre-approved the couple's mortgage on the spot. Meanwhile, the couple arranged to have an engineer inspect the house Monday afternoon.
"The contract went out on Tuesday, and within a week it was signed, sealed, and delivered," she said. "That's how fast this couple worked."
Not every home is moving at such speed, of course. Ms. Wood, for example, can think of one home in northern Westchester that was recently put on the market by its owners -- an estate -- for $550,000, but which she thought should have been priced at $495,000. Soon after it went on the market, the house received two bids, for $480,000 and $485,000, but the estate turned both offers down. After several months of paying carrying charges for the property, however, the estate reduced the price of the home to $475,000, and eventually sold it for $450,000.
I N this market, if that house had been priced properly, it would have sold immediately," Ms. Wood said. "Sellers should remember that their home will probably sell for less than it would have sold for if it had gone to market at the right price, and while this is usually a real-estate truism, it's especially true in a very active market such as what we now have."
But Mr. Otteau also urges sellers not to get too greedy. Based on what he has recently noticed within the New Jersey real estate market, he thinks that homeowners who want to sell their homes over the next three or four months will need to price them more competitively than was necessary six months ago.
Meanwhile, Betsy Goss, a sales agent at Prudential Connecticut Realty in Darien, urges sellers to remember that the fall and winter months often bring in a different kind of buyer than do the spring months. "Often these buyers have been looking and looking, and are educated enough to know the market," she said.
What about buyers? Ms. Goss advises them to get preapproval for a mortgage before they start looking, and to come see the house as soon as they can with checkbooks in hand. As for Ms. Ross, the real estate agent in New Rochelle, she urges buyers to take a reality check.
"The reality is that the asking price no longer gets you the house," she said. "If it's a good house, you've got to go over that price immediately."

Avalon Joins New Roc City for New Rochelle Revival

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
WITH New Roc City, the massive entertainment and retail center in the heart of the downtown, up and running for a month, site work has begun on the next component of this city's revitalization.
Groundbreaking for the new element, a 24-story luxury rental tower, was held Oct. 19. At the ceremony, Mayor Timothy C. Idoni noted the huge infusion of private capital in the two projects. "That's $300 million in just two blocks," the Mayor said. 
 The city is pinning most of its hopes for revitalization on the 1.5 million square foot New Roc City, which is expected to draw crowds back into its downtown. The beige stone complex that replaced the old Macy's mall has its own Main Street and police station, and includes a 19-screen movie theater, an IMAX theater, a sports and entertainment center, a supermarket, three restaurants, a hotel, office building and health club.
About a block away, Avalon on the Sound, a 412-apartment building that is to rise across from the Metro-North train station is being built at an estimated cost of $95 million by Avalon Bay Communities, a real estate investment trust based in Alexandria, Va. "It's always been imperative to get people downtown," the Mayor said, "and the best way to do that is for them to live there."
A third major project, now in the planning stage, is the $15-million Intermodal Transportation Center, which is to replace the Metro-North and Amtrak train station. It is to include new bus and train terminals, as well as taxi and limousine stands.
"It will centralize all modes of transportation, which is extremely important to the Avalon Bay project as well as to office workers and for people using New Roc City," said Joseph Madonna, Commissioner of Development. "These three projects are the key components to the city's revival."
With Hillary Rodham Clinton in attendance at the groundbreaking, there were considerably more reporters on hand than would normally cover a routine groundbreaking. Security was tight, with Secret Service agents present and a full complement of police officers checking credentials and turning away even people with invitations, if they arrived too late.
This kind of attention would have seemed inconceivable just a few years ago when New Rochelle was having trouble seeing any project through to completion. Through the early 1990's, a string of developers tried and failed to remake the old Macy's mall.
Then in 1993, New Rochelle was in the running to be the world headquarters for Unicef, the children's-relief agency, which ultimately chose to remain in Manhattan.
Even the latest projects were slow to become realities, according to the Mayor. "Avalon was waiting to see what would happen with New Roc City," he said. "Now that it's open and doing well, it was time for this groundbreaking, the next thing."
At Avalon on the Sound, which will be the city's tallest building, apartments will range from studios to three bedrooms, with rents from $950 to $3,000.
Residents will have access to a health club, outdoor swimming pool, basketball court and community room at no extra cost. There will also be some shops and food services -- "the type of thing you'd expect, a place to get coffee and some conveniences," according to Frederick Harris, a vice president for development with Avalon.
The project here is one of Avalon Bay's few public-private ventures, according to Mr. Harris.
W E'VE worked out a 30-year payment plan with the city for the land and taxes on the property," he explained. "The payments are based on our net income, and it's no secret that it works out to be a lot less than if we were paying up front and were taxed at the full rate."
Despite its name, Avalon on the Sound will rise on Huguenot Street, about a mile from Long Island Sound. "Every apartment will have a bay window," Mr. Harris said. "And most will have Sound views. Also a large percentage will have balconies."
If all goes well with leasing, Avalon Bay will also build two additional phases with a total of 600 apartments. "But that depends entirely on the market," Mr. Harris said.
It also depends on the impact of the city's other projects, especially New Roc City. It has been attracting 35,000 to 45,000 people a week, according to Jeffrey Castaldo, executive director of real estate for the center. "We track that through movie ticket sales and number of dinners served," Mr. Castaldo said. "We expect that number to increase to 100,000 people weekly once we're fully operational."
One of New Roc City's major attractions, Mr. Castaldo said, aside from the movies, is its entertainment and sports center, which features two ice skating rinks and a climbing wall, as well as a motion simulator and virtual reality rides.
Another element in the center is an attraction called the Space Shot, a 235-foot free-fall ride. A health club and 120-room Marriott Residence Inn are expected to open next month and in December, respectively.
Mr. Castaldo said the extended-stay hotel would focus on guests who were relocating, on temporary assignments or in training programs. The suites will have one and two bedrooms, with fully equipped kitchens. "They're for people who want to stay one night or a couple of months," Mr. Castaldo said.
He said he still had 62,000 square feet of retail space after signing a lease last week with the Modell's sports chain for 18,000 square feet. He added that he has been talking to record and book stores and an "upscale" Italian restaurant and was now also actively seeking tenants for New Roc City's 100,000 square foot office building.
Now that New Roc City is almost complete, the city expects to turn its attention to the Intermodal Transportation Center, "which is especially important for the hotel," Mr. Madonna said.
The city has already received about $12 million from Federal and state sources to finance the transportation center. "We'd like to get a couple of million more," Mr. Madonna said. "We should have the first environmental studies completed in the first quarter of the year 2000."
In addition, the city just received $500,000 in Federal grants for the rehabilitation of North Avenue, the city's main north-south thoroughfare. "North Avenue connects to our waterfront, and after we've completed our work on the downtown, that's the next place where we'll turn our attention," said Mayor Idoni.

HEADLINE: Residential Life Is Returning to Atlanta's Downtown

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
BILL GOULD said he felt like an urban pioneer when he stepped through a kudzu-shrouded doorway and into what would be his new home nine years ago.
The 25,000-square-foot brick building dated to the 1880's when Standard Oil of Kentucky built it for a barrel-making operation; more recently it had been an automobile parts supply house and a junk dealer's warehouse. 
 Just beyond the backyard lay a railroad yard, while next door were other industrial buildings, also empty, also hidden by kudzu vines. And yet this industrial no man's land stood at the edge of a growing downtown.
Mr. Gould, a photographer, envisioned loft apartments, spaces for artists like himself to live and work in at a reasonable cost.
Now 39, Mr. Gould is a pioneer no more.
Hundreds of residential units, both in new high rises and conversions of industrial buildings , have been built in the last few years as developers have discovered a heady market for living in downtown Atlanta.
The two-square-mile downtown had long been overlooked in favor of fancier midtown addresses or the even-more elegant Buckhead area, both to the north. Families tended to trek farther out to suburban enclaves in neighboring counties, subdivisions that literally sprawl for miles across the landscape.
"It was scary out here," said Mr. Gould, whose Allied Factory Warehouse now includes eight apartments and work space for more than a dozen artists. "The area had almost returned to wilderness."
He was attracted to the site first by an intrinsic love of industrial buildings and then by a cobblestone street at the rear, a rarity here.
"The one thing about Atlanta that doesn't appeal to me is everything is new," he said. "We've been tearing down buildings since the Civil War."
To be sure, Atlanta is a place where new is revered. High rises were built only after smaller, older buildings were demolished in a steady progression beginning in the 1960's and continuing until the early 1990's. One of Atlanta's best-known companies, the Coca-Cola Company, left downtown in 1919 -- the year that Ernest Woodruff bought it for $25 million -- for a campus-like setting in midtown Atlanta.
But in 1976, the Cable News Network opted to buy a 1.5-million-square-foot building at the edge of downtown for its headquarters. The building is now nestled between two new civic-related developments, Centennial Olympic Park, built for the Olympics, and Phillips Arena, home to Atlanta's Thrashers hockey team and its Hawks basketball team. The arena was built by Ted Turner, founder of CNN; Philips Electronics North America paid for the right to have it named for the company and to have its huge sign on the building.
Since 1990, $1 billion has been invested in downtown Atlanta. Much of the money was spent on Olympics-related construction, such as the park and Turner Field, used for the Olympics and now home to the Atlanta Braves, and landscaping along downtown streets. In that same period, 2,690 housing units were built downtown, according to a report for the Centennial Olympic Park Area, a private, nonprofit organization founded to guide development around the 21-acre park.
One of the agency's first projects is a three-acre site at the northeast corner of the park that is to include about 100 condominium units, 200 rentals, retail spaces and, possibly, a children's museum. The agency paid $6.5 million for property, which is to be developed by a private developer sometime next year.
Meanwhile, across the park, Legacy Property Group expects to break ground next month on a 10-story residential condominium at the rear of the Embassy Suites Hotel. Called Centennial Park West, the units will range in price from $200,000 for 1,000 square feet of space with one bedroom to $1 million for 4,000 square feet and four bedrooms, according to John Pauli, an architect whose firm, Stang & Newdow, is designing the interior. The firm of May & Pinska of New York City designed the outside.
Most developers here credit the Olympics with not only making the city more attractive but also with spurring the first projects that brought people back to the city. Some of the games' sponsors subsidized projects to convert three downtown office buildings into apartments.
One, the 89-unit Metropolitan, once the home of the First National Bank, is now being sold as condominiums, ranging in price from $50,000 to $120,000. The other two -- the 65-unit Muses and 114-unit William-Oliver -- are still rental apartments, according to a report by Dale Henson Associates, a real estate consulting firm here.
"We have a mild to severe case of condo-mania," said Dale Henson, a real estate consultant here. "There is a frantic effort to get into the market before it gets too filled out or we have an economic setback."
IN addition to the office-building conversions, several industrial buildings close to Mr. Gould's property in the Marietta Street area have been converted into lofts and many of them have been sold as condominiums. The site of a former gasket manufacturer was turned into 30 units that sold for $145,000 to $337,000, while a seed company's building was transformed into 18 condominium units ranging in price from $137,000 to $240,000.
Mr. Gould said he had decided to rent out space because his development proceeded one unit at a time, without bank financing. Now that the renovation is nearly complete, he is considering selling the units as condominiums.
Another area seeing a surge in residential development is the Fairlie-Poplar neighborhood, once a high-crime area of bars and rundown hotels. Several buildings have been converted to loft condominiums, while the first new residential construction downtown in many years is taking place at what will be 123 Luckie Street, now the site of a parking lot. Prices for the 49-unit condominium will range from $190,000 for a one-bedroom to $550,000 for four bedrooms, said Mr. Pauli, the project's architect.
Mr. Henson noted, however, that while the market looked vibrant the actual number of units recently completed or under way is less than a thousand.
"How many does it take to create a community?" he asked. "There's not enough to create an environment that will make a difference," he said.
Living in a downtown like Atlanta's certainly poses challenges, Mr. Gould said. The area could be considered in its infancy for residents, meaning few restaurants open at night and only one grocery -- a Kroger Supermarket across the street from the State Capitol -- anywhere close.
Moreover, there is a perception that crime is worse here than in the outlying areas. But Mr. Gould, as well as city leaders, say that is perception, not reality. Reported crime has decreased since the police increased street patrols and put neighborhood precincts in storefronts across the city.
The city has made attracting downtown residents a priority as well. The need for a vibrant middle class was highlighted in a 1998 report issued by the Atlanta Renaissance Program, which called its absence "missing rungs in the ladder to progress." The report showed the city had become home to the poor and the wealthy and set goals such as improving education and transforming deteriorated areas to attract more middle-income families.
John A. Williams, chairman of Post Properties and president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, said the city was working hard to solve those problems so that it can be home to others besides empty-nesters, young marrieds and singles.
One element city leaders see as crucial to this end is keeping Macy's open on Peachtree Street in the heart of the city. Mr. Williams's company has offered to buy the six-story building, lease the ground floor to Macy's and put offices on the second and third floors and 150 residential units on the top three floors.
"The key to a vibrant downtown is people," he said. "The city is now very popular, a response to rebellion against sprawl that has infected Atlanta. The customer is making a choice to live in an environment different than suburbs."

Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
Mattie Grady-Smith, a lawyer, has been appointed to direct the county's Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunities program. Her appointment is part of County Executive Andrew J. Spano's effort to increase the number of women and members of minorities in the county's work force, Mr. Spano said.
Ms. Grady-Smith, 47, will earn $79,945 a year to promote employment opportunities, conduct a sensitivity training program for supervisors to deal with sexual harassment and conflict resolution and develop a program for Civil Service test preparation. 
 The percentage of women and minority-group commissioners and deputies has risen to 20 percent from 5 percent during Mr. Spano's term in office.
The County Executive has also revived the Hispanic and African American Advisory Boards and developed an economic development policy, which encourages participation by women and minority-owned businesses.
Of the county's 5,980 full-time employees in January, there were 3,844 full-time white employees, 1,539 black employees, 423 Hispanic employees, 164 Asian employees and 4 American Indian employees. (Employees may be represented in more than one group.) Of those, 2,803 were men and 3,177 were women.
Ms. Grady-Smith worked for the Department of Social Services from 1973 to 1991, when she was appointed to the Office of Risk Management, a position she held until 1995. There she handled medical malpractice and general liability claims at the Westchester Medical Center satellite office. From 1995 until her recent appointment, she worked for the Medical Center's Department of Risk Management. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: Bringing Out the Dead

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

DATELINE: PLATTSBURGH, N.Y.

 BODY:
IT was cold and dark in the cemetery where Latoya Franklin stood stone still, her arms clinging to a friend from behind. It was quiet, so quiet that the friend, Vern Witherbee, could hear Latoya's bones shake. They looked straight ahead. There was a squeak. Then Latoya jumped four feet backward, screaming bloody murder. Tears streamed down her face as huge gray rats scampered out of a coffin and across her feet, before disappearing into a hole.
Latoya, 17, a high school student in this upstate town, collapsed to the ground, shaking all over. When she regained her composure, her party of five continued on, passing ghouls feasting on corpses, scientists cooking bats and snakes, and blood gushing from a patient on an operating table as he was being hacked up with a cleaver. After 25 minutes and many more fits of screaming, the party emerged dazed into the bright light of a warehouse, outside the area where volunteer firemen had set up a house of horrors. 
 Across the country, as the veil separating the living from the dead is once again lifted during the Halloween season, the latest fright to capture the popular imagination is the haunted house designed not for children, but for adults.
With some costing around $1 million, and employing Hollywood-style special effects, live rodents and dozens of actors, the attractions are aimed at grown-ups who increasingly crave more graphic chills. A sign near the entrance of the Plattsburgh haunted house, which expected 4,000 visitors during its week of operation, reads, "Not recommended for children under 13." The children who did enter invariably bailed out immediately by a door designed for the purpose. Most were in tears.
"We made one adult gentleman go to the bathroom in his pants; need I say more?" said Brian Herkalo, one of the volunteers running the attraction, whose $3 admission price went to support local charities.
A Web site, HauntedAmerica.com, lists 3,000 haunted houses in operation around the country in October, up from 2,300 last Halloween season. Ninety percent of them are aimed at adults. "There are more adult haunted houses than there have ever been, entertaining millions of people," said Joe Jensen, a co-founder of the Web site and formerly the operator of a haunted house in Chicago that he said drew 75,000 visitors a season. "The haunted houses are becoming scarier and scarier. The audiences are demanding it."
Some fright factories are in basements or warehouses, with staffs of volunteers who build sets and impersonate ghouls to raise money for charity. But more often, they are profit-making businesses, which charge up to $30 for admission and are as elaborately constructed as theme parks, employing actors to ride "headless" on horseback through woods or a farm.
At Spooky World in Foxboro, Mass., four haunted houses sprawl over 60 acres behind Foxboro Stadium, home of the New England Patriots football team. The monthlong attraction was built at a cost of $4 million, tripling in size from last year when, at a more residential location, it caused huge traffic snarls.
On Oct. 23, 8,700 people visited Spooky World, most of them in their 20's and 30's. Linda Blair from "The Exorcist" and Kane Hodder of "Friday the 13th" have been celebrity guests. But the biggest star is probably Ruth Phelps, a k a the Mouse Girl, who smears her body with peanut butter and lets 200 mice run over her.
"She has been bitten, but she doesn't mind," David Bertolino, a co-owner of Spooky World, said. The Mouse Girl's one request is that she be smeared with smooth, not chunky-style, peanut butter. "The mice were eating the chunks off her face," Mr. Bertolino explained. "It wasn't an unreasonable request."
In Newton, Pa., a haunted house called the Dredd Funeral Home admits visitors in groups of 10. At one point, a guest mysteriously disappears. "It's eerie," said April Woodall, 41, a dean at the Academy of Vocal Arts, an opera training school in Philadelphia, who has visited three times.
The remaining "mourners" then enter a room to pick out a casket for their departed friend. But all of a sudden the missing visitor appears in a casket. "I don't like to be jumped up from behind and shouted 'Boo' at," Ms. Woodall said. "That's predictable. The good haunted houses give you something to think about a long time afterward."
Each year, owners and experienced visitors say, haunted houses have been getting more elaborate, with gorier costumes, more expensive special effects and scenarios that play mind games with visitors, rather than simply startling them. Buffs who travel far and wide to visit haunted houses, and experts like Mr. Jensen of the Web site -- collectively known as "haunters" for their passion -- say that Americans have a taste for more graphic fright because of popular entertainment like "The X Files" and Doom, the video game. This summer's hit horror movies, including "The Mummy," "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Sixth Sense," also seem to have swelled the audience this fall for haunted houses.
Lewis Cole, the chairman of the film division at Columbia University, said that horror as a genre is more in demand when the economy and politics are unroiled. "When everything is sort of stable, people want to see things that make them feel something," he said.
"If you think of the 50's and 'Psycho,' " he went on, "it was a placid time, yet there were all sorts of elements that were about to explode, and then you had the 60's." In that decade, there was plenty of excitement in the streets and screen horror was not so popular.
A subgenre of haunted houses, operated by conservative Christian churches around the country, depict scenes from hell with an express moral lesson: here is what awaits drug users, abortionists and homosexuals. They have sometimes stirred local controversy, and in late October, a church in Cedar Hill, Tex. that set up a Hell House depicting the high school murders at Littleton, Colo., landed in the national news for its perceived insensitivity.
The great majority of haunted houses are secular, and the frights they impart are intended to be thrilling, perhaps cathartic, but not moralizing. One of the most popular scenarios, duplicated by many operators, begins when visitors enter a crypt. They see an upright coffin, which is open, and suddenly a hand pushes them in. The floor of the coffin opens and the visitors descend by ramp into hell, where dead souls in ragged clothes cry out. Some have missing limbs, others have faces that look like they've been gnawed.
Mr. Jensen, whose Chicago haunted house was named Hades, used to study Aztec and Mayan traditions to plan new frights. "Their death legends are most graphic and least known," he said.
Other popular tableaus at haunted houses around the country this year include the following:
* The Black Hole, a tunnel that is spinning around you. It's pitch black and all you can see are the stars on the tunnel, spinning, spinning. It creates an extreme sense of vertigo.
* The Demon Puppets, eight-foot-tall creatures that lunge at visitors from the darkness.
* The Chainsaw, as held by a seemingly crazed person. "That still scares people the most," Mr. Jensen said.
At the Headless Horseman Hayrides and Haunted House in Ulster Park, N.Y., the owners, Michael and Nancy Jubie, have learned to ratchet up the frights each year. On their 45-acre farm, more than 25,000 people have visited in the five weeks preceding Halloween. They ride by wagon through fields unveiling the works of a fictitious Dr. Joseph Blight.
As the story goes, Dr. Blight, after many years of research in Madagascar, has been infected by an unknown spore, and now has plant and human DNA. He has created a new form of life that is half human, half plant. Participants visit his two homes, where his species live. In one room an angry half-plant, half-man punches a hand through a woman's chest, and it comes out the other side.
"We're sold out every night," Mrs. Jubie said. "Demand is greater than supply. But once Oct. 31 is over, people don't want to be scared. They turn their heads toward Christmas."
In the week leading up to Halloween, Oct. 31, the haunters have been out in force. Elizabeth LaBrake, 21, a community-college student in Plattsburgh, was waiting with two friends to visit the firefighters' haunted house.
"Plattsburgh is very boring," she said. "You need something to put you on the edge, to get your heart going."
A friend, John Akin, 20, had a different reason. "I just want to watch her freak out," he said.
And Latoya, the teen-ager who had fallen to the floor shaking when rats scampered over her feet -- they were mechanical, not real -- was still wiping away tears. Asked after emerging from the spook house if she would ever go through it again, she hesitated a moment, then answered, "Absolutely."

Chat: Alan to Bill to Trent, Janet to Bill, and Larry to Bob

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
IT was a busy week in Washington for politics and policy on economic and financial issues. Imagine that you could take a peek at the E-mail traffic among the big players. You might, or might not, have seen something like this. (And no, the addresses are not real.)
 
To: billc@whitehouse.gov
From: greenspan@fed.gov
Thank you, Mr. President, for letting me know privately that you will reappoint me to a fourth term as Fed chairman when the time comes next year. It will be a privilege to continue in public service and to seek to maintain the vibrancy of the Greenspan Economy -- I mean, Clinton Economy. 
 By the way, and I probably should have mentioned this earlier: We may have a situation developing here. This darned economy of yours is just tooting along like a freight train.
Though I've tapped the brakes a few times, I may have to apply a bit more force to slow things down. In fact, this baby may be so resilient that I have to keep raising rates into next year.
With your legacy already secure, I know this is of little matter to you personally. But your sidekick there is counting on strong growth, low unemployment and a fizzy stock market to carry him into the White House. So you might want to pass on to the Gore folks a heads-up that by next October or so, joblessness is likely to be rising and confidence sinking, and an opportunistic opponent might then be able to capitalize on one little economic pothole to suggest it's time for a change.
But then, I guess you already know how that works.
 
To: lott@senate.gov
From: billc@whitehouse.gov
Trent, I wanted to congratulate you for your part in our mutual effort to put aside the temptations of short-term partisan advantage and set the nation on a course of fiscal responsibility and prudent debt reduction.
You had me going there with that $792 billion tax cut for a while. What a jokester!
And I'm sure you understand that I was just having a little fun with those pesky liberal Democrats in the House when I proposed using the budget surplus to subsidize prescription drugs for everyone 65 and older. Big spending programs have never been my priority.
No doubt, the American people will reward both of us for our farsightedness in leaving the surplus largely untouched and improving the Government's long-term economic strength.
Because of our courageous decisions, we have given the country confidence that it will be able to deal with the problems that threaten the prosperity of voters not yet born.
By the way, I also look forward to working with you on the international issues that face us, you isolationist, nativist, never-had-a-passport hick who doesn't know his W.T.O. from his C.T.B.T.! :-)
 
To: gates@microsoft.com
From: reno@justice.gov
Congratulations on your company's stock becoming a component of the Dow Jones industrial average. Now every triumph on your part will lift the single most widely quoted indicator of the country's economic vibrancy to new heights.
Unfortunately, I suppose, it also means that more than ever, every piece of bad news about Microsoft will send investors into spasms of panic, undermining the economy and eroding the political support that has permitted the Clinton Administration to survive all the late unpleasantness.
Which brings me to this little misunderstanding about your Web browser and the exuberance with which you seek to share the fruits of your product development with consumers. Just because that judge is about to rule that you are a heartless monopolist intent on atomizing the competition -- I have no idea why my antitrust division put such ideas in his head -- doesn't mean that we can't quietly come to some agreement to keep Microsoft from being chopped up into 1,000 pieces.
As a sign of my sincerity, I have instructed the F.B.I. to purge all Netscape products from Justice Department computers. I would hope that your counteroffer would include options on a few hundred thousand shares for the charity of my choice.
 
To: rubin@citigroup.com
From: summers@treasury.gov
I knew there was a reason I spent countless hours locked in a room with Phil Gramm getting a deal on updating the laws governing the financial services industry.
It must have been to assure your employment with a financial services mega-conglomerate that can use the freedom granted to it under the new legislation to gain control over every aspect of personal and corporate finance in the United States and throughout the industrialized world.
Glad to be of assistance.
Just remember, though, that you're not going to be dealing with regular guys like me and Greenspan anymore. Unlike Washington, Citigroup is a viper's nest of competing egos and agendas, and it's pretty clear that you're there to play referee.
So if things don't work out for you at Citigroup, the latest polls suggest that I will be available to replace you once again, anytime after Jan. 20, 2001.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
Raising The Specter Of an Oil Shortage

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
JUST about a year ago, some analysts were saying oil prices could fall to $5 a barrel by year-end. Oil company executives told Congress that prices would linger around $10 a barrel for the next decade.
That was then. 
 Now, thanks to rising demand and discipline on the part of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Mexico and Norway, prices are north of $21 a barrel, double what they were last fall. Inventories are lean and winter is coming. Instead of $5, the talk is that by year-end prices could be around $30 a barrel, maybe higher. And some people have started to whisper about gasoline lines by spring.
Matthew R. Simmons, president of Simmons & Company International, a Houston-based energy investment bank, is one of those people. Only he's not whispering. He took some time last week to discuss what he worries may happen over the next six months. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
Q. For the last four or five years you have been talking about the potential for an increase in oil prices. We've had a spike this year, but you are still worried. Why?
 
A. I started getting worried about our vulnerability to an imbalance between supply and demand about four or five years ago, but I have never been as concerned as I am right now. Unless certain things happen, demand will outrace supply.
 
Q. What are the supply and demand numbers for oil?
 
A. The International Energy Agency estimates that in the fourth quarter worldwide demand for oil will be 77.2 million barrels a day, rising to 78.3 million barrels a day in the first quarter.
On the supply side, non-OPEC production, including natural gas liquids, is estimated at just over 48 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter, and will only inch up slightly from that level in the first quarter. OPEC is producing just over 26 million barrels a day.
The official thought is that there are enough inventories to cover this shortfall. As of the end of August, the I.E.A. estimated total Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development inventories were 2.69 billion barrels, and said stocks will be drawn down by 1.2 million barrels per day in the third quarter.
Now, the single biggest lack of knowledge in the petroleum industry has to do with stocks. Most of them are not usable. And the I.E.A. estimates on non-OPEC production, which assumes a 1.4-million-barrel-a-day increase between the second quarter of 1999 and the first quarter of 2000, are a joke, because nothing has been started yet on new oil projects.
Last week, five of the major oil companies reported their third-quarter results. On average, daily production at those companies was down 2.5 percent compared to a year ago. If it turns out non-OPEC supply is flat rather, then you have to add another 1 million barrels a day to the draw on stocks.
 
Q. So what happens if you're predictions about a shortage are right?
 
A. If OPEC sticks to its production quotas, which I think they will, and the winter is not as mild as the last couple have been, I am worried about a physical shortage that creates a violent price rise. In my view, most of our petroleum stocks are at the low end of anything we have operated with.
 
Q. How big a price increase could we see?
 
A. I am probably the only person in the oil industry who has never given a price forecast. But letting demand get ahead of supply terrifies me. If that happens you could get a price increase of at least $5 to $10 a barrel.
A big price increase unleashes all sorts of bad things . . . I think there are gasoline lines in our future, and Americans don't like gasoline lines. I don't know how we would handle gasoline lines now, because we don't have attendants at gasoline stations now, as we did in the 1970's.
 
Q. Since there are always stock drawdowns in the fourth and first quarters, if this jump doesn't occur in the next six months, will it not happen?
 
A. If it hasn't shown up by the end of March, it won't show up. And the pressure for a price jump will start to get significant by mid-November, when peak demand starts to kick in.
 
Q. From an investor's perspective, who are the big winners if your scenario plays out?
 
A. I think you would see a terrific spike in oil service stock price prices, companies like Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes. But with the run-up in oil prices into the $20-a-barrel range, they are going to do well next year anyway.
Clearly, profitability of all oil and gas companies will be helped by this, but the top 10 to 15 independent oil producers and the bottom 3 major oil companies will also be star performers.
We happen to need a lot more supply, and that means more exploration. But many of these companies have downsized and it will take time to gear up again.

HEADLINE: Mornings, They Like To Watch

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
EAST Side, West Side, all around the town, early-morning television is taking to the sidewalks of New York as never before -- sidewalks that have become, in effect, sound stages where cameras can capture the exuberance of nose-to-the-glass fans waving, shouting and reveling in their 15 seconds of fame.
Picture-window studios have become a New York phenomenon. Network executives say stations in other cities cannot afford to spend millions on studios the way the networks can, and besides, New York is the people-watching capital of the world, and the networks know it. Every aunt or grandmother who tunes in, hoping for a glimpse of a relative in the background behind Matt and Katie or Charlie and Diane or, starting tomorrow, Bryant and Jane, adds to a show's ratings. 
 "This breaks every rule in TV 101," said Robert J. Thompson, a professor of film and television at Syracuse University. "You're not supposed to take the attention off the business at hand, but when the business at hand needs a little push, the audience provides a vast and sometimes amusing unpaid cast."
And so ABC and CBS are trying to catch up to the "Today" show on NBC, which moved to a first-floor studio in Rockefeller Center in 1994. Ever since, "Today" has been showing off its standing-room-only sidewalk space -- and bragging about displacing "Good Morning America" for the lead in the ratings.
Imitation is the surest form of television; ABC moved "Good Morning America" into a glass-walled studio in Times Square last month. "Today" remains No. 1, but since "Good Morning America" began showing crowds on the lower level of its two-story studio and inviting a lucky few upstairs for consumer-affairs segments, its ratings have risen somewhat.
Tomorrow, CBS will move its newly renamed "Early Show" to Fifth Avenue and 59th Street, with world-famous hotels in the background. CBS is betting that its new studio will help make the network competitive in the morning for the first time since "Captain Kangaroo" went off the air a generation ago.
But not all the hotels are looking forward to the arrival of Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayton and their fans. The Sherry-Netherland Hotel went to court to block CBS's plans, complaining that the show would lead to too-full sidewalks and noise that could wake late sleepers at the hotel. "People will be waving and shouting and creating that fake Beatlemania-like sensation," the hotel said in court papers. A CBS spokesman would say only that the matter remains unresolved, but that the two sides have been talking.
The networks have spent heavily to show their viewers New York up close. NBC spent $15 million; CBS is said to have spent $30 million. MTV also broadcasts from studios with floor-to-ceiling windows. Its home, across Broadway from the new "Good Morning America" quarters, draws neck-craning fans hoping for a glimpse of their favorite veejay or, better, their favorite rock star. (The neck-craning is a must. Unlike the "Today" and "Early Show" studios, MTV's base of operations is on the second floor.)
"Obviously the success of the 'Today' show woke other television people up," said Steve Friedman, who was the executive producer of "Today" when it moved and now has the same job at its new CBS competitor.
Something else that woke up the networks' decision-makers was New York's surging popularity as a tourist destination. "New York is hot again," Mr. Thompson said. " 'Seinfeld' did this, 'Friends' did this, and they contributed to the idea that New York is the place to be. There was a sense a few years ago that you wanted to ignore New York, the symbol of all kinds of collapse, the inner city, the economy. That's all changed."
Out-of-towners find themselves peering in the morning shows' windows because there is not much to do at 7 A.M. The Statue of Liberty and the observatory at the Empire State Building do not open until 9:30.
For the folks back home, the streetscape provides an element that producers consider increasingly important -- "visual relief." Playing peekaboo with passersby gives viewers something more than just another glitzy set filled with people sitting around talking.
If two's company, Mr. Friedman's show will make an early-morning crowd. But he said the decision to put the hosts in front of glass was not about imitation. "The fact is that people expect more out of television than a studio that's supposed to look like somebody's living room or dining room and isn't," he said.
His counterpart at "Good Morning America," Shelly Ross, said the new studio provides a pool of people who can go on the show and or talk with consumer experts about why they buy what they buy or eat what they eat. "In the past," she said, "Good Morning America" relied on "handpicked friends of friends of friends" for such interviews.
But showing crowds on live television is not without risks. "When you see people holding up one finger, you wonder are they saying, 'You're No. 1,' " Mr. Thompson said, "or are they saying something else?"

HEADLINE: After Its Latest Facelift, A Younger, Sexier Dow

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE Dow Jones industrial average has long been viewed as the most prominent measure of the financial health of corporate America. Maybe now it should be seen as a barometer of how fast the economy is changing.
Last week the keepers of the Dow -- the editors of The Wall Street Journal -- announced plans to boot four perfectly respectable companies and replace them with younger and better-performing substitutes. It was the third time in the 1990's that such a thing had happened. All told, 11 of the 30 stocks in the Dow are new in this decade. 
 To find any comparable rate of change one must return to the 1930's, when the Depression-era economy was suffering a very difficult upheaval. Now Wall Street thinks the economy is going through an upheaval with implications every bit as great -- but much more pleasant -- for the economy.
The old economy, as reflected in the Dow industrials of 20 years ago, was dominated by companies that made things -- steel, cars, cigarettes, chemicals, oil and tires. The new Dow is dominated by companies in far different lines of work.
The Dow of the 1970's had three oil companies, two steel companies, one computer company and no financial firms. The new Dow has four computer-related companies, three financial behemoths, just one oil company and no steel makers. It has Walt Disney, Coca-Cola and McDonald's. But Alcoa is still on the list, and so are General Motors and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. The old America of heavy industry is still represented, but not nearly as heavily.
One sign of the magnitude of the change is that of the four companies that will join the Dow tomorrow, three of them -- Intel, Microsoft and Home Depot -- can trace their corporate lineage no further back than 1968. The fourth, SBC Communications, was spun off by AT&T (another Dow member) back in 1984 as part of the antitrust settlement that broke up Ma Bell. The companies they replaced -- Chevron, Sears, Goodyear and Union Carbide -- all joined the Dow in 1930 or earlier.
IT'S hard to underestimate the symbolic power of the Dow. Intel and Microsoft are emblematic of American dominance in the rapidly growing personal computer business. That image is better than the one created in 1985, when McDonald's joined the index, or in 1991, when USX, the former U.S. Steel, was tossed out to make way for Disney. Then there was talk that the new America meant hamburger flippers going to movies.
In announcing the changes, Paul E. Steiger, The Journal's managing editor, spoke of making the Dow "more representative of the emerging U.S. economy." But he also evidently wanted to stick to blue chips, companies that had proven themselves to be successful. There are no pure Internet companies in the Dow.
The pace of change in the Dow may reflect more than the speed of change in the economy. After all, the economy was changing from the 1940's through the early 1980's, even though there were few changes in the Dow during that period that were not forced by takeovers or financial distress.
One thing that is different now is that Dow Jones & Company makes money from fees paid every time investors buy options, futures and other securities based on the Dow. In recent years, the index has not risen as fast as its prime competitor, the Standard & Poor's 500, which includes 500 major American stocks and has a very heavy dose of technology stocks and a larger share of the market in stock index securities.
Had Intel, Microsoft, Home Depot and SBC Communications been part of the Dow since 1997, the index would have been the better performer. Perhaps such superior performance would have persuaded more investors to trade the Dow, rather than the S.& P.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Wishful Thinking"
If the Dow Jones industrial average had contained the four companies that are to be added to it tomorrow since March 14, 1997 -- the last time it was changed -- it would have reached almost 13,000 in July. Chart plots the Dow Jones industrial average (actual and revised) from 1997 to 1999.
 
On Oct. 1, 1928, the Dow Jones industrial average was expanded to 30 from 20 stocks. With the changes to be made tomorrow, only four companies (shown in bold type) remain from that list.

HEADLINE: One Internet, Two Nations

BYLINE: By Henry Louis Gates Jr.; Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the Afro-American Studies Department at Harvard University, is co-editor of Encarta Africana.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
After the Stono Rebellion of 1739 in South Caroli na the largest uprising of slaves in the colonies before the American Revolution -- legislators there responded by banishing two forms of communication among the slaves: the mastery of reading and writing, and the mastery of "talking drums," both of which had been crucial to the capacity to rebel.
For the next century and a half, access to literacy became for the slaves a hallmark of their humanity and an instrument of liberation, spiritual as well as physical. The relation between freedom and literacy became the compelling theme of the slave narratives, the great body of printed books that ex-slaves generated to assert their common humanity with white Americans and to indict the system that had oppressed them. 
 In the years since the abolition of slavery, the possession of literacy has been a cardinal value of the African-American tradition. It is no accident that the first great victory in the legal battle over segregation was fought on the grounds of education -- of equal access to literacy.
Today, blacks are failing to gain access to the new tools of literacy: the digital "knowledge economy." And while the dilemma that our ancestors confronted was imposed by others, this cybersegregation is, to a large degree, self-imposed.
The Government's latest attempt to understand why low-income African-Americans and Hispanics are slower to embrace the Internet and the personal computer than whites -- the Commerce Department study "Falling Through the Net" -- suggests that income alone can't be blamed for the so-called digital divide. For example, among families earning $15,000 to $35,000 annually, more than 33 percent of whites own computers, compared with only 19 percent of African-Americans -- a gap that has widened 64 percent over the past five years despite declining computer prices.
The implications go far beyond on-line trading and chat rooms. Net promoters are concerned that the digital divide threatens to become a 21st century poll tax that, in effect, disenfranchises a third of the nation. Our children, especially, need access not only to the vast resources that technology offers for education, but also to the rich cultural contexts that define their place in the world.
Today we stand at the brink of becoming two societies, one largely white and plugged in and the other black and unplugged.
One of the most tragic aspects of slavery was the way it destroyed social connections. In a process that the sociologist Orlando Patterson calls "social death," slavery sought to sever blacks from their history and culture, from family ties and a sense of community. And, of course, de jure segregation after the Civil War was intended to disconnect blacks from equal economic opportunity, from the network of social contacts that enable upward mobility and, indeed, from the broader world of ideas.
Despite the dramatic growth of the black middle class since affirmative action programs were started in the late 60's, new forms of disconnectedness have afflicted black America. Middle-class professionals often feel socially and culturally isolated from their white peers at work and in the neighborhood and from their black peers left behind in the underclass. The children of the black underclass, in turn, often lack middle-class role models to help them connect to a history of achievement and develop their analytical skills.
It would be a sad irony if the most diverse and decentralized electronic medium yet invented should fail to achieve ethnic diversity among its users. And yet the Commerce Department study suggests that the solution will require more than cheap PC's. It will involve content.
Until recently, the African-American presence on the Internet was minimal, reflecting the chicken-and-egg nature of Internet economics. Few investors have been willing to finance sites appealing to a PC-scarce community. Few African-Americans have been compelled to sign on to a medium that offers little to interest them. And educators interested in diversity have repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of minority-oriented educational software.
Consider the birth of the recording industry in the 1920's. Blacks began to respond to this new medium only when mainstream companies like Columbia Records introduced so-called race records, blues and jazz discs aimed at a nascent African-American market. Blacks who would never have dreamed of spending hard-earned funds for a record by Rudy Vallee or Kate Smith would stand in lines several blocks long to purchase the new Bessie Smith or Duke Ellington hit.
New content made the new medium attractive. And the growth of Web sites dedicated to the interests and needs of black Americans can play the same role for the Internet that race records did for the music industry.
But even making sites that will appeal to a black audience can only go so far. The causes of poverty are both structural and behavioral. And it is the behavioral aspect of this cybersegregation that blacks themselves are best able to address. Drawing on corporate and foundation support, we can transform the legion of churches, mosques and community centers in our inner cities into after-school centers that focus on redressing the digital divide and teaching black history. We can draw on the many examples of black achievement in structured classes to re-establish a sense of social connection.
The Internet is the 21st century's talking drum, the very kind of grass-roots communication tool that has been such a powerful source of education and culture for our people since slavery. But this talking drum we have not yet learned to play. Unless we master the new information technology to build and deepen the forms of social connection that a tragic history has eroded, African-Americans will face a form of cybersegregation in the next century as devastating to our aspirations as Jim Crow segregation was to those of our ancestors. But this time, the fault will be our own.

In Politics, Ethnic Posturing Isn't Simple Anymore

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
IT once seemed so easy. Toward the end of every mayoral campaign in New York City, candidates would head to the Lower East Side where, crowded in by cameras, they would eat a knish or a pastrami sandwich and talk about how much they loved Israel. Or toward the finish of a Presidential campaign, the candidates would turn up in the Polish section of Chicago for some kielbasa, a pro-forma denunciation of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and more photographs. This was ethnic politics in its most primal form, an unstated calculation that the most elementary of gestures -- a visit, a picture, a noncontroversial proclamation or two -- would produce a payback in the form of the "Jewish vote" or the "Polish vote."
Those days are suddenly looking very far away. Ethnic politics, which was never really as simple as some politicians believed, has reached a level of complexity that is suddenly confounding politicians across the nation. That has become especially apparent these days in what is arguably the first cauldron of ethnic politics in the United States -- New York -- with its race for the Senate between Hillary Rodham Clinton, the First Lady, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Mayor, a contest that seems to be providing an intricate road map of where ethnic politics in America is heading. 
 Of course, winning the Jewish vote in New York was never just a matter of eating a Kosher dill, just as capturing the Hispanic vote in Texas or California required more than the ability to spout a few lines in Spanish. But these days, candidates are forced to take positions on all kinds of complicated issues, pitting the perceived interests of one ethnic group against the sentiment of the larger population, or dividing members of purportedly solid constituencies by generation, ideology and economic class.
And these pressures are coming at a time when groups that once existed at the margins of electoral politics -- most of all, Hispanic voters, whose clout nearly rivals blacks in some parts of the country -- have become powerful forces, large in number, knowledgeable about issues and savvy in working the system. The idea of such constituencies as single-minded voting blocs, concerned only with parochial issues and subject to easy manipulation, is as much of a relic as Tammany Hall.
"You can't do tokenism anymore," said Lynn Cutler, a long-time Democratic operative who is now a White House adviser to Vice President Al Gore. "I think that maybe in all honesty the way we did it in the past wasn't respectful. It was like, 'I checked that box. I ate the knish.' There's less single-issue voting based on ethnic differences."
Representative Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx, the ranking Puerto Rican member in the House, said: "There was a time when all you had to do was get up and say a few Spanish words or eat the right Spanish food and you were an amigo. Now, the issues are much deeper."
In this sophisticated, new environment, it is no longer enough to take off, for example, on the three-I travel itinerary of Israel, Italy and Ireland in preparation for a New York campaign. Not long ago, Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton were forced to choose between what the Defense Department described as the nation's security over Puerto Rico and the concerns of local leaders about the island's safety when the Pentagon said it wanted to continue bombing practice there. (Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton chose Puerto Rico.)
Similarly, Mrs. Clinton is now pressed to take a position on an application before President Clinton to grant clemency to Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former United States intelligence analyst serving a life sentence for spying on the United States. Mr. Giuliani has demanded that Mr. Clinton free Mr. Pollard.
The most unsettling episode, at least for Mrs. Clinton, came over the summer after Mr. Clinton offered executive clemency to 16 jailed members of the F.A.L.N., a Puerto Rican separatist group that has engaged in terrorism. When he first made the offer, she tepidly endorsed it, and Republicans charged that the President had acted to curry support for his wife with Hispanic voters.
As an uproar erupted, Mrs. Clinton withdrew her support for clemency, and found herself besieged both by Puerto Rican leaders on one side and Republican critics on the other. For Mrs. Clinton, it was an unhappy introduction to New York ethnic politics.
What most mystified Mrs. Clinton's Puerto Rican supporters was why she said anything at all. Once upon a time, it might have made sense to reflexively adopt a position that many Republicans -- as well as a few independent political commentators -- argued was the obvious stance a Democratic candidate should take to capture this important constituency.
In truth, Puerto Ricans living in the United States are divided over whether the island should be independent. The F.A.L.N. has not been in the news for years, and many young Puerto Rican Americans know little about it. And even among those who know of the group, and support its goal of Puerto Rican independence, there is no evidence of widespread support for its tactics.
"It's complicated," said Joseph A. Wiscovitch, a political consultant who has worked on Hispanic issues for Democratic and Republican candidates, including Mr. Giuliani. "Some Latinos feel, why is all this energy being spent on F.A.L.N.? Why not spend it on education. You're talking about the silent majority." Even Mr. Serrano said he believes there was not much electoral benefit in his advocating clemency: "I don't know if that will get you a lot of votes."
Fittingly, Hispanics have attracted the most attention of the nation's politicians. This group of voters is at the leading edge of the changing dynamics of ethnic politics, outpacing blacks as a segment of the population, even if they remain, to date, a smaller part of the electorate, because of citizenship requirements and age, said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Nationally, Hispanics made up 5 percent of the vote last year, up from 3 percent in 1992. In New York City, they made up 20 percent of the vote in the 1997 mayoral race, compared to 13 percent in 1993.
But as a group, Hispanics are increasingly large and diverse, in terms of country of origin, ideology and economic class. If there ever was such a thing as a "Hispanic vote," it doesn't exist now. Hispanic voters, like many ethnic groups, are better informed than before. There are Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers. "We now have 24 hours a day the ability to get information in Spanish if we're not conversant in English yet," Mr. Serrano said. "There was a time that you couldn't get to know the issues because no one was covering them in the language that we knew."
Generational differences in the views of ethnic groups are also emerging. The single burning issue of one generation of immigrants, which made them vulnerable to easy appeals by politicians, has become merely one of many concerns for their American children and grandchildren. In Florida, older Cuban-Americans are as passionate in their opposition to Fidel Castro as ever; but that bitterness has not necessarily passed down to the next generation.
It was once unthinkable for a candidate in New York to support the creation of a Palestinian state, and Mrs. Clinton came under much criticism when she did. But Ms. Cutler, who is Jewish, said she has found that her own children, while extremely concerned about Israel, are not at all perturbed by the notion of a Palestinian state. "It is subtle, but that is the difference," she said.
So how does a politician respond to this changing dynamic? A clue can be found in the Presidential campaigns, where, not surprisingly, it can be hard to pass a campaign day without hearing an Anglo candidate speaking Spanish. At an appearance at a Hispanic banquet in Washington the other day, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has considerable experience in appealing for the votes of Mexican-Americans, boasted how he did not have to tailor his speech for this audience, because they already shared his values. He would not, he said, say anything special to appeal to Hispanics. And then, without a skipping a beat, Mr. Bush recounted how he can't go anywhere without someone asking him if he is going after the Hispanic vote.
"Por su puesto!" Bush said, using the Spanish for "of course."

The Last 100 Days

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
I don't know how Al Gore will do in the upcoming race. I think he's got a lot more substance than the press has given him credit for. But if Mr. Gore's candidacy does go down early, it could have one interesting side effect. It might actually free up the Clinton Administration to govern in its final months without worrying about politics. Having missed out on its first 100 days -- due to a variety of scandals and mishaps -- the Clinton Administration could be the first in history to be known for its last 100 days. Imagine if the President, unconstrained by any campaign, actually felt free to do only the right things in foreign policy with his last 100 days.
Here's the speech Mr. Clinton would give: 
 "My fellow Americans, I intend to use these last 100 days to make up for some of the mistakes in the previous 2,820. The first thing I will do is something I never did in foreign policy -- set some clear priorities. My last 100 days are going to focus on the two biggest relationships we have -- Russia and China -- because unless we manage those right, the rest won't matter. With Russia I did the wrong thing and with China I failed to do the right thing. Not anymore.
"Let's start with Russia. We never had it in our power to determine how the democratic experiment in Russia would come out. We did have it in our power, though, to make Russia a less dangerous place and a less angry and isolated place -- no matter how its experiment evolved. Unfortunately, driven by a need to win Polish votes in the Midwest, I opted to do just the opposite. We expanded NATO, which, in one fell swoop, alienated the Russian elites, undermined our moderate, pro-Western allies inside Russia, and so angered the Russian Duma that it refused to ratify the Start II treaty, which would have cut Russia's long-range nuclear arsenal in half. Madeleine and Strobe kept telling me we could expand NATO and get START II. But it never happened.
"The critics of arms control say: 'No problem. We don't need Start II. Our strength will protect us.' What these guys don't grasp is that it's not Russia's strength that threatens us. It's Russia's weakness. I'm not worried about Russia using a nuke. I'm afraid of it losing a nuke. The danger is not that a strong Russia will launch a missile at us, but that in a weak Russia one will fall off the back of a truck and end up in Iraq. And the way to reduce that threat is by making Start II and Russian integration in the West our top priorities.
"Therefore, on this eve of Russian presidential elections, I am announcing the following: The U.S. will support bringing Russia into NATO and the E.U. by 2010, provided Russia meets a specific set of democratic, legal, arms-control and economic criteria. Most of the top politicians in Russia today are just corrupt old Bolsheviks, but by the next election in 2004, you are going to have a new generation running that gets it. I want to empower these young Russians in their internal fights with Russia's old guard by laying out a clear, strategic pathway for them. I want these young Russians to know, and to be able to say, that if they make the right choices, Russia will get what it wants and what we should want -- that it become part of a free and undivided Europe.
"As for China, we don't have the power to transform China. But we do have the power to make it a more open, rules-based society. We have a great tool for doing that -- bringing China into the World Trade Organization, which would force upon it a set of legal norms, and a degree of openness, that would be unprecedented. With a W.T.O. deal, U.S. Internet firms would be much freer to invest in China and the Chinese would have many more ways to interact with the world -- without having to go through their government. I made a huge mistake last April when I let John Podesta, Gene Sperling and Bob Rubin talk me out of finishing the W.T.O. deal with Zhu Rongji when he was here. We could have had it. But after all the support we had gotten from House Democrats on the Monica thing, my aides didn't want to rile up the Dems and the unions by pushing through W.T.O. for China. So I let the deal go. I regret that, and I'm going to fight to get it back.
"You know, every time I did the politically hard thing -- Kosovo, Nafta, the Middle East -- I made history. And every time I did the politically expedient thing, I made trouble. I'm going to use these last 100 days to fix both China and Russia. And while I am at it, I'm going to lift the embargo on Cuba too. I never did like Florida anyway."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Candidates, Taking a Stand, Mix Policy and Persona

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H.

 BODY:
IT was once a sure-fire attack strategy in Presidential debates: Candidates turn to their rivals and scold them for espousing policies that are fanciful, shallow and even risky. "Where's the beef?" asked Walter F. Mondale, memorably needling Gary Hart during the Democratic primary campaign in 1984.
No one's asking now. The 2000 campaign has been marked by an extraordinary (if not mind-numbing) degree of substance. Candidates have issued more meaty 10- and 12-point plans, earlier in the season, than ever before in Presidential politics. The question is, will it pay off? Or are the voters more attuned to that elusive and much-trumpeted concept, character? 
 The dueling over policy pronouncements by Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley was on display last week at the first televised debate here at Dartmouth College. They eagerly plunged into a discussion of the intricacies of more funding for special education, health insurance for children and protections for homosexuals.
The leading Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush, has issued stacks of position papers (his recent education plan was 12 single-spaced pages) to fend off critiques that he is, in the parlance of his state of Texas, more hat than horse. But he doesn't talk about them as much, preferring to project a Reaganesque geniality and optimism.
To some degree, the candidates' handling of issues reveals their own approaches and personalities. Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley built their Senate careers on mastery of daunting matters like the environment and tax system overhauls. "He's equal part dreamer and policy wonk," Eric Hauser, a Bradley spokesman, said of his boss.
Mr. Bush, partly because he prides himself on not sweating the details, speaks more about grand themes that have served him well as Governor. He is, no doubt, mindful of polls showing that while most people are not paying much attention to the Presidential contest, those who do seem more interested in the candidates' personal qualities.
Still, by being substantive, candidates can achieve other goals. "There's an implicit Presidential aura to presenting six-point programs," said Anthony Dolan, a former Reagan speechwriter. "There's a subliminal message you send to voters: 'I have the will to govern.' " Some candidates use detailed policies to prove their bona fides with a narrow group of partisans and interest groups whose support is crucial in the primaries.
There is another practical explanation for so much substance so early: Because the primary schedule next year is the most compressed in history, the entire process is accelerated. Candidates who wait until January to issue proposals may be dismissed as too slow -- or imitating their rivals.
And in the past, candidates did not have to be so specific because the parties often set the agenda. During the cold war, the prescriptions for dealing with the Soviet Union were starkly different in both parties. Now that there are fewer differences -- and no overriding, burning issues -- candidates face greater pressure to define themselves through their distinct plans.
THE danger for politicians is they can get tripped up in the minutiae. Mr. Gore, relying on his vast experience in the White House and in Congress, has emphasized his command of the issues. But early this year he put out such a blizzard of issue papers that the Bradley camp ridiculed him for being bogged down in small-bore matters. He has tried to remedy that recently by mixing the policy with the personal.
Candidates complain that if they dwell on issues, the media ignores them and focuses on personality and the horse race anyway.
Mr. Bradley has also learned the down side of serving up too much detail. Refuting accusations that his proposals lacked heft, he boasted that he was going further than most politicians in setting a price tag -- $65 billion a year -- for his plan to make health care available to virtually all uninsured Americans. But in doing so, he gave Mr. Gore an opening that the Vice President happily seized upon last week.
"It may be a big idea." Mr. Gore said, "but it's not a good idea." Should Mr. Bradley makes it to the Democratic nomination, that line may well turn up in the Republicans' attack commercials.
Mr. Bush's advisers, as well as Mr. Bradley's, have urged their candidates not to be prodded into appearing like policy mavens. "Yes, a tax plan is important and, yes, an education proposal is important," said Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director. "But the specific percentage of a proposed tax cut is probably less important to the average voter than, 'Do I agree with this candidate's overall philosophy?' "
BESIDES worrying how their opponents will respond, candidates have to be mindful that voters do not always take detailed policy proposals at face value. When Bob Dole, the Republican nominee in 1996, issued the economic and political foundation of his campaign -- a 15 percent income tax cut and a halving of the capital gains tax -- polls showed that voters did not view it too seriously. That's because the Dole campaign publicly tinkered with several alternatives. It did not help that President Clinton's campaign distributed quotations to reporters in which Mr. Dole had belittled the supply-side economics that was central to his proposal.
A heavy emphasis on substance was first notable during the 1992 Democratic Presidential run by then Gov. Bill Clinton, former Senator Paul Tsongas and Senator Bob Kerrey. All sought to demonstrate their seriousness of purpose. Substance, indeed, was a way for Mr. Clinton to deflect questions about his personal conduct and assure voters that he knew how to fix the economy. One of his strategists, George Stephanopoulos, went as far as to say that "specificity is the character issue of '92."
Mr. Clinton, of course, never escaped questions about his integrity. In the current campaign, politicians who want to succeed him are again trying to use substance to prove their own character.
"Because Clinton was perceived to be a smooth operator, there's an extra motivation for candidates this year to show that that's not them," said Dan Schnur, communications director for Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is seeking the Republican nomination. "The way you do that is by flashing the policy credential. Bob Dole stood up and said, 'I have character.' That's not good enough. Policy is the prism through which voters judge character."
The emphasis on substance may seem like a public service. But the bad news is that the more candidates propose, the more they overpromise. Mr. Clinton had ambitious plans for his national service program that were scaled back after his election. Chances are, most of the heady dreams of campaign 2000 will never be more than dreams.

HEADLINE: Isolationism's Return

 BODY:
Isolationism -- the notion that American interests are best served by minimal involvement in foreign affairs and alliances -- has been a recurrent issue in American political debate. The issue has now resurfaced with surprising passion, with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and their senior advisers joining in an attack on those they call the "new isolationists." Their main targets are the senators who voted to kill the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but lately their ire has expanded to include almost anyone who has opposed military intervention in Kosovo, full financing of foreign aid and the repayment of America's $1 billion debt to the United Nations. For their part, Republicans have accused the White House of caricaturing honest differences of opinion on complicated issues.
This is the kind of exchange that can either degenerate into partisan name-calling or add something useful to what could be a healthy debate over America's role in the world as it approaches a new administration, not to mention a new millennium. The early signs are not reassuring. The White House argument -- that the test-ban vote proves that the G.O.P. has been hijacked by America Firsters -- ignores the fact that those voting no included such principled Republican internationalists as Senators Richard Lugar of Indiana and Olympia Snowe of Maine. The argument from some Republicans -- that the White House's squishy internationalism would make America hostage to utopian and unenforceable treaties -- is similarly overdrawn. 
 Historically, isolationism has taken different forms. But only once -- the years following the post-World War I decision not to join the League of Nations -- has it taken root for any length of time. Since then, isolationism has been regularly trumped by the pressure of world events. Pearl Harbor undercut the most virulent America Firsters, while the need for postwar reconstruction and the onset of the cold war trumped the opposition of Senator Robert Taft and other isolationist Republicans to multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and NATO.
The collapse of the Soviet Union, however, has created uncertainties about America's global role and given life to two quite different forms of isolationism. One is Patrick Buchanan's, a blend of nativism and protectionism that rests partly on a fearful assessment of America's ability to compete in a global economy. The other derives not from the insecurities that afflict Mr. Buchanan but, conversely, from a supreme self-confidence that America can go it alone, that its wealth and military power make international treaties unnecessary. This is the smug and shortsighted isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership, people like Trent Lott and Dick Armey.
This Republican insularity on Capitol Hill is all the more striking given that the leading Republican Presidential candidates, George W. Bush and John McCain, are both internationalists, as are Bill Bradley and Mr. Gore on the Democratic side. With the Congressional leadership frozen in place, the presidential campaign becomes an important arena for defining what sort of internationalism the United States should embrace, and where and when it should exercise its moral influence, its military power and its economic clout. These are fundamental questions. Today's furor over neo-isolationism will have served a purpose if it forces the leading candidates in both parties to engage them.
Indeed, as a number of analysts have noted, the real threat to America's tradition of global engagement may not be political but generational. An entire generation, the one just below George W. Bush's, is growing up with no connection to World War II and only the dimmest memories of the cold war. This generation is clearly comfortable with economic engagement abroad. The task for internationalists in both parties will be to make the case for an expansive world view that defines broader diplomatic engagement and leadership by the United States as necessary components of national security and global stability.

HEADLINE: An Island Bombing Range

 BODY:
A presidential panel created by Defense Secretary William Cohen recommended earlier this month that the Navy cease all training activities on the island of Vieques near Puerto Rico in five years. In the interim, the Navy would be allowed to use the island for live bombing exercises. That phase-out plan is not fast enough. The Navy should discontinue the shelling right now and promptly return the land to Puerto Rico.
About 9,300 people live on Vieques, a small island six miles off the coast of Puerto Rico. The Navy controls two-thirds of its 33,000 acres. Aerial bombing and naval gunfire over the past two decades have degraded the environment and stymied efforts to increase tourism and maritime jobs. Angry protests from local residents, who are American citizens, and the Puerto Rican government erupted in April when a civilian guard was killed at the Naval range in a bombing accident. Live fire exercises have been suspended pending a final decision by President Clinton. Meanwhile, Senators Charles Schumer and Frank Murkowski have introduced a bill calling for the immediate removal of the Navy from the island. 
 This controversy goes back to the 1970's, when the Navy ceased using the neighboring island of Culebra for weapons training after mortar fire landed on a beach where children were playing. Training exercises were transferred from Culebra to Vieques, despite intense opposition from the governor of Puerto Rico and the island community. In 1983, the governor and the Navy secretary signed an agreement in which the Navy promised to help with economic development, address safety and environmental hazards caused by the shelling, and keep the use of live fire to an absolute minimum.
The presidential panel found that the Navy has not lived up to those commitments. The percentage of live fire used in relation to inert ammunition actually doubled from the late 1970's to the 1990's. No real effort has been made to deal with noise and health concerns, and relations with the community have deteriorated.
The Navy says it cannot perform combined combat exercises anywhere on the East Coast. But separate components of the exercises, such as aerial bombing, artillery training and ship gunfire training, can be conducted at ranges elsewhere. The panel noted that the availability and convenience of Vieques may have influenced the assessment of other sites. The panel's recommendation that an alternative be found in five years suggests that military readiness need not be compromised by using other venues and other training methods. The people of Vieques should not have to wait that long before the Navy clears out.

In Panama, a Party But No Guests

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN the United States gave up its colonial ambitions and handed over the Philippines to the Filipinos in 1946, Harry S. Truman sent the living symbol of American power in the Pacific -- Gen. Douglas MacArthur -- to do the deed. When Richard M. Nixon returned Okinawa to Japan 30 years ago, he dispatched a man capable of teaching even Japanese politicians a thing or two about mixing business and politics: Vice President Spiro Agnew.
So here's the delicate diplomatic question of the moment for President Clinton: Who will lead the American delegation to the formal handover of the Panama Canal in December? 
 It's a good bet that Vice President Al Gore can think of better ways to occupy his time than posing for a photo-op surrendering the canal and the huge American military installations around it.
Some in the White House have mused about sending Jimmy Carter. After all, he was the President who signed the two treaties in 1978 to hand back the canal zone after 96 years -- and the one who assured the world that if things go bad in Panama, the American military still has the unilateral right to regain control.
When Panama's new President, Mireya Moscoso, visited Mr. Clinton recently to urge him to show up himself for the ceremony, Mr. Clinton said he was still thinking about it. (The Panamanians want to hold the ceremony in mid-December, after belatedly realizing that on the actual date of the transfer -- Dec. 31 -- people around the world will be busy with other celebrations.)
"I think it's fair to say there's some ambivalence around here about whether the President should go," one White House official said. It's no surprise. Giving up territory is never exactly popular; Queen Elizabeth stayed as far away from Hong Kong as possible during the handover to China in 1997, sending Prince Charles instead.
But in the case of Panama, the pain of surrendering 364,000 acres is eased by the fact that the main argument made by opponents of the treaty in 1978 -- that America was paving the way for Communist naval power to be extended out from Cuba -- seems a bit farfetched today.
Nonetheless, there is suddenly talk in the Senate of new threats to the canal, which handles five percent of world trade. Isn't Fidel Castro still in the neighborhood? And a host of conservative lawmakers have complained that the Hong Kong-owned company that runs the canal's container ports, where cargo is handled on the Atlantic and Pacific sides, could help China seize control of the canal. Congress just finished hearings on the issue, replete with secret testimony from the Central Intelligence Agency.
"Cuba and China have strong economic interests in Panama, but do not pose a threat to the security of the canal at this time," Gen. Charles Wilhelm, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, told a Senate committee. In fact, the Pentagon doubts the Chinese have the naval power to take Taiwan, a bit closer to its shores.
SO are the Panamanians thrilled with how the handover has worked out? Not exactly. Some politicians in Panama were clearly hoping that the United States would pay big money to lease back the bases, a business strategy that didn't count on the end of the cold war.
After lengthy negotiations, the Clinton Administration said no thanks. So that leaves Panama with a canal that is expensive to run and a big party in December -- to which Washington has yet to send an R.S.V.P.

HEADLINE: Senseless Congressional Cuts

 BODY:
The across-the-board federal spending cut approved by the House last week must have seemed to Republican leaders like a good way to send a message of frugality. Perhaps it was viewed that way by the 35 percent of Americans who, according to polls, think the G.O.P. Congressional leaders are doing a good job. But it makes no economic or budgetary sense to apply the budget knife to every program on the federal books just because Republicans want to score some political points. President Clinton is right to threaten a veto if the cuts get to his desk.
It says something about the budget-cutting frenzy that both leading Republican presidential candidates have distanced themselves from Congress's reckless handiwork. An earlier attempt to rescind part of a tax break for the working poor drew criticism from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Last week Senator John McCain mocked Congress for cutting meals-on-wheels while allowing a Congressional pay raise to go through. The pay raise was trimmed slightly, for appearances, but the point is still valid. Mr. McCain also questions why regular military expenditures are getting cut while Congress is financing planes and ships that the armed forces say they do not need. The reasons are the influence of campaign donors and jobs in the districts of powerful lawmakers. 
 The purpose of these budget cuts is to force Mr. Clinton and the Democrats to demand that they be restored with funds generated by Social Security payroll taxes. The Republicans then plan to run even more television commercials accusing the Democrats of "raiding" Social Security. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that even the House Republican budget plan taps the very Social Security revenues the Republicans claim are sacrosanct. After the budget-cut scheme passed, Speaker Dennis Hastert declared, "They said it couldn't be done." He was right. It wasn't done.
Both political parties have a challenge to meet here. The Republicans need to eschew mindless across-the-board cuts designed to embarrass the President and start serious negotiations on which programs deserve increases and which deserve cuts. The White House, for its part, must make clear how it would find the money to avoid spending cuts and also increase spending on teachers, police and the like. Mr. Clinton still maintains that revenues can be raised from a modest tobacco tax and other revenue steps, as well as some unspecified cost re-estimates. But the tax and revenue measures advocated by the White House have little support in Congress. They are the Administration's refuge right now from the need to be more clear on how to solve the budget disagreements with Congress.
With members of Congress looking to get out of town and go home, there is little time to wrap up the budget negotiations. Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida says the Republican and Democratic budget demands "are not that far apart" even though "we are far apart on the political rhetoric." The two sides need to go from the latter to the former before they can pass a budget.

A Pessimistic Forecast For Real Estate Trusts

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Shares of real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, are unlikely to recover anytime soon from the slump they've been mired in for the last 19 months, investors and analysts said at an industry convention in Los Angeles.
The deep pessimism comes even as the real estate industry enjoys some of its best times ever. An economy in its ninth year of expansion has office occupancy rates at their highest point ever, and rents are rising as much as 20 percent or more in some cities, like New York and San Francisco. 
 Some investors and analysts say rents and occupancy rates are leveling off and will continue to do so, especially if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the economy slows and demand for space cools off. That could all combine to slow REIT earnings growth.
"Things are so good now, they can only get worse," John Lutzius, an analyst at Green Street Advisers, a real estate research firm in Newport Beach, Calif., said at the conference.
Last year, the Bloomberg REIT Index fell 23 percent as concerns mounted that construction activity was accelerating, interest rates were rising and there were no more bargains to be had in the property market. In addition, a few high-flying REIT's, including Patriot American Hospitality and Meditrust, plummeted after aggressive acquisition strategies backfired.
This year, in addition to continuing concerns about rising interest rates, a new set of worries has taken center stage. Investors are concerned about slowing earnings growth and rising debt loads. The Bloomberg REIT Index is down 11.1 percent this year.

From the Economy, a Familiar Song

BYLINE: By PATRICK J. LYONS 

 BODY:
By now, everybody on Wall Street seems to know the lyrics by heart. Every three months the preliminary gross domestic product figures arrive, and right on cue the market analysts' glee club begins to sing, Another quarter of lovely growth, another quarter of moderate inflation, but who knows, it might end any day. The stock market duly applauds, and then recommences worrying about the next hint of wage pressure or flagging consumer demand.
 This time around, the brisk 4.8 percent pace of economic growth came at the end of a week of generally favorable earnings news, and equity markets in the United States and abroad reacted especially favorably to the news. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained more than 5 percent for the week to close at 1,362.93, and the Nasdaq did about as well. The Dow industrials lagged a bit behind, despite this week's shakeup in the index's roster that removed four venerable but pokey stocks to make room for younger and sprightlier companies like Microsoft and Intel. 
 Bond markets heard the same happy song, with yields falling steadily during the week. The dollar lost a bit of ground against the Japanese yen but strengthened against European currencies. PATRICK J. LYONS

HEADLINE: Bosnia Has Achieved Peace but Not Ethnic Unity, a Study Finds

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Four years after the fighting stopped in Bosnia, an international study group has concluded that Western efforts have failed to realize the driving principle of the Dayton accords: a single, multi-ethnic country.
A lengthy paper released by the International Crisis Group, an independent group consisting of former national leaders, diplomats and analysts concerned with the Balkans, paints a bleak picture of Bosnia as a place divided into three ethnic entities propped up almost entirely by Western economic assistance. As aid begins to drop, social and economic tensions will increase, threatening the tangible success of peace, the report says, urging more robust action by outside governments to get what they want in Bosnia. 
 The hard tasks in Bosnia -- insuring the return of refugees, reconstruction, building an economy -- have been largely overshadowed in the last year as attention focused on the war in Kosovo and its aftermath.
The assessment by the group, which was formed to monitor events in the Balkans and is chaired by former Senator George Mitchell, coincides with other assessments of what has happened in Bosnia, where NATO troops have been deployed since the peace accord reached in Dayton, Ohio, on Nov. 21, 1995 was signed that December.
Not all conclusions are as grim as those of the Crisis Group. In the coming issue of Foreign Affairs, the journal of the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York, two former Clinton Administration officials, Ivo Daalder and Michael Froman, argue that Bosnia remains deeply divided, with corruption and ethnic politics dominating society. But Mr. Daalder and Mr. Froman give credit for the reconstruction that has taken place in Sarajevo and elsewhere, and praise the fact that most people in Bosnia do not fear for their safety.
Like the Crisis Group, Mr. Daalder and Mr. Froman state that peace is the main accomplishment, but argue that peace in itself is probably a sufficient achievement for the outsiders who intervened to stop the three-and-a-half year war.
The architect of the Dayton accords, Richard C. Holbrooke, who is now the United States representative to the United Nations, wrote in a Sept. 14 Op-Ed article in The New York Times that "many of the forces of darkness -- separatists, racists, war criminal and crooks -- are still there, continuing their efforts to keep the people in the Dark Ages."
The White House has been more upbeat. In July, the Clinton Administration said that the "rate of refugee returns in Bosnia is exceeding that of the past two years." However, only about 8,000 people returned to areas where they are in the ethnic minority.
The Crisis Group said that the ability of refugees to return to homes they fled during the 1992-95 war was the key measure of whether the accords were working. On this score, it concluded, they have failed.
The Crisis Group report said the failure to get refugees back home bodes poorly for Bosnia's future, predicting that the longer the absence from home, the more likely it would become that refugees would resort to violence against local authorities preventing their return.
One of the most troubling prospects was the likelihood of reduced economic assistance from the West. "The inability of donors to hold out the promise of aid could cause local leaders to be even more noncompliant than now," the report said. Social unrest could increase, especially since unemployment is already very high and pensions continue to be unpaid.

HEADLINE: As the Battlegrounds Shift, the Draft Fades in Europe

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: TAVERNY, France

 BODY:
Nicolas Dombroski, an 18-year-old mathematics student, was not happy at having to spend his whole Saturday at the French Air Force base here learning about what soldiers do.
"It's a waste of time," he said of the movies and lectures that filled the morning and the afternoon. "I didn't even listen." 
 One reason that Mr. Dombroski did not have to pay attention was the fortunate timing of his birth.
As Europe strives to build nimbler, lighter armies, France is among the nations that have dropped conscription. Mr. Dombroski and the 40 other young men at the Air Force base had only to be informed about the army before departing again, with hair still long, and, in some cases, body jewelry still attached.
French men born after Jan. 1, 1980, no longer face an obligatory 10 months in the army. Like Britain and the United States before it, France plans to have an all-volunteer armed force by 2002.
Spurred first by post-cold-war cuts in defense spending and more recently by superior American technological and logistical performance in the NATO air war over Kosovo last spring, Europe wants more agile, better equipped armed forces. Conscription-based armies, heavy with tanks and artillery designed to defend against invasion, are becoming a thing of the past, with Spain and perhaps Italy set to follow the French example. Soon, among the big Western European countries in NATO, only Germany will continue the draft.
Mindful of the German militarism that caused two World Wars this century, Germany still views conscription as an instrument of democratic civilian control over the military -- as the Americans and, for two centuries, the French did before it. But now many European military planners and commanders see the draft as an obstacle to the slimmed-down, technologically advanced, rapidly deployable forces that the allies are trying to build to deal with trouble spots far from home -- the main mission that NATO is planning for in the 21st century.
The 20th century mission was territorial defense. But the last threat of outside invasion vanished with the Soviet Union, and that has changed everything for allied armies.
Marianne, the French version of Uncle Sam, still wants you all right, but only for a day. And military recruiters hope you remember the day fondly enough to come back as a volunteer.
"If I didn't have a diploma, I'd think of volunteering," said Louis Gautron, a 19-year-old economics student who got his baccalaureat last year, entitling him to go to a university. "I had no idea how many job skills you could learn in the army."
He spoke midway through the "call for defense preparation day" that was held here and at 247 other sites around the country on Oct. 9. There have been 58 of these days since the first one a year ago. Not all are on weekends, and none are held in the vacation months of July and August. Starting next April, young French women will also be required to come spend a day learning at least a little about the military.
In the first year, 514,664 young men heard what the army had to say in these sessions, which also involve a test of reading comprehension. Roughly a third of them, according to French military surveys, would be interested in coming back at least once to learn more.
Military recruiters hope these sessions will make it easier to fill their volunteer quotas. The slimmed-down French armed forces of 2002 will still need 357,183 people in uniform -- 259,299 if the members of the gendarmerie, a national police force under the Ministry of Defense, are not counted. There were 500,000 people in the French military in early 1996, when President Jacques Chirac announced the new plan.
"We've been reducing by roughly 30,000 draftees a year," Defense Minister Alain Richard, a member of the Socialist Government that inherited the plan in 1997 from Mr. Chirac's Gaullists, told local elected officials at Taverny. The air base, at the edge of a suburb northwest of Paris, has no airplanes but a large underground command center in a bunker.
The local mayor had a question for Mr. Richard familiar to any American Secretary of Defense: "Is the base at Taverny going to be kept open after the transition?"
Mr. Richard smiled. "I don't know what my successor 20 years from now will do," he answered, "but for the foreseeable future, I want to keep all large installations near big cities open, because we'd need them if we had to build our forces up again some day."
Britain and the United States believe that their all-volunteer forces contain units that are more easily mobilized and sent on expeditions like the NATO-led peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. The reliance on conscripts meant that some continental European countries took far too long to get their forces on the move for Kosovo, French military officials believe.
"The British and the French are the only countries in Europe that have readily deployable forces," Mr. Richard said. With changes in the structure of its armed forces, Germany, too, might have them in 10 years, he said.
"But some countries took two months to send troops to Kosovo," he added, referring to some smaller NATO allies.
European defense ministries were shocked by their own slow and cumbersome reaction and by technological gaps with the United States that the war over Kosovo revealed.
Mr. Richard explained, in answer to a question from one of the youths called up for the day, that American planes had flown most of the bombing missions because the United States could get its aircraft there faster than most of the Europeans could. Reorganizing European defenses, he and other officials said, will shorten reaction times, and volunteer professional soldiers and reservists will be easier to move on short notice than draftees.
Part of the French plan would create a 50,000-strong reserve to reinforce the regular army, as National Guard units do in the United States.
Britain also designed a reserve flexibility into its system when it moved to all-volunteer forces in the early 1960's, with a Territorial Army of 40,000. A strategic defense review last year, aimed at reorganizing and redesigning British armed forces to make them more rapidly and easily deployable to places like Bosnia, Kosovo and now East Timor, allowed for an increase in the planned size of the army in 2005, to 114,000 soldiers from 109,000.
"Moving from conscription to volunteer forces, you find that for the same amount of money, you can get a much more effective and easily deployable fighting force," said Lord Gilbert, until this summer a minister of the British Defense Ministry.
Spain, like Britain and now France, plans to abolish the draft by the end of 2002, and to reduce its armed forces to about 168,000 by 2003, from 175,000 now. But Spanish Defense Ministry officials said that, with about three-quarters of the 300,000 Spanish men who come of draft age every year never actually spending a day in uniform, there were discussions about ending conscription even earlier.
Germany, where 40 to 45 percent of the young men called choose alternative civilian service as firemen, paramedics, orderlies and the like, is the only major Western European country still committed to maintaining the draft. Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping has repeatedly supported conscription, which was adopted, along with ways of teaching soldiers when it is correct to disobey orders, when Germany's allies allowed the country to rearm in the 1950's.
One reason for keeping the draft, some officials say, is that Germany's social services and hospitals may have to shut down if they suddenly have to do without all those volunteers doing alternative service.
Italy's Parliament is considering a bill to reduce the size of the armed forces over three years. Now numbering 280,000 men, of whom 136,000 are draftees, the armed forces would drop to 200,000 volunteers -- including, for the first time, some women.

HEADLINE: Argentines Get a Peek at Government-to-Be

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 30

 BODY:
As a candidate, President-elect Fernando de la Rua refused to debate and kept his speeches vague. But as his administration begins to take shape a week after his election, he is preparing Argentina for sharp cuts in public spending and revealing an open style of governing full of trial balloons and freewheeling public debate among his advisers.
From their headquarters in a downtown hotel, Mr. de la Rua and his aides are sending out suggestions that the Government's fiscal health is in more serious jeopardy than they had feared. 
 Jose Luis Machinea, who is poised to become Economy Minister, has publicly disputed the departing Government's estimated 1999 federal deficit of $5.1 billion, saying it will be more like $5.7 billion and could balloon to $10 billion next year unless harsh austerity measures are taken.
But even as Mr. de la Rua appears to be preparing the country for economic policies that are sure to disappoint the left wing of his coalition, he is shifting moderately left in foreign affairs, moving somewhat from President Carlos Saul Menem's close alignment with the United States toward a more isolationist posture closer to that of traditionally nonaligned Latin American countries like Brazil and Mexico.
Showing a knack for symbolism in foreign affairs, Mr. de la Rua chose election night to announce that the first country he would visit as President-elect was Brazil in order to begin easing trade tensions.
The next day, he publicly advised Paraguay's former army chief, Gen. Lino Oviedo, who took political asylum here after charges that he masterminded the assassination of his country's Vice President last March, to find a new home outside Argentina. His presence here has caused tensions between the two neighbors.
And in an interview with the Mexican newspaper Reforma, Mr. de la Rua said Argentina would no longer contribute troops to multinational peacekeeping operations. Should he hold to this view, it would be a break with President Menem's commitment of troops for peacekeeping operations in Cyprus, Haiti and the Balkans and a return to Argentina's traditional policy of neutrality and nonintervention.
But Mr. de la Rua has made it clear that he has no intention of breaking with the United States. After receiving a telephone call from President Clinton, Mr. de la Rua said on Friday, "I told President Clinton we would work together for peace and against drug trafficking."
Mr. de la Rua, who is currently Mayor of Buenos Aires, has until his inauguration on Dec. 10 to organize his administration, and he is not expected to announce his Cabinet for several weeks. But by taking several foreign policy stands and appointing several planning teams immediately after his election, he has partly dispelled the popular impression that he is plodding and indecisive.
"It's a very orderly transition so far," said Rosendo Fraga, a historian and political analyst. "It looks like this will be the first time since 1916 that one President passed power to another of an opposition party without a crisis."
Hints are emerging about the style of the de la Rua Government, which promises to be a sharp break from the glitzy and mercurial ways of the Menem administration. While Mr. Menem made snap decisions that sometimes surprised his Cabinet ministers, Mr. de la Rua appears to be consulting with a wide range of political groups to reach consensus before making decisions.
He also seems to be returning to a traditional tool of Argentine governance abandoned by Mr. Menem: the use of the trial balloon to test the waters on controversial matters or subtly bury policies supported by some of his backers.
Early this week, Mr. de la Rua publicly instructed his economic team to study imposing a one-time windfall profits tax on companies privatized under Mr. Menem. The proposal brought down the stock prices of utilities for a couple of days, but it was cheered by the Frepaso Party, a social democratic group that is the junior partner in Mr. de la Rua's governing coalition.
But only a day later Mr. Machinea, the Economy Minister in waiting, shot down the idea. Analysts noted that the seeming flip-flop served a useful purpose. Because of his social democratic credentials, Mr. Machinea was in the best position to disappoint the left wing of the coalition. At the same time, his action perhaps improved his standing with foreign investors who are still wary of Mr. Machinea because as the central bank president in the late 1980's he presided over a devastating currency crisis.
In still another break with Mr. Menem, who preferred his two Vice Presidents to be seen but not heard, Mr. de la Rua has allowed his Vice President-elect, Carlos Chacho Alvarez, to speak his mind.
Mr. Alvarez, a Frepaso leader, publicly pressed Mr. de la Rua to appoint the losing Frepaso candidate for Governor of Buenos Aires to a Cabinet position. Mr. de la Rua did not respond to the pressure, but he let Mr. Alvarez continue to speak out on a variety of issues with no apparent repercussions.
"We're going back to a more subtle style of Argentine politics," noted Felipe Noguera, a leading political consultant.

HEADLINE: Family Values, or the Lack, At Issue in a Tight Election

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: BILOXI, Miss., Oct. 28

 BODY:
Only three states had governors' races scheduled this year: Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi.
The Louisiana contest last Saturday turned out to be a bit of a political yawner when Gov. Mike Foster, a Republican, easily brushed aside 10 challengers to win a second term. 
 And the Kentucky contest, on Tuesday, looks like another yawner, because about the only thing in doubt is by how much Gov. Paul E. Patton, a Democrat, will win re-election.
Then there is the Mississippi contest, also on Tuesday. This one is different.
It looks to be close, with final polls showing the two top candidates, Lieut. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat, and former United States Representative Mike Parker, a Republican, running neck and neck.
Then there are the issues.
For years, candidates for governor in Mississippi have been debating what to do about the state's persistently low-ranking schools and its persistently low-paying jobs. Mr. Musgrove and Mr. Parker are no exception.
But the biggest issue may be the phantom issue: Kirk Fordice, Mississippi's current Governor.
Mr. Musgrove and Mr. Parker are not running against just each other. They are also running against Mr. Fordice, using him as a foil, without mentioning him directly, for competing campaign pitches and feel-good television commercials that focus on family values, one of the hottest political issues of the late 1990's.
Certainly no issue is hotter in conservative Bible-belt Mississippi.
In recent months, Mr. Fordice, a Republican who is not eligible to run for a third term under state law, has been making headlines with his efforts to divorce Pat Fordice, his wife of 44 years, so he can marry an old high school flame he has been publicly courting. He wants Mrs. Fordice to decamp the Executive Mansion (she refuses to go), and he has had a number of loud and unpleasant exchanges with reporters assigned to cover him.
Many Mississippians, Republicans as well as Democrats, say that they are fed up with the story of marital infidelity in the Executive Mansion, coming as it has on the heels of the one of marital infidelity in the White House (Mr. Fordice called frequently for President Clinton's resignation). They say they are embarrassed for their state.
John Grisham, the Mississippi lawyer turned best-selling novelist, is a Musgrove supporter. But he said the other day that "after eight years of Kirk Fordice" just about any "decent person" of whatever political ilk would do as a successor.
"Right now," Mr. Grisham said, "Jesse Ventura would look good, or Hulk Hogan, or anybody."
Just as Mr. Musgrove and Mr. Parker are trying to outdo each other over how much more money to pour into Mississippi's schools and what bait to use to lure more high-paying industries to the state, so they also are trying to outdo each other when it comes to their commitment to family values.
When Mr. Fordice showed up the other day for a Parker fund-raiser, at which Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was the headline speaker, he was given a seat in the back row, as good a measure as any of how much distance Mr. Parker is trying to put between himself and the Governor.
When Mr. Musgrove and Mr. Parker campaign, their wives often accompany them, standing prominently on the podium. Both candidates are running television commercials featuring family members.
One of Mr. Musgrove's advertisements shows his son, Jordan, in a classroom, raising his hand to ask a question. Another has Mr. Musgrove chatting warmly with his wife, Melanie, and their daughter, Carmen Rae.
In his campaign speeches, Mr. Musgrove talks of "tax relief for families" and of how better schools make for stronger families.
Several of Mr. Parker's advertisements show him fishing and hunting with his children and talking to his mother about dirty campaign tactics. In another, he tells of courting his wife, Rosemary, and at the end, gives her a loving hug and says:
"She's smarter than I am and I'm smart enough to know that. I think she'd make a great First Lady."
At times, Mr. Musgrove, who is 42 and from Batesville in the northwestern part of the state, and Mr. Parker, who is 50 and comes from Brookhaven in the southwest, sound in their speeches and commercials as if they are delivering each other's campaign spiels, perhaps no great surprise given that Mississippi is one of those Deep South states in which Democrats are more and more coming to resemble Republicans.
In a televised debate here on Monday night, Mr. Musgrove said, "We have to improve our schools and upgrade our economic policy."
Mr. Parker countered, "What Mississippians want is good education and good-paying jobs."
Of course, the two men have their differences.
Mr. Musgrove accuses Mr. Parker of voting to cut health and Social Security benefits while in Congress. Mr. Parker, who did not run for a sixth term last year, counters that he voted only to balance the budget and calls Mr. Musgrove's accusations "disingenuous" campaigning.
"It's almost as if they're giving the same message with a slightly different spin on it, nuanced a little for their particular constituents," said Joseph Parker, a political scientist at the University of Southern Mississippi.
Over all, Mr. Parker has been hitting the family-values issue harder than Mr. Musgrove, particularly in his television commercials. Any discernible results?
When Mr. Parker started his campaign early last summer, he trailed Mr. Musgrove by a dozen or so points in the polls. Since then, he has steadily closed the gap and in the most recent survey was several points ahead of Mr. Musgrove, although the race was still essentially a dead heat.

HEADLINE: Pro-Business Senator to Head Vital Environmental Panel

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
For the first time since Congress began passing landmark environmental laws three decades ago, the critically important Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is about to be headed by someone who wants to make those laws more friendly to business.
There are two candidates for the chairmanship to replace Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, who died on Sunday. But whether Republicans choose Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire or James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, they will break the environmental mold filled by Mr. Chafee, and before him by Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, Quentin Burdick, Democrat of North Dakota, Robert T. Stafford, Republican of Vermont and Jennings Randolph, Democrat of West Virginia. 
 The change is another measure of how the Senate's Republicans have evolved over the years. The original conservation movement was a Republican concept early in the century, and over the last three decades Republican support was central to a bipartisan committee. Today the environmental movement considers none of the remaining nine committee Republicans an ally.
Republican leaders and Senators Smith and Inhofe declined to discuss the committee or their environmental views this week, saying it would be inappropriate before Senator Chafee's funeral today. But policy statements made available by the pair's staffs clearly describe them, and their records are well known.
Senator Smith, for example, has strongly supported a revision of the Superfund law that would shift the responsibility for paying for cleanups away from polluters. And he has said that although the "environmental movement of the 1970's served a purpose," the challenge of the future "will be how to encourage the protection of our environment without jeopardizing economic growth and overburdening taxpayers."
Mr. Inhofe has been a frequent antagonist of the Environmental Protection Agency over the regulations of the Clean Air Act and the quality of the science behind its views. And he accused the agency of "turning jobs into endangered species," especially in the coal industry, through its efforts to limit particulates in the air.
Their differences in tone and voting record from Mr. Chafee are deep. The League of Conservation Voters, which gave the Rhode Island Senator a lifetime achievement award this month, rated his votes as correct 70 percent of the time over his career. For Mr. Smith, the rating was 36 percent and for Mr. Inhofe, 7 percent.
Under ordinary circumstances, there would be no question about who would succeed Mr. Chafee. Mr. Smith joined the committee when he was elected to the Senate in 1991, Mr. Inhofe when he arrived four years later. And seniority governs chairmanships.
But in some amorphous way, Mr. Smith has been out of the Republican Party since July 13, when he announced he was converting his hapless Presidential bid into an independent candidacy and said "the Republican Party is more interested in winning elections than in supporting the principles of the platform."
He is now seeking to rejoin the party and will probably be taken back in. But Republicans may hold his three months in the wasteland against him when it comes to a valuable chairmanship, though they left him in the thankless position as chairman of the Ethics Committee.
In recent years, even when Mr. Chafee did not have the votes in his committee or confidence about a bill's prospects on the Senate floor, he had a chairman's prerogative of simply pigeonholing it, as he did with the House's 1995 effort to rewrite the Clean Water Act. Neither potential successor is likely to do that.
One business lobbyist said on Friday of Senators Smith and Inhofe, "They would probably be more supportive" than Mr. Chafee. She added, "They have been very big supporters, especially Inhofe, of making sure regulations are based on sound science and weigh costs and benefits."
From an opposite perspective, Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said: "John Chafee was an architect of most of our environmental laws. The next person is going to use more of a wrecking ball approach."
Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, would not predict the next chairman's course. But Ms. Browner said it was time for Congress to reauthorize and modernize laws like the Clean Water Act, last overhauled in 1987, and Superfund.
The contenders have different styles. Mr. Inhofe is a satisfied veteran of the partisan wars of the House. Mr. Smith is easier to work with, but can be stubborn.
One environmental lobbyist here, Dan Weiss of the Sierra Club, said, "It wouldn't be surprising to see an environmental feeding frenzy launched by Mr. Smith, or especially Mr. Inhofe," whom he dismissed as a "spokesman for the oil industry." Mr. Smith, he said, at least came from a state that was "on the receiving end of pollution" and had constituents who were concerned about the environment.
Although environmentalists worked hard to defeat Mr. Smith when he ran in 1996, they would plainly prefer him to Mr. Inhofe. When Mr. Smith served in the House from 1985 to 1990, he actually voted with the League of Conservation Voters two-thirds of the time, like most New England Republicans.
"There is something there we could hopefully build on," Ms. Callahan said. Moreover, the environment is an issue for New England voters, and if Mr. Smith runs again in 2002, he is likely to face strong Democratic opposition, something Mr. Inhofe need not worry about.
Representative Sherwood Boehlert of Utica, N.Y., an environmental leader among House Republicans, said it was clear that "either one would be dramatically different in approach to environmental issues as compared to Chafee."
But Mr. Boehlert said the change might not make as much difference as it would have a few years ago, because House Republicans had become much less eager to take the political risks of changing environmental laws than they were at the height of the Gingrich revolution of 1995.
Mr. Boehlert said it was becoming clear on all sides that the "American people want us to protect the air they breathe, the water they drink, the food they eat."

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Gentler Look at the U.S. World Role

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the White House's acrid defeat on a treaty banning nuclear testing, President Clinton declared that the Republicans in Congress are now driven by a reckless "new isolationism." The Treasury Secretary charged Congress with "malign neglect" of America's obligations. The national security adviser accused Republicans in Congress of pursuing a "survivalist" foreign policy.
But within days of delivering these broadsides, Administration officials began to backpedal. Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury Secretary, said in a speech that economic isolationism "does not spring from a single party or agenda." Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said that he did not intend to label all opponents of the weapons treaty isolationists or to tar the entire Republican Party with the label. 
 "I don't want to reduce this to Republicans versus Democrats," Mr. Berger said in an interview. "But there are serious issues and we ought to talk about them. We are at the pinnacle of our power," he said, adding, "are we going to seize this opportunity to lead the world, or are we going to pull back?"
Ostrichism and nativism will always be found in American politics. But the debate, many foreign policy experts say, is about what form of internationalism makes sense for an unchallenged superpower.
After the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was spiked, Mr. Clinton noted that a majority of Republicans wanted to delay consideration of the treaty rather than kill it outright, as a determined minority of Republicans, with the blessing of Trent Lott, had done.
These lawmakers reject the isolationist label, but their views could fairly be characterized as unilateralist. They believe that by agreeing to the treaty the United States would be foolishly risking America's nuclear superiority over an unverifiable arms control regime.
By casting the entire Republican Party as captive to its isolationist wing Mr. Clinton alienated those Republicans who believe the United States has global obligations but who question the Administration's strategy for meeting them.
"These attacks are both dangerous and bad judgment," said Robert B. Zoellick, Under Secretary of State in the Bush Administration and an adviser to George W. Bush, the Texas Governor and presidential candidate. "That pattern is to brand all opponents as isolationists. It's not only inaccurate, it runs the serious risk of undermining the larger case for America's engagement in the world."
Mr. Zoellick believes the American people today favor an active role but prefer to leave the terms of engagement up to the President. He believes that Mr. Clinton has squandered the opportunity. But Republicans are also to blame, Mr. Zoellick said, for letting distaste for Mr. Clinton to cloud their judgment.
Republicans like Senator Richard G. Lugar, a moderate from Indiana, , agree. "The President and the national security adviser have attempted to use the word 'isolationist' as a political attack word," Mr. Lugar said. Mr. Clinton has resorted to name-calling rather than making a good-faith effort to narrow "differences of opinion in how the United States should be engaged in fulfilling its international goals," he said.
Certainly, there are Republicans -- and former Republicans, like Patrick J. Buchanan -- who argue that the United States need not sully itself in the Balkans or East Timor, nor participate in the mushy do-goodism of international bodies. But there are Democrats as well who opposed American military intervention in Haiti and Bosnia and who question the value of free trade.
There is a long tradition -- in both parties -- of mistrust of foreign entanglements and multinational organizations.
Democrats overwhelmingly opposed intervention in the Persian Gulf in 1991 and voted heavily against the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993. For decades during the cold war, Republicans opposed internationalism, preferromg robust military spending and unilateral intervention in conflicts from Southeast Asia to Central America.
But the larger discussion since the end of the cold war is not about treaties or trading arrangements, but about the American identity and national purpose.
It is a debate that predates the republic and that George Washington addressed in his Presidential farewell in 1797, warning against "permanent alliances." (It was Jefferson who warned of "entangling alliances" four years later.)
The debate has been renewed after every major conflict, from the War of 1812 to World War II.
"One side believes the United States is exceptional and unique, unique because it is isolated by the oceans and uncontaminated by foreign influences," said Michael J. Hogan, dean of the College of Humanities at Ohio State University. "They believe that the more the country enters into entangling alliances, the more likely it is that it will be corrupted."
The other side argues that while the United States is singular, Mr. Hogan continued, "it has the mission to spread the blessings of American liberty to people around the world."
That tension was largely stilled during the cold war. Congresses and Presidents, from Truman to Reagan, shared a broad consensus on the need to pay the price of advancing liberty around the globe, although there were deep and even violent disputes on where and when to use American troops. That consensus has now broken down.
"It was much easier during that era to rally the public and the Congress to engagement under the banner of containment," Mr. Berger said. "But with the end of the cold war, it is tempting to some to want to pull back, but it is equally dangerous. There is a range of threats out there that will affect America's prosperity and security."
Republicans mostly agree, but their quarrel is with the Administration's approach. They do not want to see American troops under United Nations command. They believe that Europeans should take the lead in the Balkans. They think that global treaties infringe on American sovereignty. And they resent the charge of isolationism.
"The reality is, we've got a President who very few people up here trust and, on the Republican side, very few like," said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. "He's never gone out of his way to develop any kind of relations up here, and this is all coming home now."

HEADLINE: New Orleans Casino Swaggers Past the Doubts on Opening Day

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The first of the nightly Mardi Gras parades wound its way through a vast new windowless casino on Thursday night, its costumed stilt walkers dancing past the carefully re-created French Quarter and Garden District, past Pete Fountain and his clarinet and buffet tables heaped with jambalaya, but hundreds of people never even looked up.
If it was merriment they wanted, the old playground of the real French Quarter was only steps away, outside the building. But in their high-stakes games of baccarat and blackjack, they had found a new, more absorbing form of adult entertainment in New Orleans, and the city is fervently hoping that they bet again and again, 24 hours a day, every day of the year. 
 "Mississippi, watch out!" cried Mayor Marc H. Morial in a ribbon-cutting warning to the nation's other casino homelands, just before the new Harrah's casino opened its doors to the public late Thursday. "Las Vegas, watch out! Atlantic City, watch out! Harrah's New Orleans is here to stay."
Full-scale gambling, in the city's first permanent land-based casino, has indeed come to New Orleans, wedged perfectly into a large downtown lot between the French Quarter and the Mississippi River, a few blocks from the convention center. But the Mayor's need to make an audacious declaration of permanence underscored just how difficult it has been to get those doors open, and how much of a risk has been taken by the city and the casino's owner.
No one really knows if the 11 million tourists who visit New Orleans each year will want to gamble, or if the extravagant evocation of the city's flamboyance inside the walls of the $345 million Harrah's will distinguish it from the growing glut of riverboat casinos, Indian casinos and resort casinos around the country. No one knows whether it will settle into the city's business landscape as a major employer and attraction, or whether it will in some way alter the delicate character that has drawn visitors to New Orleans for ages.
Gambling's recent history in the city has raised some doubts about its future. The State Legislature first approved a single land-based casino in New Orleans in 1992, a few years after it allowed riverboat casinos, video poker machines and a state lottery. While Harrah's began building its permanent structure in 1995, it opened a temporary casino in the city's Municipal Auditorium, to great fanfare. Before seven months were out, the owners realized that revenues were only a third of the necessary $33 million a month. In a humiliating bankruptcy, the temporary casino closed in November 1995, and work on the new building halted.
Harrah's now says the failure was the result of the auditorium's out-of-the-way location, next to a public housing project, and says the new casino's premier site and opulent interior will improve its fortunes. But three riverboat casinos that were moored near downtown have also failed, raising the question of whether New Orleans can ever be a wholehearted gambling town.
"People don't come here to gamble," said Raphael Cassimere Jr., a history professor at the University of New Orleans who is an expert on the city's past. "They come here for a convention, or to go to the restaurants and the French Quarter. The big gamblers go where there are lots of casinos, like Las Vegas or Atlantic City. I think it's far from settled whether this casino will succeed."
During the reorganization of the local holding company that owns the casino, of which Harrah's Entertainment Inc. is a 43 percent shareholder, several large casinos opened on the gulf coast of Mississippi, drawing heavily from nearby New Orleans. Those casinos, as well as those in Nevada and Atlantic City, have something the local Harrah's does not: luxurious attached hotels, restaurants and nightclubs that add a sense of entertainment to gambling. To get past the objections of New Orleans's powerful restaurateurs and hoteliers, the Louisiana Legislature required Harrah's to build a stand-alone casino, with no attached rooms and limited food service. (A nightclub may eventually open in the building's second floor.)
It also required $100 million in state tax payments every year and more than $10 million in annual rent to the city. Gambling analysts say the casino will have to make about $260 million a year to pay its taxes and its 2,800 employees, which translates to 14,000 patrons a day losing an average of $50 each. That revenue projection is about half of what a major casino like the MGM Grand in Las Vegas takes in every year, but 14,000 gamblers a day would equal fully half of New Orleans's daily tourist population.
The economic burden is heavy, and Harrah's officials, who will manage the casino, acknowledge feeling handicapped by the taxes and rules, compared with the relatively free hand they have at other casinos. But they are nonetheless convinced their investment will pay off.
"We may not have an attached hotel, but we have something the others don't: New Orleans," said Gary W. Loveman, chief operating officer of Harrah's Entertainment. "We're a virtual monopoly here, and we're the only casino between the East Coast and Nevada with facilities for our high-end customers."
Beyond the casino's three elaborate Mardi Gras floats, wrought iron balconies and hand-painted murals are lush private rooms for gamblers willing to spend $10,000 or more a day on card games, craps or $500 slot machines. The 100,000-square-foot casino is already adjacent to the city's most expensive hotels -- whose rooms will be reduced in price for high rollers -- and nationally known restaurants are not far away.
Underlying the hope for the casino is a general sense that New Orleans, with its bars, jazz clubs and loose-limbed spirit, already attracts people who might be prone to gamble.
"Let's face it -- New Orleans is not Orlando," said Warren Reuther Jr., who owns several paddle-wheel tour boats and other tourist enterprises downtown. "It's already perceived as an adult city, a let your hair down and have a good time place. It won't be easy for them to make money, but I think New Orleans is their biggest hook."
Less than a third of the casino's revenues are expected to come from local residents, Mr. Loveman said, meaning the casino will have to entice millions of the conventioneers and other visitors who come to city for other reasons. Some of the tourists gawking at the starlit purple ceilings today said that they might very well spend a few hours playing some of the casino's 2,900 slot machines, which, as in most casinos, dominate the floor. Thousands of visitors, in fact, crowded into the building on its opening day.
"Why not?" asked Dr. Morton Weyler of Westbrook, Conn., who was in town with his wife on a group tour. "It's all part of the fun."
But skeptics fear that the city is sacrificing a slice of its authenticity to pay for government services without raising taxes.
"Instead of people enjoying the real sights of New Orleans, they're asking people to go inside a closed building and look at a fake New Orleans," said C. B. Forgotston Jr., a lawyer who has been an outspoken opponent of the casino and who predicts it will eventually beg the state to reduce its tax burden. "Why would anyone do that? And if they did, they would just take money away from existing small businesses. It's no way to run a government."

HEADLINE: 1999-2000 N.B.A. PREVIEW;
The Sprewell Weave Of Love and Hate

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Juror No. 1 was struck by how Latrell Sprewell's fingers curled long and thin like water from a drinking fountain, how his array of eye glasses and finely crafted braids made him look bookish but hip, how respectful and nonthreatening he appeared as the defendant in a civil trial almost four weeks ago.
During courtroom breaks, he paced in his tailored suits, stopped by a stroller to visit his newborn son and made eye contact with everyone he spoke to. It was easy for some of the jurors to be enamored of his presence -- and for most of them to be won over. 
 "To me, he was cocky, but I have to say, when he's sitting there, he's a beautiful-looking guy," said juror No. 1, Nancy Hurwitz-Kors, who was against the California jury's favorable decision toward Sprewell when they ordered him to pay $105,000 to the two plaintiffs who were seeking close to $3 million after being injured in a March 1998 automobile accident.
"If he had come across differently," Hurwitz-Kors said, "if the jurors had been afraid of him, it might have been a different outcome, but they weren't afraid of him. He probably worked at that."
And yet, finding forgiveness seems to come so easily for Sprewell. Despite each transgression, he has not only gained acceptance from the Madison Square Garden fans who crave his frenetic playing style, he has accepted a five-year contract extension with the Knicks worth $61.8 million. In delicately handling their star, management is willing to look the other way on his behavior, cross its fingers on his troubled history and bet that a team with Sprewell can find its way to the National Basketball Association finals again.
Last year, their public relations risk paid off. Since the Knicks made the trade for Sprewell last January, he has parlayed his flaws into a fortune, turned his mistakes into a marketing strategy while creating a popularity that has crossed racial and economic boundaries.
"I'll have a businessman come up to me and say, 'My son wants his hair done like yours,' " Sprewell said after a recent workout. "I'm like, what have I started here? But I think it's great that people are open and not afraid to try a different idea, even if it's just a hair style.
"For me, I'm not trying to be different or make any kind of statement," Sprewell said. "I just don't want to be like everyone else."
He is distinct in style, original in substance. But in many ways, Sprewell stands before you like an inkblot, something different to everyone. To some, he's the menacing figure on the floor, the sinewy player in the No. 8 jersey who growls and flexes like a cartoon action figure. To others, he is the soft-spoken star who is refreshingly honest about his missteps. Yes, he missed training camp for an impromptu road trip. Yes, he should have called. But this is who he is, no apologies.
"I was pretty much the same way as a kid," Sprewell said. "I can remember there were things I wanted to do -- things maybe my mother didn't want me to do -- and even if they would get me in trouble at times, I would do them anyway."
This is not exactly the desired behavior trait consistent with the team concept Coach Jeff Van Gundy emphasizes at every practice, team meeting and film session. But Van Gundy -- who caught the glaring stare of Sprewell as he stewed on the bench last year and who wasn't always pleased with his star's takeover mentality -- doesn't see him as a disciplinary problem.
"I don't think he has ever shown a lack of respect for me in that gym," Van Gundy said. "He has tried to do what we wanted. When I talk about relationships with players, that's when I know I have a good one. He's willing to be coached and performs at a high level. Does that mean he's going to like everything? No."
When Sprewell doesn't agree, he vocalizes it. It was hardly a problem last year, when Sprewell, fresh off his league suspension, exhibited mostly model behavior. But there is a notion that the financial security of a contract extension will create an opening for Sprewell to act out, ignore authority and be disruptive. Before he was ever offered a deal a week ago, he skipped training camp.
"Like I said when he missed training camp, he was wrong," Van Gundy said. "But I don't know if you can draw from that incident that there is going to be a pattern of not respecting authority."
Perhaps to rationalize their lucrative contract offer to Sprewell, the Knicks have to ignore a pattern of misbehavior established by Sprewell. Instead, they have catered to his every need, first making him a starter and then allowing him to design his own contract extension. As one Knick player privately noted, the "special treatment" for Sprewell has left some teammates grumbling about a double standard.
"It's like there are two rules," the player said. "Is it a problem? Not if we win."
Success fed the Sprewell frenzy last year, at least in New York.
"On a local basis, he's very popular," said Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports, a Chicago-based marketing firm that matches athletes to advertisers. "If he does not perform on the court this year, I think you could be looking at an ugly situation. New Yorkers are quick to get down on a player, as they have in the past. By pushing the envelope on behavior as he does, it doesn't leave much margin for error."
In a television commercial for And 1, Sprewell sits in a chair with his hair blown out into an Afro as a hairdresser begins the braiding process. In a haunting tone, he decries his image as a nightmare and declares himself the American Dream. The ad was unique and shocking, just the qualities some fans relate to Sprewell.
"A lot of people like the underdog," Sprewell said, trying to explain his rapport with the New York fans. "And I've been put in that situation basically ever since the P. J. incident."
P. J. Carlesimo was the Golden State coach who tried to rein in the star's free spirit two years ago and ended prying Sprewell's fingers off his neck. Sprewell has explained the situation as "just a bad day." Take away the violent aspect of the infamous confrontation, and Sprewell all but sees himself as the symbol of every employee who has longed to stand up to the boss, but couldn't.
"I think a lot of people identify with that," Sprewell said. "A lot of people go to work and have a difficult time with their supervisors or bosses or whatever it is. Sometimes, you just want to tell them how you feel."
He says this in all earnestness, with his eyes focused on yours. Part of Sprewell's allure, he will tell you, is that he is articulate and intelligent, a side of himself he puts emphasis on when he wears clear-lens glasses that are more a fashion accessory than necessity. On the flip-side of the brazen emotion he shows on the court is a man who once majored in social work at the University of Alabama. Full of contradiction, Sprewell is able to pull out a personality trait to match any occasion.
It has worked to captivate New York fans, and served him well before a California jury. But a deputy sheriff who fingerprinted Sprewell upon his reckless driving charge that led to the civil trial had a different take on his appearance.
"He was cordial and cooperative," said Deputy Sheriff Rudy Bowers of Contra Costa County in California. "When I worked the jail, there was one officer for every 64 inmates, and they act as gentlemanly as a guy next door. What changes is when they don't get their way. As far as Latrell Sprewell, I look at him as any other of these guys. If pushed or if he doesn't feel like he's getting his way, he can snap at any moment. If you or I had wanted to ram another car because it was driving slow in front of us, you would hit the switch that says, Don't do it. People like Latrell Sprewell don't have that switch."
Sprewell admits that he acts on every impulse. And if there is a fine to pay, so be it. If there is a punishment that comes along, O.K. So far, all has been forgiven. So far, he has been granted New York's unconditional love.
"You know, that's just the way Americans are," Sprewell said. "They like to root for the underdog."

Chart: "KEYS TO KNICKS' SEASON"
 
TWO REASONS TO BELIEVE
 
An Unstoppable Tandem: Allan Houston is the smooth shooter and Latrell Sprewell is the brazen slasher, and together they present enormous matchup problems for opponents. If they continue to develop as partners on the floor, they can be as dangerous as any duo in the league.
 
The Camby X-Factor: Marcus Camby can help the Knicks begin to find life after Patrick Ewing with his energetic bursts, flying dunks and offensive rebounds. If he can find his groove playing center on a nightly basis, the sting will be taken out of Ewing's early-season absence.
 
Two Causes for Concern
 
Me-First Mentality: The Knicks were nearly ruined by selfish play last year. And if their 2-6 preseason was any indication, they didn't learn anything from it. If they don't trust their teammates on offense and defense, the fairy tale team of last year will fall apart at its dysfunctional bindings.
 
Ewing's Uncertain Future: The Knicks have never been more than a .500 team without Patrick Ewing. If they falter again, Ewing, at age 37, may not be able to save them upon a return that could be as late as January. If they succeed without him, Ewing could return as a disruptive misfit resistant to a system that doesn't cater to his style. SELENA ROBERTS

HEADLINE: Global Economy Slowly Cuts Use of Fuels Rich in Carbon

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
Even as the world's expanding population and economy increase atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide that scientists say are warming the earth, the global energy system is moving steadily away from the carbon-rich fuels whose combustion produces the gas.
Experts say atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide may be double that of the pre-industrial era by the end of the next century. But they also say the levels would be much higher except for a trend toward lower-carbon fuels that has been going on for more than 100 years, but has been largely unnoticed except by a small band of energy specialists. 
 The question now, they say, is whether the trend can be accelerated enough to stave off or lessen what many scientists believe is a potentially disruptive global warming.
For nearly a century and a half, fuels with high amounts of carbon have progressively been replaced by those containing less. First wood, which is high in carbon, was eclipsed in the late 19th century by coal, which contains less. Then oil, with a lower carbon content still, dethroned King Coal in the 1960's.
Now analysts say that natural gas, lighter still in carbon, may be entering its heyday, and that the day of hydrogen -- providing a fuel with no carbon at all, by definition -- may at last be about to dawn.
As a result, the experts estimate, the world's economy today burns less than two-thirds as much carbon per unit of energy produced as it did in 1860. In the United States, they estimate, the trend toward lower-carbon fuels combined with greater energy efficiency has, since 1950, reduced by about half the amount of carbon spewed out for each unit of economic production.
But because economic growth and population growth have been so rapid over the decades, overall atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have steadily risen, to the point that the concentrations may well have doubled by the year 2100.
Mainstream scientists say that this much carbon dioxide could warm the earth, on average, by 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, that is about half as much as it has warmed since the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.
A change of this magnitude would likely have widespread consequences for the world's climate, weather and human life.
Now, as representatives of 150 governments meet in Bonn in the latest round of global talks on measures to further reduce carbon-dioxide emissions, analysts both in and out of industry say that the next quarter-century is shaping up as a period of technological and economic ferment offering a chance to accelerate the trend toward a low-carbon economy and, eventually, a no-carbon one.
In Bonn, the delegates are trying to work out the details of an agreement forged two years ago in Kyoto, Japan, that could speed up the trend. Their work is not expected to be finished for at least a year, and the Kyoto agreement still must be ratified by a sufficient number of countries after that.
However that may turn out, "the decarbonization of the energy system is the single most important fact to emerge from the last 20 years of analysis" of the system, said Dr. Jesse H. Ausubel, an expert on energy and climate at Rockefeller University in New York City. Dr. Ausubel predicts that this evolution will produce a carbon-free energy system by the end of the 21st century.
Among some recent signs of the trend are these:
*The Federal Energy Information Administration reported last week that emissions of carbon dioxide by the United States had increased by an average of 1.37 percent a year in the 1990's -- only about half the 2.6-percent rate of growth in economic production. Analysts say the discrepancy is evidence that the economy is being decoupled from carbon.
*The agency reported this month that the same is generally true in China, the biggest consumer and producer of coal in the world, where coal production has been reported to be dropping lately. "China has dispelled a commonly held notion that economic growth and energy consumption are necessarily coupled," the report said.
*In December, Honda will introduce in the United States a high-efficiency, low-emissions automobile powered partly by gasoline and partly by self-generated electricity. It is said to run at 60 miles per gallon of gasoline in town, and 71 on the highway, and to travel 600 to 700 miles on a tank of gas.
Toyota has introduced a similar "hybrid" automobile in Japan, and these cars are "literally kick-the-tires examples of the decarbonized economy," said Hal Harvey, president of the Energy Foundation, a partnership of foundations that promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Other auto makers are also planning hybrids, which are being viewed as a transition, ultimately, to vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells that emit no carbon. In its planning, the General Motors Corporation has "embraced fuel cells as the technology of choice," but with hybrids coming first, said John Williams, the leader of the company's internal team on global climate issues.
And while auto companies are looking down that track, some of the world's biggest energy companies are looking to provide the appropriate fuels. Hydrogen, in particular, has attracted fresh interest.
Until recently, "the hydrogen option was seen as rather distant," said Ged R. Davis, an executive of Shell International in London who analyzes such questions for Royal Dutch/Shell, one of the world's largest energy companies. "Now it is looking closer, perhaps over the next decade or two," Mr. Davis added. "Most of the energy and car companies are looking at this rather seriously." Shell itself has established a hydrogen subsidiary.
In the nearer term, hydrogen would be used in fuel cells for cars, trucks and industrial plants, just as it already provides power for orbiting spacecraft. But ultimately, hydrogen could also provide a general carbon-free fuel.
The world energy system will not change overnight, of course, if it changes at all. And new products must ultimately stand the test of the marketplace. But some analysts say that the next two decades or so will be a time of unusual pressure for change, both for environmental and economic reasons, in which companies will be driven to compete for survival and dominance in some sort of emerging new energy system.
Whether companies are seriously pursuing new options or merely preserving them for the future, experts say there seems little doubt that the long-term trend toward decarbonization is real, and that it will most likely continue even in the absence of any shift to hydrogen or renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.
"The future decarbonization rate is likely to be at least as high as the historical one" of about three-tenths of a percent a year, said Dr. Nebojsa Nakicenovic, an expert on energy and the environment with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, a research group in Laxenburg, Austria. The institute was one of the first groups to study the question.
Oil accounts for the biggest share of global energy consumption today, followed by coal and, closely, by natural gas. In most of the world except the United States and China, said Dr. Ausubel of Rockefeller University, coal is either defunct or on the way out, and natural gas will increasingly displace it.
According to several recent analyses, Dr. Nakicenovic said, recoverable natural gas now appears far more abundant than had been previously thought. The burning of gas produces, on average, only about a third of the carbon dioxide per unit of energy of coal, and about two-thirds that of oil.
Gas not only can fuel fixed facilities like industrial plants and furnaces, it can also be processed to produce hydrogen for use in carbon-free fuel cells to power automobiles and generate electricity. In those cells, there is no combustion; instead, hydrogen reacts chemically with oxygen to produce electricity. But when hydrogen is extracted from gas, the residual carbon must somehow be disposed of, possibly by pumping it back into depleted oil and gas wells.
Dr. Ausubel predicts that natural gas will become the dominant fuel of the next 40 to 50 years. If so, that alone would be enough to continue the long-term decarbonization trend.
China, which some experts think will emerge as the biggest carbon-dioxide emitter of the 21st century, has greatly reduced its energy consumption per unit of economic output, has closed several coal mines, is seeking to modernize industrial and power plants and is moving toward natural gas, many analysts say.
Not least, they say, the Chinese are worried about the health effects of coal's air pollution. Nevertheless, the Energy Information Administration reported last week, China's coal demand is expected to double by 2020.
So while the trend toward a carbon-free economy may continue, Dr. Ausubel says, it might not move rapidly enough to assuage the fears of those who are most concerned about global warming. He says that if the trend continues to evolve more or less naturally, with business as usual, it will take another century or so to decarbonize the energy system fully.
By then, he predicts, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will be around 500 parts per million, nearly double what they were before the industrial revolution. Mainstream scientists say that would be enough to change the earth's climate substantially, make droughts, heat waves and floods worse and raise the sea level to heights that would threaten many low-lying coastal areas and islands. Some analysts say that 500 parts per million is a best-case estimate, and that business-as-usual could cause a tripling of pre-industrial carbon-dioxide levels.
Other experts think that concentrations could be held substantially below 500 parts per million if the trend toward decarbonization were to accelerate. Mr. Harvey of the Energy Foundation says "prospects are excellent" for an acceleration.
And Mr. Davis, the Shell executive, says his company's analyses suggest that if the proper incentives were in place, new energy technologies could be adopted broadly enough to bring about a peak in oil use and carbon-dioxide emissions by about 2020. After that, there would be a decline.
One sort of incentive might lie in the Kyoto agreement, which calls for a group of 39 industrialized countries to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by an average of 5 percent below 1990 levels over the period 2008 to 2012. One mechanism for doing this is a system whereby a country that exceeds its reductions target can earn money by selling that extra reduction to another country that is having trouble meeting its target. A similar system, involving company-to-company trading, has been proposed for the United States.
While negotiators struggle over the terms of such arrangements and politicians wrangle over putting the Kyoto accord into effect, many energy analysts seem to agree on one thing: The ultimate goal ought to be a carbon-free economy based largely on hydrogen. Dr. Ausubel, for one, predicts that such an economy will materialize.
Many would agree with Mr. Williams of General Motors: "I think I'm on pretty solid ground in saying the long-term vision is hydrogen. But there's a lot of work between here and there."

HEADLINE: STILL STANDING -- A special report.;
Ignoring Scars, Milosevic Is Stubbornly Pressing On

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Slobodan Milosevic gray and remote, internationally isolated and politically unpopular, charged with war crimes, his army restive and its reservists outraged, his economy ruined and his factories bombed, his refineries and electricity system smashed and his sources of fuel unclear, his roads and railways holed and his bridges collapsed -- has not only survived the loss of Kosovo, but gained a second wind.
How he has managed to do so over the last five months is a testament to his grit, preparation and peculiar world view, as well as to his strict control over the levers of the state. 
 Through the police, the army and the official news media, he has sown fear and uncertainty and belittled any pretenders to his throne, while deepening the divisions among his opposition. The possibility of a violent explosion is always here in this bruised, sometimes desperate nation. But with less need than ever to please the West, Mr. Milosevic has shown a tougher, combative, intimidating side and intensified the sense of threat in the society, being more willing, even avid, to beat protesters, shut down newspapers and send people to jail.
The Milosevic era may be coming to an end, but it will not happen quickly. He has made clear that he will not be forced from his office as Yugoslavia's President without a fight for which his opponents lack the courage and the troops, and he has managed to extend a degree of confidence to the rest of his regime.
He has also benefited from the manifold mistakes of his divided enemies, both foreign and domestic, to become a sort of European Saddam Hussein -- isolated, unpopular, but apparently unmovable.
In late August, sensing the panic in his regime after the loss of Kosovo and a sizable opposition rally in Belgrade, Mr. Milosevic summoned the leaders of his party to stop the rot.
According to some who were there, he said the main task was to get through the winter, week by week, month by month. While opposition figures try to finish NATO's job and pull him down, and all of them with him, he said, the Government and the party must concentrate on the reconstruction of the country and patriotic activities of all kinds.
They must rebuild the bridges and the power and heating plants, and insure that every person whose house or apartment was destroyed by a NATO bomb had a new dwelling for the winter.
"Our companies must provide and help," he said, implying that it was time for those who had made money from their coziness with the Milosevic clan to stump up, for their own preservation. "We need full mobilization of every segment in order to achieve the maximum."
The world would change, he said. President Clinton would go. The Russians would elect a new President, more nationalist, closer to Serbia. The world was tired of American hypocrisy and hegemony, he said. The Europeans understood that the region needs Serbia. Just hang on. He would outlast them all, he said.
Whatever his peculiarities, Mr. Milosevic, now 58 years old, is described by everyone who meets him as possessing a strong will and an aura of confidence, and he rarely shows fear or unease. During the war, as one air-raid siren sounded 10 seconds after the others, he turned to a visitor with a genuine grin, saying, "That one's always late."
He is fond of indulging in the Serbian pastime of vulgar speech in private, over whisky and cigars, as a way of establishing intimacy, and he draws others out, leading them on to judge their loyalty, while keeping his real feelings to himself.
He listens but makes his own decisions in private, usually after consulting his wife, Mirjana Markovic, whom he met at 17 and with whom he shares an extremely close and obsessional relationship.
He tends to stay out of the limelight, though he is making a few more public appearances these days, to show his vitality. Still, as is habit when he appears on the state television news, an announcer summarizes his comments, and his voice is rarely heard. He is a distant patriarch, generally floating above the swamp of daily politics and squabbles.
In what one Serbian analyst calls a "Slobocentric universe," created over the last 10 years of international isolation, he sits, like a gnomic sultan, high above a ruined landscape where he remains the arbiter of what few benefits are still to be had. Aleksandr Tijanic, Mr. Milosevic's former spokesman, calls him "an element in the Serbian periodic table."
He cultivates and drops allies with political acumen, using influence, money and pressure. Currently, he favors the ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj, a tough politician who has brandished a gun outside Parliament and punched opponents, to protect his right wing and to threaten his foes.
In a group, according to those who know him, Mr. Milosevic is a stiff, self-conscious and rather clumsy man, with the fake air of a Roman senator, and he carries himself with a kind of artificial dignity, despising flattery and imitation.
Here, in a meeting of his Socialist Party of Serbia's Glavni Odbor, or main committee, Mr. Milosevic was both steely and soothing.
"If anyone feels tired, he may feel free to withdraw," he said calmly. "I will understand this. I have nothing against this." Then he paused. "We are still a rasadnik for cadres," he said, using the Serbian word for tree nursery. "We have so many cadres that we could make 20 more governments as good as the one we have now."
Despite such an invitation, despite the West's ban on foreign travel for more than 300 Milosevic associates, and despite the most fervent hopes of the Clinton Administration and the divided Serbian opposition, no one of any consequence has left the Milosevic Government. There has been no significant split, not even any large cracks.
His indictment on charges of war crimes weakened him, but the simultaneous indictment of four top aides -- including his most plausible internal successor, the Serbian President, Milan Milutinovic -- was an additional inducement for Mr. Milosevic's elite to stick together.
He has maneuvered within narrow boundaries and with few resources to underline his control over the country and the fate of its people, especially those who fear losing what little they have left. His Government and his crony capitalists have gone into high gear to fix the war damage, covered lavishly on state television, which he has controlled throughout his 12-year rule, and they have secured contracts somehow for Russian natural gas, so people do not freeze this winter.
He has made sure that the police get paid, that his nationalist right wing is covered, and that his opposition is excoriated for its weakness and divisions, while painting the opponents as agents of the very countries that bombed Serbia.
He has been greatly aided in making those charges by his control over the state news media, especially broadcasting. But he is able to make them so plausibly only because of two developments that the West should have been able to control, officials close to him say.
First, the chaos in Kosovo, where NATO has not prevented the flight of Serbs in the face of organized Albanian revenge and the destruction of treasured Serbian monasteries and churches. A democratic, multiethnic Kosovo would have hurt Mr. Milosevic badly, making Serbs wonder what the war was all about. There is in the population considerable knowledge and some shame over the deaths of at least 10,000 Kosovo Albanians, by Western estimates, and the expulsion of some 800,000.
But the current state of Kosovo and the mistreatment of even innocent Serbs let the regime argue that Washington forced the war on Belgrade, which could not win. The inability of the West to bring order to Kosovo or to control Albanian crime underlines the message sent by most Serbian news media that Mr. Milosevic had no option but to fight the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, even if the war was fought with all the atrocities that Bosnia made so familiar.
Feeding the sense of paranoia and victimization on which Mr. Milosevic survives are the perceptions of many Serbs about the West's attitudes toward them: its embrace of collective guilt and its lip service toward Belgrade's sovereignty.
Second, the United States and the West made an open embrace of opposition figures like Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party and his rival, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement, urging them to overthrow Mr. Milosevic in a popular uprising, without a democratic process. By meeting them in Montenegro, in public, and providing them with money, however late or limited, Western diplomats made it easy for Mr. Milosevic and his news media to portray the opposition as paid agents of NATO, continuing its war against Belgrade.
The Serbs, who rarely see themselves as the world does, do not need much prodding to feel that they are the victims of an American vendetta against one man in a highly personalized battle, antithetical to America's democratic values, to save the reputations of President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
The Americans are perceived as promoting revolution against a despised but elected leader. That revolution is supposed to be assisted by the American-promoted deprivation of the Serbian people, by their lack of heat, gasoline and food, while Washington tries to veto European efforts to provide such assistance even to opposition-run towns.
"With enemies like NATO and the Serbian opposition," says Aleksa Djilas, a political scientist who has followed Mr. Milosevic's career, "Milosevic doesn't need many friends." He thrives on an atmosphere in which Serbs feel the world is being biased and unfair, an autism only aided by 10 years of Washington-driven isolation of Serbia.
Like any incumbent, Mr. Milosevic benefits from this atmosphere of emergency and threat, hardly exaggerated when Washington makes his overthrow the explicit price of any aid or reintegration for the Serbs. Even Serbs who agonize over the killings and expulsions of Kosovo's Albanians find this blackmail hard to take.
After all, argues Milan Milosevic, a veteran analyst at the independent Vreme magazine who is no relation to the President, Mr. Milosevic was the supreme commander in a war for the fatherland against an enemy 60 times stronger. Given that "his head is one of the declared war aims, it's not entirely cynical for him to argue that the war continues by other means and to justify wartime measures," Milan Milosevic said.
Mr. Milosevic himself, says Mr. Djilas, has an extraordinary stamina that derives from his own calculation of interests. "In politics, as in war, defeat is often when you think you're defeated," he said. "If you don't recognize defeat, or you don't show it, you can last a great deal longer."
By any objective terms, Mr. Milosevic should be finished. He wanted to be a Serbian Tito. But Yugoslavia continues to unravel, and Serbia has lost its fourth war in nine years: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and now Kosovo, which was an integral part of Serbia itself. With Montenegro restive and aiming for independence, the orbit of Serbian control has shrunk to its smallest this century.
Serbia is home to some 700,000 refugees and internally displaced people -- an estimated 200,000 from Kosovo alone. That represents nearly a tenth of the Serbs in the Balkans. As Mr. Djindjic has said, "Four times the Serbs have gone forth on tanks, and four times they have come back on tractors."
Real unemployment is widespread, the Serbian economy is a third its size in 1989, and average wages are now below 80 German marks a month, or about $45.
But Mr. Milosevic is in a good mood nonetheless, says a man who has seen him regularly, having constructed his own peculiar notion of how the world now works. For a man who fancies himself a worldly figure and likes nothing better than visits from American crisis solvers like Richard C. Holbrooke, the isolation in which Mr. Milosevic now lives is exasperating.
Mr. Milosevic once worked as a banker in New York, and he talks about America all the time, the man said. He seems not to understand that while he was indispensable to the United States for regional security after the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian war, he now has little left to offer. He still believes that the Americans will understand the importance of Serbia to the region, as the Europeans do. He fails to see that Serbian atrocities in Kosovo, which he regards as an internal matter and less severe than in Bosnia, have altered views in America and made him an untouchable pariah.
Mr. Milosevic regards the Clinton Administration as having gone mad, this visitor said. "He can't believe that the American leadership has been hoodwinked into supporting the Kosovo Liberation Army and 'the narco-traffickers, black marketeers and mafiosos' of Albania," the man said, using Mr. Milosevic's own terms. "He says the only survival is internal, that we've got to save ourselves until sanity befalls them. He says: 'I've got to run my country and rebuild. While they were bombing, we were planting.' "
Mr. Milosevic, who does not always get a balanced view from cowed and relatively unsophisticated aides, regards the current anathema aimed at him as wholly personal, because he would not play to the American script and give up Kosovo after a few days of bombing, the man said.
"He thinks he'll be there after they're gone and writing their memoirs, and that someone else will come along, George Bush Jr., with less passion about him and more sensible answers. He feels like he's defending his country and fought a bloody civil war, and he's not making nuclear weapons and selling them to anybody with cash or threatening anybody else."
While he has failed as a Serbian Tito, he sees himself as leading a new nonaligned movement, of countries like Russia, China, India and Belarus, who reject Washington's hegemony. Yet much of this is wishful thinking, and his heart still appears to lie in America.
Those who see him frequently say he is beginning to believe that fresh elections, much as Mr. Draskovic has called for, not only can be won, but will be an answer to Serbia's postwar isolation. If the ruling coalition now of his Socialists, his wife's Yugoslav United Left party, and Mr. Seselj's ultranationalist Radicals, running a single slate of candidates, can win the next Serbian elections, there will be new legitimacy, his officials say.
Even if they do not win a majority, as is more likely, given his political weakness and the fatigue of 12 years of Government, they believe that the opposition will not win a majority either. They believe that some part of the opposition -- in particular Mr. Draskovic, who started the war as a deputy prime minister -- will be willing to make a deal with Mr. Milosevic.
All that may be wrong, of course. The 70 percent who consistently tell pollsters that they want a new Government may have the nerve to vote for one in the polling booths. And the United States' pressure on Mr. Draskovic -- plus his own continuing anger at what he regards as a regime-directed attempt on his life in early October -- may be enough to keep him from again making a deal.
But elections would leave Mr. Milosevic in his post. And the essence of his power has never been elections so much as his ability to create inner conflict, discredit his opposition, manage self-created crises and rule beyond the institutions he himself has degraded.
In a recent poll of 1,500 Serbs published in NIN magazine, there were startling figures that go a long way toward explaining the survival of Slobodan Milosevic.
Asked who was the first person they thought of as Serbia's leader, 34.9 percent of the respondents answered, "no one." Mr. Milosevic came second, with 18.3 percent. Third came "undecided," with 16.8 percent. The top opposition figure was Mr. Draskovic, with 5.4 percent. Mr. Djindjic got 3.7 percent, and Mr. Seselj got 3 percent.
In an isolated, fearful universe where nearly 52 percent of the people are unable to articulate an alternate leader for Serbia, the man who commands a solid 20 percent of the vote can remain king.
But the current mood of tentative confidence should not disguise the fear in early June, as Mr. Milosevic accepted NATO's ultimatum and agreed to pull out of Kosovo.
The regime was in a significant panic, unsure of what to do, acknowledged Ljubisa Ristic, the president of the vanity party that Mr. Milosevic created for his wife and that serves as one of several ways to funnel private money into the regime. But it was obvious that the West's final offer, negotiated with the Russians, had to be taken, Mr. Ristic said.
The Serbs could not shoot down NATO aircraft, despite propaganda claims. It was the last moment to save the civilian population of Belgrade from a more permanent loss of bridges, electricity and infrastructure, Mr. Ristic said, while acknowledging that it was also the best moment for Mr. Milosevic and the regime to save themselves.
Close aides found the courage to tell Mr. Milosevic that he should not reject this deal only to accept a worse one later.
Faced with an ultimatum, an imminent NATO decision to introduce ground troops if the war continued much longer and a threat that Belgrade would soon lose its bridges and electrical power, the officials say, Mr. Milosevic decided to take an offer that included benefits he could sell at home. A peace settlement would be sanctioned by the United Nations, as the war never was. Kosovo would be explicitly left in Belgrade's sovereignty, with no reference to any referendum on its future status, a form of absurdity in a province so heavily Albanian. And Kosovo would be administered by the United Nations, not by NATO, which would also have to accept Russian troops as peacekeepers.
But the army generals were appalled, and so was Mr. Milosevic's key coalition partner, the ultranationalist Mr. Seselj, who had sworn that no foreign soldier would ever enter Kosovo.
Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, the commander of the Third Army Corps that controlled Kosovo as well as southern Serbia, was said to have been shocked by the sudden news of capitulation. He turned pale and sweaty, slumping silently in the back of his car.
But General Pavkovic did not rebel, remembering Mr. Milosevic's methodical humiliation of the army from 1992-95 as he built up the police, gave them military equipment and military ranks, and paid them three times better. And General Pavkovic, just weeks later, served Mr. Milosevic by calming angry army reservists who wanted their combat pay and by warning the opposition that the army would defend the legitimate Government.
Mr. Seselj was a harder problem. In a late-night meeting with party leaders after accepting the NATO-Russian offer, Mr. Milosevic asked for Mr. Seselj's support in a parliamentary vote the next day. Mr. Milosevic told him that if he could not vote for the deal, he should at least abstain. Mr. Seselj said that he was not sure he could even do that. But if the party voted against the deal, Mr. Milosevic said, Mr. Seselj must promise not to pull down the Government in the Parliament.
The next day, Mr. Seselj and his Radicals voted against and vowed to leave the Serbian Government out of protest. But they remained. Not only that, but as opposition protests peaked and then began to wane, Mr. Seselj agreed to join the federal Government as well, taking the seats vacated by Mr. Draskovic.
Still, the failure of Mr. Djindjic to bring large numbers of protesters into the streets was a happy surprise for the Government. There had been serious talk earlier in the summer about a deal with Mr. Draskovic that would have made him Serbian Prime Minister of a transitional Government, with Mr. Milosevic stepping back toward a more constitutional role as Yugoslav President, officials say. Some businessmen in or close to the Government, like Bogoljub Karic and Milan Beko, found themselves on the list of 300 or so Milosevic associates barred from travel or tending their assets abroad and approached Mr. Draskovic to hedge their bets.
But the United States objected fiercely to the idea that Mr. Milosevic would remain in office at all and threatened Mr. Draskovic himself with indictment on war crimes charges stemming from the activities of his short-lived Serbian Guard in the Croatian war in 1991. To try to push Mr. Draskovic closer to the rest of the opposition, Washington also put him on the visa watch list, meaning that he could not travel to America.
It is not clear how much Mr. Milosevic himself, who usually uses go-betweens, was involved in these discussions with Mr. Draskovic. But they fell apart, the opposition wasted the summer, and Mr. Milosevic gained confidence.
In a rare speech Oct. 11 in Leskovac, where some of the first postwar unrest appeared, Mr. Milosevic acknowledged that life is hard for most people in Serbia. "It does not take CNN or Deutsche Welle to tell the citizens of this country that -- I, your president, am telling you that."
And he challenged the opposition, saying: "If citizens feel that despite all those misfortunes, there are representatives of the people who could insure a better life for a majority of the people, let them elect them at the next elections. And that is all I have to say on that subject."

HEADLINE: Voters' Guide to the Referendum on 14 Revisions to New York City's Charter

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
In June, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed a 15-member commission to consider revising the New York City Charter, its basic governing document. He named a former Deputy Mayor, Randy M. Mastro, as chairman and strongly hinted that his primary goal was to block the mayoral ambitions of a bitter political foe, Public Advocate Mark Green. Under the current charter, Mr. Green would finish Mr. Giuliani's term if the Mayor runs for the United States Senate next year and wins.
By law, the commission had to consider changes to the entire document, not just the rule governing mayoral succession. The panel quickly made a list of more than 100 proposals, but eventually backed away from any change that would have affected Mr. Green. The number of proposed changes was whittled down to 14, and the changes must be approved or rejected as a group, not individually. 
 Mr. Giuliani has voiced strong support for the proposed revisions, saying they would make permanent some of the most successful policies of his administration, particularly those affecting public safety and fiscal responsibility.
But good-government groups and a host of Democratic politicians, including Mr. Green and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, have condemned the charter revision process, saying it was politically motivated and the proposals rushed onto the ballot with too little time for deliberation. These critics say most of the changes could be accomplished through legislation and many revisions would weaken the Council while strengthening the mayor.
These are the Charter revisions to be decided in Tuesday's vote:
 
GUN-FREE SCHOOL ZONES -- Makes possessing a gun within 1,000 feet of a school building a crime. Supporters say it would close gaps in a similar Federal law and extend a state law that also makes it a crime to possess a gun inside a school or on school grounds. Opponents say the revision could be struck down for conflicting with existing state or Federal statutes and the City Council should pass such a measure instead.
 
GUN SAFETY LOCKS -- Requires safety locks on all guns owned in the city. On Oct. 13, the Council approved a bill identical to this revision, and the Mayor is expected to sign it into law tomorrow. Opponents of the revision, which strengthens an existing law that requires the locks only for some guns, say this and many other Charter changes can be accomplished simply by passing local laws. Supporters say the Council was roused to action only after the Charter proposal was put on the ballot.
 
STABILIZATION AND EMERGENCY FUND -- Requires that 50 percent of any budget surplus go into a fund to cover future deficits, pay off long-term debt or finance capital projects. Supporters say this would guarantee fiscal responsibility. Opponents say a reserve fund already exists and requiring surpluses to be salted away would handcuff policy makers.
 
CAP ON SPENDING INCREASES -- Imposes a cap, tied to the rate of inflation, on annual increases in city spending. (The mayor and City Council could jointly lift the cap in an emergency.) Supporters say this would force officials to act responsibly and save taxpayer dollars. Opponents say the cap would not necessarily limit spending and would shift budgetary power away from the Council to the mayor.
Opponents also say this revision would further politicize the budget process and limit the city's flexibility in negotiating union contracts by preventing it from offering salary increases greater than the rate of inflation in exchange for limited or no raises in other years. Opponents also say the regional Consumer Price Index, which would be used to calculate the rate of inflation, does not necessarily reflect changes in the cost of goods and services in New York City. Supporters say the price index is a good measure by which to regulate city spending.
 
TAX INCREASES -- Requires a two-thirds majority vote of the City Council to impose or increase taxes, and a four-fifths majority to override a mayoral veto of a tax measure. Supporters say the harder it is to raise taxes, the better. Opponents say the revision would handcuff lawmakers and could give a small group of Council members the power to block a necessary tax increase. Opponents also say it would make the Council more likely to raise property taxes, which for technical reasons are not affected by the proposal. Supporters say that is unlikely because raising property taxes is politically unpopular.
 
HUMAN RIGHTS -- Makes the city's Human Rights Commission, which has existed for nearly 40 years, a permanent entity. Supporters say this would make it far more difficult for future city leaders to disband the commission. Opponents say the commission's existence is not threatened and the revision is unnecessary.
 
IMMIGRANT AFFAIRS -- Makes the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs and Language Services permanent under the Charter. Supporters say this would insure the office's continued existence and enhance its ability to serve immigrants. Opponents say immigrants' needs must be evaluated further before a decision is made on granting Charter status to the office. They also say legal immigrants deserve preference in receiving city services and the office's confidentiality policy could encourage further illegal immigration.
 
MAYORAL SUCCESSION -- Requires a nonpartisan special election within 60 days of a mayoral vacancy, beginning in January 2002. (Currently, the public advocate succeeds the mayor until a general election can be held.) Also eliminates the public advocate's role in presiding over City Council meetings and voting to break ties. Those powers would be given to a Council member chosen by the Council. Supporters say voters should directly elect a mayor's successor. Opponents say voters already know they could be selecting the mayor's successor when they choose a public advocate. The opponents also say this revision would make it possible for the city to have four different mayors within little more than a year -- the departing mayor, the public advocate, the mayor chosen in the special election and the mayor selected on the next Election Day.
 
CITY CONTRACTS -- Raises the minimum value of contracts that the city can award without public advertising and with only limited competitive bids. The purchase limit would be $100,000; it is now $25,000 for goods and services, $50,000 for construction and related services and $100,000 for information technology. The revision would also eliminate procedural steps in bidding and allow the city to procure goods and services in cooperation with other government entities. Supporters say the current limits are too low and the city's procurement methods need streamlining. Opponents say large contracts are frequently broken into several smaller contracts to circumvent the bidding rules, and raising the limit would encourage further contract splitting.
 
REVIEWING VENDORS -- Centralizes the procedure for reviewing vendors seeking city contracts and clarifies the city's authority to deny contracts to corrupt businesses. Supporters say this would help prevent corrupt businesses from winning contracts. Opponents say it would increase the authority of the Procurement Policy Board, whose members are appointed by the mayor and the comptroller to administer city contracts. Opponents say the board has too much power already.
 
ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN'S SERVICES -- Makes the agency independent of the Human Resources Administration. Supporters say children's services should be handled by a separate agency and giving the child welfare agency Charter status would make it permanent. Opponents say the City Council could accomplish that with legislation but the agency's performance needs further review first.
 
ORGANIZED CRIME -- Creates the Organized Crime Control Commission, a permanent entity consolidating the work now done by various city agencies that regulate and license public wholesale food markets, the private garbage-hauling industry and shipboard gambling. Supporters say it would increase efficiency. Opponents say the commission's jurisdiction would overlap with those of the Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.
 
PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY -- Merges the Department of Health and the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services into a single agency, the Department of Public Health and Mental Hygiene Services. Supporters say the revision would increase efficiency, improve access to comprehensive health care and enhance coordination among public health workers who deal with many of the same patients seeking physical and mental health services. Opponents say the merger could lead to reduced services and attention for the mentally ill and disabled. In effect, the merger has already taken place, because the city's Health Commissioner, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, runs both agencies.
 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES -- Calls for the Mayor's Office of Operations to coordinate public and private efforts to combat domestic violence. In 1994, Mr. Giuliani signed an executive order creating the Commission to Combat Family Violence, which coordinates efforts including a hot line for victims to report violence and increased services for battered women in city hospitals. The revision would make fighting domestic violence a mandate in the Charter. Opponents say no Charter revision is needed because the commission already exists by executive order.

HEADLINE: Muted Echoes of the Civil War

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MOSES; JENNIFER MOSES is the author of "Food and Whine: Confessions of an End of the Millennium Mom" (Simon & Schuster).

 BODY:
MY 9-year-old son, Sam, thinks I've become morbid, and maybe I have. For some years now, I've been drawn to cemeteries. Which may be why our first stop, after landing in Biloxi, Miss., is the old city graveyard, conveniently situated just a couple of blocks from our B & B.
Like other graveyards in the Deep South, this one -- with its above-ground crypts, moss-covered stones, intimations of the War Between the States, and tendrils of Spanish moss -- is hauntingly resonant. Above me, birds call in the heavy canopy of the live oaks. To my right, Sam is playing shadow-tag among family tombs of people called Reynoir, Agregaard and Bousquet. And to my left -- where Highway 90 stretches along the coast from Mobile, Ala., to New Orleans -- a grape-juice-colored shuttle bus, courtesy of the New Palace Casino, whizzes past. 
 Biloxi's brief moment of glory came in 1720, when for two years the city was the capital of French colonial Louisiana. In 1722 it lost that title to New Orleans, but Biloxi went on to sustain itself with lumber, seafood and tourism.
Regular monster hurricanes notwithstanding, the city is thriving in its latest incarnation as the coastal capital of casino gambling, drawing snowbirds, retirees, college students on spring break and families looking for an affordable vacation. I'm told that in the warm months Highway 90 is a snarl of traffic, lined with concession stands, jet-ski rentals, and T-shirt cabanas, and the beach is a mass of supine bodies. The Redneck Riviera, it is sometimes called, and, during the age of grand seaside hotels and steamer ships, the American Mediterranean. But in February it's too cold to swim, and Sam and I have the town to ourselves.
He drags me away from my meditations on death and the vagaries of history, demanding that we do something fun. Thus we head for the nearest souvenir shop, where I buy him a Batman kite, even though he thinks Batman is stupid, and then to the clean, white, wide-open beach, the world's largest artificial one, built to shore up the sea wall, which itself was built in 1924 to shore up the eroding coastline. Today the beach is empty save for ourselves, the sky is a wash of blue, and the winds coming off the Mississippi Bay are brisk.
On the far side of the bay lies a string of barrier islands that make up Gulf Islands National Seashore, and beyond them lies the Gulf of Mexico. From March through October, in fact, you can take a boat to Ship Island, home of Fort Massachusetts, once a camp for Confederate prisoners. The boats aren't running now. Sam, heedless of everything but his new toy, runs up the beach, his kite soaring above him.
Biloxi is surprisingly pretty; it's also amazingly ugly. It depends on where you are and which way you look. If you stick to the old residential stretches along the shoreline, where Highway 90 splits to become a long boulevard divided by a wide grassy median graced by towering palm trees, you see lovely old boxy houses gazing out over the water, deeply shaded front yards, wide front porches, azaleas bursting into bloom, and, as evening approaches, a pink-flecked Southern sky.
But if you head either east toward Gulf Shores or west toward the old downtown, what you get is one big modern casino after the next -- hulky oversized structures with tacky embellishments like the leaping pink plaster dolphins at the entrance to the Isle of Capri Casino. There's also the immense Keesler Air Force base smack in the middle of town, which we were prevented from visiting when we confessed to the airman on duty that we weren't, actually, military personnel. But in between there are enough points of interest and historic sites to capture the attention of even the most hyperenergetic boy on a winter holiday with his mother.
Plus there are hamburgers -- hamburgers as far as the eye can see, which pleases Sam, who suffers, during nonvacation times, from hamburger deprivation. His belly full, we head for Beauvoir, the last home of Jefferson Davis. As soon as our minivan swings through the gates and onto the grounds, even Sam seems to notice that we've entered a world far from the bumper cars at Fun City, let alone the slot machines at the Treasure Bay Casino Resort.
Right away you can see why the former President of the Confederacy accepted the offer of Beauvoir's owner, Sarah Dorsey, to write his memoirs here. The house, which was built in the middle of the 19th century by a rich Mississippi planter, is an open, airy, single-story raised cottage with a front veranda that is approached by wide stairs and rooms filled with antique furnishings and Davis family memorabilia. In pre-air-conditioned times, the floor-to-ceiling triple-hung windows let in the Gulf breezes, and a jar filled with honey trapped errant insects.
Some years after Jefferson Davis's death, the estate was sold to the Mississippi division of the United Sons of Confederate Veterans, who maintained a soldiers' home on the property.
Today you step out of the house and onto grounds that stretch north toward a sluggish bayou and, beyond that, a Confederate veterans' cemetery and the Tomb of the Unknown Confederate Soldier, on which visitors have placed flowers and small Confederate flags. The grounds also include the newly opened Jefferson Davis Presidential Library, a modern museum with displays about Davis's life and times.
As we head back to Highway 90, I explain to Sam that in the hot, dusty, humid and smelly days before modern sewage and electricity, Biloxi drew city dwellers from New Orleans and Mobile eager to escape the threat of yellow fever for the relatively salutary climes of the coast. Until 1870 they arrived by steamship; afterward, and into the late 1960's, they came by train. In response, Biloxi built hotels grand and small, but today, only one still stands: the classical revival Magnolia Hotel, built in 1847 near the steamship dock, and now the Biloxi Mardi Gras Museum. (Mardi Gras parades, somewhat tamer than those in New Orleans, roll through Biloxi every year.)
Now Sam and I, into our second day, have stopped at the visitors center to pick up a guide to a walking tour, and find ourselves in front of the old hotel on Rue Magnolia. Behind us is Biloxi's most famous restaurant, Mary Mahoney's, in the looming, graceful Brunet-Fourchy House (circa 1835). I love meandering around the heart of the old downtown, but Sam is beginning to get a little antsy looking at the buildings -- Greek Revival and neo-Classical and Victorian and neo-Classic Revival and Creole and Gothic. Then we land at the Cathedral of the Nativity, built in 1902, unexceptional from the outside but housing exquisite German-made stained glass windows depicting scenes from the life of Jesus. Sam is stunned and captivated. "How did they make these?" he asks. As we leave the church, we look up to see the pale orange, and not yet complete, Beau Rivage casino, hovering over the old town like a giant space-age bat.
Also in the heart of the old downtown is the George E. Ohr Arts and Cultural Center. For those -- like myself -- not in the know, George Ohr, "the mad potter of Biloxi," struggled for recognition during his lifetime (he died in 1918), but is now regarded as a master ceramist -- an artist who reached new heights as a colorist and glazer, his quirky works imbued with expressiveness. In the museum you can see the largest permanent exhibition of his work in the United States.
We duck into McElroy's, a family-owned seafood restaurant on Biloxi's small-craft harbor, where the decor is strictly back-to-basics sparse, the seafood is absolutely fresh, and the hamburgers, Sam tells me, are first rate.
Biloxi is built on a peninsula that juts out on one side into the Biloxi Channel, and is bordered on the other by what's called the back bay of Biloxi. There are fish, an aquarium, seafood and deep-sea fishing vessels. After lunch, we dawdle for a while at the harbor, where Sam decides which boat he'd most like to hire for a fishing trip. Next we visit the J. L. Scott Marine Education Center, where we gaze at the creatures swimming around the 40-odd tanks, including the 42,000-gallon Gulf of Mexico tank, where a lazy eel, five feet long, has looped himself around a tire, placed just so in the water, as if for his personal comfort. "That's what you look like in the morning," Sam says.
From there we go to the Maritime and Seafood Industry Museum on Point Cadet. Along with exhibits that preserve maritime artifacts, and displays depicting the life that grew up around the seafood industry, the museum also owns two full-sized schooner replicas, which can be hired out for full- or half-day cruises. The seafood industry was for many years the lifeblood of the town, and changed the face of Biloxi, drawing workers from new places: Cajuns from Louisiana, Bohemians from Baltimore, Dalmatians from Yugoslavia, and Poles. They lived in company-owned shotgun houses and worked in the canneries and on the factory piers shucking oysters, peeling and de-veining shrimp, and shoveling oyster shells to be used in paving roads.
Men, women and children all worked in the seafood industry, which thrived despite the hurricane of 1893 that virtually wiped out the city's fishing fleet; despite the one in 1901 that created 25-foot waves in the Sound or the one in 1915 that eroded much of the shoreline; despite the one in 1947 that buckled the highways; and despite Hurricane Camille, in 1969, that destroyed the remaining Point Cadet fish factories. Here in the museum you can also see a hokey but fascinating video about Camille, the most severe hurricane ever recorded.
Though seafood no longer plays quite so pronounced a role in the local economy as it once did, the city continues to mark the opening of the shrimping season with the Blessing of the Fleet. It includes a parade of decorated boats in Biloxi Harbor that moves past a "blessing boat," on which a Catholic bishop stands, sprinkling each vessel with holy water. Next year the event will be heldon May 1 and 2.
We'd booked ourselves into the Father Ryan House (built in 1841), a B & B distinguished by the giant palm tree growing out of the middle of the front steps. Another good B & B in town is Green Oaks, Biloxi's oldest remaining beachfront house, which is surrounded by old live oaks, and elegantly appointed with period furnishings.
Back at the Father Ryan House, neither Sam nor I cares much about the antique furnishings or the glasses of wine that have been placed in the dining room for guests. That's because Sam has discovered that the house was once the home of Father Abram Ryan, who was known as the poet-priest of the Confederacy. On a credenza he finds a copy of Ryan's poetry, and reads aloud:
Old trees! old trees! in your mystic gloom
There's many a warrior laid,
And many a nameless and lonely tomb
Is sheltered beneath your shade.
"Do you want to go back to the cemetery with me and do some grave rubbings?" I ask when Sam finishes reading the poem. But Sam says enough is enough, and we go out for a hamburger instead.

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES;
Before the Prosperity, There Was Barbecue

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: LAWNSIDE

 BODY:
When the Olympic champion Carl Lewis came home to Willingboro to accept an award earlier this year, he brought a couple of friends, Oprah Winfrey and her boyfriend Steadman Graham. Word had it that before the ceremony, the three sneaked over to this town in Camden County.
If so, they would not have been the first. Sarah Vaughan used to do it all the time when she performed in Philadelphia or New York. So did Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Louis and Jersey Joe Walcott. 
 For more than a half-century, people of all stripes flocked here, the oldest incorporated black community in the Northeast, to try out one of its many barbecue joints.
No more.
This summer, the last bar serving barbecue here, Hilly's Place, closed its doors. Down a bit on Evesham Avenue, the cement porch sign announcing "Gerry's Family Barbeque" with its painted pig head, is there, but the ramshackle dining room and open-pit cooking area have been demolished. Other signs announce "BBQ" and "Soul Food," but the signs on the buildings behind them read "For Sale." Around the corner on the White Horse Pike, even the relatively new Classic Kitchen has shut its doors.
"An era has clearly ended in Lawnside," said Linda Waller, president of the Lawnside Historical Society. "But who knows if it is a bad thing?"
In reality, Lawnside is having something of an economic revival. Settled by free blacks in the 19th century, this town of 2,800 has long been a working-class black town tucked behind affluent neighbors like Haddonfield, Tavistock and Cherry Hill. But in recent years, a large shopping center has replaced an abandoned orchard, and a former trash dump will be the site of town houses selling in the six figures. The land where Gerry's and Hilly's recently stood may be similarly developed before long.
But that does not stop people like Clarence H. Still, a lifelong borough resident and unofficial historian here, from having a few pangs of nostalgia.
"It's definitely missed by the older group," said Mr. Still. "Us older folks will talk about the neighborhood, remembering things that happened there."
Lawnside was a center of black clubs and amusement parks in another boom time, the 1920's, when some entrepreneurs took an open field near a commercial area by Evesham Avenue and the White Horse Pike and turned it into a sort of amusement park.
"I'm almost 78 and I was like 5 or 6 years old and the first thing I remember, there was a picnic grove," said Spencer C. Moore, who now lives in nearby Magnolia. "There was a club, the Cotton Club, and they put up a nice pavilion with wooden benches and tables. One thing led to another and they got a liquor license and then they enclosed it and had shows in there."
By the 1930's, a stream on the property was dammed up and two lakes for swimming and boating were formed. Summers found a swimming pool filled and one local man with an eye for a dollar set up arcade games, even a Ferris wheel. The clientele was almost exclusively black.
"Things thrived because of segregation," said Mr. Still. "There had been nowhere for black folks to come to be comfortable and be entertained. Clubs grew up across the street. It became the place to go. I'd sit on my porch as a kid and see buses and buses. Black folks on double-decker buses from Philadelphia, and then touring buses from Ohio and North Carolina and who knows where else."
And when people wanted to eat, they wanted to eat something familiar.
"Everyone tried to outdo the other one with the cooking," said Mr. Still. "That was a big attraction. "Was it Southern-style barbecue? No, it was Lawnside-style. People started asking for their barbecue that way."
Mr. Still and Mr. Moore said Lawnside-style barbecue probably got its reputation because people were eating it while they were in a partying mood, so they were predisposed to think it was the greatest.
At least through the 1940's, the entertainment district thrived. Even Philadelphia didn't have the reputation among blacks for partying that the little town 10 miles to the east did. There was the Whippoorwill Club, just inside the Magnolia town line, and next to that was Wilcox's Cafe. Then on down to Harrison's Barbecue and Hilly's and Dreamland and the Cotton Club.
"There was also Showell's Tea Room, where they didn't ever serve tea," said Mr. Moore. "The gimmick was they would serve the liquor in teacups and teapots.
"And then there was a guy named A. B. Johnson who had a joint, a bar without too much entertainment," he added in reverie. "Johnson was a bully when he had a couple of drinks. He bullied this little guy named Brown. Brownie went home and got a shotgun. He came back into the bar and shot it through the handrail. But that is where A. B.'s arm was, and in the end, he had to have it amputated."
As segregation dwindled and blacks were more welcome in what were once white city entertainment districts, Lawnside became less of a draw. Through the 1960's and 70's, there was still a lot of partying on Saturday nights, but it was mostly local. By the early 1990's, the bars ceased to offer entertainment, but there were still some barbecue joints filled on weekend evenings.
"In recent years, they just didn't draw," said Mr. Waller of the Lawnside Historical Society. "When the shopping center went in, that was the last straw. There was more reason to hang out there. I'm glad it's doing well, because it's good for the economy here. But we have lost just about every family-owned business, including the barbecue places. On the whole, it is good, but you lose something when local people don't run things."
And at least Lawnside barbecue has found its niche.
"People just do it at home now,' said Mr. Still. "It smells just as good around here on a summer night. They just don't sell it any more. Every once in a while, a church has a barbecue night -- fish, chicken, ribs. It's real good. Then us in the older group can sit back and tell stories. Entertain the young ones."
And eat.

HEADLINE: It's a Law. Estate Owners Will Keep Their Distance.

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: BERNARDSVILLE

 BODY:
Grazing cows were about the only residents of Meadowbrook Farm visible from Mine Brook Road here on a brilliant fall morning last week, when the wooded Somerset hills were ablaze with the colors of autumn. Mayor Hugh Fenwick would no doubt have been pleased.
In a move that the popular Mayor said is intended to protect the environment, limit flash-flooding around the town's lower elevations and preserve Bernardsville's rural character, the Borough Council approved an ordinance on Oct. 18 that limits the size of houses based on the size of their lots. 
 The ordinance will work like this: A house on a three-acre lot will be allowed to take up 5 percent of the lot, or 6,534 square feet. A house on a five-acre lot will be permitted to take up 4 percent of the lot, or 8,712 square feet.
"We have traditionally, in Bernardsville, been rural, country, whatever the word," said Mr. Fenwick, who lives on a 17-acre estate (the house is not visible from Mendham Road) left to him by his late mother, Milicent Fenwick, who represented the area in Congress for eight years before her death in 1983. "One of the ways we have been able to be that way is to have a few wealthy people build very large houses on very large properties, so they did not encroach on the road."
While Bernardsville is not exactly being invaded by the Beverly Hillbillies, the new wealth generated by the region's economic prosperity has prompted a boom in which ever-larger houses are rising on lots that could hardly be called country estates. In the exclusive Bernardsville Mountain section, traditional refuge of the landed gentry, the new houses tend to be close to the road and highly visible.
Currently, the 62-year-old Mr. Fenwick said, the limitations specify merely that houses on lots of three acres or more lots be set back at least 125 feet in front and 75 feet on the sides. That has allowed for a proliferation of what some local planners have taken to call McMansions -- squeezed together in all their gaudy suburbanization.
"When we looked at our protection against what might be called wall-to-wall housing, we had nothing to protect us from houses that might be 150 feet apart, but the house might be 200 feet long," Mr. Fenwick said.
To be sure, not everyone agrees with the new restrictions. James F. Williams, one of two members of the six-member council to vote against the ordinance, said it would force some residents whose houses are already near the size limit to apply for a variance before building a cabana, guest house or other structure.
"To me, all you're doing is driving many of our existing residents to the Board of Adjustment," Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Williams, who himself lives in a relatively modest Cape Cod, said he did not like the thought of rows of inappropriately large houses, either. But, the 58-year-old councilman added, "unfortunately, you can't legislate taste."
Mr. Fenwick conceded that the ordinance could give the impression -- falsely, he insisted -- that the town's landed gentry were trying to tell the new 90's millionaires and other nouveaux riches how to spend their ample disposable income.
The newly rich are fine with him.
"We are allowed to plan the way we would like the town to look," he said, "so in doing that, it could look like the old money would be trying to tell the new how they should be spending their money. I would not be in favor of doing that. I don't like the message it sends.
He added: "It doesn't bother me that we have the second-highest income in the fourth-richest county in the United States. That doesn't bother me. People with money don't bother me."
The ordinance, which goes into effect tomorrow, is merely a precaution, Mr. Fenwick said. Anyone who has already applied for planning board approval or a building permit is exempt from the ordinance, he said.
Patrick O'Keefe, executive director of the New Jersey Builders Association, declined to comment, other than to say that size is not necessarily a factor in the profitability of a house.
Even if the ordinance is intended to curb the consciousness of consumption among the economic boom's beneficiaries, it could be for their own good, said one local builder, who preferred to remain anonymous.
"We've got people who spend money like it's going out of style that we call the nouveaux riches," said the builder. "Those are the people the Mayor and council are protecting. Because if this bubble bursts, they're never going to afford that."

HEADLINE: Mayors and Their Challengers;
Incumbents Cite Achievements, and Contenders Appear Undaunted by the Odds Against Them

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
WHEN Mary Margaret Mulrooney was an assistant district attorney in the Bronx, a judge nicknamed her the bulldog. As she seeks to unseat Mayor John D. Spencer of Yonkers, she says the name still fits.
"Whether it's a court case or a political cause, when I sink my teeth into something, I shake my head and don't let go," Ms. Mulrooney said last week. She is a 46-year-old Democrat and a lawyer in private practice. Mayor Spencer is a 52-year-old Republican and a former city councilman. 
 The candidate challenging Mr. Spencer shares similar characteristics with two other mayoral hopefuls, although each comes from a different background. All three challengers are relatively unknown but apparently undaunted by the odds against them.
In Mount Vernon, the odds that favor incumbents have actually encouraged Emilio John Bosco Jr., a Democrat who is running on the Republican, Independence and Liberal tickets against Mayor Ernest D. Davis, also a Democrat and the one who got the Democratic nomination.
"I'm a man who loves a challenge," said Mr. Bosco, a retired 56-year-old businessman with no political experience who ran in a field of five candidates for Mayor four years ago, and came in second with 32 percent of the vote. "I look for things that take chutzpah." As a young man, Mr. Bosco served with the Army's 101st Airborne Division, and in 1962 he was a personal guard to James Meredith, the first black person to attend the University of Mississippi.
But Hank Bartels of New Rochelle says it takes more than guts and grit to unseat an incumbent. Mr. Bartels, 41, a Republican and Conservative who is running against Mayor Timothy C. Idoni, a Democrat, said, "It also takes a thick-skinned, even-tempered candidate who's willing to persevere against the odds and fight for his ideas."
In addition to their personality traits, the challengers share something else in common: their belief that in a prosperous economy, the incumbents have sought out big business ventures at the expense of small and middle-size entrepreneurs.
In Yonkers, Ms. Mulrooney said that the current administration favors condominium development and private use of the waterfront over businesses like restaurants and convention centers, for example, which would attract the public to the Hudson River's shores.
In Mount Vernon, Mr. Bosco wants to bring back the little stores and neighborhoods in place of the Mayor Davis's plan to build a large hotel and convention center.
And in New Rochelle, Mr. Bartels, the son of blue-collar workers, said he was concerned that Mr. Idoni's efforts to see the city grow are leaving out the neighborhood merchants who once formed the city's backbone. He said discussions of taking land by eminent domain for giant stores have frightened downtown residents. "Mr. Idoni's vision is not the people's vision," Mr. Bartels said. "Mine is."
In response to their challengers, the incumbents cited their accomplishments in office and their opposition's lack of government experience. None of the three challengers has held an elected office. The incumbents brushed aside complaints and criticism as political rhetoric and distortions of the facts.
William Dentzer, a spokesman for Mayor Spencer, said Ms. Mulrooney was manufacturing issues.
The mayor's campaign literature counts among his achievements in office the reduction in the city's income tax surcharge, the first no-property-tax-increase budget in 30 years, the end to the oversight by the state's Emergency Financial Control Board, a 21 percent decrease in crime, record increases in state financing of schools, control over where and how to build new dwellings in the 19-year-old housing desegregation case and the ability for the school district to design its own curriculum to correct the effects of desegregation, among other things.
Mr. Spencer also cites the beginning of a public and private revitalization of the waterfront and downtown area by securing county, state and Federal financing, elimination of graffiti with strict laws and the establishment of professional management training in City Hall and performance-based evaluations.
The Mayor would not allow a photographer to take his picture, saying that other photographs had already been taken and he did not want his time wasted. "Every time I do an interview with the media, they distort the issues, and they make a controversy when one doesn't exist," he said, explaining why he declined to be interviewed. "The media ruins people's lives."
Ms. Mulrooney has criticized Mr. Spencer, who is running on the Republican, Independence, Conservative and Right to Life tickets, for being inaccessible and remote -- a charge Mr. Spencer denies.
Ms. Mulrooney, who has made a campaign promise to do away with some of the Mayor's powers -- specifically the ability to appoint school board members -- also blames Mr. Spencer for creating the divisive atmosphere between the school board and teachers that preceded a four-day walkout by teachers this fall.
As the election approaches on Tuesday for the full-time job that will pay $133,000 a year beginning in January, Ms. Mulrooney is banking on the tendency of the state's fourth-largest city to favor political upstarts. In 1979, for example, a brash young Democratic City Councilman, Gerald E. Loehr, ousted the incumbent Mayor, Angelo R. Martinelli, with a campaign promise of restoring fiscal integrity to Yonkers and of eliminating the divisiveness that he said had often characterized the city's politics. In 1987, Nicholas C. Wasicsko, a City Councilman, won the mayoral race in an upset of Mr. Martinelli -- who by that time was a six-term Mayor. In 1991, Mr. Martinelli, again the favored candidate and hoping to make a comeback, lost his bid to Terence M. Zaleski, the son of a factory worker and a onetime science teacher and lawyer.
"It has been known to happen," Ms. Mulrooney said.
In Mount Vernon, Mayor Davis, 61, said his opponent, Mr. Bosco, was also manufacturing issues. He said his achievements spoke for themselves: new jobs for residents, a reduced crime rate (burglaries down by 29.4 percent and robberies down by 30.6 percent), more than $1 million invested in low interest loans to rehabilitate housing, real estate values up 12 percent and the smallest tax increases in a decade.
Mr. Bosco questioned Mayor Davis's effort to refinance Levister Towers, a low-cost housing development, which Mr. Bosco said has been the victim of "uncaring, neglectful and incompetent management." He has also said that the Mayor's repairs to Memorial Field have not been enough, and that he should be doing more. Mr. Bosco also said that Mount Vernon needs to be run more like a business that treats taxpayers as stockholders.
Mr. Davis said, "Mr. Bosco thinks you can take a problem like Levister Towers and cure it overnight with a wave of a magic wand." Mr. Davis has proposed bringing in a developer and restructuring the housing project so that tenants can become stakeholders.
"People will be able to afford to live there," Mr. Davis said. "No one will be removed, and we will get payments for back taxes. How can you criticize that?"
The same argument about overnight miracles applies to Memorial Field, the Mr. Davis said, adding that the city is developing a master plan for the ballpark and working closely with the county on it.
As for government being run like a business, Mr. Davis said: "What does that mean? Businesses sell products and make profits. The purpose of government is to empower people and protect them and help them do things they can't do by themselves. If profit is the motive, then something is seriously off, because services like garbage removal and paving are not profitable, even though they are important."
The full-time mayor's job in Mount Vernon pays $80,000 a year.
In New Rochelle, Mr. Idoni, 44, is seeking a third term and relying on his record.
"Who would have thought just a few short years ago that New Rochelle would have a nationally recognized entertainment center instead of a broken-down mall in its downtown?" Mr. Idoni's campaign literature says.
Mr. Idoni, a part-time mayor who earns $63,500 a year, said he is proud that, among other things, luxury rental apartments and a park have replaced vacant lots on Huguenot Street, that crime has dropped more than 30 percent and that the city's most recent tax increase was less than 1 percent.
"The opposition just needs to find something wrong with our efforts," he said.
Answering the concerns of Mr. Bartels about where medium-size businesses fit into the plan, Mr. Idoni said the city is already courting ladies apparel retailers, shoe stores and enterprises like Borders Books and Music for its downtown.
Mr. Bartels, a marketer and manager for a dental materials concern, said the city -- in addition to encouraging small and medium-size businesses -- needs more consistent law enforcement to promote safer streets and cleaner neighborhoods. A member of the school board and co-president of the Halycon Park Neighborhood Association, he said he backs more accessible parking, lower property taxes for the school district and holding the line on city taxes.
 
Peekskill Window of Opportunity for Democrats
 
PEEKSKILL
WITH this city's 73-year-old incumbent Republican Mayor, Frances S. Gibbs, stepping down after three terms, the race for the top spot here has opened up the possibility that for the first time in 38 years, there might be a Democratic Mayor.
Mayor Gibbs's retirement has also generated discussion on two pressing issues that arose during her current term, when Peekskill residents were arrested for speaking out at public meetings and when residents accused city officials of racism for their efforts to install cameras in housing projects where minority groups live and also on public streets.
The questions are whether surveillance cameras are the answer to the city's crime problem and how to make government more responsive. Although Mayor Gibbs supported the use of cameras and opposed residents' speaking on issues not previously scheduled for discussion at City Council meetings, not even John J. Kelly 3d, the Republican candidate in this race, has taken a similar stand.
In the election two years ago, Mr. Kelly, 42, ran against Mayor Gibbs on the Conservative and Independence Party Lines and describes himself as a reform Republican. He is distancing himself from members of his party who associated themselves with Mayor Gibbs.
"The current G.O.P. does not have its finger on the pulse of the public and is not open to criticism or new ideas," Mr. Kelly said. "I'm part of the new Republicans, not the old breed."
Mr. Kelly, a former history teacher and a school administrator in Orange County, said he supports more open public meetings -- "although not a circus atmosphere," he said. And although he said he supports the limited use of surveillance cameras in parking garages and at public pools, he said he does not back their use on streets and other public places, where a traditional police force should be stationed, he said. He is also running on the Independence and Conservative lines.
Opposing Mr. Kelly is Eileen Yajure, 40, who said she wants to be the first Democratic Mayor since 1961."Sometimes when one party is entrenched for so long, officials start acting like the king and queen of the court, and they are stunned when their authority is questioned," she said. "My response is, 'Hello, this is a democracy!' "
Ms. Yajure said she opposes the use of surveillance cameras in public places and she promised to make city government more responsive."The greatest need of Peekskill's citizens is to be listened to and to have a relationship with government," she said.
Looking ahead to the coming two-year term, Mr. Kelly said Peekskill's greatest need "is to get aggressive in promoting the economic development of the downtown."
The part-time mayoral position pays $12,000 a year. Mr. Kelly said that because the Mayor's job is to set policy, he would be able to attend to both his school administrative duties and his responsibilities as Mayor.
Ms. Yajure, who works as a freelance computer software consultant, also said that she had no worries about balancing two sets of responsibilities. ELSA BRENNER

The Econobox Turns a Corner and Picks Up Some Edge

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
JUDGING by the models arriving in dealer showrooms this fall, one might think that small-car sales are booming and profits from economy models are soaring.
But the opposite is true. The small-car market has been in a slump for nearly three years as cheap gasoline and stable vehicle prices have drawn buyers to larger vehicles, including sport utilities. Profits from small cars are negligible to nonexistent. 
 Still, auto makers must churn out small, fuel-efficient automobiles to help bring down their federally mandated corporate fuel economy averages, which are being pulled higher by brisk sales of big, gas-guzzling vehicles. In addition, econoboxes are aimed largely at young, often first-time buyers, a group expected to grow to as much as a third of the market by 2005, according to J. D. Power & Associates, the market research company.
Despite the doldrums in the small-car market, the auto makers' latest efforts to lure buyers to their much-improved products have been valiant.
Last spring, DaimlerChrysler revamped its Neon for the 2000 model year, giving it a more grown-up look but maintaining its fun-to-drive character. This fall, Toyota introduced the Echo, an unusual-looking small car with a price that starts around $10,000. Saturn has spruced up its dated S-Series, and in the spring Nissan will bring out a new Sentra, which is expected to be certified in California as the world's first gasoline-powered "super ultra low emission" vehicle. Honda will revise the segment's best-seller, the Civic, next year.
Among the most impressive small cars of recent years, however, is a new entry, the Ford Focus, which melds edgy styling with a spacious interior and superb handling.
After a month with four versions of the Focus -- the base and midlevel sedans, the station wagon and the sporty, top-line sedan -- I concluded that the car is well suited to buyers who want more than basic transportation, but still want an entry-level price. It is a subcompact I could happily live with.
The Focus, which began arriving in dealer showrooms on Oct. 1, is intended to replace the Escort eventually, but for now that car will stay around; the Focus is priced and sized between the Escort and the compact Contour. The Focus comes as a ZX3 hatchback, a wagon and a sedan in three versions -- the base LX, the big-volume SE and the sporty ZTS. The American car is virtually identical to the one introduced in Europe a year ago, which auto writers voted European Car of the Year.
Like the Mercury Cougar, the Focus is cloaked in a rather extreme example of Ford's New Edge styling, which features crisp lines and taut surfaces. The Focus won't be mistaken for anything else on the road. I found more people liked its look than hated it, and few were indifferent.
The interior is unusually spacious for a small car, with a high roofline that comfortably accommodates 6-footers. Rear legroom is among the best in class. The very supportive seats are raised higher than in most small cars, and entry and exit is easy through tall, wide doors. If nearly 13 cubic feet of trunk space isn't enough, one simply folds the split rear seats to add capacity.
To anyone accustomed to the clean, generic interiors of small Japanese cars, the Focus seems awfully busy, a puzzle of assorted geometric shapes. Still, the pieces fit snugly and the interior materials seemed to be of good quality.
The controls are large and easy to operate; the gauges use large numbers, making them easy to read.
Ford said it used human and electronic testers to insure a pleasant new-car smell, but I still detected the acrid odor of plastic parts that haven't cured long enough.
The Focus has many conveniences, including a steering wheel that tilts and telescopes, a height-adjustable driver's seat, useful cup holders and a console with storage space and a pen holder.
Safety features include seatbelts with pretensioners and retractors to keep occupants in the safest position in a crash, child safety seat anchors and an emergency release in the trunk. Side air bags are optional at $350. Anti-lock brakes, standard on the ZTS, cost $400 on other models.
After driving away, Focus buyers receive a welcome package in the mail from Ford, part of a youth-oriented marketing campaign that includes live television ads and Webcasts. The welcome items include a watch; a picture frame that attaches to the dashboard; an expandable, megasized cup holder, and a sunglass case. To further personalize the car, as young buyers often do, Ford plans to sell several accessory packages: one for pet owners has a color-coordinated water bowl, among other things; a Friends Package has seat covers, a candy dispenser and an ice cooler.
I could do without the candy or dog bowl. The car's driving dynamics would seal the deal.
This little car is darn fun to drive. It reminded me of Ford's sporty Puma, a wonderful coupe sold overseas.
The Focus is available with two 2-liter, four-cylinder engines, either a 110-horsepower, single-cam version or the 130-horsepower, dual-cam Zetec, which is standard on the GTS and ZX3. Transmission choices are a five-speed manual or a new electronically controlled four-speed automatic.
The dual-cam engine puts the Focus in a league with the peppy Dodge Neon and versions of the Civic that have a zippy Honda engine with variable valve timing. It handily accelerated onto the freeway even when carrying five adults. The base engine did not measure up so well, however, and it felt especially sluggish in the heavier station wagon, where it is the only engine available.
Regardless of the engine or the trim level, the Focus handles crisply and responsively. The steering is precise and the brakes feel sturdy. The ride is comfortable for a car of this size, though road noise is excessive, especially in the back seat.
The Focus hatchback starts at $12,280, sedans at $12,540 and the wagon at $15,795. The prices seemed attractive when they were announced last spring, but Toyota upstaged Ford by putting a sticker of $9,995, plus shipping, on the Echo hatchback.
With its edgy styling, ample space for people and cargo, great handling and numerous features, the Focus makes a big impression. It is a lot of small car for the money.

HEADLINE: Bitter Pills for Ailing Hospitals

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
"I COULD take off my shoe and show you I don't have a cloven hoof," said David Hunter, putting a self-mocking spin on his contentious line of work.
Famous as a slash-and-burn cost-cutter who can do the dirty work that floundering hospitals cannot bring themselves to tackle on their own, Mr. Hunter is often greeted as the Devil incarnate. No one's job is safe when his 70-member consulting firm, Hunter Group, wields the axe: along with thousands of clerks, technicians, nurses, doctors and other workers, Hunter has recently displaced chief executives at major university-affiliated teaching hospitals in Chicago, Detroit and San Francisco. The company's latest emergency rescue plan is for the premier medical center in Philadelphia. 
 No question, these institutions and others like them are staring at daunting problems. Battered by big cuts in Medicare payments, rising drug costs and managed care plans that force them into below-cost deals, teaching hospitals around the country face mounting financial stresses. The hardest-pressed among them, generally large hospitals in inner cities, find themselves with no choice but to cut costs drastically to keep their doors open.
That is when Mr. Hunter, 54, a no-nonsense management expert with 11 years of experience operating on wounded hospitals, is called in by hospital trustees. "If they are using guys like us," he said, "the problems have to be enormous." He calls the hostile reception he often gets "a shoot-the-messenger issue," adding that "the problems were there before we got involved."
But critics say Hunter Group's shock therapy endangers the triple mission of the medical centers: educating doctors, treating patients of all income levels and conducting the breakthrough medical research that has little or no place at for-profit hospitals. Officials of medical faculty associations and nursing unions, for example, say the job cuts tend to be of the meat-axe, across-the-board variety, hitting vital services as hard as ancillary areas.
"What is happening today is the invisible destruction of the great academic medical centers," said Dr. William M. Kelley, chief executive of the financially troubled University of Pennsylvania Health System. "We will be more efficient and able to deliver care at a lower price, but we will not be able to do the things that made us great," like experimenting with new surgical procedures.
"Our ability to develop the medicine of tomorrow is going away," Dr. Kelley said.
Academic medical centers play a vital role in American health care that is important even to people who never set foot in them. They treat the toughest cases and train the best new doctors, who often hone their skills serving the poor before beginning practice elsewhere. Teaching hospitals develop and test new medicines and surgical procedures on the frontiers of medical knowledge. In many cities, academic medical centers are also the largest employers of both skilled and entry-level workers.
But as inflation in health care revs up after a four-year lull, the great hospitals are under growing pressure from Government and private payers to take yet another tuck in their world-class expenses.
Hunter Group's forte is emergency work, and it loses no time once an engagement begins. Teams of operations and finance experts move from the home base of St. Petersburg, Fla., into nearby hotels and motels and shuttle to the troubled hospital in hired limousines and rental cars paid for by the client.
Referring frequently to a portfolio of "benchmarks" like the ratio of nurses to beds or floor polishers per square foot, drawn from consulting stints at 100 hospitals across the country, they analyze the hospital's operations from the wards and surgical suites to the billing department to the executive suite. "We take a real hard look at the expense side," Mr. Hunter said.
Within 14 weeks in most cases, the consultants present a plan to a steering committee of hospital board members and senior management:
 
 * Cut jobs 20 percent, they said in Philadelphia, where the prestigious University of Pennsylvania Medical Center had an operating loss of $198 million the year ended June 30. Late this month, the hospital said that it would eliminate 2,800 health services jobs out of 14,000 over the next 14 months.
* Close a money-losing satellite hospital that serves the poor, they said in San Francisco, where a merger of two nationally acclaimed hospital systems was bleeding $2 million a month in operating losses. Though the two medical centers, those of Stanford University and the University of California at San Francisco, said on Thursday that they would dissolve the merger, U.C.S.F. said it would go ahead with the closing of in-patient and emergency room services at Mount Zion Hospital. A similar recommendation in Detroit led to the closing of Mount Sinai Hospital there.
* Find a new chief executive, they said in Detroit, Chicago and San Francisco. Someone from Hunter will mind the store in the meantime: David Hunter himself became interim chief executive of California-Stanford; what his role will be after the dissolution of the merger was not clear on Friday. A longtime aide of Mr. Hunter ran the Detroit Medical Center and later the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center.
* Flatten management, reduce the numbers of laboratory tests and electrocardiograms, get rid of hundreds of salaried physicians, reduce support money flowing to medical education from patient fees and pare teaching budgets, they say nearly everywhere.
* When the financial problems seem intractable, simply sell the hospital. An 80 percent stake in the George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, for example, was sold in 1997 to a for-profit chain, Universal Health Services.
The discussions between the Hunter team and the client hospital can be tense, said a top hospital executive who has participated in such meetings.
Not every recommendation is accepted: in Boston, the New England Medical Center spurned a Hunter Group proposal that it should sell out to a for-profit company, later arranging its own merger with a nonprofit health care system in Providence. But it is hard for hospital boards to say no when management is temporarily ceded to the consultants.
Rank-and-file doctors, nurses and technicians at the hospitals say they get little or no chance to contribute suggestions or influence the consultants' decisions on cuts. "We knew we were on the chopping block," said a nurse at the San Francisco hospital. "We heard about it on the whisper circuit."
Hunter Group gets the lion's share of assignments to turn around troubled academic medical centers, said Larry Lewin, director of hospital strategy for Lewin Group, a Washington-based consulting firm. But a growing number of health care turnaround firms are competing for the business, and Ernst & Young, the giant accounting and consulting firm, also jumped in recently.
Candidates for the consultants' ministrations have been exploding in number since last year's cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals. The nation's 120 academic medical centers operate 200 hospitals, but some hospital executives doubt that they can all survive without severe cutbacks and closings. A survey of its members by the University Health System Consortium of 80 big teaching hospitals last summer found that two in five had losses in operations in their most recent quarterly results.
In New York City, the five big academic medical centers are headed for a drop of $100 million in their combined annual operating income this year, and shortfalls at the three teaching hospitals of the State University of New York are straining the university system's statewide budget.
"Academic medical centers are the crown jewels of our health system," said Dr. Bernard Ferrari, a consultant at McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm. "They often deliver the most expensive care to the people who are least able to pay. They are an endangered species." A handful have large endowments or other sources of investment income that have tided them over while the stock market has been booming, but even they are now struggling with declining revenue.
Medical schools are attracting fewer applicants than they were a few years ago, but health care economists debate whether the centers are still training too many specialists, too many general practice doctors, or both. Though union officials and politicians stress the importance of the centers in providing tens of thousands of jobs and vital health services for low-income people in cities, deteriorating finances are robbing many of them of the ability to play these roles and still be self-sustaining.
"It is questionable whether Boston, Philadelphia, Washington and New York can support multiple big medical school organizations," Mr. Hunter said.
The hospitals that recently sought help from Hunter Group all have especially steep losses.
The Detroit Medical Center posted operating losses of $160 million last year and $93 million in the first seven months of 1999. The University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia lost $288 million on operations in the last two years.
University of California-Stanford Health Care projected a $65 million surplus for the first two years after it was created by merging the hospitals of Stanford and the University of California in November 1997. The projection was over-optimistic by $111 million; the center lost $46 million. The two top executives at California-Stanford resigned last August.
Still, in some cases, critics say, Hunter-inspired economizing made it harder, not easier, to stanch the losses. Senior physicians at the New England Medical Center said it took much longer for the hospital to collect outstanding bills after it made deep cuts in its billing department. At the same hospital, a profit-generating liver transplant unit was out of action for a week until replacements could be found for blood bank technicians whose jobs were cut.
But Mr. Hunter's fans point to a return to profitability at beleaguered hospitals in several cities as evidence that broadly, his methods work.
Mr. Hunter, a former hospital executive at Duke University and in Mount Holly, N.J., started Hunter Group with two partners in 1988. Mr. Hunter and his partners sold the firm to 16 of its executives last year for an undisclosed price. Mr. Hunter stayed on as chief executive on contract and retains a financial interest in the company.
"We can do things that existing management can't do," he said in a recent conversation on the front porch of his century-old stone house in Newtown, Pa., outside Philadelphia. For one thing, most academic medical centers operate by consensus among turf-guarding medical superstars not known for small egos. Decision-making in such an environment can be excruciatingly slow, and resistance to outside criticism can run high.
"Ninety-five percent of our members are trying to keep David Hunter out of their institutions," said Robert Baker, president of the University Health System Consortium.
When the Hunter Group is brought in, it is typically for a few months of drastic cutting. "We're not there long term," Mr. Hunter said, and clients rarely sign up for a return engagement. "They never want to go through it again."
Many of the problems that lead a medical center to call the Hunter Group were all too evident in the short, unhappy merger in the San Francisco area.
Stanford Health Services and the University of California San Francisco Medical Center both ranked among the nation's top 10 hospitals in independent surveys before their merger, which was motivated by a desire to overcome the challenges of operating in the vortex of one of the nation's most intense markets for health care plans.
The merger, however, just made the financial problems worse, at least for the short run. Instead of cutting staffs and eliminating duplication, the merged entity wound up adding 1,000 employees, including new managers to coordinate hospitals 40 miles apart at Palo Alto and San Francisco. Unforeseen millions were spent on computers and consultants, including $100 million for Year 2000 upgrades.
Desperate to reverse the trend, the hospital's board called in Hunter Group, at a cost of $414,000 a month plus expenses.
The consultants found that the merged medical centers were spending $15,000 more for each patient than other large hospitals did, reflecting teaching, research and treating the indigent. The number of emergency patients increased sharply, adding to unreimbursed costs last year, after the medical center expanded emergency room capacity at its main hospital in San Francisco.
To attack the cost problems, Hunter consultants negotiated staff reductions with the medical school faculty and the managers of hospital departments and examined ways to get better prices on supplies. Taking care of poor people is both a duty and a financial drag. The merged medical center loses $80 million annually on uncovered services to Medicaid patients, said Peter Van Etten, who was chief executive until August.
Susan Cieutat, a pediatric intensive care nurse who is active in the California Nurses Association, said cuts in staffing levels are causing problems. "There used to be one nurse for three or four patients," she said. "Now it's five or six patients. Nurses are exhausted, stressed, demoralized. Many are looking for work elsewhere."
Mr. Hunter acknowledges that cutting the nursing staff can be delicate because good nursing is crucial to quality of care. And in some places there is a shortage of nurses ready to do stressful jobs. "It's more 'Can we get them?' than 'Can we cut them?' " he said.
As for revenues, Mr. Hunter proposed trying to renegotiate contracts with managed care companies that were based on capitation -- a flat monthly fee for each health plan member -- or on fixed day rates for hospital care; both are money-losers for the hospital, he said, and it would be better off with a fee schedule that varies with the patient's diagnosis. That will not be easy in California, a bastion of managed care.
The cost of care for poor people poses an even more difficult revenue problem. Costs that hospitals have to swallow have been rising as health plans raise their premiums, causing a growing number of working people who are not eligible for Medicaid to drop their coverage. Hospitals are stuck with much of the cost of caring for such patients.
In the glory years before the managed care squeeze and Medicare cutbacks, payments from patients subsidized teaching and research. No longer. Dr. Warren Gold, chairman of the U.C.S.F. medical school faculty association, noted that Hunter Group had recommended "a major cutback in payments from professional fees" -- the money faculty doctors bring in when they treat patients at the hospital -- to finance teaching and research. Instead, according to Dr. Lee Goldman, the acting dean of the medical school, the main concern was to retain money in the hospital to buy state-of-the-art equipment like $3 million gamma knives for delicate brain surgery.
"What is really at risk here is clinical innovation, the interface between a faculty that does research and tries to make advances, and the clinical care," Dr. Goldman said.
"The U.S. is indisputably the leader in this," he added. "In the 1860's it was Germany. Now everybody comes here. It's a great American triumph. But we could screw it up."
But the real choice facing the most troubled medical centers, Mr. Hunter argued, is not one of preserving research financing or cutting it back; it is a choice of ruthlessly cutting expenses or closing the doors. Like it or not, the money to operate the old way simply will not be there in the future, he said.
Mr. Hunter predicted that revenues at academic medical centers would fall by at least 10 percent a year for the foreseeable future, though he acknowledged his estimate might be colored by his close-up knowledge of hospitals in deep trouble. "We're not," he said, "looking at the Miss Americas."

An article last Sunday about the Hunter Group, a consulting firm that advises teaching hospitals on financial problems, quoted incorrectly from remarks by Dr. Warren Gold, chairman of the medical school faculty association of the University of California at San Francisco, about cost-cutting proposals for the merged medical centers of that university and Stanford. Dr. Gold said the Hunter Group had recommended "a major cutback in physician practice support payments" -- that is, subsidies given by the medical center to faculty members who provide primary care to patients there. He did not say "a major cutback in payments from professional fees" to finance teaching and research.

When the University of California and Stanford University agreed to merge their teaching hospitals in the San Francisco area in 1997, they hoped to gain economies of scale. Instead, costs kept rising and remained far above those of similar hospitals. Hunter Group, a consulting firm, told the board that 2,000 employees would have to be laid off to make the merged hospitals financially viable. The troubled merger was dissolved last week, but the cuts are already underway.

Safety features include seatbelts with pretensioners and retractors to keep occupants in the safest position in a crash, child safety seat anchors and an emergency release in the trunk. Side air bags are optional at $350. Anti-lock brakes, standard on the ZTS, cost $400 on other models.
After driving away, Focus buyers receive a welcome package in the mail from Ford, part of a youth-oriented marketing campaign that includes live television ads and Webcasts.

Will Trade Acupuncture For Manicure and Pasta

BYLINE: By LYNN ERMANN 

 BODY:
IF she could, Amy Sacco would probably pay for everything with pasta. "So how hungry are you?" she slyly asks whenever she is given a hefty bill for equipment or services for her Chelsea restaurant and bar, Lot 61. She says she has exchanged food and drink for waitress uniforms, work on Lot 61's Web site, lamps and artwork.
Ms. Sacco is one of many New Yorkers who use the oldest form of commerce, barter. Natasha Septimus, a hair stylist who works out of the Warren-Tricomi salon in Midtown Manhattan, bartered with a dermatologist, trading cuts for skin treatments. Leslie Kimmel, a masseuse who also does nutrition counseling, has exchanged massages for everything from electrical work to office work. 
 Andrew D'Angelo, studio manager at Dance Manhattan in the Flatiron district and a swing dance instructor, trades lessons for massages, haircuts, acupuncture and even clothing. And Andrea Cohen and Jeffrey Bell, who own Bongo, another Chelsea restaurant, said they bartered drinks for much of their decor, from the aquamarine glassware over the bar to the signature postcards, as well as for haircuts.
Loot New York, a weekly publication that contains only classified advertising, offers testimony to the unusual variety of services and goods offered in trade. A recent ad proposed exchanging "100 hours of private lessons that should give you the head start you will need in swordsmanship in turn for one good running motorcycle." A woman wanted to trade Latin dance instruction for tennis lessons or Norwegian language lessons. (Her boyfriend, she said, is Norwegian and a tennis player.) Maybe you want a watch? Nick Denaro, who also advertised recently, was happy to oblige, but only in exchange for a fig tree.
Among artists, trading their work for goods and services is something of a tradition. "Bartering is pretty prevalent with artists," said Shelly Jacobson, a Manhattan accountant who has taken art in exchange for payment on several occasions. For her, she said, "it is a way of investing in art."
Susan Dobscha, an assistant professor of marketing at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., who has studied alternative economies, said bartering was becoming more mainstream. "It is not seen as people on the fringes," she said, especially in the era of the Internet, when trading with strangers has become easier than ever.
Though one-on-one bartering is tough to track, barter exchanges, groups that arrange trades of goods and services for members, appear to be on the rise nationwide. "We expect it to grow exponentially in the next few years," said Robin Maini, executive director of the International Reciprocal Trade Association, an industry trade group. Mr. Maini said there were 600 such barter groups, compared with 410 in 1986.
"The awareness of bartering has changed unbelievably" over the last decade, said Lois Dale, who founded Barter Advantage, a Manhattan corporate bartering company, in 1981. Since then, Barter Advantage's membership has grown to 1,500 from 200, she said.
Ms. Dale said it was no surprise that barter is popular in New York City. "We have so many people and such a variety of businesses here," she said.
Groups like Barter Advantage act as middlemen. Members typically pay a fee to join and receive some form of credit for the goods or services they provide, which they can exchange for goods or services offered by other members. Ms. Dale said she used the barter system for the delivery of her daughter 12 years ago; the obstetrician was a member of her exchange.
Barter exchanges range from the multinational to the neighborhood-based. In 1997, a group of Green Party members started the Brooklyn Greenbacks Project, creating a currency based on goods and services that participants are willing to barter.
Craig Seeman, the founder of Greenbacks, said the number of participants had doubled in the past year, to 300, including a chiropractor, an optometrist, a massage therapist, a florist, a book shop and a few lawyers, mostly in downtown and central Brooklyn. But the project is expanding, Mr. Seeman said. "We are making efforts to reach out to neighborhoods where there is a lack of capital," he said.
While barter exchanges may leave less to chance, members are limited in that they must use the goods and services offered within the group. But barter relationships between individuals can be tricky. In some cases, it's a matter of trusting a stranger to meet one's expectations. Ms. Kimmel, for example, traded diet counseling for help organizing her home office but soon found that the other woman was as lax with filing as she was with sticking to a weight-loss plan.
Ads placed in the paper can also yield unwanted results. "People just call up with services you didn't ask for," says Ron Stern, a chiropractor on the Upper West Side who advertised in Loot offering chiropractic treatment in exchange for help making a sign for his new business. One man, he said, called and offered salsa dance lessons. "Another fellow was doing wedding and bar mitzvah videos," he said. "One was a clown."
But when barter works, it can be very satisfying, some who have traded say. "Each party feels that they're getting the better deal," Ms. Septimus, the hair stylist, said. "You're doing something you do every day so it doesn't seem that exciting, but what you're getting seems great to you."
Bartering can make a big city like New York suddenly seem small, bringing together people whose paths might otherwise not cross. A recent Barter Advantage networking meeting included an exterminator, a psychic healer, a radio disk jockey, a public relations person and a woman with a lingerie business.
Ms. Sacco said she found that her barter clients were also her most loyal. "They're invested in a different way," she said.

If you barter property or services, the Internal Revenue Service says, the fair market value of whatever you receive in the trade must be counted as income on your tax return. Some examples of how it works:
 
* Say you are a lawyer with your own private practice. In other words, you are self-employed. You provide legal services for an Internet business that has gone public and the company gives you shares of its stock as payment for your services. You must include in income the fair market value of the shares in the year that you receive them.
 
* Say you own a small apartment building. An artist gives you one of her paintings in return for a rent-free six months in one of your apartments. You must report as rental income the fair market value of the art work. She must report as income the fair rental value of the apartment.
 
* Say you are a self-employed carpenter and you've joined a barter club that uses credit units as a means of exchange. It adds credits to your account for goods or services you provide to members, which you can use in exchange for goods and services offered by other members. You must include in your income the value of credit units added to your account, even if you use those credits to obtain goods or services from other club members in a later tax year.

THE NEW NEW THING
 A Silicon Valley Story.
 By Michael Lewis.
 268 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. $25.95. 
 Most books about business are boring. A great exception was "Liar's Poker," Michael Lewis's funny, knowing depiction of the monstrously giddy frat-guy world of investment banking. "Liar's Poker" was the perfect nonfiction companion volume to "The Bonfire of the Vanities" in the 80's canon. During the decade since, Lewis has produced good, charming, thoughtful journalism about business and politics, but I was unprepared for the accomplishment of "The New New Thing." It is a splendid, entirely satisfying book, intelligent and fun and revealing and troubling in the correct proportions, resolutely skeptical but not at all cynical, brimming with fabulous scenes as well as sharp analysis. Lines that seem slightly portentous at the outset -- The business of creating and foisting new technology upon others that goes on in Silicon Valley is near the core of the American experience" -- by the end seem unquestionably true, fully borne out by the tale he has told. "The New New Thing" may be to Silicon Valley what Pepys's diary was to 1660's London or Twain's "Roughing It" to the American West of the last century.
Lewis chose to focus on a single, pivotal Silicon Valley player -- a new-capitalist adventurer who "could have made it big at no other time in history." The result is a wide-ranging but sharply focused chronicle that gathers force and clarity as it unfolds. It was shrewd of Lewis to pick a subject who is important but not a household name -- not a Bill Gates or a Steve Jobs or a Steve Case. "The New New Thing" thus reads, for most of us, like fiction in the best sense, providing character revelation and narrative surprises all along the way.
The book tells the story of the engineer and entrepreneur Jim Clark, reported and written as Clark continued to bestride and transform Silicon Valley -- and by extension the American economy. Lewis does not say, but nonetheless proves, that the 55-year-old Clark, not Gates or Jobs or anyone else, is the grandest figure of that realm -- at least as accomplished and more interesting, inspiring and likable than his younger peers.
Raised poor and fatherless in a dreary Texas town, Clark must have been a candidate for his yearbook's Least Likely to Succeed. He unleashed a skunk at a dance, exploded a bomb on a school bus -- but wasn't actually expelled until he told a teacher to go to hell. Because he had never before encountered a multiple-choice exam when he joined the Navy in the early 60's, and since most of the answers seemed to him partly correct, he circled them all. The Navy accused him of cheating, certain he had tried to fool the computer scoring the tests -- which was, in a particularly Dickensian moment of ironic injustice, the first time Clark had ever heard of a computer. Nine months later, however, he scored higher than anyone else on a math test and was promoted to algebra instructor. After the Navy, his life continued its new upward swing -- marriage, a master's in physics, a Ph.D. in computer science -- but Clark's hooligan instincts messed that up in short order: his first marriage collapsed, his second wife left him after he was fired for insubordination from a teaching job, and he sank into a depression.
Providence, however, deposited Clark in the exurbs south of San Francisco, the place no one yet called Silicon Valley. "In something like an instant the man had changed his life," Lewis writes. He wound up at the Palo Alto Research Center, known as PARC -- the legendarily fecund computer lab created by Xerox. He and his band of Stanford graduate students invented a microchip he called the Geometry Engine, which made possible three-dimensional computer graphics. He decided to start a company based on the chip.
But the hurdles he faced in financing Silicon Graphics permanently inflamed Clark's righteous, roughneck sense of meritocratic grievance. Although it became perhaps the most successful company in the valley during the 1980's, "financiers and managers owned huge chunks of Silicon Graphics and had seized control of the board of directors." Lewis offers Clark as the ultimate anti-Organization Man, the apotheosis of a new, late-capitalist type, the productive and brilliant corporate worker "with a taste for anarchy." A decade after he started Silicon Graphics -- essentially powerless, nursing resentments against the money men and mere managers -- he walked away.
Clark distilled his experience into a doctrine: "The guy who finds the new new thing and makes it happen wins. . . . He wanted to create the company that invented the future." He understood before anyone else at Silicon Graphics that cheap computer power would wreck the company's business in $70,000 workstations. And a full decade ago he very clearly saw the potential of the embryonic World Wide Web. "Will personal computing and personal communications be combined," Clark was asked during a panel discussion in 1990, "or will it just remain as science fiction?" He gave the correct answer, and then wrote a paper elaborating on his notion. In "The Telecomputer," he sketched out an information and entertainment network that average Joes would access through their cable television systems. Suddenly Time Warner, AT&T, Viacom and U.S. West were all madly pursuing Clark's vision of the future.
But while the giant corporate beasts were lumbering and stumbling to try to build what he had imagined, nimble Jim Clark outflanked them. Recruiting a few young engineers in 1994, he abandoned the "telecomputer" and instead conjured Netscape into existence -- and thus, with the world's first mass-market Web browser, turned the geeks-only Internet into a vast consumer phenomenon. Three months after he forced Netscape to go public (he wanted cash to build a giant $37 million computer-controlled yacht), the share price had risen from $12 to $140. Clark therefore also more or less single-handedly ignited the stock market's high-tech I.P.O. explosion.
"People started drinking my Kool-Aid," Clark told Lewis, casting his persuasive abilities in a classic Valley trope. While Netscape didn't create the Web, it made friendly and accessible a technology that was regarded as anarchy. "What the I.P.O. did was give anarchy credibility," he said. This was the unequivocally salutary part of Clark's achievement. The other part -- the speculative stock-market frenzy he unleashed -- will surely prove more of a mixed blessing. "The most appealing companies became those in a state of pure possibility," Lewis writes. "Which is to say that the U.S. capital markets acquired the personal predilections of Jim Clark."
And there is a remarkable third act as well, played out during just the last couple of years, which Lewis, who had extraordinary access to Clark, witnessed firsthand. After Clark was hospitalized in 1995 -- for an impossibly apt affliction, a kind of anti-anemia, too much iron in his blood -- he dreamed up Healthscape or, as it came to be called, Healtheon. Unlike Silicon Graphics, which was based on a revolutionary new piece of hardware, or Netscape, based on a revolutionary new piece of software, Healtheon was driven merely by an administrative problem (fragmented, logistically messy American health care) and Jim Clark's entrepreneurial hubris. His idea was to eliminate medical paperwork by creating a computerized clearinghouse that would act as the intermediary between American patients, doctors, hospitals, H.M.O.'s and insurance companies -- to accomplish the idealized efficiency of socialized medicine without the Socialism. This is the point at which the saga begins looking suspiciously tulipomaniacal. "Clark had no plans to spend even a day in the Healthscape offices," Lewis writes. "He had ceased to be a businessman and become a conceptual artist."
The venture capitalists and bankers were a bit more resistant to Clark's new big idea than the A-list Silicon Valley engineers who begged to join him, but only a bit. And earlier this year, just a few months after one attempt at an I.P.O. failed, Healtheon successfully sold its shares to the public. Today its market value is $2.6 billion. "No one asked how a company that the stock market deemed unworthy was now, suddenly, desirable," Lewis writes. "Like other Internet companies, it said to the stock market: Our future will look nothing like our present; ergo, you cannot determine our value by looking at the present. You must close your eyes and imagine a new world. . . . In this new world skepticism was not a sign of intelligence. It was a sin."
Clark has devoted much of the last four years to building Hyperion, possibly the largest sailboat in the world, which he and his on-board team of programmers control with 25 Silicon Graphics workstations. Lewis's scenes at the Dutch shipyard and aboard the boat make for a refreshing counterpoint to the main story, since they take place in the real world -- outdoors, with high winds and ripping sails, among craftsmen and sailors who aren't obsessed by computers. Clark himself, however, pronounces Hyperion's maiden trans-Atlantic voyage "boring as hell" -- and it's true that an awful lot of pages are spent describing the crew and minor computer snafus they face. The tedium of the ocean crossing, however, is redeemed by a spectacular finale: Clark's own Gulfstream jet buzzes the boat so the pilot can inform the boss by radio that America Online bought Netscape for almost three times what the company was worth when Hyperion left the Netherlands 10 days earlier.
"Now that he had a billion dollars," Lewis writes of Clark, "his life had become a great deal more . . . financial. He truly loved money, money truly loved him, and he wanted all the people he liked to be a part of the new relationship." Indeed, Clark doled out enough Healtheon shares to his yacht captain and yacht programmers to make them millionaires. Yet although he remains magnanimous, at the end of the book one starts to worry that he is becoming a depressingly standard-issue rich guy, who merely wants to get richer instead of doing so in the course of inventing cool new ways to discombobulate the old order. Before Silicon Graphics, Clark said a fortune of $10 million would make him happy; before Netscape, $100 million; before Healtheon, a billion; now, he told Lewis, "Once I have more money than Larry Ellison, I'll be satisfied." Ellison, the founder of the software company Oracle, is worth $13 billion.
There is nothing seriously wrong with this book. One forgives the author's occasionally coy chattiness, and faux Tom Wolfean exclamatory passages ("Oh, the disdain! Oh, the contempt! . . . Who did Jim Barksdale, Serious American Executive, think these whisperers of secrets and tappers of laptops were? Serfs!"). Only a little more annoying are lapses into smirky men's-magazine prose, as when he describes Clark piloting a helicopter while "enduring the aftershocks of two bottles of fine Burgundy." But Lewis conveys with a rare combination of wisdom and glee both the thrill and absurdity of late-20th-century business. Even his asides are to the point, as when he describes Microsoft's lead trial lawyer as "a triple agent in his own soul: a big-city lawyer who thought he had adopted strategically the surface mannerisms of a stupid hick but who was, for the purposes of this trial, a stupid hick."
"The New New Thing" leaves one with a fond respect for Jim Clark and a dizzy awe at the weird, hypercapitalist moment in which we find ourselves. He may or may not turn out to be a great American, but he is profoundly American. "As a practical matter Clark had no past, only a future. That's when he really came alive: when you got him on the subject of what was going to happen next." He was always open to accident, Lewis writes of Clark -- that knack being, in fact, nothing but a more practical formulation of E. B. White's famous prescription for would-be New Yorkers, the willingness to be lucky.
