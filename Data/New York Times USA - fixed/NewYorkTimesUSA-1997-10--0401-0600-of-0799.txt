Lots of Gore, Tantrums, Leather And Bleach

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
"Playing God" is so fond of showing bloody hands digging into bullet-punctured bodies that after its third or fourth close-up of an emergency surgical procedure, you might as well be watching a children's finger-painting class for all the impact it has. Those dripping red hands belong to Eugene Sands (David Duchovny), a down-and-out Los Angeles surgeon who becomes the pet miracle worker of a big-time counterfeiter and smuggler named Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton).
Eugene, a synthetic-heroin addict who lost his medical license after being caught operating while high, is "discovered" by Raymond one night in a Los Angeles drug lair where he improvises a lifesaving breathing mechanism for a gunshot victim after a shootout. The next day Raymond has Eugene kidnapped and brought to the Malibu dream house he shares with his sulky, puffy-lipped girlfriend, Claire (Angelina Jolie). Raymond magisterially appoints the unemployed surgeon to be his own private Mr. Fixit, charged with saving the lives of his bullet-riddled henchmen without their having to go to the hospital. It isn't long before the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has been tracking Raymond, pressures Eugene into betraying his new employer. 
 "Playing God," directed by Andy Wilson from a screenplay by Mark Haskell Smith, wants so desperately to be stylishly hard-boiled that it runs wildly amok. In addition to a ridiculously high blood count, the movie heaves and strains with overripe dialogue and acting that veers between somnambulism and hysteria with nothing in between.
Mr. Duchovny's Eugene is a flat imitation of a typical Richard Gere louse, minus Mr. Gere's glinting sarcasm and facetiously cynical grins. His performance is utterly lifeless and without charm. Mr. Hutton plays Raymond, who affects bleached hair and long leather jackets, as a kind of Jack Nicholson parody, alternately growling inscrutably, then going ballistic in freakouts that even Mr. Nicholson would probably be embarrassed to see on the screen.
Raymond, unfortunately, is only one of several characters to fly into uncontrolled fits of fury. Whenever anyone, even the F.B.I. contact, gets angry, he invariably throws a full-scale tantrum. For a film that wants so badly to be cool and hip, "Playing God" is the movie equivalent of a rageaholic. Once it raises its voice, it can't stop screaming.
"Playing God" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is extremely violent and gory, with sexual situations and abundant profanity.

Daewoo's British Trick: Making Dealers Vanish

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
CD-ROM no-dicker stickers to mega-car marts to digital deals on the Internet, car sellers are experimenting with techniques that may hold promise for a future where only one thing seems certain: the traditional dealership will be forced to make big changes. An approach that has proved successful in Britain may soon be adapted for the United States as the Daewoo Motor Company sets up shop.
Daewoo Motor America, the United States marketing unit of the South Korean auto maker, recently acquired property in Fairfield, Conn., for its first American dealership. Daewoo will operate the former Traynor Porsche-Audi dealership as one of its first factory-owned showrooms. In addition, Daewoo (pronounced DAY-woo) has acquired other sites for sales operations and plans to buy more. The company says it will start start selling cars in the spring. 
 Daewoo intends to operate company-owned stores where state franchise laws allow it. (New Jersey and Maryland are among the states that prohibit factory-owned dealers.) Most of the nation's car dealerships are independently owned and operated. While they do exist, factory-owned dealerships are rare and have had limited success.
In Britain, Daewoo established its beachhead with a simple plan: by running its own sales operations it would cut out the middle man. The money saved was channeled into an aggressive advertising campaign that quickly generated a high rate of brand awareness.
In addition, Daewoo created customer-friendly sales and service operations and it established a set-price, no-haggling policy, much like the one used in the United States by the Saturn unit of the General Motors Corporation. Another program that was successful in Britain, and that may be extended to the United States, according to a company representative, involves weeklong test drives. And, as the company tries to become established, it may offer a few customers extended, six-month test drives.
British consumers seem to like Daewoo's approach, and the company says sales have exceeded expectations. From April 1995 through the end of 1996, Daewoo sold more than 33,000 cars in Britain and is on track to capture 1 percent of the market. Analysts project that expansion of the company's British sales network could yield sales of 40,000 to 50,000 units a year for a market share of more than 2 percent by 2001.
And Daewoo seems to be pleasing its customers. In its most recent survey on quality and customer satisfaction, J. D. Power & Associates ranked the company fourth in Britain, ahead of established and respected auto makers like Toyota and Mazda.
Daewoo's retail outlets in Britain are often in unlikely locations, including grocery stores, to make car-buying more convenient. The company has a sales center within the nation's largest supermarket, Savacentre, in London.
Daewoo has three levels of retail outlets. Large superstores called Motor Shows sell high volumes of new cars and some used cars, and have service operations. Car Centres have smaller showrooms and focus more on service. Support Centres emphasize service and the sale of accessories.
In Britain, Daewoo advertisements portray dealers as sharks and they have disclosed a typical dealer's profit on a car sale. These methods have infuriated many conventional dealers.
Such on-the-edge advertising is unlikely in the United States. "Our ads must communicate the different car-buying and ownership experience to American consumers in compelling ways," a company spokesman said in a written response to submitted questions. Daewoo declined to make an executive available for an interview.
Certainly Daewoo is not selling a glamorous product. The cars it has been offering in Britain are aging designs based on Opel models from General Motors. But in the United States, Daewoo will sell three new models: the subcompact Lanos, the compact Nubira and the midsize Leganza.
In the United States, where Daewoo is following two other Korean auto makers, Hyundai and Kia, the company is planning full-service dealerships and scaled-down satellite stores. The satellites will be in places convenient for consumers "to experience our cars," a spokesman said, without saying specifically whether they would be sold at places like supermarkets or discount stores. Every store will feature a finger-touch computer kiosk where consumers can obtain product information.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW;
An Ambitious Symbol Of Newark's Pride

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
As the diva protested to the camera-toting tourist, "We are not a building!" Darn right. And neither is the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. Don't let those sturdy walls of brick and glass fool you. Newark's new center is much more than a work of architecture. It is an uproar. A commotion. A melee of civic hope.
Designed by the Los Angeles architect Barton Myers, the performing arts center is an immensely ambitious example of what has become a familiar urban genre: the recruitment of art to salvage a declining downtown. But Newark is not just any downtown. It is a city that came to symbolize urban decline after it was ripped apart by riots in the 1960's. And this $180 million project is no minor gesture in the direction of urban renewal. 
 Under the direction of its president, Lawrence P. Goldman, the performing arts center, which opens on Oct. 18 with a gala, has taken shape as a potent counter-symbol, an art riot, so to speak, or at least a cultural rally. In the years ahead, the life of this place will unfold not just inside the center but also in the streets around it.
Following a master plan developed in 1988 by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and James Stewart Polshek & Partners, the center occupies a superb site across the street from the historic Military Park, just a block from the Passaic River. The building's relationship to the city is inspired. Start with the simple decision to forego a tunnel connecting the building to the underground parking lot beneath Military Park. Concert and theatergoers will have to take to the streets. One can appreciate this building, in fact, as a nightly transfusion of people into a city's once deserted streets.
A riverside park is in the works. Eventually, concert and theatergoers commuting from New York City will be able to take a pleasant 10-minute stroll from Newark's newly refurbished Penn Station through that park. These plans are light years from the days when developers believed no one would venture into Newark unless new office towers came equipped with skywalks. Skyscrapers are wonderful. Skywalks are a contradiction in terms.
The center's exterior is contextual. Its red brick walls, relieved by contrasting masonry bands and columns of stone, employ an industrial vocabulary, with clear roots in the handsome factory buildings that still grace the city's periphery. A steel canopy, suspended over the entrance, reinforces the industrial look with a metallic nod in the direction of the blackened superstructure of a nearby bridge. On the main facade, expanses of glass frame sparkling views of the lobby. Visitors can also enter through a small templelike rotunda, tucked into the facade's western corner. The rotunda's curving edge reads from afar as the hinge of a door thrown open in welcome.
The center's high spots are its two theaters. Prudential Hall, the largest of these, seats 2,750. It is breathtakingly glamorous. If you don't say "ooh" when you walk through the door, you will at least say "aah." Otherwise, please rent a video, make some popcorn and stay home.
The hall is classical in form and spirit: four-tiered and horseshoe-shaped, glittering with light. The color scheme varies slightly from the traditional red and gold. There's red galore, but in place of gilded plaster, the tiers are faced with panels of beautiful golden wood. These are studded with wooden medallions, an acoustical device and a visual delight, picked out with twinkling lamps.
Red fabric panels can be lowered over the auditorium's red plaster walls to change the hall's acoustics. Movable wooden "towers," each 40 feet tall, can be shifted to alter the stage configuration. An acoustical reflector overhead can project beyond the proscenium frame. Its dimensions and angle will vary according to the kind of performance -- orchestral, dance or pop music.
A ceiling dome of molded white plaster billows overhead, its circumference ringed with lights. The dome awaits the installation of a chandelier. A pity some local muralist has not been commissioned to represent a Newark heaven. Even so, stage and auditorium have been combined into one warm, embracing room. The region has not seen as fabulous a new hall since Philip Johnson's New York State Theater opened its doors three decades ago.
The 514-seat Victoria Theater is a gem of more modest size and cut, a smoky amethyst of a room, with walls of gray and rose brick and seating upholstered in an iridescent fabric that shifts in tone from green to plum. Intended for more experimental productions and children's theater, it's a spare, serious space that may hold the key to the center's future as a place where art is produced as well as consumed. Though the auditorium is small, the stage is vast and equipped to handle sophisticated productions. Why adopt an industrial esthetic unless you intend to produce?
The center's vast lobby areas are much less successful. There is simply too much going on. Structural steel rods poking out of the ceiling. Miles of patterned carpet. Balconies faced here with glass, there with curved panels of wood. Floors inlaid with colored stones. Copper elevator doors. Copper handrails. An exterior promenade paved with glass block. One could go on. Do I have to come right out and say it? Please promise not to tell anyone. The lobby is a mess.
Still, it's a mess worth pausing over, because it raises an issue of general concern: How to create visual richness without going out of control? This design also compels one to ask why some messes are better than others. After all, many architects today celebrate heterogeneity as an ideal esthetic for these culturally fractured times. Isn't heterogeneity just a $10 word for mess? Why isn't Barton Myers's mess as appealing as the messes designed by Frank Gehry, Eric Owen Moss, or Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown?
The answer is that they deal with mess from a philosophical point of view. When Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown make different visual vocabularies collide, the collision is exaggerated and deliberate. Mr. Moss's architectural collages are held together by intuition, not by repeated materials and forms. Mr. Gehry's fragmented buildings gradually unfold into unified spatial patterns.
Pattern, in two and three dimensions, is the issue here. It turns out that modern architects were more successful than post-modernists have been at enriching buildings with pattern. Thomas Beebe, the architect, once observed that modernists excelled at pattern-making because it was integral to the Beaux Arts training many of them received. But the manipulation of abstract, two-dimensional pattern was also the first thing students were taught in a Bauhaus-style education.
The idea that modern architecture was visually destitute was usually based on poor examples, like the Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan. But other modern cityscapes -- like the condominium towers on Collins Avenue north of the Art Deco District in Miami Beach or the high-rise social housing on the outskirts of Barcelona -- present a different picture. Buildings in these areas offer patterns of remarkable variety through the simple manipulation of windows, mullions, spandrels, balconies and the random patterns of reflections, curtains and interior lighting. A street full of googie buildings can add up to a remarkably rich environment. A few contemporary architects, like Rem Koolhaas and Architectonica, have clearly picked up on this idea.
Though Mr. Myers tries to stay within an architectonic framework, he's embroidered the structure with more elements than he manages to control, visually or spatially. The eye keeps taking refuge in details, because the space never comes into focus. Churlish as it may be to rain on Newark's parade, the fact must be stated clearly: Architecture, too, is a performing art. The center's management would not dream of presenting less than top-flight work on its stages. There's no reason to relax standards when it comes to architecture, an art form that goes on playing year after year.
Enough. The center's shortcomings will fade into the background when the lobby is full of people, especially at night, when the glazed, brightly lit spaces will project an animated social spectacle into the recovering city outside. And the building's heart is in the right place around the clock.

HEADLINE: Working Less in France

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "French Premier Proposes Cutting Workweek to Create Jobs" (news article, Oct. 11): You translate the French theory behind the shorter workweek as a scheme to take a given economic pie and "divide it into smaller slices." If the aim of the shorter workweek is austerity, why is it so vehemently opposed by the French employer federation? As you report, the French Socialists have been forced by the unions to embrace the shorter workweek, with no loss in pay. Where is the austere discipline in this demand?
You also suggest that "other European countries have rejected such an approach." In fact, in recent weeks, the demand for shorter workweeks has been embraced by Spain's opposition Socialists and resuscitated by Germany's Social Democrats and labor leaders. 
 In Italy, the Communists temporarily brought down the center-left government when the prime minister rejected proposals for a shorter workweek. European Union countries will soon introduce maximum work time regulations as part of the "social chapter" of the Maastricht treaty. It is probably the relative isolation of the American labor movement that has kept labor leaders from embracing the popular program. Still, we can hope.

Grounds for Hope

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
"The situation is better," President Alia Izetbegovic said. "There is hope for the future in Bosnia."
Coming from Mr. Izetbegovic, who has often taken a somber view of his country's prospects, the comment was notable. And it was echoed by many others I met here -- editors, politicians, international experts. 
 Why the optimism? President Izetbegovic and others gave several reasons.
First they mentioned progress in dealing with indicted war criminals. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has just sent to the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague 10 accused Croats who he said had "voluntarily" turned themselves in. It was a powerful signal of international commitment to the Dayton agreement. For Mr. Tudjman acted, after long delay, under heavy American pressure. That is a second fundamental reason for the optimism: the more decisive, vigorous U.S. policy since Secretary of State Albright visited here in May.
The most important indicted figure still at large is Radovan Karadzic, who led the Serbs in their genocidal war. But his influence in the Serbian half of Bosnia, the Republika Srpska, has been greatly reduced by his conflict with its President, Biljana Plavsic.
Another reason is the recent seizure by the international force here, SFOR, of four transmission towers used by Serbian television in Pale. SFOR acted at the request of the international civilian High Representative, Carlos Westendorp, who made the decision because Pale television broadcast ethnic hate and called the SFOR troops Nazis.
The clampdown on Pale television, Dr. Karadzic's mouthpiece, is seen by many as a crucial step because of the way television was used by Serbian leaders to rouse the ultranationalism that led to the war. Broadcasts depicted Muslims and Croats as killers of Serbs. Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, said there was "a collective paranoia created by the media."
The four seized towers now transmit broadcasts from Banja Luka, Mrs. Plavsic's headquarters. They are far less hateful, though news programs ignore the other half of Bosnia or cover events there as part of foreign news.
Many say that democracy cannot grow in Bosnia without independent, professional broadcasting. Mr. Westendorp is now proposing a transitional measure to assure nonpartisan television. He has asked the contact group of countries sponsoring the international effort to approve creation of a board of judges and journalists -- part international, part local -- to set editorial standards and enforce them until Bosnia creates a similar system of its own.
President Izetbegovic volunteered, in our conversation, that the Westendorp proposal "should apply to us, too." Bosnia state television is relatively mild on ethnic matters but boosts the Izetbegovic party, the S.D.A. A Croat-run station broadcasting from Mostar is more biased; its weather map colors the Croat-dominated area of Bosnia as part of Croatia.
Sarajevo itself is a concrete sign of progress. There are still shattered buildings everywhere. But the electric trams are running again, and new shops open day after day, giving the city a bit of the cosmopolitan look it once had.
For most people economic conditions remain tough. Seventy percent rely on remittances from abroad or family members who have jobs with international organizations. But the mood is not dejected.
One thing seems absolutely clear: No part of this modest-sized country can attract investment -- can prosper -- as a separate state. That is one reason a recent rash of op-ed articles in American papers urging partition of Bosnia puzzles Bosnians. They know also that any attempt at partition would mean more war.
But the talk of partition is irresponsible for a larger reason. It would mean yielding to the most vicious racism in Europe since the Nazis, and destroying a country that is a multi-ethnic symbol. Why do that just when Dayton shows signs of working?
"The plan was to kill Bosnia," Prime Minister Silajdzic said. "That's not possible anymore."

HEADLINE: A Soaring Dow Masks Inflation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Robert Eisner argues against raising interest rates in "When Bad Economic Theory Threatens Good Times" (Op-Ed, Oct. 11). But the issue is when interest rates should rise, and why. The stock market's doubling in less than three years is said to reflect growing earnings and a sound economy. But price earnings ratios that are at all-time highs are a form of inflation.
Soaring financial assets are a problem even when the cost of living is stable because the higher they rise, the harder they fall. Then, the ripple effects on pension funds, insurance companies and banks would be felt, and the average person, as well as the wealthy, would pay. 
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is pursuing a shrewd policy of jaw-boning long-term interest rates up and the stock market down, to control the asset bubble.
Mr. Greenspan has warned that it would be foolish to expect earnings to continue to rise at such a pace. If he is right, stocks will be less attractive and the market will flatten, whether the Fed raises interest rates or not. But if the market continues to rise based on unrealistic earnings expectations, he seems to be saying the Fed will raise rates.

HEADLINE: A Bad Patent Bill

 BODY:
The Senate is considering a misguided bill to recast the patent laws in ways that would threaten small inventors and dampen the innovative spirit that helps sustain America's economy. The bill is so mischievous that it has attracted an unusual coalition of opponents -- including the icon of liberal economists, Paul Samuelson, the icon of conservative economists, Milton Friedman, and 26 other Nobel Prize-winning scientists and economists.
Patent laws currently require inventors to disclose their secrets in return for the exclusive right to market their product for up to 20 years. Early disclosure helps the economy by putting new ideas immediately into the hands of people who, for a fee to the patent holder, find novel and commercially applicable uses for these ideas. Extended protection, meanwhile, provides a huge incentive for inventors to keep inventing. The American system generates more and better patent applications than any other country's. 
 The Senate bill would weaken patent protection for small inventors by requiring inventors who file for both American and foreign patents to publish their secrets 18 months after filing rather than when the patent is issued. Small inventors say that premature publication gives away their secret if their application fails. It would also allow large corporations with the financial muscle to fend off subsequent legal challenges to maneuver around the patent even if it is later issued.
Worse, the bills would encourage corporations to avoid the patent process altogether. Under current law, companies that rely on unpatented trade secrets run the risk that someone else will patent their invention and charge them royalties. The Senate bill would permit companies whose trade secrets are later patented by someone else to continue to market their products without paying royalties. Encouraging corporations to hide secrets is the opposite of what an economy that relies on information needs.
Pesky patent holders do in fact get in the way of large corporations. But the economy thrives on independent initiative. Small inventors need ironclad patent protection so that they are not forced into a legal scrum with financial giants. The House of Representatives and the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the patent bill without hearing the country's leading economists and scientists make their case. Senate sponsors now say they will try. Congress needs to hear the critics out before proceeding to any more votes.

HEADLINE: Aid From Rich Nations to Poor Fell in 1996

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Foreign aid to the world's poorest countries has fallen to its lowest point in half a century, a report by private relief groups said this week.
The new survey, "The Reality of Aid," bases its conclusions on figures collected by 21 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes 25 leading industrial nations. It was published on Wednesday and released in the United States by Interaction, a Washington coalition of 150 United States agencies. 
 The amount of aid to developing nations from these 21 countries fell $3.8 billion in 1996, to $55.8 billion, the study found. This represents only one-quarter of 1 percent of the total gross domestic product of the 21 countries, down from one-third of 1 percent in 1992.
The United States had the lowest ratio of foreign assistance, with 0.12 percent of its gross domestic product going to help developing nations, including assistance to Israel.
Japan has also made deep cuts in foreign assistance, the study shows; though it remains the largest donor, Japan reduced aid by 15 percent between 1995 and 1996. An unfavorable exchange rate accounted for some of that decline.
Eleven industrial countries reduced their foreign aid in 1996, the report said. At the same time, private groups increased their aid by $80 million, to $234 billion, more than four times the amount provided by governments.
More than 1.3 billion people live in absolute poverty by world measures -- on income of less than $1 a day.
Because many live in countries with high population growth, the numbers of poor people grow even as poverty-reduction programs begin to make headway, James Gustave Speth, the administrator of the United Nations Development Program, said today. The United Nations has set aside Friday as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.
Mr. Speth also said today that private investment in the developing world was far from the panacea that some aid specialists predicted a few years ago. At least 90 percent of private investment has gone to China or to middle-income countries, a number of them in Asia. The 50 poorest countries got less than 1 percent of the investment.
Two-thirds of the people living in developing countries get by on less than $2 a day, Mr. Speth said.
The report also said the export of surplus farm products to developing nations, particularly from Europe, was damaging the livelihoods of farmers even as it relieved food shortages.
The European Union's export of subsidized beef to South Africa, for example, had led to a financial loss to that country's producers of something equivalent to 95 percent of Europe's aid there, the group said.
The study called for more debt relief for the poorest countries and said that the international monetary organizations were refusing to help the poorest countries while bailing out economies like those of Mexico and Thailand.

HEADLINE: Racing to Be First With a Harmless Substitute for a Cleaning Solvent

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
For the last six weeks, Jeffrey L. Battiston, the owner of a dry cleaning chain in West Hartford, Conn., has secretly been testing what could be the Holy Grail of his industry: a substitute for the toxic but commonly used cleaning solvent perchlorethylene that he said is harmless to the environment, nonflammable and cleans just as well as perc.
Meanwhile, a company using technology developed by scientists at Hughes Aircraft Company and at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the birthplace of the atomic bomb, is just months away from a nationwide test of a machine that scrubs clothes with liquid carbon dioxide. And researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles are readying a report showing that dry cleaners who switch to machines that use water can defy industry expectations and clean nearly all kinds of clothes. 
 Across the country, teams of chemists, physicists, economists and entrepreneurs are hurriedly finishing off years of research and rushing to sell what each hopes will become a new industry standard for the nation's 37,000 dry cleaning establishments, most of which have relied on perc for decades.
Propelling that race are mounting concerns about the harmful effects of perc -- which include unpleasant odors, lower air quality, polluted ground water and tainted breast milk -- and increasingly strict regulations that experts say could force hundreds of dry cleaners in New York State alone to close up shop by the end of 1998. The increased concern was demonstrated most recently by the evacuation of a Harlem elementary school that had once been a dry cleaning plant.
Yesterday, Mark J. Green, the New York City Public Advocate, requested a new law that would shut down dry cleaning plants in residential buildings if they were cited three times for leaking illegal levels of perc.
In West Hartford, Mr. Battiston is testing Rynex, a new solvent developed by a Woodbury, N.Y., company. The solvent can be used in conventional dry cleaning machines after minor adjustments, which the company said would cost a few hundred dollars and could be completed in less than an hour. Mr. Battiston said that since he began using Rynex in late August, he had cleaned at least 5,000 garments with the new solvent, without their owners' knowledge.
"I haven't heard any complaints," said Mr. Battiston. "Two customers called just to say they smelled something different, and they asked me what it was."
Several customers interviewed yesterday said they, too, could smell a difference, but preferred it to the familiar scent of clothes cleaned in perc. Ellen Brassil-Horak, who picked up two blazers yesterday morning that had been cleaned overnight in Rynex, said they had "a very sanitary smell."
Mr. Battiston, a third-generation dry cleaner whose three stores handle 6,000 garments a week, said he had no financial stake in Rynex Holdings Ltd., the maker of the chemical. Rather, he said, he agreed to try it because "it really could save our industry."
"At least it could save it from a lot of headaches," Mr. Battiston said. "Let's face it, our industry's taken a lot of heat the last few years."
Industry experts remain cautious about Rynex Holdings, which lost credibility after previous promises of a replacement for perc failed to materialize. "I've got to see it to believe it," said William Seitz, executive director of the Neighborhood Cleaners Association-International, a trade group in Manhattan.
But William A. Hayday, an engineer who heads Rynex Holdings, said that tests were about to begin in two more cities, and that the product could be on the market by the end of the year.
If Mr. Hayday's invention does not untie the dry cleaning industry's Gordian knot, several competitors are preparing to cut through it.
In Los Angeles, Robert Gottlieb, director of U.C.L.A.'s Pollution Prevention Education and Research Center, said that a 12-month study of a "wet cleaning" shop had shown that cleaning clothes in water is, indeed, a viable alternative to dry cleaning for nearly all garments. Although the technology is several years old, Mr. Gottlieb said, there are fewer than 300 shops nationwide that specialize in wet cleaning -- including the Ecomat stores in New York -- partly because of a widespread industry belief that water is appropriate for only about 40 percent of garments. He said his report would show that perceived problems of shrinkage and bleeding can be controlled by computerized washers and dryers without sacrificing profitability.
Cleaning "dry clean only" garments in water so defies the conventional wisdom among dry cleaners, however, that at least two research groups are working on cleaning processes that would require investments of tens of thousands of dollars by shopkeepers.
In Raleigh, N.C., scientists at the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State University who invented a detergent that dissolves in liquid carbon dioxide have formed a spinoff company, MiCell Technologies, to bring the technology to market. R. Bradley Lienhart, the company's chief executive, who formerly oversaw production of perchlorethylene at Dow Chemical Corporation, said that MiCell would have its first prototype ready by the end of the year. The machines will sell for about $125,000, he said.
And in El Segundo, Calif., Global Technologies has licensed a similar carbon dioxide-based cleaning process, originally developed by Hughes Aircraft and scientists at Los Alamos to clean aircraft parts. Jack Belluscio, a Queens native who heads the company, said that prototypes would be ready for testing in five cities by next summer.
Mr. Belluscio said he had met with officials of the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation this week, asking them to offer loans to dry cleaners to help them convert to his machines, which will retail for up to $80,000. In exchange, he said, he offered to make New York one of the five test cities.

HEADLINE: Scrubbing the Air, Buffing the Cleaners;
Belated E.P.A. War on Pollutants May Infuse Value Into Companies

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
A few years ago, Nina Bergan French started Sky+ to perfect and sell a still rough but promising new method for analyzing toxic metals that she had licensed from a Federal research laboratory. She was certain that the Clean Air Act of 1990 would provide a ready-made market. But the years passed and the Environmental Protection Agency still did not crack down on the metallic contaminants. Ms. French lost her license, and switched Sky+ to government consulting to pay her bills.
Now, the E.P.A. is testing several monitoring devices, including the one Ms. French gave up, as it prepares to clamp down on airborne toxic metals. "Finally, the E.P.A. may create a market for me," said Ms. French, who wants Sky+ to do environmental consulting work for industry. 
 After several years of what polluting industries have called reasonable delays but what environmentalists call foot-dragging, the E.P.A. seems poised to tighten restrictions on smog, soot and airborne pollutants.
Its main targets are cars and other vehicles, particularly buses and trucks with diesel engines. But the agency is also aiming at factories and power plants. Specifically, it is expected to soon force industry to filter out soot particles that are one-fourth the size of the ones regulated now, to clamp down on emissions of nitrogen oxide and other compounds that form ozone, and to reduce allowable levels of toxic-metal molecules spewing from smokestacks.
Utilities and steel companies are complaining of multibillion-dollar costs. But air-pollution-control companies, many of which have not seen a profit for years, are singing of a multibillion-dollar market.
"The opportunities are breathtaking," said Jeffrey C. Smith, executive director of the Institute of Clean Air Companies, which predicts that sales of air-cleaning equipment, which have been flat for several years, will rise 7 percent annually.
Predictions, of course, aren't the same as money in the bank, and Wall Street, expensively fooled before by the false promise in environmental stocks, remains aloof.
The skepticism is understandable. R. Steven Maxwell, managing director of the Technology Strategic Group, an environmental consulting firm, estimates that $100 invested in environmental stocks 10 years ago would have grown to $300 by the early 1990's -- but would have shrunk to just $30 today.
Now, though, the pieces for a recovery seem to be falling into place. "This may not be a bonanza waiting to happen," Mr. Maxwell said, "but this will be a good business for companies that get it right."
The prospect of new E.P.A. rules -- assuming Congress does not countermand them -- is not all that's sending optimistic breezes wafting through the pollution-control industry. American manufacturers will soon have to replace the creaky precipitators, scrubbers and other air-cleaning devices that they installed two decades ago. Orders from Europe and Asia are soaring. And analysts speculate that the deregulation of the utility industry, now in its early stages, will spur interest in newer, cheaper pollution controls, as the utility companies compete to offer the lowest-cost electricity.
"Deregulation will drive the question of pollution-control investment even faster than E.P.A. standards," predicted William G. Rosenberg, president of E3 Ventures, an environmental consulting firm.
Indeed, Robert McIlvaine, president of the McIlvaine Company, an environmental market research concern, predicts that by the year 2006, power plants alone will spend $17 billion a year to remove sulfur from flue gases. And, he calls the proposed nitrogen oxide rules "the most attractive U.S. environmental business opportunity ever."
The environmental industry is primed to respond. Companies like Bee-Line Software are touting programs that can model how changes in fuel mixtures will affect emissions. Manufacturers like Thermatrix Inc., formed in 1992 to make low-temperature flameless oxidizers that neutralize organic pollutants without forming nitrogen oxide, are aggressively chasing sales. And, industry experts say, there are more products in the pipeline.
"People don't talk when they're working on a new black box because they're afraid someone will steal their idea," said William C. Anderson, head of the American Academy of Environmental Engineers.
Companies with older technologies are dusting off brochures, too. The Engelhard Corporation, for one, predicts annual sales of its decades-old nitrogen oxide-removal catalytic system to reach at least $50 million in 2001, five times current volume. And it hypothesizes a $1 billion market for a newer catalyst that converts ozone to oxygen.
"The technologies have been waiting for the regulations to show up," said Daniel W. Parker, Engelhard's general manager for environmental technologies, "and now it looks like they will."
Signs of hope abound. Advertising in the Air and Waste Management Association's magazine, which had dropped precipitously in the last three years, is way up again. And John A. Thorner, the group's executive director, said booths were already selling briskly for his annual technology conference in June.
The resurgence comes none too soon. One of the country's most thriving industries a decade ago, the air-pollution-control business has declined steadily in the 90's.
Sure, a few companies with special market niches did well. The Smith Environmental Corporation, a subsidiary of Haden Maclellan Holdings P.L.C. of Britain, has had steady growth in sales to paper companies of devices intended to destroy ozone-forming compounds -- in good part, Smith's president, Robert C. Hyde, suggested because the forest-products industry has "never been as good as the utilities at pressuring Washington to delay rules."
Companies with products that cut costs as well as pollutants have also done well. Turbodyne Technologies Inc., a six-year-old maker of "air enhancement flow" products that increase fuel efficiency as well as reduce pollutants, has seen sales increase steadily, to $55 million this year. "People are more receptive if they don't have to trade fuel economy for clean air," said Edward M. Halimi, Turbodyne's founder.
But most air-cleaning products represent an end-of-the-pipeline cost with no inherent savings. And for the companies that sell them, the last seven years have been a financial disaster. Many small ones have gone out of business, and despite the rosy future that supposedly lies just over the horizon, even some industry stalwarts are bailing out.
Wheelabrator Air Pollution Control Inc., which in 1992 branched into fancy machines to control and monitor ozone-forming pollutants, has retreated back to its core scrubbers and precipitators for removing dust and sulfur dioxide. "The market didn't develop, because E.P.A. did not promulgate its rules," said Paul J. Feira, the company's president.
Air and Water Technology's Research Cottrell division, whose name was once synonymous with scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators to the point that such devices are called "cottrells" in much of Europe, has been losing money and is looking for a buyer. Last month, General Electric Power Systems, a unit of the General Electric Company, sold Environmental Services Inc., which does about $50 million in sales a year, to a Canadian company, Marsulex Inc., for $13 million. "It never became a strategic part of our $7.3 billion power-generation business," a G.E. spokesman, Bruce Bunch, said.
Wall Street has jumped ship, too. Share prices for Environmental Elements, Wahlco Environmental Systems and Thermatrix -- all pure plays that only make pollution-control devices -- have plummeted. "No one thinks the environmental industry is a good investment these days," said John T. Schofield, Thermatrix's chairman.
That sounds like an understatement to Joan B. Berkowitz, managing director of the consulting firm Farkas Berkowitz & Company. "Being labeled an environmental firm is the kiss of death with investors," she said.
But if buyers for environmental stocks remain scarce, buyers for environmental companies are starting to appear. "We're getting interest from companies that want to enter this business, and even from financial players who just see profits to be made," a high-ranking executive at Research Cottrell said.
Similarly, Physical Sciences Inc., which makes spectroscopes that use spark plugs to measure an airstream's components, already has a loan from the Small Business Administration and is talking to several large companies about an infusion of cash to develop the market.
"The investment community is still leery, but we're exploring licensing and partnerships," said Michael L. Finson, the company's executive vice president, who said new E.P.A. rules could more than double his annual sales of $16 million.
The new rules are not a done deal. In fact, the Air Quality Standards Coalition, a multi-industry group formed to fight stricter rules, is still lobbying with members of Congress to forestall the smog and soot regulations, arguing that they will cost 200,000 jobs and $150 billion.
Some coalition members, speaking off the record, concede that the last-ditch effort will probably fail, and that the new rules will take hold by next year, at the latest. Still, it will take longer than that for most air-cleaning companies to feel well off.
For one thing, the juiciest markets are in Europe and Asia. In a novel marketing partnership, Turbodyne is donating half a percent of gross sales to the United Nations, which in April gave the company's technology United Nations flag status -- a designation that endorses it for improving conditions in third world countries, and qualifies it for marketing and publicity assistance from the United Nations Development Program's Global Technology Group.
But few other environmental companies have the cash or connections to cultivate relationships in other countries.
And competition is intense, not only among pollution-control firms but from purveyors of clean-burning fuels, from engineers who tinker with industrial processes to stop pollutants from forming, and from chemical companies that refine formulas for paint or other substances so that they do not emit fumes.
"There are dozens and dozens of new technologies coming on line that could meet the regulations," said Gary S. Guzy, counselor to the E.P.A. Administrator, Carol M. Browner. "And in the long term, solar energy and biomass fuels will be developed that meet air-quality rules."
Still, it seems, none of the obstacles can prevent optimism from pervading an industry that is bone-weary from years of depression.
Or, as Mr. Smith, the trade association executive, put it, "It's not something to pop champagne corks over, but things are definitely getting better."

"Tools for Cleaning Up the Environment"
Some of the air-pollution-control technologies that have been developed for commercial use in the last decade.
 
Electrostatic precipitators -- Used to clean smokestack emissions.
 
Catalytic reduction -- Reduces nitrogen oxide from coal- and oil-fired boilers.
 
Scrubbers -- Remove 95% of sulfur dioxide emissions from utility boilers' smokestacks.
 
Valve seals and detection equipment -- For controlling and detecting leaks in pipes in chemical and oil refineries.
 
New coolants -- Air-conditioners use alternative gases for cooling instead of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's.
 
Catalytic converters -- Used on wood-burning stoves to make them cleaner.
 
New paints and coatings -- Used on consumer products to make them free of noxious fumes. (Source: Environmental Protection Agency)(pg. D5)

HEADLINE: Social Security Benefits to Increase 2.1%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The tens of millions of Americans who get Social Security and other Federal benefits will get an increase of 2.1 percent in their checks in January, the second-smallest raise since automatic cost-of-living adjustments began in 1975, the Government said today.
From the recipients' point of view, the skimpy increases are the not-so-pleasant aspect of the nation's success in subduing inflation, as most goods, such as shoes, creep up slowly while a few, such as used cars, actually decline. Even inflation in services is under 3 percent. 
 There was further evidence of that trend today when the Consumer Price Index for September, which provided the final piece of data for calculating the benefits increase for 1998, showed that prices edged up by two-tenths of 1 percent, a bit less than most economists had expected and the same increase as in July and August.
"Today's news confirms that inflation remains under control," said Kenneth S. Apfel, Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Seeking to take the edge off possible disappointment that the average monthly benefit will rise only $16 a month, he added, "Low inflation is good for America, particularly for many Social Security beneficiaries with limited incomes."
The Treasury, of course, on behalf of taxpayers, benefits from paying out less in cost-of-living adjustments. Still, even the small increase might overcompensate for price increases, because it is based on the Consumer Price Index, which many experts say exaggerates actual inflation.
One reason is that the index is intended to measure not the cost of living but a relatively fixed basket of goods and services and thus does not allow for the fact that if the price of, say, roast beef rises sharply, consumers tend to switch to less expensive hamburger or chicken.
Nonetheless, even by that gauge, inflation has been modest. And in September, the so-called core price index, which excludes the wide-swinging food and energy components, was up only two-tenths of 1 percent, like the overall index.
"What we see is strong, constant and relentless downward pressure on prices," William J. Hudson, chief executive of AMP Inc., a large Harrisburg, Pa., electronics company, told a gathering here of the National Association of Manufacturers. He and other speakers cited global competition and productivity improvements as the main factors preventing revived inflation despite an uninterrupted business expansion of more than six years.
And the only signs of upward pressure on labor costs, added Dana G. Mead, chairman of Tenneco Inc., are for workers in high technology.
Today's report, economists said, lent little support to any inclination the Federal Reserve might have to tighten monetary policy to slow the economy down. "If Mr. Greenspan was in search of some basis for raising interest rates, he did not get it," said Joel L. Naroff, chief bank economist in Philadelphia for the First Union Bank.
Some, however, such as Frank McCormick, senior economist at the Bank of America, were less sanguine. "We see this as sort of the end of the good news on inflation," he said, predicting that higher oil prices and the dollar's decline in world currency markets would contribute to Fed decisions to raise rates twice, in quarter-point increments, by spring.
Although the C.P.I. report showed energy prices jumping 1.3 percent last month, this had little overall effect since energy accounts for only 7 percent of the index.
Food inflation decelerated to one-tenth of 1 percent, aided by a downturn in coffee prices following six month of increases totaling 24.2 percent. Prices of apparel rose following a sharp August decline and air fares, a choppy component, 2.1 percent. Prices of new and used cars showed little change last month but used cars are now 5.6 percent cheaper than in September 1996.
Separate reports today showed that first-time claims for unemployment benefits edged up 2,000 last week, to 306,000, while business inventories during August rose two-tenths of 1 percent.
Social Security benefits for the average retiree will rise to $765 a month from $749, the agency said, with the maximum benefit for a worker retiring at age 65 in January set at $1,342.
The average benefit for an aged couple who both receive benefits will rise to $1,288; a widowed mother and two children will get $1,522; an aged widow or widower will get $731, and a disabled worker with a spouse and one or more children will get $1,198, all of these reflecting increases of 2.1 percent. The only year in which the percentage increase in payments was lower was 1987.

Census Report Shows Suburban Growth

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In 1995, the economic expansion in the New York region was strongest in some of the wealthiest suburban counties surrounding New York City -- Bergen in New Jersey, Fairfield in Connecticut and Putnam in New York -- according to an analysis released yesterday by the Federal Bureau of the Census.
Although the report offered no more recent data -- providing a well-documented but lagging indicator, as is typical of the Census -- it revealed a geographic portrait of the New York region during a year when economic expansion was beginning to accelerate after more than five years of little or no growth. 
 As measured by the number of businesses and payrolls in each county, those that fared best combined large concentrations of people commuting to jobs in Manhattan and prosperous suburban economies. Manhattan fared about as well as the best-performing suburban counties.
In Bergen County, the number of businesses increased by 3 percent, to 32,034, while the annual payrolls for those businesses increased 9 percent, to $14.6 billion, the report said.
In Putnam, a more sparsely populated county, the number of businesses grew 10 percent, to 2,119, the report said, and the annual payroll rose 8 percent, to $403.3 million. In Fairfield, the number of businesses increased 5 percent, to 91,189, it said, and the annual payroll rose 8 percent, to $47.1 billion.
The report said that the number of Manhattan companies rose 2 percent, to 99,779, and that annual payrolls jumped 9 percent, to $92.2 billion. THOMAS J. LUECK

HEADLINE: No Talks, Just Faxes, in Amtrak Dispute

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Amtrak and the union that may strike over wages next week did not meet today but traded unfriendly faxes, each making statements that threaten the continued operation of Amtrak and commuter lines across the country.
The head of the bargaining committee for the union, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, said today that it had reached an agreement with Metra, the commuter rail agency in the Chicago area, that would allow that line to continue running if there was a strike. 
 The union has been negotiating for three years and will be free to strike at 12:01 A.M. Wednesday.
The union also released a copy of a letter it sent today to Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, repeating its commitment not to interfere with commuter railroads.
But the head of the bargaining committee, Jed Dodd, cautioned that his union might not be so friendly toward commuter lines operated by Amtrak, like Marc in Maryland and Washington, the Shoreline East in Connecticut and the Purple Line in the Boston area. Mr. Dodd said he had no argument with commuter lines that were not involved in the contract dispute with Amtrak, but he said some of the lines employed members of his union under the terms of the contract now at issue with Amtrak.
Metra, the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit in the New York region and Septa in Philadelphia are government-run railroads that use some Amtrak tracks or stations. The commuter railroads directly run by Amtrak carry 174,000 passengers a day; 357,000 are carried by commuter railroads operating over Amtrak's tracks. Amtrak's inter-city service carries about 60,000 a day.
An Amtrak spokesman, Clifford Black, said the meaning of the union's agreement with Metra in Chicago was not clear.
"To the extent they stop train traffic at Union Station by ceasing to work, they stop both of us," Mr. Black said.
The union workers perform such jobs as track inspections that must be made twice a week, he pointed out. And if the union takes actions that stop Amtrak trains from using Union Station in Chicago -- or stopped Amtrak trains in other cities with commuter lines -- Amtrak might take other unspecified actions that would shut down the commuter trains, Mr. Black said.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, plans to hold a news conference in New York on Friday morning with representatives of the union, the Long Island Rail Road and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that supervises the Long Island Rail Road. Mr. D'Amato wants to describe how the Long Island Rail Road might keep running over the westernmost four miles of track leading into Pennsylvania Station. That part of track is run by Amtrak.
Mr. D'Amato said Amtrak had been invited and added, "We need Amtrak's cooperation."
The exchanges today over commuter railroads show the differing strategies of the parties. Some union officials are convinced that if they shut down the commuter lines, Congress would step in and end their strike, an action they do not want. Amtrak, on the other hand, does not want to let its unionized employees pick and choose what functions they will perform.
New Jersey Transit officials are supposed to meet with the union on Friday. The system has a more serious problem because its operations are on the Northeast corridor, which Amtrak owns and operates.
The union today also released a letter it had received on Wednesday from Amtrak asking for the quick approval of a two-week extension of the "cooling-off period" imposed by President Clinton on Aug. 22. The period expires next Wednesday.
Amtrak said the purpose of agreeing to an extension now would be "reassuring the riding public," and it asked for a response by 3 P.M. on Thursday but did not get one. The union characterized Amtrak's letter as an ultimatum, but said it would consider the request.
Amtrak also asked the union for a plan for allowing the continued operations of the commuter lines. Mr. Dodd, who heads the negotiating committee, said he was not able to draft such a plan because he did not know the railroad well enough.
The union represents 2,300 workers who are paid about $15 an hour to maintain tracks, bridges, tunnels, signals and electrical systems. Amtrak said that with overtime, the workers are paid an average of $41,000 a year.
The railroad has 13 unions, comprising 26 bargaining units, 21,000 union workers and 2,000 managers. All but one of the contracts with the unions are open for renegotiation, but no others are close to being allowed to strike.
The Presidential Emergency Board appointed in August said the workers deserved the same pay as those employed by freight railroads. Amtrak says that those railroads earned nearly $4 billion last year but that it lost $83 million and that its losses this year will be even bigger, while the board's recommendation would cost it $25 million this year.
The board suggested that Congress appropriate more money, but both the White House and Congress plan to phase out Amtrak's operating subsidies over the next five years. Mr. Dodd said the increases recommended by the board would do no more than restore purchasing power lost to inflation since the early 1980's.

HEADLINE: Teen-Age Girl in Chicago Embarks on New Experience: School

BYLINE: By BILL DEDMAN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The caller to the Chicago schools' special truancy line wanted to ask a hypothetical question. What would happen to a parent if her 15-year-old daughter were not in school? In several days of coaxing conversations, the mother acknowledged the truth: Her daughter had never been to school. In fact, the girl hardly went out of the house.
This week, the girl went to school for the first time -- in junior high -- and no one knows why. 
 "She knows her A B C's. She knows her colors," said Maribeth Vander Weele, chief of investigations for the Board of Education. "She learned her days of the week by looking at a calendar. She's a shy child, very isolated. She wants to learn. She wants to be a teacher."
Schools officials are not sure why the mother never sent the girl to school, aside from a few days of kindergarten, and why no one reported her absence before now. The girl's 26-year-old brother attended public school and is taking college courses. Her 8-year-old sister is in second grade, and the mother has been conscientious about that daughter's schooling, picking up report cards and attending parent-teacher conferences. The father has not been with the family for several years.
The mother, who is unemployed and on public assistance, told officials that she feared for the safety of her teen-age daughter, who would have to walk through their rough South Side neighborhood to get to school. But she allowed her youngest child to attend a neighborhood school.
The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services will evaluate the family, including the mother's mental state.
Officials have not identified the family publicly.
The girl has no physical or mental disability, officials said, although she does need glasses. Nor does she appear to have suffered any abuse. The home was clean, and the girl was well fed and clothed. It is unlikely that the mother will face a criminal charge of educational neglect, officials said.
The girl told officials that she had gone to the grocery store, but had mostly stayed at home. She studied there some with her younger sister, officials said.
This week the girl sat in classes so she could get used to being with other children. Officials chose to place her in junior high school, for now, because that age group seemed most appropriate. She is being evaluated but will need intensive remedial instruction. Today, after The Chicago Sun-Times publicized the case on the front page, an anonymous donor offered to pay for tutoring.
"It's amazing that in this day and age you can have a child who has gone 15 years without ever having enrolled in school," said Paul G. Vallas, chief executive officer of the Chicago public schools. "But we've had a lot of unusual cases."
The special truancy line, set up a year ago, has helped bring more than 2,000 students back into the Chicago public school system, which has 425,000 students. Truancy rates have declined 18 percent among boys and 9 percent among girls, officials said. Most of the truants had been out only a few days, but officials have found entire families of children who are not in school and are not receiving home instruction.
"There are a lot of forgotten children out there," Ms. Vander Weele said.

HEADLINE: Zurich Group-B.A.T. Deal Is Made Firm

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Zurich Group of Switzerland announced a firm agreement today to take control of B.A.T. Industries' insurance businesses in a complex merger that would create one of the world's biggest financial-services companies and a major new player in the United States.
Under the agreement, which was expected since Zurich said on Sunday that the companies were talking about a deal, the two companies would pool their insurance and money-management businesses and the tobacco business of B.A.T. would be spun off into a separate entity. 
 Zurich would own 55 percent of the new financial company, with B.A.T. owning the rest. Though neither company would announce full terms of the transaction, saying they would be provided early next year, the new financial services company would have a market capitalization of roughly $32 billion.
But while the merger would rank among the biggest ever, it produced a surprisingly lukewarm reaction from some investors. Analysts who follow Zurich Group complained that the merger was unnecessarily complicated, would produce relatively insignificant cost savings and had murky strategic objectives.
Shares of Zurich Group have climbed about 5.2 percent, to 630 Swiss francs, since Sunday. Shares of B.A.T., which was eager to split off its insurance operations from its cigarette business, have jumped about 10.5 percent, to 609 pence.
By any measure, the new company will be a giant, based in Zurich and run by Zurich Group's chairman and energetic deal maker, Rolf Huppi. As a money-management concern that is growing with Zurich's current acquisition of the American mutual fund company Scudder, Stevens & Clark, it will oversee more than $342 billion in assets. As an insurance conglomerate that includes the Chicago-based Kemper Corporation, a Zurich unit, and the Los Angeles-based Farmers Insurance Group, a B.A.T. unit, it will have annual premium income of $40 billion.
B.A.T. is hoping that the deal will raise the stock market value of its insurance businesses, which have been under a cloud caused by B.A.T.'s extensive cigarette interests. As the owner of Brown & Williamson, which makes Kool and other American brands, B.A.T. has been under persistent pressure from investors as a result of the threat of tobacco litigation in the United States.
But the merger's complicated structure was criticized by some analysts. Zurich Group and B.A.T. shareholders will jointly own the new company, to be called Zurich Financial Services Group, through two separate holding companies that will themselves be listed as publicly traded stocks. B.A.T.'s tobacco interests, meanwhile, will remain separate as yet another publicly traded company, called British American Tobacco.
"It is unnecessarily complex and lacks transparency," complained Michael Lindsay, an insurance industry analyst at Lehman Brothers in London. "Some investors won't like it, simply from that point of view."
At a news conference in Zurich today, Mr. Huppi made it clear that he expected the deal to shore up his company's presence in the United States. Zurich Group bought Kemper last year for $2 billion and has reached an agreement to buy Scudder for $1.7 billion. B.A.T.'s key financial holding in the United States is Farmers, which has a sales force with more than 14,000 representatives.
Analysts said the appeal of this sales force, under the same company that will also be distributing Kemper's and Scudder's products, was one of the motivations for the agreement.
But unlike other mergers in the insurance and banking fields, this one is not expected to yield quick profits through cost-cutting and consolidation. Nor will it suddenly give Zurich big new economies of scale. Rather, Mr. Huppi justified the merger on the basis of "long-term" strategy.
"This transaction is not a short-term cost-saving measure," Mr. Huppi said. "What you have is a positioning taking into account long-term developments within world markets."

HEADLINE: U.S. Maritime Agency Moves to Bar Most Japanese Cargo Ships From American Ports

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
In an unexpected intensification of a trade dispute with Japan, the Federal Maritime Commission ordered the Coast Guard today to bar most Japanese cargo ships from American ports and to detain any Japanese ships currently in port.
The order was not expected to take effect until Saturday at the earliest, and presumably would be suspended if a long-brewing dispute over American access to Japanese ports is resolved in negotiations that continued tonight. 
 The commission took its vote today after it learned that Japan's three largest shipping companies -- apparently on orders from their Government -- were refusing to pay $4 million in fines imposed last month. The commission levied the fines in an attempt to force Japan and the politically powerful group that operates its harbors to drop a series of complex rules that American shippers contend make it expensive and sometimes impossible for them to move freely in and out of Japanese harbors.
The commission, invoking a 1920 law that gives it authority to bar or detain any ships moving through American ports, took the White House by surprise with its action, and sent Administration officials scrambling to contain the damage.
Any prolonged cutoff of the billions of dollars in trade between the two countries -- everything from consumer electronics to computers, wine and automobile components -- could quickly ripple through the world's two largest economies. It could also upend the final stages of talks over a civil aviation accord, an agreement that is significantly higher on Washington's agenda.
"I think the Japanese are a bit shocked at the severity of the commission's action today," an Administration official said. "We were taken aback a bit ourselves."
Administration officials say they had no advance warning of the commission's decision, which was announced at 3 P.M. That announcement apparently contributed to a late fall in both stock prices and the value of the dollar.
The order could be lifted immediately if the Japanese shipping companies agree to pay the fines or reach a settlement. But if the Coast Guard begins to bar entry to American harbors, the trade disruption could be considerable.
The vast majority of goods that move between the two countries are transported in container ships. The rest includes items that require specially designed ships, including cars, bulk materials like grain and other agricultural goods, and oil.
Although President Clinton has the authority to overrule the commission on national security grounds, a senior Administration official said, "There has been nothing in the air to suggest he's thinking of that."
The shipping dispute that led to today's order involves arcane rules that anger American shipping companies -- but that in some cases also apply to Japanese companies.
The rules are set by the Japan Harbor Transportation Association, a politically powerful private group that represents stevedores and terminal operators.
American and other foreign shipping lines have long complained that the association, which has a monopoly on harbor operations throughout Japan, requires all shippers to receive prior approval for even the most minor operational changes in handling cargo in Japanese ports. Those changes include alterations of schedules, substitutions of one ship for another and re-routing of ships.
The association has a strong interest in resisting reforms, which they fear could threaten their workers. But the issue is complicated by the fact that the association is also a major contributor to Japanese politicians, and the widespread belief in Japan that harbor operations have close links to Japanese organized crime groups.
Perhaps one reason that this dispute has intensified so quickly is that the talks are taking place outside of the ordinary trade apparatus and are being conducted by officials unaccustomed to the carefully orchestrated dance of trade talks between the two countries.
The talks, which resumed here this week, are being run by the Department of Transportation and its Japanese counterpart. The United States trade representative's office and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the usual gladiators in trade disputes, are not involved.
One of the unwritten rules between the two countries is that denying access to each other's markets is the ultimate sanction, the nuclear weapon of trade talks.
The last time the issue came up was during the high-stakes face-off on Detroit's ability to sell American cars and car parts to Japan. For weeks, the White House debated and refined its plan, and in the end President Clinton, meeting with his economic advisers, settled on some very limited sanctions, involving luxury cars made by a few Japanese automakers. The sanctions never actually went into effect because of an 11th-hour settlement.
The three Japanese companies affected by the commission's order are Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, known as K-Line in the United States, Mitsui OSK Lines and Nippon Yusen Kaisha. An executive close to one of the companies said on Wednesday that they have been eager for a settlement, in part because they, too, waste time and money following the rules of the Japan Harbor Transportation Association. But the companies know that their best bet is to benefit from what the Japanese call "gaiatsu" -- foreign pressure -- brought by American companies.
The three shipping companies were apparently prepared to pay the $4 million in fines, which represent a tiny fraction of the value of the cargo they move each week between the two countries. But late Wednesday night, they were ordered by the Ministry of Transportation not to pay, according to corporate officials.
The commission did not receive word of this refusal until it was already meeting today. So it reacted instantly, invoking the section of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 that permits it to tell the Coast Guard to "deny entry for the purpose of ocean-borne trade" and to detain vessels already in port.
The action may be particularly surprising to the Japanese, because independent regulatory bodies in Tokyo traditionally have little power to actually shut down commerce. It is almost inconceivable that Japan's regulatory bodies would risk a move this big without checking through the political chain of command.
In this case, the Federal Maritime Commission is not actually conducting the negotiations, but some Administration officials speculated today that the commission may be taking a particularly activist role at a time that Congress is seeking to pare down the number of regulatory agencies.
The Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulated trucking, was eliminated two years ago, and its remains were folded into the Transportation Department.

HEADLINE: With Transit Surplus Comes Subway Fare-Cut Proposal

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Bus and subway ridership are up by about 10 percent since July, far beyond the Transit Authority's expectations. The taxes that subsidize the authority have brought in much more money, thanks to the city's booming economy. The Transit Authority is, relatively speaking, awash in money in 1997, its balance sheet about $110 million healthier than projected.
So it was, perhaps, inevitable that someone would propose cutting the fare to $1.25. 
 That someone was the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone. At yesterday's Transit Authority board meeting, he asked the authority to consider offering 12 rides for the price of 10 to Metrocard users starting in January, rather than the 11-for-10 deal the authority plans to offer them. Mr. Vallone said that the authority's unexpected income would cover the cost of the rollback, which would bring the fare to what it was in 1995, when it went up to $1.50.
"If we can actually show the citizens of the city that we can make improvements and at the same time pass on a discount to them," he said, "why not seriously consider reducing the fare to a buck and a quarter?"
Transit officials said it was far too soon to make plans for the extra cash: revenue from the buses and subways has been increasing only since July, when free bus-to-subway transfers were first offered, though the increase in tax revenues began several months earlier.
"One swallow doesn't make a summer," said Daniel T. Scannell, the authority's vice chairman.
But John S. Dyson, a Transit Authority board member who is also an adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, urged the authority's staff to draw up a plan by next month to see if the extra discount would be feasible, if not by January, then maybe by July.
"We owe everyone a serious, businesslike analysis," he said.
For the first eight months of this year, according to figures released at the meeting, the subways and buses brought in $1.46 billion in fares, $25 million more than budgeted; almost all that increase has come since July. Tax revenue from sales, petroleum and utilities, among other things, stood at $674 million, $42 million more than expected. At the same time, the authority's expenses are down $44 million, to $2.33 billion, mostly because of savings on rentals and employee benefits. The surplus was first reported yesterday in The Daily News.
In addition to the Council Speaker and the Mayor, Ruth W. Messinger, Mr. Giuliani's election opponent, voiced support for the rollback.
"The whole point of fare cards," she said, "was to allow discounts for regular riders and provide for commuter and monthly passes. If they've got a surplus, they can do it now."
One board member, Beverly Dolinsky, who also heads a rider advocacy group called the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, asked her colleagues to consider saving the money for future debt payments, which are scheduled to balloon after 1999.
"If you can't do that," she said, "given that people are used to the fare now, it might be better to provide them with more and better service."
But Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, another rider group, urged the board members to spend the money one way or another. He reminded them that in 1994, the authority rang up a $113 million surplus, only to see it vanish when the city cut subsidies for student subway passes by that amount.
"You don't leave a surplus sitting around," he said. "Someone will steal it."

HEADLINE: Companies Get Second Helping Of Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
New York City's use of corporate tax breaks has become so pervasive that some of the city's most powerful and profitable companies are getting a second helping of incentives and subsidies at a time when New York's economy appears to be thriving.
In the latest example of what is known as corporate retention, the Giuliani administration is expected to announce next week that it has granted a $25 million sales tax exemption to Reuters, the British media company that threatened to leave Manhattan but instead will now build a corporate headquarters in Times Square. The administration says it is saving 1,850 jobs and getting a new office building out of the deal. 
 The tax break would be the second package of incentives that Reuters would enjoy at the office tower in the middle of Times Square. The site at the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue already has what many in real estate, government and urban planning circles regard as the city's most extensive tax breaks, worth an estimated $118 million over 20 years.
Under the 42d Street redevelopment project, the incentives for the Reuters site, and three other parcels, were worked out in the 1980's to enable developers to put office rents below those of surrounding landlords and to lure tenants to what had been a blighted neighborhood. Blighted is not a word anyone would use to describe Times Square today, which prompts many urban planners and even some real estate brokers to ask why the city is adding another share of tax incentives now.
"To the degree we're doing these deals two and three times, it aggravates an unfortunate situation," said H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning group. "These deals allow corporations to make suckers out of the public sector. I can't believe that Reuters wouldn't have done this without the tax break."
And Reuters is hardly alone. Conde Nast Publications, a unit of Advance Publications, threatened to move to the Midwest, Smith Barney to Hartford, and the Equitable Companies to Westchester County, and as a result, all received either a second package of tax incentives or a new, improved deal on a tax break granted years earlier. Bear Stearns & Company did not even bother to issue a threat, yet in August, it still received a second round of tax breaks.
The city has given tax incentives to some of Manhattan's most prominent companies -- from Credit Suisse First Boston and Paine Webber to The New York Times -- so it is hardly surprising that some companies have got into line for more. And under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city's Economic Development Corporation has struck more than twice as many corporate retention deals in the last three years as his predecessor, Mayor David N. Dinkins, did during the last three years of his administration.
 
Necessary Tool, Or Misspent Money?
City officials have long contended that incentives, which include breaks on sales and property taxes and electricity costs, are a necessary tool. But a growing number of urban planners, budget watchdogs and anti-tax groups, along with State Senator Franz S. Leichter and economists at the Federal Reserve Bank, assert that a city would be better off spending the tax money on roads, public transportation, job training and other areas that improve the overall business climate. No new jobs are created in the region when a company moves to Manhattan from Jersey City, they say, and the tax breaks shift the tax burden from the large corporations that get them to mid- and small-sized companies that do not.
Mr. Giuliani is following a path established by his predecessors, Edward I. Koch and Mr. Dinkins, in the 1980's and early 1990's, when they gave $235 million in incentives to Chase Manhattan Bank and $106 million to Prudential Securities after those companies threatened to flee Manhattan. Since Mr. Giuliani took office in 1994, he has provided 34 companies with tax breaks and other incentives totaling $666.7 million. The city could not provide comparable numbers for previous administrations.
City officials maintain that they are doing better deals at a lower cost per job and linking a larger part of the benefits to job growth. In the case of Reuters, the city is offering the company a $12 million sales tax exemption to retain the current number of employees and linking the remaining $13 million in benefits to increases in the company's work force, according to city and state officials involved with the deal.
"Every deal we've done has improved upon the last one," said Randy L. Levine, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. "It's not just about retaining jobs. We're getting job growth and a new building. The citizens are getting a net gain rather than a net loss. So we don't think it's double dipping."
But while the so-called retention deals have become somewhat smaller, the number of deals continues to rise. Large corporations seeking new office space routinely threaten to move to New Jersey or Stamford, Conn., or elsewhere to obtain tax breaks from the city. Whether the companies truly intend to abandon New York for the suburbs is harder to determine.
"A lot of people come out and kick the tires and then go back to New York and negotiate a deal," Richard LeFrak, the developer who runs Newport City, a corporate complex on the waterfront in Jersey City. "It's part of the process of getting subsidies out of New York."
That is not to say that all companies threatening to leave New York are simply bluffing, or that other states are unwilling to use tax incentives. Connecticut lured Swiss Bank and 1,300 employees from Manhattan to Stamford in 1994 with a $120 million incentive package. More recently, Zurich Centre Group, an insurance and financial services company, obtained what is perhaps the richest single tax break in the country. Zurich plans to move its operations and 400 employees from lower Manhattan to Stamford in return for $190 million in tax credits, the equivalent of $475,000 per job.
 
Jobs 'Moved Around,' One Official Says
"No new jobs are created in the process," said Robert B. Reich, the former United States Secretary of Labor. "They're merely moved around. Meanwhile, the public spends a fortune subsidizing these companies. But there's no way that mayors or governors can withstand the heat once a major company announces it is thinking about leaving."
That is why Mr. Reich, Representative David Minge of Minnesota and Arthur J. Rolnick, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis, say that the only way to end what they call the war between the states is to enact Federal legislation that would treat these tax breaks, cash grants and other incentives as corporate income, thereby gutting the value of the subsidies.
"I'm all in favor of states competing over who has the best-educated work force or the best transportation infrastructure," Mr. Reich said. "That's healthy. It bids up the value of public capital."
Last August, the Giuliani administration announced the city's second deal in six years with Bear Stearns, granting a $75 million tax package in return for the investment concern's promise to remain in Manhattan for the next 50 years and to build a new headquarters at 383 Madison Avenue, just north of Grand Central Terminal and perhaps the most valuable office development site in the city. Bear Stearns can collect a part of the benefits, up to $30 million, only if the company adds jobs to its current work force of 5,700.
James E. Cayne, chief executive of Bear Stearns, said at the time that during his company's three-year search for new office space, it had never threatened to leave the city. But that did not prevent the Giuliani administration from saying it had saved 5,700 jobs and sparked construction of a new office building.
More than half the jobs at Bear Stearns, however, had been "saved" by the Dinkins administration in 1991, when it granted the company an incentive package valued at $35 million to $45 million after it had threatened to move its back-office employees to New Jersey. The 15-year deal, which included tax breaks and low-cost electricity from the New York State Power Authority, covered 3,350 back-office employees, who moved to the Metrotech complex in Brooklyn, and the headquarters staff at 245 Park Avenue.
Mr. Levine, the Deputy Mayor, contends that the city jettisoned the Dinkins agreement and cut what he says is a better deal that covers a greater number of employees and anchors Bear Stearns to Manhattan for 50 years. But some analysts question the wisdom of a long-term deal with Bear Stearns, a profitable company whose deal could become moot if it were swallowed up in a wave of mergers that are sweeping the financial industry.
 
Reaping the Benefits Of 2 Retention Deals
Travelers Inc., the financial conglomerate, has reaped the benefits of two different retention deals. In 1994, Travelers received a $22.1 million tax package from the Giuliani administration in exchange for keeping 8,970 employees in New York, 94 percent of them at the company's subsidiary, Smith Barney. The city's news release did not mention that Travelers and Smith Barney were already benefiting from tens of millions of dollars in tax credits and low-cost electricity from the State Power Authority at its headquarters on Greenwich Street, under a deal struck in the mid-1980's. Those benefits had been given to Shearson Lehman, which was acquired by Travelers in 1993 and combined with Smith Barney.
"Travelers inherited the benefit," said Jack Murphy, a Power Authority spokesman. "There was a commitment to maintain at least 2,500 jobs in Manhattan."
After threatening to move to New Jersey in 1994, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, then a wholly owned subsidiary of the Equitable Companies, got $29.5 million in tax breaks after it agreed to move 1,950 jobs from 140 Broadway to a new headquarters at 277 Park Avenue. A year later, Equitable drew a $9.3 million tax package to keep its headquarters and 1,750 employees in Manhattan, instead of moving to Westchester. Although the benefits of both deals accrue to Equitable, the Giuliani administration and Equitable say the deals cover two separate companies with two separate payrolls.
City officials say they were able to come up with a better deal with NBC in 1996, when the company asked for its second special tax break. In 1987, Mayor Koch had given NBC a $100 million tax package to keep the broadcasting company from moving to Secaucus, N.J. After NBC agreed to buy its longtime Manhattan home at 30 Rockefeller Center, the Giuliani administration gave an additional $7 million tax cut. Unlike the Koch administration's package, which did not impose any conditions on the network, the latest deal requires NBC to keep at least 2,250 employees in New York until 2010 to obtain the additional benefits, city officials say.
Nowhere in the city are the layers of tax deals more apparent than in Times Square. The Giuliani administration gave a $10.75 million tax break to Conde Nast last year after the publishing giant threatened to move a number of employees to the Middle West. Although many real estate brokers and publishing executives could not imagine Conde Nast editors ever leaving Manhattan, the Giuliani administration said the deal insured that one of the first new office buildings of the mid-1990's would be built in Times Square.
Like Reuters, Conde Nast will also benefit from millions of dollars in tax breaks attached to the property as part of the 42d Street project.
"As a community," said Ira Schuman, executive vice president of Julien J. Studley Inc., a commercial real estate broker, "we need to be having a discussion as to what level of assistance the government should be providing, especially when we have a healthy economy."

HEADLINE: Messinger Opposes Helping Yankees Move to Manhattan

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Ruth W. Messinger said yesterday that she opposed spending city funds to build a new stadium for the Yankees in Manhattan and would support only a relatively limited effort to improve Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and prevent George M. Steinbrenner 3d from acting on a threat to move his team to New Jersey.
Ms. Messinger, the Democratic mayoral candidate, went to a sidewalk in front of Yankee Stadium to dramatize one of the clearer distinctions between herself and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani: how far the city should go to try to keep the team after its lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2002. "What I want the Mayor to tell us specifically is whether he will commit to bar the use of any public funds, or any public lands, to move the Yankees out of the Bronx," Ms. Messinger said. 
 Mr. Giuliani has said that while he prefers that the Yankees remain in the Bronx, he is prepared to support dramatic steps, including building a stadium in Manhattan, to keep the Yankees here.
Ms. Messinger's attempt to draw a distinction between herself and Mr. Giuliani on this issue came on a day when she encountered more evidence of gaps in her Democratic base. In a highly unusual bit of political theater, Mr. Giuliani appeared at City Hall with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the state's longtime Democratic Senator, where they announced a lawsuit intended to overturn the Presidential line-item veto.
Both men said they were brought together only by the opposition to the new law. But the result, intended or not, was the unusual image of Mr. Giuliani, whose central campaign effort this year has been to blur partisan distinctions, and Mr. Moynihan jostling and smiling broadly as cameras clicked away.
"I've endorsed the Democratic candidate," said Mr. Moynihan, who has not campaigned with her. When reporters asked about the political significance of the event, Mr. Moynihan responded with a twinkle in his eye and a curl to his lip, "I've taken an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic." His audience burst into prolonged laughter.
At the same event, Dennis Rivera, the president of 1199 National Health and Human Service Employees Union, a stalwart Democratic union that provided the organizational base for David N. Dinkins's two mayoral campaigns, delivered some more bad news for Ms. Messinger by disclosing that his union had decided to stay neutral in this contest.
"The nonendorsement of 1199 should not be construed an endorsement of the Mayor, or lack of an endorsement," Mr. Rivera said. "It's essentially that. The union has taken a stand of nonendorsement of many, many, many races." Mr. Giuliani also won the endorsement yesterday of Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union.
In discussing Yankee Stadium, Ms. Messinger was in part responding to polls suggesting that voters do not support moving the stadium or providing economic aid to Mr. Steinbrenner, her aides said. Mr. Giuliani these days rarely talks about what the city should do to keep the Yankees, and Ms. Messinger's remarks yesterday were intended to force Mr. Giuliani to address the issue.
"I believe there are much more important priorities for this city than spending a billion dollars to move the Yankees," Ms. Messinger said, standing with the shuttered stadium behind her in a cold autumn drizzle.
As Manhattan Borough President, Ms. Messinger has opposed the idea of building a new stadium, at a cost of up to $1 billion, on the Hudson River, between 30th and 33d Streets. She went further yesterday, saying that while the city should spend more money to improve such public facilities as subways near Yankee Stadium to entice Mr. Steinbrenner to stay, she considered such expenditures less important than spending money on city services like classrooms.
Mr. Giuliani's communications director, Cristyne F. Lategano, said the Mayor understood that the baseball team was a business. "You can't force them to stay in the Bronx," she said. "You can't force them to stay in New York City. If they are seriously pursuing New Jersey, he would look at them as a business."
At her news conference, Ms. Messinger initially said she would not support any public expenditures on the stadium itself. "This is a private business, a private team," she said. "The profits go to the private team. The private team should make the investment."
Later, after she spoke briefly with the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, she walked back over to reporters who were leaving the event to amend her remarks. She noted that the stadium was a public building and that she might support spending some money to improve it.
"My preference for public money is for the infrastructure around here, because it's used all of the time and not just for games," she said. "But I just wanted to make clear I wasn't closing out that direction."
Ms. Messinger said she did not believe that Mr. Steinbrenner was serious about moving. But she said she considered enticing Mr. Steinbrenner to stay less essential than improving other city services.

In an advance that promises to make it vastly easier for older women to remain fertile, researchers at a private clinic in Atlanta said they had frozen human eggs, thawed them, fertilized them and created a successful twin pregnancy. Fertility clinics have long been able to freeze sperm and embryos, but they had been stymied by their inability to freeze eggs.

HEADLINE: Garment Shops Found to Break Wage Laws

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Federal investigators have found that almost two-thirds of the companies in New York City's garment industry violate overtime or minimum-wage laws, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said yesterday.
At a news conference, Ms. Herman painted a picture of an industry that still resembled the sweatshops of the early 1900's when immigrant laborers often toiled 70 hours a week in unsafe conditions for minimal pay. 
 Ms. Herman said the Federal Government's first compliance survey done through inspections found wage and hour violations at 59 of the 94 garment makers that were visited, or 63 percent.
"Obviously, these results are unacceptable," Ms. Herman said. "We must redouble our efforts to seek solutions to the serious sweatshop problem in New York City."
Federal officials said they randomly chose the shops from among the city's 4,000 garment factories, which range from mom-and-pop shops with 15 workers to sprawling operations with more than 200. Investigators inspected them last summer and looked for violations over the preceding 90 days.
They found that of the 94 garment shops they inspected, 54 percent violated overtime laws and 20 percent flouted minimum-wage laws. The officials said they found minimum wage or overtime violations in 90 percent of the clothing shops inspected in Chinatown.
The violators have been cited and will be required to pay the back wages.
Altogether, 37 percent of shops complied with all overtime, minimum-wage and record-keeping laws, the investigators said.
Joanna Cheng, director of the Garment Workers' Justice Center in Manhattan, hailed the report for focusing attention on what she said was a huge problem that was growing worse. Ms. Cheng said that on Wednesday, an immigrant from China who was working in a Manhattan garment shop went to her office to complain about being paid $180 for a week when he worked 84 hours, equivalent to $2.14 an hour. The Federal minimum wage is $5.15 an hour.
"To many people, sweatshops are something that take place in third-world countries," said Bruce Raynor, executive vice president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. "Unfortunately, sweatshops take place in states like New Jersey and New York for thousands of workers."
Industry experts say that sweatshops were largely wiped out in New York City in the 1950's and 1960's. But the shops crept back in the 1970's and 1980's as immigrants flooded into New York in search of work and garment entrepreneurs increasingly cut corners in the face of low-wage competition from overseas and from the many clothing manufacturers that fled to the nonunion South. Sweatshops, which sometimes produce well-known clothing lines, have flourished as the labor movement's domination of New York's economy has waned.
Secretary Herman called on retailers and manufacturers that contract with New York garment shops to hire monitors to periodically check on the factories, supplementing the inspections done by the Federal and state labor departments.
Ms. Herman used Los Angeles as an example, noting that manufacturers there have joined a program to monitor more than half the garment shops in that city. She cited a Federal survey that found overtime violations at 25 percent of the monitored clothing shops and at 61 percent of the shops that were not monitored.
In New York, investigators found that 1,400 workers were due a total of $412,300 in back pay at the 59 factories where there were violations, coming to almost $300 per worker.
"That might not sound like much," said Suzanne Seiden, Acting Deputy Administrator of the Federal Wage and Hour Division, "but for a lot of workers that comes to two weeks' wages. For these folks, it's a matter of putting food on the table."
Owners of garment factories asserted that they were pressured to cut corners by intense foreign competition and by retailers who often paid them late or too little for what they produced.
"A lot of retailers don't pay on time, and that makes it hard for some shops to pay their workers properly," said Charles Wang, executive director of the Greater Blouse, Skirt and Undergarment Association, which represents 300 unionized New York shops. "The retailers often pay a piece rate that is too low that translates to paying people only $3 or $4 an hour."
Ms. Herman disclosed the findings at a news conference she held in Newark alongside Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick, who announced a broad plan for Newark's Catholic schools to combat sweatshops.
The archdiocese will identify the manufacturers of Catholic school uniforms that are sold in Newark and then work to insure that those companies comply with labor laws. The plan, developed by the archdiocese, the garment workers union and Federal and state officials, calls for teaching Catholic school students in grades 7 through 12 about labor issues and sweatshops.
"Catholic social teaching has stressed, always, that everyone has a right to fulfill their basic human needs for food, clothes, health care and housing met through just wages and through safe working conditions," the Archbishop said.
Some New York officials took umbrage that Ms. Herman traveled to Newark to issue a report that criticized clothing makers on the other side of the Hudson.
James Dillon, the state's Acting Labor Commissioner, said New York shares Federal concerns about sweatshops, adding that the state has focused on the problem by strengthening its investigative task force on sweatshops. While the Federal Department of Labor has no plans to seek prosecution of the violators, Mr. Dillon said New York State has prosecuted more than twice as many sweatshop operators as in 1994.

HEADLINE: Where Affirmative Action Ranks in Importance With the Architecture

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Etched on the plaques around the rotunda of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center are the names of governors, million-dollar-plus donors and Gus Heningburg, the affirmative-action consultant for the project.
"I don't think you will find another building in the state where they list the name of the affirmative-action officer along with the architect, board members and others," said Mr. Heningburg, a longtime resident of the city, which as of 1990 was 58 percent black and 27 percent Hispanic. 
 Lawrence P. Goldman, president of the center, said the decision to list Mr. Heningburg reflected an unabashed "social agenda" that required that at least 33 percent of the construction hours be worked by members of minorities and that at least 25 percent of the contracts go to businesses owned by minority groups and women.
In the end, minority workers accounted for 39 percent of the worker hours and 32 percent of the minority contracts.
"We did this very consciously and are not ashamed of it," Mr. Goldman said. "We want to be an economic engine for the city, and where this has happened best is where the arts centers have taken a strong position in making it happen."
Mr. Heningburg is a veteran of efforts in the 1970's to place minority workers in the construction trades in Newark and surrounding Essex County.
In 1975, he founded the Newark Construction Trades and Training Corporation, which grew out of demonstrations that closed a number of publicly financed building sites where minority-group workers had had trouble being hired.
Over the years, with the help of Federal and city money, the corporation trained 3,000 workers and helped pave the way into unions.
Mr. Heningburg said in the process he learned that the simplest way to increase hiring at construction sites was to include it in contracts with construction companies and subcontractors just as a clause would require that a roadway be level, or the companies would not be paid.
"It makes it an economic issue, not a moral or social issue for the contractor," he said.
Mr. Goldman said the center "never had to fire a contractor, but we did have some dicey moments and had to withhold payments for a time."
"The point, though," he added, "is that when faced with challenges, we didn't blink."

Dollar Strengthens vs. Mark As German Rate Fears Ease

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar surged against the mark yesterday after officials of the Bundesbank eased concerns that German interest rates would soon rise, while talk of a rise in United States rates mounted.
A member of the Bundesbank's policy council, Reimut Jochimsen, said yesterday that the central bank was not likely to raise interest rates in the next few weeks, though it was watching for signs of inflation. Another council member, Klaus-Dieter Kuhbacher, said later that he saw no reason for more rate increases before the end of the year, the German news agency VWD reported. 
 Also yesterday, larger-than-expected gains in United States industrial production and housing starts signaled that the economy might be growing fast enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates soon, or at least sooner than a rate rise by the Bundesbank. Industrial production rose seven-tenths of 1 percent last month for the third consecutive monthly gain, while housing starts jumped 7.9 percent last month, after two months of declines.
"The market thinks there's going to be a delay in moving German interest rates while rates in the U.S. may rise," said Ron Hudson, head of corporate currency sales at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Robert Near, an institutional currency salesman at the Bank of New York, said, "The idea that German rates can stay where they are, while we're on the lookout for higher U.S. rates certainly favors the dollar."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.7718 marks, up from 1.7435 late on Thursday. The 1.6 percent rise against the mark was the sharpest single-day gain since July 11.
The dollar rose against the yen after Finance Minister Hiroshi Misuzuka ruled out tax cuts aimed at reviving Japan's sagging economy.
The dollar extended its gains versus the yen in late trading after the United States reported a breakthrough in talks with Japan over a dispute on access to Japanese ports. Rising trade tension tends to drag down the dollar, so signs it may be abating often give the currency a boost.
In New York, the dollar settled at 120.68 yen, up from 119.65 yen on Thursday. In other trading, the pound fell to $1.6166 from $1.6179.

HEADLINE: Fed Official Not Worried About Economy

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Oct. 17

 BODY:
Though a tight labor market poses a troubling inflation threat, fresh reports of economic strength do not signal an immediate need to put on the brakes, a Federal Reserve policy maker said today.
"Currently, the availability of labor and the threat of a run-up in the cost of labor are at or near the top of many people's worry list," said Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. 
 Mr. Guynn is a voting member of the Fed committee that raised interest rates in March. The central bankers next meet on Nov. 12.
In a speech to the Economic Club of Florida, Mr. Guynn echoed remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who rattled financial markets last week by saying the economy has been on an "unsustainable track" of strong, noninflationary growth.
While Mr. Guynn said a Government report today of an unexpectedly large rise in factory output could be an inflation warning, much of the increase was from electricity plants and probably was temporary.
The Fed will not base policy on particular figures that "go up one month and down the next," he said. "The economy is operating at a very high level, which is very good as long as we don't get some kind of imbalance, We'll just have to watch."

HEADLINE: About New York;
Ex-Gangster On New Path, With Advice

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
FELIPE MERCADO slowly got up from the sofa -- he was tired after working all day as a building superintendent -- and ducked into the bedroom. He reappeared holding a denim jacket with cutoff sleeves, the kind that used to be seen in his Hunts Point neighborhood more often than intact ones. An arc-shaped patch on its back read "Savage Skulls."
In the 1970's, Mr. Mercado wore his colors like a flag. He was Blackie, the president of the Savage Skulls, a Bronx street gang with hundreds of members and perhaps as many rivals. He survived that era, as well as 11 years in and out of prisons, and returned to Hunts Point, where the challenges of making a living were more daunting than any danger that had lurked in wait from another clique. 
 He and some of his gang brothers are in their 40's now, but they sometimes wear their old colors like grizzled Veterans of Domestic Wars getting together for a smoker.
"I'm still a Savage Skull," said Mr. Mercado, 44. "But it passed. Everybody works. When we get together we go to a bowling alley. It's a family now. If one of the brothers is not working, we try to get him a job or help him out. We have cookouts, so our kids can go to the park."
What happened?
"You get older," he said. "Simple as that. You have your kids and you want a better life for them."
MR. MERCADO has been thinking a lot about children. Recent weeks have brought a flurry of reports, some overblown, about a new wave of youth gangs slashing away at innocent victims as they try to carve out a name for themselves on their turf. In response, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has vowed to crack down by deploying more police officers to "nip in the bud" any resurgence.
All this talk makes Mr. Mercado laugh.
"They had a task force with us before," he said. "They're going to go after the big guns, but then the other guys will be there without leadership and go crazy. Before you know it, everything you try will backfire. Let me put it this way. If you take the President and all his officials of the Government, who's going to make all the decisions for the country? People will just go berserk."
It happened to his gang when he was sent to prison. Wannabes and knuckleheads saw their chance and ran amok. He said there were new wannabes out there now, wilder and more violent. Yet one thing has not changed.
"Everybody wants something to belong to," he said. "My parents were never home. My father had passed away. My mother was working all the time. I was always alone. You need somebody to identify with. There is nothing for these kids today."
And when there is nothing to do, nihilism rules.
"They think it is easy to die," he said. "But it is harder to live. They take the easy way out. They go get shot up. In reality, give life a shot and see how far you can get if you survive."
As much as he has tried to talk to the young gangsters and others in the neighborhood, it has not been easy. Call it karma, but they insist on doing things their way and ignore his advice.
IT is not just the young people who have chosen to go their own way. He used to speak to schools and community groups about how to deal with youth violence, but it seemed that nothing changed. He was elected president of a local public school's Parents' Association, where he began a conflict-resolution program that fell victim to bureaucratic turf battles.
"I'm retired," he said. "I got tired of talking to people."
It would be easy to dismiss Mr. Mercado as an ex-con with a shady past, but he speaks thoughtfully and quietly. He has a trade and an education now, something that too many young people lack. They might get it in prison, but you don't have to be an economist to figure out that there are more cost-effective ways, he said.
"The system has to bend a little," he said. "You can't do things just by force."
His voice was weary. Life is hard, but it keeps him busy. When he's not fixing things in the building, he sits in his living room and paints, near a table where candles flicker by a statue of the Virgin Mary.
Outside, the sounds of an argument echoed. He shook his head in annoyance.
"It can go either way with these kids," he said. "Sometimes I don't even bother to think about it. Giuliani thinks he's doing something. He better stop and think. Even the people who are working are so stressed they can blow up. They try and try, and the more they do the more they get messed over. The kids feel like that, too. You know what I'm saying?"

HEADLINE: Strength in Economic Data Renews Fear of Fed Tightening

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Just when it seemed the economy had begun slowing to a safer speed, two Government reports today renewed fears that it still was running too fast for the anti-inflation police at the Federal Reserve.
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent last month -- to make growth for the July-September quarter the biggest in 13 years -- as their operating rate edged closer to capacity. And builders broke ground on 7.9 percent more new homes in September, erasing nearly all the drop in housing starts over the preceding two months. 
 Taken together, the latest figures undermined assumptions fed by lackluster retail sales growth, regional surveys of factories and continued tame inflation that activity was slackening and that the Fed could likely avoid restraining it with higher interest rates.
Now, however, "It's a little too early to say the economy is slowing," Melanie Hardy, an economist at Bear, Stearns, said after digesting today's figures. She noted especially the rise in industry's operating rate, up three-tenths of a point, to 84.4 percent, the highest since February 1995.
Although there were mitigating factors in both reports, the unexpected strength contributed to sizable declines in the securities markets as traders and investors reassessed the possible outcome of the next Fed policy meeting, scheduled for Nov. 12.
"It's become clear that the economy can't continue to grow at this pace without good reason to expect some monetary tightening," said William A. Brown, chief economist at J. P. Morgan. He put the chances of a rate increase next month at "close to 50-50."
Still, today's statistics were not overwhelmingly strong. The production increase was swollen by a 4.4 percent leap in utility output after a cool August that minimized air-conditioner use.
In fact, manufacturing, which accounts for 86 percent of the Index of Industrial Production, climbed a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent in September, half the increases of July and August.
Moreover, noted Maury N. Harris, senior economist at Paine Webber, higher output recently has been achieved without a corresponding rise in the number of hours worked in factories and thus should not raise fears of inflationary wage pressures.
"So far this year," Mr. Harris said, "manufacturing output has been rising by around four-tenths of 1 percent per month faster than factory hours worked -- a clear indication of the kind of productivity gains that the Federal Reserve System wants to see continuing in order to keep price inflation low."
And while housing starts were up for apartments as well as single-family homes -- and in all regions of the country -- specialists said they had merely plateaued at a high pace of 1.5 million that was no higher than June's.
"We don't have a surge in starts," said Paul Taylor, senior economist at America's Community Bankers. "What we have is a combination of good market conditions, which include low mortgage rates, modest price appreciation, well-managed inventories and the wealth effect" of rising stock prices.
Today, the National Association of Home Builders reported another decline in the proportion of members who rated traffic in model homes "high." October's 9 percent reading, which flirted with a five-year low, was seen as a signal that home building would slow in coming months even though the Government's report on September starts showed permits issued for future construction climbed 3.4 percent, to an annual rate of 1,445,000.
Groundbreaking rose 10.7 percent last month in the West, 9.7 percent in the Northeast, 9.3 percent in the Midwest and 5.6 percent in the South, the Commerce Department found.
The production report, compiled by the Federal Reserve, showed sizable gains for furniture, iron and steel, computers, semiconductors, aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment, paper, chemicals and petroleum refining.
There was a substantial decline, however, in industrial machinery other than computers and office equipment, and small declines in instruments and miscellaneous manufacturing.

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble, With Dow Falling 91.85

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stocks dropped sharply yesterday for the second consecutive day, hurt by bad news on corporate earnings, rising oil prices, fears of a United States-Japanese trade war and Government data that suggested renewed inflation.
The combined impact of these forces briefly sent the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 180 points, or 2.4 percent, reviving some unsettling memories on the last trading day before the 10th anniversary of the stock market crash. 
 The Dow average recovered about half the loss to end down 91.85 points, or 1.16 percent, at 7,847.03, as fears of a trade brawl receded, after Japan and the United States announced they had settled their differences. But some traders said the psychological stigma of the 1987 crash, which sent the Dow average down 22.6 percent in a huge wave of selling, was a subtle influence hanging over the market that contributed to the decline yesterday. "Some of these stocks were taken apart on news that just wasn't that bad," said Donald M. Selkin, head of stock index futures at Prudential Securities, noting that the market had been relatively calm in recent weeks. "Just when we were about to whistle past the graveyard of what happened 10 years ago, we get this." The selloff was caused partly by another batch of weak earnings reports in the once-stellar technology sector, adding to a string of high-profile setbacks.
Seagate Technology Inc., a leading maker of computer disk drives and a technology bellwether, was the worst hit, after announcing an unexpectedly large third-quarter loss late Thursday. Its shares tumbled 5 5/16 , to 32 yesterday, a 14 percent drop. Its results compounded worries inspired by other disheartening earnings results reported Thursday.
"There were disappointing earnings in big, important companies," said Charles Pradilla, a market strategist at Cowen & Company. "This was Sears, Merck, Intel and Sun Microsystems among others. And those companies mentioned stuff that might not go away so fast."
Because of those concerns, entire legions of stocks were battered yesterday. On the Big Board, trading activity was heavy, at 625 million shares, and nearly four stocks fell for every issue that rose. Indeed, all the major stock indexes fell more than 1 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 11.07, or 1.16 percent, to 944.16, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks fell 7.87 points, or 1.72 percent, to 449.29.
The drop in technology stocks was felt particularly hard on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where many computer-related companies are traded. The Nasdaq composite index fell 32.81 points, or 1.93 percent, to 1,666.85. And the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index lost 2.7 percent of its value.
Investors were also troubled by rising oil prices related to tensions in the Middle East and rising bond interest rates, which reacted to Government reports of unexpectedly robust industrial production and housing starts in September. Yields have been climbing since Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted two weeks ago that pressures might build into inflation.
Several analysts, though, said they were perplexed by the two-day selloff in stocks, noting that earnings were not as bad as the market was suggesting.
"This is not a panic session," said Joseph Yurman, a managing director at Robertson, Stephens & Company. "Everyone's making comparisons to 1987 but we're nowhere near that."
Byron R. Wien, the chief United States strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, said the selling was not worrisome.
"Look, we've been going up for weeks, so the market was overbought and due for a reaction," he said. "But I think this is an interim correction, if we have a more serious decline it will occur early next year."
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 26 fell yesterday, led by I.B.M., which is due to report earnings next week, and Merck, which disappointed this week. Shares of I.B.M. fell 4 1/4, to 95 7/16 , and Merck lost 2 15/16 , to 95.
Within the technology sector, dozens of stocks saw huge losses. Besides Seagate, Sun Microsystems was down 3 15/16 , to 38 3/8; Dell Computer -- a market favorite -- lost 3 15/16 , to 94 7/8, and Intel was down 2 3/8, to 83.

HEADLINE: Japan Nears Pact With U.S. On Threat to Bar Its Ships

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The United States and Japan said today that they were on the verge of a shipping agreement that appeared to defuse a looming confrontation between the Coast Guard and Japanese vessels entering and leaving American harbors.
The accord, the details of which are not final, is intended to remove the restrictions on American ships operating in Japanese ports, a source of contention for many years. But officials on both sides conceded that no matter what they put on paper over the next few days, it may not break the power of organized crime groups that are widely viewed as controlling Japan's ports. 
 But to both the Americans and the Japanese, that seemed almost secondary to the daylong scramble to patch together an accord that would persuade the Federal Maritime Commission to back away from its unexpected decision on Thursday to close American ports to Japanese cargo ships.
By early evening -- after meetings at the White House that involved the Treasury Secretary, the trade representative and the chief of staff, Erskine Bowles -- the commission decided not to order the Coast Guard to begin the embargo, which would have been the first since 1941, when oil shipments were halted. Japanese schoolchildren are still taught that the 1941 embargo precipitated the attack on Pearl Harbor.
The commission planned the embargo after Japanese shipping companies, on orders from their Government, refused to pay $4 million in fines imposed six weeks ago in an effort to force the relaxation of port rules. Whether they will still have to pay is among the unresolved issues.
In fact, the Administration could not seem to decide today whether this was a brewing crisis or a comic series of missteps on both sides. At one point, a senior official at the White House was even reciting the lessons of the Cuban missile crisis, which gripped Washington 35 years ago this week: before plunging into a naval embargo, it was important to make sure the other side had a graceful way out.
What happened today was that the unexpected decision by the Maritime Commission forced both Washington and Tokyo to elevate their long-running port dispute to the highest political levels. "Let's say it concentrated the minds," said Stuart Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, who was thrown into the talks along with the Japanese Ambassador, Kunihiko Saito.
Mr. Saito is no newcomer to Tokyo-Washington contretemps. His previous job was Deputy Foreign Minister, the top career diplomatic post in Japan, a position that offered plenty of opportunity to defuse trade disagreements that threatened to weaken the Japanese-American alliance. But today he was careful not to declare victory.
"I hesitate to call it a success yet, because some details are still being worked out," Mr. Saito said in an interview this afternoon. "There is a limit to what the Japanese Government can do, because there are private parties involved."
One of those parties -- the Japan Harbor Transportation Association -- has a stranglehold on port operations, which is the heart of the problem. For decades, its dictates on how shipping companies must operate, including requiring expensive advance clearance for every change in plans, have been the law of the waterfront. The situation is not eased by the fact that the dividing line between the association and the yakuza, Japan's organized crime groups, is murky at best.
"There are very powerful, well organized groups on the docks," Mr. Eizenstat said today, weighing every word, "with a great deal of muscle, in more ways than one."
In the accord today, Japan agreed that all shipping companies will be permitted to go through the Government to deal directly with port operators. Of course, many of those operators are members of the association, but, in theory at least, foreign companies may be able to open their own terminals.
"This new system certainly will be tested in the very near future," said Koji Tsuruoka, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official involved in the talks. "It remains to be seen what happens. But we are hopeful."
Mr. Tsuruoka insisted that the yakuza had been driven out of many of the ports and that its influence was diminishing. "The question is whether the association would harass someone using the new alternative route," he said. Japan has "given assurances that order will be maintained at the ports and Japanese laws will be enforced."
Such assurances are something short of an ironclad commitment, but many Japanese trade accords have been infused with the same vagueness.
When Japan and the United States reached a landmark accord on automotive trade in 1995, they described Japan's obligations in such differing terms that it sometimes seemed as if they had sat in different negotiating rooms. That agreement seemed to work for a year or so, but in recent months it has begun to fray, with American officials saying Japan is not living up to its commitments, and Japanese officials saying they never agreed to interfere with the operations of domestic automakers.
No one would be surprised if the same happened in this case. "This isn't the end of the issue, it's just the next step," a senior Administration official said. "But we won't be spending the weekend watching on CNN while the Coast Guard pulls up next to Japanese freighters."
The American negotiators were aided by the fact that even Japanese shipping companies have long chafed at the expensive, inefficient procedures at Japanese ports, though they have never had the political clout to subvert the control of the Japan Harbor Transport Association. So in an odd way they were allied with the Americans.

Another Big Marriage In the Accounting Industry
KPMG Peat Marwick and Ernst & Young are expected to announce as early as Monday that they will merge to create the world's No. 1 accounting firm, with $15.3 billion in global revenue and 11,712 partners. 
 Such a combination would eclipse in size the pending merger of Coopers & Lybrand and Price Waterhouse announced a month ago. Both deals would reduce the Big Six accounting firms to the Big Four. Page A1.
 
Stocks Fall Again
The stock market dropped sharply for a second straight day on a combination of disappointing corporate earnings, fears of a U.S.-Japanese trade brawl and news of unexpected strength in the economy that revived anxiety about inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled as much as 180 points before recovering half the loss to end down 91.85 points, or 1.16 percent. The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, fell nearly 2 percent. D15.
 
Treasury bond prices fell on the Government's reports of unexpectedly strong housing and manufacturing data, which revived speculation the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates at its November policy-making meeting to thwart inflationary pressure building in the economy. D14.
 
The dollar surged against the mark after Bundesbank officials hinted German interest rates would not rise soon, while talk of a rate increase in the United States intensified. D4.
 
Accord on Shipping Near
United States and Japanese negotiators are nearing an agreement on shipping, officials said, defusing a confrontation between the Coast Guard and Japanese vessels entering and leaving American harbors. While the details are not final, the agreement is intended to remove restrictions on American ships operating in Japanese ports. A6.
 
Pressure Building on Worldcom
A big drop in Worldcom's share price underscored the potential vulnerability of its $34 billion offer for MCI, which is to be paid entirely in Worldcom stock. Analysts speculated further drops might pressure the suitor into sweetening its offer with some cash, in order to compete with a $28 billion all-cash bid for MCI by GTE. D3 .
 
Dow Jones, CNBC Said to Talk
Dow Jones executives are said to have met with potential partners or buyers of the company's troubled financial information business and are said to be in discussions with CNBC about a possible joint venture. Dow Jones stock rose 3 percent on speculation it might divest the Dow Jones Markets unit, which has been a drag on the company. D2.
 
Thinner McDonald's Earnings
Slow domestic sales and the strong dollar overseas contributed to a less-than-expected 1.9 percent earnings gain in the third quarter for McDonald's. The leading fast-food chain said it expected the dollar's strength to hurt its results in the fourth quarter as well. D15.
 
Software Merger Planned
Sungard Data Systems, a provider of computer disaster recovery services, said it would purchase Infinity Financial Technology, a designer of trading and risk management software, for about $313 million in stock. D3.
 
Oil Reverses and Ends Lower
Crude oil prices retreated sharply to end lower on eased concern of a wider conflict in Iraq that could disrupt supplies. Cocoa prices jumped on strong United States demand. D4.
 
Thai Reforms Advance
Emergency decrees designed to stabilize Thailand's troubled financial sector were approved by the Cabinet and took effect immediately. The rescue package was required by lenders who contributed to a $17.2 billion International Monetary Fund loan package to Thailand D14.

HEADLINE: Something in Common;
To Bridge a Gap, Korean Grocers Try a Little Creole

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
Gazing at his customers suspiciously, Mun Chae paced along the rows of eggplants, green plantains, bell peppers and other vegetables stacked neatly on the shelves of Chae Fruit and Vegetable Market.
Then Mr. Mun, the manager of the store, zeroed in on a familiar face, a large Haitian woman who was clutching a straw basket under her arms and examining a bunch of plantains. He approached her and spoke in perfect Haitian Creole. 
 "Sak pase?" said the Korean-born Mr. Mun, asking the woman how she was doing. "The plantains are good," he said, again in Creole, stretching his command of the language. The woman smiled and headed for the cash register. His mission accomplished, Mr. Mun smiled back.
Such genial, cross-lingual exchanges between buyers and sellers have become more common in the four-block stretch of Church Avenue between 16th Street and St. Paul's Place in Flatbush, Brooklyn, as Korean grocers, once perceived by their customers as aloof and worse, have begun to learn a smattering of useful Creole words, including a few earthy ones, to cater to Haitian and other Caribbean customers.
In trying to bridge the linguistic and cultural distance, the half-dozen Korean merchants on the shopping strip are in part responding to what they see as misconceptions about them among the Caribbean and other minority communities.
The two immigrant groups have often had bitter relations, which was heightened seven years ago after a Haitian customer said she was slapped by a Korean store owner on Church Avenue. That incident touched off a yearlong boycott of Korean stores, which became a political albatross for Mayor David N. Dinkins.
In the wake of the boycott, Koreans began reaching out to other groups in the city. These days, more non-Koreans are employed in Korean-owned stores. Seminars are offered to teach Koreans to smile more frequently at customers, something they say is rare in their culture, and to put change directly into a customer's hand rather than simply dropping it on the counter, as they would in Korea. On their own, they are learning Creole phrases from their customers and from Caribbean street vendors.
"Our problem has always been communication," said Mr. Mun, who also manages Bon Banane, another grocery store across the street. "The Haitians don't speak good English and the Koreans don't speak good English. So we make a little effort to understand their language. They like it and it's good for our business."
Many Haitians view the Koreans' attempt to learn even a few technical words and phrases as a sign of respect and admiration.
"It was incredible for me to be walking down Church Avenue and hearing this Korean guy calling out in Creole the names of vegetables that Haitians like," said Ronald Aubourg, a policy analyst with the Haitian Centers Council, a community group based in Brooklyn. "His interaction with his customers was fascinating. It's the kind of thing that could happen only in New York."
The Rev. Al Sharpton, who supported the 1990 boycott, said that he welcomed the merchants' attempt to reach out socially, but that their effort should be extended economically, by offering neighborhood residents more jobs and by using the services of local businessmen. "You must not just be courteous, but engage in economic reciprocity," Mr. Sharpton said.
In New York, merchants have traditionally made efforts to learn the languages of their customers. Decades ago, in response to an influx of Spanish-speaking residents, Italian and Jewish store owners in the South Bronx and parts of Brooklyn started using the familiar Spanish greeting "hola," and other expressions.
But it has been a long, uphill climb for Koreans, who began arriving in large numbers in 1965 after immigration laws were eased. Back home, they were mostly professionals and civil servants. In New York, they gravitated to food stores, because their weakness with English was not such a barrier in that business.
They could scrape together enough money to buy stores in blighted areas ignored by other merchants. Their formula for success was simple: stay open long hours and offer glistening fresh vegetables that catered to local tastes. They stock plenty of strawberries in Park Slope, for example, but not in Flatbush.
As the number of Korean stores citywide increased to 3,000, Koreans discovered that language was not just important for success, it was essential. Conflicts and confrontations, some caused by cultural misunderstandings, would sometimes spin out of control. Customers accused merchants of being rude, and merchants feared that some of their customers were predators. Critics said that those complaints seemed to focus on young black men.
The 1990 boycott, centered on the Red Apple grocery, was the bitterest manifestation of the gulf, and the ill will lingered even after the owner sold the store in 1991. But in the years since then, gestures like learning Creole and taking black and Hispanic community leaders to South Korea have smoothed relations.
"I think it's terrific that the merchants are doing this," said Grace Lyu-Volckhausen, who directs minority program evaluation at the State of New York Mortgage Agency. "Language unites you and makes you understand other people."
Mrs. Lyu-Volckhausen, who was Asian affairs liaison for Mayor Edward I. Koch, said that after the 1990 boycott began, Korean leaders developed a list of tenets for Korean merchants ignorant of American business practices and of their customers' culture and mores.
The big breakthrough has been the Korean grocers' efforts to learn some Haitian Creole, a melange of French and African dialects that is spoken by 10 million people, including 7 million Haitians and people from other Caribbean islands like Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Lucia. To be sure, the merchants cannot carry on a discussion in Creole about the latest twist in Haitian politics, a subject that their Haitian customers debate passionately on the streets outside.
What they have done successfully is to learn enough words to conduct a brisk business.
"This is Church Avenue, and maybe 80 percent of our customers are Haitians," said Timil Kim, who works at Bon Banane and boasts of knowing about a dozen Creole words. "They come in to hear our Creole."
In the last few years, the sidewalks of Church Avenue have been crowded with Haitian women selling spices and condiments wrapped in plastic bags, reminiscent of the open-air markets of Haiti. But the Haitian women have met little or no resentment from the more established Korean grocers. Instead, the two groups seem to have created an informal joint venture. The bustle created by the Haitian street vendors spills into the stores, increasing business.
The vendors also teach Korean merchants Creole and point out the spices and vegetables favored by Haitians. The Korean markets carry Caribbean vegetables like yucca, red coco, dasheen and edoes, and other produce like yams, mango, tamarind and sugar cane. The stores also sell sorrel, a dark red root used to make a soft drink, and Crix, a popular biscuit sold in the Caribbean.
"We don't have any problems with the Koreans," said Marie Narciste, 41, a vendor who was selling an assortment of spices, candles and used clothes, a few feet away from the Korean-owned Caribbean Fruits and Grocery store. "We conduct our business and they do theirs. We're all trying to survive."

HEADLINE: In Westchester, Race Tight but Rivals Miles Apart

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Oct. 16

 BODY:
They represent the two faces of Westchester.
The Republican candidate for county executive, Ted Dunn, is a Harvard-educated multimillionaire. The Mayor of Rye, a small, affluent city on Long Island Sound, he lives in a 14-room house in an affluent community of waterfront homes. He is a retired managing director of Morgan Stanley who has raised $800,000 for his campaign and has added $1 million of his own. 
 The Democratic candidate, Andy Spano, has spent 36 years in government jobs, 25 as a teacher and school administrator and 11 as county clerk. Mr. Spano, who lives in an eight-room Cape Cod in Yorktown, a middle-class community in northern Westchester, started a computer-consulting business in 1993 after he retired as county clerk. Last year, the company lost $21,000. His campaign has raised $600,000.
Polls suggest that either man could win, a far cry from the tradition in Westchester, where for years Republicans have been as confident of capturing the county executive's job as a Kennedy would be of carrying Boston. Only one Democrat, Alfred DelBello, has been elected county executive in Westchester's history. In 1973, Mr. DelBello won the office in a race in which there was no incumbent, and he remained County Executive until 1983, when he became Lieutenant Governor.
Today, Mr. Spano finds himself in a similar position, with no incumbent in the race, since Andrew P. O'Rourke, who has been County Executive for 14 years, is retiring.
"My sense is that it's a very close race, but Spano has a real opportunity to win it," said Richard A. Berman, president of Manhattanville College, which released a poll in late September that showed Mr. Spano 10 to 12 percentage points ahead of Mr. Dunn, with 24 percent of voters undecided. The college put out a poll in July that showed Mr. Spano 18 points ahead, so Mr. Dunn has narrowed the gap.
"Dunn was successful," Mr. Berman said, "in putting a lot of money in and increasing his name recognition and garnering traditional Republican support, primarily around the tax issue, which our poll had previously identified as the most significant issue in the minds of Westchester residents."
Though Westchester is traditionally associated with wealth and suburban Republicanism, there are 38,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans in the county. But a quarter of registered voters have no party affiliation, and many of them vote Republican. Three percent belong to other parties, like the Right to Life Party, which also has a candidate, Michael Reynolds, in the race.
Both Mr. Dunn and Mr. Spano have focused on taxes. Mr. Dunn, an advocate of privatization, has pledged to keep taxes level, as he has in Rye since 1993, when he was elected Mayor, an unpaid job. He has also focused on environmental issues, and says he plans to upgrade the county's sewer system and create parkland along the Hudson River.
"He's been a model Mayor of the city of Rye," said Ira Brody, chairman of the Victory 97 campaign unit of the Westchester Republican Party. "He's held the line on taxes. He has a good record on the environment and a solid vision for Westchester and protecting the environment. He's also tough on crime."
Critics, however, question whether Mr. Dunn's experience running a wealthy, homogeneous community has prepared him to govern a county as diverse and large as Westchester.
"Rye's a nice place, and fortunately it doesn't have any problems," said Thomas J. Abinanti, a Democratic legislator from Greenburgh. "But county government is real government, and you're dealing with the full panoply of problems. I think it tells you how important the job of mayor is in Rye since there's no pay for it."
Asked if he can run a big government, Mr. Dunn points to his business success. "I ran a big business in Malaysia and I ran a big business in Italy," said Mr. Dunn, who speaks fluent Italian. "I'm accustomed to accomplishing things."
He said being wealthy and not a career politician allowed him to be independent.
"Andy Spano wants to take the fact that I've had a successful business career and hold that against me," Mr. Dunn said. "The fact that I've been successful in business allows me to do this job in Rye. I think it's good that I'm a political outsider in that I'm not dependent on this as a job. I'm beholden to no one."
His detractors say that, unlike the gregarious Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Dunn will have a tough time carrying a populous, working-class city like Yonkers.
"Dunn's strength is not personal contact with voters," said Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Democrat. "He doesn't do well in groups he's not comfortable with. Spano is a much better campaigner, but I don't know that you can beat huge amounts of money by doing train stations."
Mr. Dunn, 61, who is married and has three grown sons, says he will have no problem reaching out to the diverse population of Westchester, noting that he sits on the executive committee of Covenant House and on the board of Mercy College, which has a large minority enrollment.
Mr. Spano, also 61, is married with six children and is thought of by his fellow Democrats as a down-to-earth, people-oriented politician. "I think Andy understands the normal person who uses government," Mr. Abinanti said. "He understands that government is there to provide services that people need, but that it shouldn't cost any more than it has to."
Like Mr. Dunn, Mr. Spano said he would create green space along the riverfront. He also said he would take steps to improve Westchester's economy, since it has the least amount of growth of surrounding counties. But Mr. Spano's major issue is a pledge to cut county taxes by 15 percent, although critics question whether such a large cut is possible. He said he would lower taxes by cutting the county executive's budget, reducing the number of automobiles available to county employees, reducing welfare and cutting the salaries of managers and commissioners by 5 percent, among other measures.
His detractors attribute his lead to name recognition, part of that the misperception that he is a member of a powerful Republican clan from Yonkers with the same surname whose members include a State Senator and the current county clerk. Mr. Spano takes exception to that assertion. "I've made a big effort over the years to divorce myself from them," he said. "I was county clerk for 11 years. It's an insult to people's intelligence to suggest they vote on a name."
To those who ask whether he can really cut taxes, Mr. Spano says he kept the county clerk's office under budget annually, resulting in surpluses that totaled more than $6 million in his 11 years in office.
His opponent concedes that there were budget surpluses, but characterizes Mr. Spano's tenure as county clerk as one marked by runaway spending, noting that the county clerk's budget went to $4.1 million from $1.7 million.
Mr. Dunn has also accused Mr. Spano of more than tripling spending for salaries during his 11 years in office, but Mr. Spano says that the County Executive and the Board of Legislators, not he, approved his budget and set the salary scale. In addition, salary levels were not tripled. Some of the increase was because of the addition of employees to the county payroll when state aid for these positions was withdrawn and because of the addition of a new archives unit to the office of county clerk.
Mr. Dunn was cited by the Westchester County Fair Campaign Practices Committee for misrepresenting the facts in asserting that Mr. Spano tripled salaries.
But Mr. Spano was also cited by the committee for misleading advertising. In one radio commercial, he says that although $1 million in taxes was collected by the Dunn administration to repair sewer lines in Rye, the sewer lines are still leaking. The committee found that the money to repair the sewer lines came from the sale of property held by the city, not taxes, and that there was no evidence presented to the committee that the sewer lines are leaking.
Much of the campaign advertising on both sides has been negative, and in recent weeks Mr. Dunn has added television commercials to his arsenal.
He has criticized Mr. Spano for his statements about political patronage, including one in 1993 in which he said, "I don't think patronage is a bad thing." Mr. Spano said recently that he was expressing his belief that "people who worked on my campaign or for the Democratic Party shouldn't be eliminated from the competition for jobs."
He added, "I hired people because they were competent."
Mr. Spano's latest commercial says that Mr. Dunn's campaign strategists are also used by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Mr. Dunn has a commercial lambasting Mr. Spano for taking a trip to Walt Disney World with taxpayer money when he was county clerk.
Mr. Spano said that he was invited to Orlando, Fla., by I.B.M. to participate on a panel at its annual conference for municipal officials on re-engineering government because of his successes as county clerk and that I.B.M. reimbursed the county for the trip. If there was reimbursement, Mr. Dunn maintains that Mr. Spano violated the county code of ethics by accepting a gift of more than $75 from a company with millions of dollars in contracts with the county.
With all the charges and countercharges, one prominent elected official predicts that the race will be close. "I'm calling it a draw," he said. "And somebody's going to win by a couple of thousand votes."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Are Hurt By Strong Econonic Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped sharply yesterday after strong housing and manufacturing data again raised investors' worries about growth, inflation and interest rates.
Traders said a Market News report quoting unnamed Federal Reserve officials as saying that they were concerned that the inflation picture could rapidly deteriorate without a tighter monetary policy also brought more selling in the afternoon. 
 The 30-year bond dropped 19/32 , to a price of 99 6/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction rose to 6.44 percent, from 6.39 percent on Thursday. A drop in stocks saw some investors abandon that market for Treasury bills in a flight to quality. The rate of the three-month bill dropped to 4.90 from 4.91 percent.
The Treasury market initially posted losses after the Commerce Department said starts of housing rose 7.9 percent in September, after two months of decline. Traders said losses were extended by a Federal Reserve report that showed industrial production up seven-tenths of 1 percent and capacity at 84.4 percent last month, higher than the 83.9 percent some economists were expecting. In fact, it was above the 84 percent historical level that has been associated with inflation.
The reports showing strong economic growth only heightened the jitters in the market since Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, sounded a warning on inflation before Congress last week. Mr. Greenspan's testimony along with recent reports showing strong growth have raised expectations that Fed policy makers will raise short-term interest rates at their meeting next month.
But not all the data released yesterday pointed to strong growth. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slipped to 105.2 in October from 106 in September, traders said. (The Michigan survey is released only to subscribers.)
There was also talk of an Asian central bank in the market buying $1 billion of 10-year notes, which allowed the market to come back briefly.
And on Thursday, the Government said consumer prices rose a smaller-than expected two-tenths of 1 percent last month, suggesting that inflation remained subdued.
"The C.P.I. continues to delight and amaze bond market participants, as it rose considerably less than feared,"said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "But because of robust consumer spending, G.D.P. growth during the third quarter doesn't appear to have differed much from the 3.3 percent pace of the second quarter, and the perspicuous third-quarter inventory drag implies a rather hefty gain in real final sales.
"The Fed is not going to let down its inflation defenses, particularly with very tight labor markets, high capacity usage, and the pace of economic growth continuing above the Fed's concept of the maximum, noninflationary trend rate."
Market participants found little solace in a speech yesterday by Jack Guynn, president of the Atlanta Federal Reseve Bank, to the Economic Club of Florida. Mr. Guynn, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who expects the economy to post about a 3.5 percent growth rate this year, said he did not see consumer debt as much of a constraint on spending.

HEADLINE: On the Stump, Whitman Touts Record Employment

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
With less than three weeks to go before Election Day, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said yesterday that New Jersey had regained all the jobs that were lost in the last recession, and announced that the state had reached a new high in the number of employed residents, surpassing the record set at the height of the last boom in 1989.
Standing under a suspended net of red, white and blue balloons in the vaulted stone and glass atrium at the Horizon Corporate Center in Mount Laurel, Mrs. Whitman chose a campaign setting that was in many ways emblematic of the economic changes in New Jersey since she took office: a ceremony marking the expansion of yet another white-collar financial services company, the PHH Mortgage Corporation. 
 "There are 3.7 million jobs in the state of New Jersey today -- more people working than ever in our history," Mrs. Whitman said, in announcing the numbers. "This is success."
But economists say that the job numbers, while clearly positive for the state, do not describe the reality that many ordinary residents see in their pocketbooks and in their workplaces. That discrepancy, they say, partly explains why Mrs. Whitman -- even bearing bullish news like yesterday's -- is facing a tight race with her Democratic Party challenger, James E. McGreevey. A new poll for The Star-Ledger of Newark by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University said yesterday that Mrs. Whitman's lead over Mr. McGreevey -- a little-known, small-city Mayor not long ago -- had slipped to just 4 percentage points, within the poll's margin of sampling error.
Whatever the economic realities, Mrs. Whitman chose a part of the state that is probably more appropriate to political realities. Many communities in the state's southern tier -- tied to the Philadelphia economy -- have not done as well as the areas to the north that are tied to New York City, which has become a major economic engine in the last few years. In her comments, Mrs. Whitman said that much had been accomplished and that companies like PHH Mortgage Corporation were leading the charge.
"PHH's expansion in Mount Laurel is an economic boon for South Jersey," Mrs. Whitman said. The balloons fell. The crowd of about 300 people applauded. A disk jockey played hip-hop tunes.
Mr. McGreevey, who did not campaign yesterday, and Mrs. Whitman were preparing for a debate today that is scheduled to be televised from 1 to 2 P.M. on the New Jersey Network and some cable stations. The debate will also include the Libertarian Party candidate, Murray Sabrin, who qualified based on meeting a goal for campaign contributions set under state law.
The economy, and what its numbers mean or do not mean, is expected to be a major topic at the debate, and at the two remaining debates on Tuesday and Friday.
Economists say the economic division of north and south is only one of the new patterns that have emerged in the 1990's that are being played out against the backdrop of the gubernatorial election. There is also a sense of dislocation, as the types of jobs and the mix of industries have shifted, and as indicators continue to show a level of economic stress among many residents. The economy, despite the numbers released yesterday, has not been restored to where it was eight years ago, but rather delivered to a new place.
"The industries that are creating jobs and are important today are very different from the ones in the late 1980's," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, a West Chester, Pa., research company.
Traditional employers that provided jobs for about 40 percent of New Jersey's residents eight years ago -- construction, government and manufacturing -- are far smaller today than they were then, and continue to show signs of chronic contraction. About 2,100 more manufacturing jobs were lost in the state last month, the State Department of Labor said.
The state's average poverty rate for a two-year period ending in 1996 was unchanged from the previous two-year period, the United States Bureau of the Census said, despite the growth in jobs. New Jersey also had the unwelcome distinction last month of being singled out by the census bureau as one of only six states in the nation in which the number of people with health insurance declined over the two-year period.
Democrats also seized yesterday on the fact that the state's unemployment rate actually went up in September, to 5.4 percent, from 5.2 percent in August. The jobless rate increased, the state said, because more people were looking for work than there were new jobs. The national unemployment rate in September was 4.9 percent.
"If anything, New Jersey stands out because its unemployment rate is higher than the national average," Richard McGrath, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey, said. "There's also an underlying anxiety about job security and employment prospects. That severely tempers the good news."
The New Jersey Department of Labor said in its monthly report that 20,100 more people in the state were employed in September than in August. That includes about 10,300 employees of United Parcel Service who returned to work after the settlement of a strike by the teamsters' union. The increase pushed the total nonfarm payroll total to 3,717,800 people. The previous peak was in March 1989, at 3,706,400 jobs, just before the onset of long and deep recession in the region.
But the significance of crossing that threshold also varies widely depending on one's perspective. By local standards, it looks pretty good. New York and Connecticut, by contrast, are not even close to regaining the jobs lost in the recession. New York City, in particular, has regained only about 40 percent of its lost jobs, despite strong and accelerating growth in the last two years.
By national standards, however, the state's performance is not so lustrous. The recession that battered the New York region was far milder across the rest of the country. Other major industrial states like Illinois, Michigan, Florida, Texas and North Carolina all regained their lost jobs several years ago. Neighboring Pennsylvania has more than 200,000 more jobs than it did at its pre-recession peak.
Economists say that the monthly totals conform to a pattern that the state has settled into, particularly in the last two or three years: the growth is steady and moderate, and concentrated in areas like business services, which includes everything from consultants to accountants.
"What the figures are suggesting," said John L. Wieting, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, "is that New Jersey is positioned for sustained and moderate job growth."

HEADLINE: As Crash Date Nears, Few Still Fear Stocks

 BODY:
From Wall Street to Main Street, the stock market crash 10 years ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points, is a distant memory for many.
Once seen as an arcane world reserved for the shrewd and the wealthy, playing the stock market has become almost everybody's game. It has replaced sports as lunch counter conversation even in the middle of Iowa, in Marshalltown, a town of 26,000 people -- and 12 stockbrokers. 
 Still, there have been some hiccups. Yesterday -- the last trading day before the 10th anniversary of Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987 -- the Dow briefly tumbled nearly 180 points, or 2.4 percent. Indeed, some traders said that the psychological stigma of the 1987 crash was a subtle influence hanging over the market yesterday.
But stocks recovered, and the Dow industrials closed down 91.85 points, hurt largely in the end by concerns over corporate earnings and renewed inflation.
Despite the recent jitters, Wall Street denizens continue to count on America's love affair with stocks to keep the money rolling in.

HEADLINE: Little Panel That Could, Did, Posing Threat of Trade War

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
During the budget battle two years ago, Republicans in Congress proposed abolishing the Federal Maritime Commission, arguing that the regulatory agency had outlived its purpose. For most of the day today, the Administration sounded as if it wished it had gone along with the idea.
The commission's decision on Thursday to wield its considerable though little-known authority to bar Japanese cargo ships from American ports sent the Administration scrambling to avert a nasty confrontation with Japan that could easily have broadened into a trade war. 
 As a clutch of officials gathered at the White House to decide how to respond, trade negotiators worked through the day at the Department of Transportation to resolve a long-simmering dispute, which involves better access for American ships to Japanese ports and an earlier $4 million retaliatory fine levied on Japanese companies.
By the end of the day, though, the commission's bold action appeared to have forced the two parties to draft an agreement on the shipping dispute.
But during the crisis talks of the last 24 hours, the United States found itself in the unusual position of joining Japan in calling for an agency of its own Government to reverse itself.
Thus, the small maritime agency was persuaded late today to postpone any action until Monday, averting for now the improbable spectacle of Coast Guard cutters hunting down Japanese freighters in American ports. Page A6.
The drastic step taken by the commission's board, which has only four members rather than five at the moment, caught the White House and other agencies unprepared. All the more so since it occurred while the President, the Secretary of State and the national security adviser were all out of the country.
"We did not have advance notice," one official said curtly today.
The chairman of the commission, Harold J. Creel Jr., brushed aside those complaints today.
He said the agency's decision to resort to sanctions reflected a growing frustration with the inability of diplomats to resolve a dispute that was hurting American ships. Without the commission's willingness to show a little independence, he said, the dispute would still not be resolved.
"It's fair to say we were disappointed that diplomatic measures hadn't worked," said Mr. Creel, 40, a lawyer from South Carolina who previously worked for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and as a senior counsel to the Senate's Subcommittee on the Merchant Marine.
"But for imposing these sanctions, we would not have had the Japanese at the table today. That's the whole point of having sanctions."
The decision and the scramble it caused have shone a spotlight on an agency that in Washington's sprawling bureaucracy is so obscure that few outside of the shipping industry have even heard of it, or of its chairman, Mr. Creel.
Its surprising move has also underscored the extent to which even the most arcane of trade practices -- and the agencies that oversee them -- can have profound effects on foreign affairs.
"Maybe this is their 15 minutes," said one Administration official, who like many others, sounded more than a little put out by the commission's decision.
The Federal Maritime Commission was established on Aug. 12, 1961, to oversee the web of statutes and laws regulating the nation's ports and shipping industries -- from the Shipping Acts of 1916 to the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. It was that latter act that the commission invoked to justify what would have amounted to a blockade of Japanese ships.
In short, it regulates seaborne commerce to and from the United States, which totals more than $500 billion a year. While regulatory agencies are rarely popular among the industries they cover, the commission's mandate to insure that American ships are not burdened with unfair fees in foreign ports has won it strong company support.
And that, more than anything, may be what has saved it from extinction.
In the age of deregulation, many critics on Capitol Hill and beyond have argued that the commission has become largely irrelevant. In 1992, during the Bush Administration, one of the commission's own members proposed abolishing the agency, as did a panel appointed early in the Clinton Administration and the Republicans who swept to power in the House after the 1994 elections.
Each time, the commission survived the chopping block after lobbyists for the nation's shipping concerns -- and supportive lawmakers from states that depend heavily on their ports -- took up its cause.
In the vast Federal bureaucracy, the agency is certainly tiny -- with 140 employees and a budget of $14 million. The commission's members, including the chairman, are appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate. The appointees, who are by statute supposed to be bipartisan, serve five-year terms. Mr. Creel was appointed to the chairman's job in February 1996. He is a Democrat.
The association's independence is theoretically supposed to free the commission from political pressures from, say, the Departments of Transportation, State or Commerce, in disputes exactly like the one with Japan, which the United States accuses of setting exorbitantly high port fees and imposing dense regulations.
In this case, it certainly exhibited an independence -- much to the chagrin of the Administration.
A senior Administration official said the White House -- not to mention President Clinton's entourage traveling through Argentina -- learned of the decision to bar Japanese ships only after reports appeared on the news wires. But Mr. Creel insisted that lower-level officials at State and Transportation were kept abreast of the matter.
As news of the decision spread, one official at the State Department expressed disbelief that any agency in Government could have acted so decisively without a thorough review of the effects on foreign policy, especially since it is supposed to police unfair practices overseas in conjunction with the State Department.
While it operates in obscurity, the commission has threatened sanctions in the past. In 1983, it came very close to barring Venezuelan ships in retaliation for what it said were unfair practices -- only to drop the threat when diplomats hammered out a settlement in a scenario similar to this week's.
"That's certainly what we want out of all of this," Mr. Creel said, "a diplomatic resolution."

HEADLINE: U.S. SAYS CHINESE WILL STOP SENDING MISSILES TO IRAN

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
China has promised the Clinton Administration that it will no longer send anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran, senior American officials said today, 10 days before a state visit by China's President, Jiang Zemin.
China has also agreed in principle to halt its nuclear assistance to Iran, a senior official said, and key Administration officials flew to China today to complete an accord. If China signs such an agreement, President Clinton could then lift an American ban on sales to China of nuclear technology for civilian power. 
 Dealing with China has been one of Mr. Clinton's most awkward problems. While he wants to bring China into the web of international relationships and take advantage of its economic potential, his policy of engagement has been criticized by Republicans as appeasement of a threat to America's interests. Under the conflicting pressures, he has reversed course many times.
Mr. Jiang's visit comes as criticism of China has focused on its repression of dissent, its punishment of human-rights advocates, its restrictions on religious practice and its history of selling dangerous technology to Iran and Pakistan.
The Administration is using the visit to press Beijing to improve its behavior and will want to highlight its successes, while critics suggest that Chinese promises may prove to be hollow.
"The whole logic of this is backward," said Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment, who is a critic of Mr. Clinton's China policy. "The Chinese want a nuclear cooperation agreement. And the Administration, which otherwise has nothing to show for this summit, wants to give Beijing what is in effect a present which shows the success of engagement, which the Chinese have not yet earned."
The new pledge to stop selling Iran the conventional cruise missiles, known as C-801's and C-802's, was made directly to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright by the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. Congress and the Pentagon have criticized the missile sales as a danger to vessels in the Persian Gulf.
The pledge may take some criticism off Mr. Clinton. The issue has been used by Republicans in Congress to accuse the Administration of weakness in defending American interests, and an American law would require imposing sanctions on China if Beijing exported enough of missiles to "destabilize" the gulf.
China is not required by any international agreements to halt the missile sales to Iran, but Administration officials told the Chinese that relations with the United States were much more important to China's future than a low-level military supply relationship with Teheran.
The pledge, one officials said, is also an indication of a more fundamental Chinese decision "to no longer be seen as a rogue state on proliferation." That would mark a sharp change from a decade ago, when China saw no problems with the spread of nuclear weapons to the developing world.
Officials acknowledged that China had not always fulfilled past pledges to limit its export of arms, technology and materiel to both Pakistan and Iran. Washington still has concerns about China's exports of dual-use chemicals and missile technology. Under the Reagan Administration, China broke written commitments to restrict missile exports to Pakistan, and was penalized.
But they say that China has come a long way on restricting its export of nuclear materials and expertise, and that a deal can be struck that would let Mr. Clinton carry out, for the first time, a 1985 agreement allowing American companies to sell nuclear power reactors to China.
Such an agreement, if it is reached, is expected to be the centerpiece of Mr. Jiang's visit, the first state visit by a Chinese leader to the United States in 12 years. Mr. Jiang is to go to Washington, Philadelphia, Cambridge, Mass., Los Angeles and four other cities. At each stop he is expected to be met by hundreds of demonstrators protesting Chinese policies, especially on human rights.
While the repression of dissent and religious practice in China are the most prominent issues for Mr. Jiang's critics, Chinese nuclear and missile exports to Iran and Pakistan have dominated the recent Congressional debates about China.
Last week, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican who is chairman of the House International Relations Committee, urged the Administration to get strict assurances from China that it is no longer selling weapons of any kind to Iran before authorizing the sale of American nuclear reactors to Beijing, even for civilian power production.
"Our members need to know that China is engaging in responsible nonproliferation behavior across the board, including all weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons," Mr. Gilman said.
Administration officials say they are concentrating hardest on the nuclear issue before the summit meeting, hoping to allow Mr. Clinton to certify that China is no longer helping any other nation develop nuclear weapons. That would let the 1985 Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation agreement come into force and allow American companies like Westinghouse, General Electric and ABB Combustion Engineering Nuclear Systems to sell nuclear power reactors to China.
For the American companies, the potential deals could be worth $15 billion through 2010, according to industry advocates. And China's interest in their reactors comes at a time when nuclear power is no longer very popular in much of the rest of the global market.
American officials say four issues are involved in whether Mr. Clinton can satisfy himself that certification is justified.
One is nuclear exports. The Chinese have issued national regulations that are supposed to cover such exports by the military as well as those of semi-privatized companies.
On the second issue, officials say the Chinese have also kept to their pledge of May 11, 1996, not to provide help to any "unsafeguarded nuclear facility," meaning one not open to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. That covers Pakistan, but Iran does allow such inspections, which had left aid to Iran a question.
On the third issue, Iran, the Americans have wanted China to phase out its nuclear cooperation and put that pledge into writing.
Last, the Chinese, just on Thursday, joined the so-called Zanger Committee, which groups equipment suppliers who have signed the treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear seapons and prepares lists of equipment that should not be exported without safeguards.
The Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation, Robert J. Einhorn, and his National Security Council counterpart, Gary Samore, flew to Beijing today to try to nail down the written pledge with Iran.
They also hope that Beijing will agree to even stricter export controls than the Zanger Committee requires, closer to the controls of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which requires all importers of nuclear equipment to allow full inspections of all nuclear activity by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

HEADLINE: Deal Is Close On Keeping L.I.R.R. Going

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
With the deadline for an Amtrak strike that could also cripple local commuter railroads just five days away, union leaders and Amtrak reached a tentative agreement yesterday to keep the Long Island Rail Road running into Manhattan even if a strike occurs.
The union involved in the labor dispute, which represents track inspectors, agreed to let several dozen workers from other unions cross its picket lines to maintain four miles of Amtrak-owned tracks that connect the L.I.R.R. system with Pennsylvania Station, the destination of most of the L.I.R.R.'s 260,000 daily passengers. 
 "We have an agreement in principle," said Amtrak's chief spokesman, Clifford R. Black 4th, "provided various things are fulfilled." Among them, he said, were a consensus on the number of workers needed to keep the trains running safely and the agreement of the other unions.
But attempts yesterday to work out a similar arrangement for New Jersey Transit, which uses much more Amtrak-owned track, were "disappointing," said New Jersey's Transportation Commissioner, John Haley Jr. He said that meetings would continue Monday, but that yesterday's failure brought the state one step closer to a "transportation emergency."
There were no meetings yesterday concerning the underlying dispute over wages between Amtrak and the the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, which represents 2,300 track inspectors. The two sides are not scheduled to meet again until Monday. But a spokeswoman for the National Mediation Board, the Federal agency that makes recommendations in rail disputes and seeks to aid bargaining, said the two sides were communicating.
A strike by the track inspectors would force the 35,000 people a day who ride Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line between Boston and Washington to find other ways to travel. Nationally, Amtrak has 60,000 daily passengers.
Amtrak also operates commuter lines carrying 175,000 people a day, and other railroads operating on Amtrak tracks carry an additional 357,000 passengers.
Among those 357,000 passengers are 65,000 on New Jersey Transit routes that use Amtrak's tracks to reach Pennsylvania Station from points as far south as Trenton; if an agreement is not reached to let those trains continue operating during a strike, those commuters would be forced into cars or buses, clogging highways. A strike would also cut off freight service to dozens of businesses and would damage New Jersey's economy, officials there said.
The New Jersey Transit lines that would be shut down are the entire Northeast Corridor line, which runs from Trenton to New York, the North Jersey Coast Line between Matawan and New York, and the Raritan Valley line between Westfield and Newark.
New Jersey officials have made contingency plans to roll out 500 extra buses to shuttle commuters on those lines from train stations to Newark, where they would take the PATH line to New York. The state also plans to add toll-takers and state police patrols and open up high-occupancy vehicle lanes to lessen traffic congestion.
Under the Long Island Rail Road agreement, reached after a two-hour meeting in Pennsylvania Station brokered by United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the track inspectors union is asking Amtrak signalmen, supervisors and dispatchers to cross the picket lines. "We don't normally do that," said Kevin Hussey, the union's New Jersey legislative director, "but we don't see any reason in the world why the commuters should be affected by an argument between the maintenance workers, who I represent, and Amtrak. Our quarrel is not with the Long Island Rail Road or the commuters who ride the Long Island Rail Road. Our quarrel is with Amtrak."
Mr. Hussey said he was confident the other unions would go along with the arrangement. "They're reluctant to cross the picket line," he said, "but it's our picket line, and if we say it's O.K., their guys are going to want to make money."
But an agreement to keep New Jersey Transit running was stymied because New Jersey Transit runs on 56 miles of Amtrak track across the state, while the Long Island Rail Road track uses Amtrak only from Pennsylvania Station through four tunnels under the East River to Queens.
Mr. Haley said Amtrak and the union could not get close to an agreement on how many workers -- who would have to be allowed across picket lines -- it would need to keep the New Jersey Transit system running, or on whether qualified workers could be found outside the track inspectors union.
After yesterday's Long Island Rail Road meeting, union, Amtrak and L.I.R.R. officials all said they were confident that replacement workers could run the system safely. Track inspectors maintain and inspect track, the third rails and overhead wires that power trains. Their inspections must be done as often as every other day.
If the Long Island Rail Road agreement cannot be finalized, a national Amtrak strike on Wednesday would throw the L.I.R.R., the nation's largest commuter railroad, into chaos. Its passengers would be forced to get off the train in Queens or Brooklyn and transfer to subways, adding an hour or more to their commutes.
Even if only New Jersey Transit and Amtrak are affected in the event of a strike, New York City officials are bracing for a big increase in car traffic and are considering suspending alternate-side parking rules.
Thomas Prendergast, the president of the L.I.R.R., said yesterday's meeting came after more than a week in which Amtrak had ignored a request by the L.I.R.R. to try to keep its trains running. The union said it asked Mr. D'Amato to intercede, and all sides credited Mr. D'Amato with making the agreement possible.
Maintenance of Way union officials have said they want to avoid shutting down the commuter lines because that could prompt Congress to step in and end a strike on terms that probably would not favor the union. Mr. D'Amato said that for exactly the same reason, some Amtrak officials would like to see any strike be as painful as possible.

HEADLINE: Touchy-Feely Schools

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Hurray for Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew! In his move to limit the independence of alternative schools (news article, Oct. 13), he has brought their questionable value to public attention. At some alternative high schools, teachers and students design projects that integrate subjects across disciplines and connect learning and life experiences. In a discussion of the role of power in their lives or in examining how families contribute to what we are, mathematics, grammar, history and science may be introduced. Graduation comes when the faculty approves the portfolios presented by students. 
 As someone who taught history at City University of New York colleges for 38 years, I feel able to say that waiting for academic topics to crop up in "touchy-feely" discussions is doing a grave injustice to our young people, most of whom need structure, content and skills training in order to enter our city's economic life.

States Move to Regulate Uses of Genetic Testing
Concerned that the Federal Government is acting too slowly to protect the confidentiality of genetic information, states are passing their own laws to regulate the use of genetic test results and to prevent discrimination by insurers and employers. Insurers contend that the laws will force them to raise premiums, while drug companies say the restrictions will make it harder to conduct research. At least 26 states have adopted such laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Typically, the measures prohibit insurance companies and health plans from requiring genetic tests or using the results to deny coverage or increase premiums. A1

Jackie Robinson
 A Biography.
 By Arnold Rampersad.
 Illustrated. 512 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50. 
 HOW firmly he is fixed in the cultural firmament: even his name has become a cliche. Just as "Jackie Robinson" is now a synonym for trailblazer, so has Jack Roosevelt Robinson been simplified and reduced into folklore. The mythic Robinson exists as a succession of rousing, if fuzzy, impressions: of solitude, strife and flashing spikes, of base-running bravado and beanballs, of pennants and provocations and perseverance -- "the unconquerable doing the impossible," to borrow Red Smith's grandiloquence. With its suggestions of hero and martyr, the legend has reverberated in the national imagination "as the epitome not only of stoic endurance," Arnold Rampersad writes in his biography, "but also of intelligence, bravery, physical power and grit." Robinson's has been a decisive significance in what Rampersad calls the "complex drama involving the sometimes harmonious, sometimes conflicting needs and desires of black and white America." Robinson never shed his identification as the representative of his race, nor did he ever want to; with an earnest zeal he personified the ritualized angst of racial assimilation.
"The Jackie Robinson story is to Americans what the Passover story is to Jews: it must be told to every generation so that we never forget," Jules Tygiel comments in an afterword to Oxford University Press's paperback edition of "Baseball's Great Experiment" (originally published in 1983), his authoritative social history of baseball's integration. Robinson's 10-year career with the Brooklyn Dodgers (the players' names evoking the melting pot: Erskine, Furillo, Snider, Abrams, Hermanski, Shuba) has become a fable of integration. For white Americans, many of whom experienced improved race relations over the last 50 years as a series of encounters with the exemplary exception, Robinson is forever the first and the best -- just as his name was automatic in the litany of "firsts," and "onlys," whose memorization constituted (until recently) the pedagogy of black history. So familiar, in fact, is the Robinson legend that during the golden anniversary of his epochal rookie season this year, it exuded an unmistakable mustiness; too many of the public tributes sounded more dutiful than heartfelt.
Somewhat surprisingly, until now there has been no rigorous account of Robinson's life. Rampersad, who collaborated on Arthur Ashe's memoir after writing the definitive biography of Langston Hughes, has assembled a jumble of journalistic, archival and oral data into an elegantly rendered, meticulously documented narrative, a level-headed and sensitive chronicle of Robinson's life from his birth in a sharecropper's cabin, the grandson of a slave, in 1919 to his death 53 years later.
Telling a story that is well known if not always known well, Rampersad, with crisp economy, recounts the ageless anecdotes -- the first interview with Branch Rickey ("I know you're a good ballplayer. What I don't know is whether you have the guts"), or Leo Durocher's tart-tongued suppression of the players' revolt during spring training in 1947 ("I don't care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes. . . . I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays"). In cleaning off the chestnuts, he also clarifies the legend. For example: about Pee Wee Reese, the Kentucky-born captain of the Dodgers, Rampersad writes that the "most telling single act" in his "important role" was when Reese "dared to put his white hand on Robinson's black shoulder in a gesture of solidarity"; he immediately adds, "Exactly when and where this moment came is uncertain." He astutely assesses the beanball savagery Robinson is celebrated for enduring: Robinson was hit by pitches six times in his first 37 games, the same number as the National League leader for the entire 1946 season. "While Robinson's color was almost certainly a factor in these blows," Rampersad writes, "it only compounded the tendency of pitchers to throw at rookies. Robinson was hit by pitches but three more times over the rest of the season. He had passed a key test of courage, one that broke many a young ballplayer."
Branch Rickey, the Dodgers' general manager, emerges as a moral entrepreneur of vision and stature. In the flamboyant, Bible-quoting oratory that inspired sportswriters to call his office "the Cave of Winds," Rickey issued multiple and conflicting explanations for his recruitment of black players, always denying, with proper Methodist humility, that he was interested in racial justice. Today it is clear that Rickey, determined to integrate baseball, enjoyed blowing smoke to camouflage his careful preparations and his intricate maneuvering; in his relish at scheming to achieve noble results through trickery, Branch Rickey is baseball's equivalent of Oskar Schindler. "Rickey's thinking clearly went beyond pragmatism," Rampersad writes; he seized the "chance to intervene in the moral history of the nation."
"Triumph of Whole Race Seen in Jackie's Debut in Major League Ball," a Boston newspaper declared. That such weight and intensity of racial identification was put on a professional athlete can seem baffling now; and it makes Robinson's rookie-of-the-year performance appear all the more majestic: in a sport that incorporates failure (as the bromide has it, even the best hitters make an out seven times out of 10), Robinson was compelled to succeed. "Over a period of six months . . . he had revolutionized the image of black Americans in the eyes of many whites," Rampersad writes. "Neither blacks nor whites would be quite the same."
It was a time when white indifference to racial inequity was a compound of complacent distaste, ineffectual benevolence and mildly guilty inertia -- comparable to the average city dweller's attitude today toward the homeless -- a time when the sole recognition most blacks expected from white society was some form of humiliation. So automatic and unspoken were caste taboos that the immortal Dodger broadcaster Red Barber -- a gentleman but one Mississippi-born -- made an immediate (and, of course, temporary) decision to quit when Rickey told him (in 1945) that the team would someday add a black player. It is impossible to underestimate how fundamental a need Robinson fulfilled for millions of people with his public assertion of dignity.
(In my early childhood, my grandmother often recounted attending one of Robinson's first games in Wrigley Field, when the overflow of black fans forced the ball park's ushers to keep expanding the black section of the stands. "Ah, hell, let 'em sit where they want!" one said finally; my grandmother always chuckled after mimicking his tone of exasperation, still savoring a rare and delightful little victory over the white folks.)
Back then, there were baseball-playing dads rather than soccer moms; Robinson's triumph within the national pastime proved particularly satisfying as spectacle. The visual startle of his presence forced spectators to confront the stark reality of segregation; the very fact of his presence provided instant rectification. Baseball is an enterprise energetic in the production of objects for obsessive, short-term adoration; the sport has long served to certify ethnic groups as worthy of general applause. Robinson allowed black people to join the Irish, Italians, Jews, Germans and good ol' boys.
Rampersad's effort to reveal the man inside the cliche benefited incalculably from the cooperation, without restriction or authorization, of Rachel Robinson. She has achieved iconic power of her own: in an age that has seen, alas, too many variations of the Noble Widow, no one has better kept the flame -- just as, when he was alive, "her reserved charm, easy intelligence and striking looks" amplified her husband's glow of cultivated vitality. (Her image was frequently included with Jackie's in what Rampersad notes were probably the first mass-market commercials to use blacks as spokesmen.) Her recollections of traveling in 1946 as a newlywed across the South to Robinson's first training camp become, in Rampersad's telling, a chronicle of the soul-searing effects of Jim Crow. Rachel, 23 years old, college-educated, confidently middle-class -- her "finishing-school poise," a New York reporter would sigh the next year, was not of "the Brooklyn baseball fan variety" -- set off from Los Angeles in regal attire and with a regal disdain. During a stopover in New Orleans, she ostentatiously ignored "Whites Only" signs on drinking fountains and restrooms ("The women stared at me, but nobody said or did anything. I sort of liked the women staring at me. I felt very strong"). Jackie and Rachel were bumped from one, then two flights, their seats taken by white passengers; they were directed to "dirty, dreadful" lodgings. Deciding to continue by bus, the weary couple were ordered out of their comfortable reclining seats to the rear, where they joined other blacks in sharing the few fixed-back seats. "What the laborers made of the strange couple -- the man asleep in his rumpled suit and tie, the lady with her massed curls and her ermine coat and alligator bag -- Rachel could only imagine." Thirty-six hours after leaving the West Coast, Jackie and Rachel arrived in Daytona Beach, Fla. "I finally began to realize that where we were going with Mr. Rickey's plan, none of us had ever been before," Rachel remembers. "We were setting out on something we really didn't understand."
Rampersad attributes Robinson's uncommonly resolute sense of mission -- "A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives," he once declared -- to his mother, Mallie. Abandoned by her husband, she carried the 17-month-old Jackie, his sister and three brothers from a Georgia plantation to Pasadena, Calif.; with her wages as a maid ($8 a week at her arrival in 1920), she quickly bought a house in an all-white neighborhood. Mallie's "unshakable attachment to religion, the entirely willful way she delivered herself and her fortunes to God without becoming fatalistic or withdrawing from the world," nurtured in Jackie the rare and attractive quality of piety untainted by piousness: "A modest man," Rampersad writes, "he believed nevertheless that God was behind his life, guiding it, and intending him for some important purpose." Combining his relentless competitiveness (an eye-opening leitmotif of Rampersad's book is Robinson's fierce need to dominate) and his generation's commitment to racial uplift, "Robinson had taken it upon himself to carry forward his people's struggle against injustice."
The apogee of his political influence coincided with the second Eisenhower Administration. Fervently anti-Communist, resolutely capitalist and earnestly conservative, Robinson was the very portrait of the socially active business executive. "A year after quitting baseball," Rampersad writes, "Robinson had become a forceful, respected part of the civil rights debate" -- a nonstop fund-raiser and speaker for the N.A.A.C.P., a columnist for The New York Post, the host of a weekly radio interview program, a guest on "Meet the Press," a man who could confidently proclaim, "Knowing President Eisenhower as I do. . . ." He exercised his celebrity and prestige so relentlessly that Jet magazine asked on its cover, "Does Jackie Robinson Talk Too Much?"
Robinson marks a transformation in the black political posture from supplicant to scold. Rickey's demand that he turn the other cheek is famous ("If you want to take this gamble," Robinson said at that dramatic first meeting on Aug. 28, 1945, at 215 Montague Street in Brooklyn, "I will promise you there will be no incident"). Recalled less often is how brief was Robinson's forbearance: he opened his third season, 1949, warning opponents, "I'm going to be rough on them." Thereafter, as Tygiel has written, "no season went by without at least one major dispute surrounding Robinson." He assailed umpires, reporters, opponents, teammates, even his manager, Walter Alston. Having been dealt the trump of race cards, Robinson played it repeatedly. "If the public will analyze it," he declared in 1953, "they will see that those who have become opposed to me resent my success deep down inside only because I am a Negro." The shadow side of the Robinson myth is a cautionary tale of the limits of moral example and the dangers of moral vanity.
With the New Frontier, Robinson's political activity "trails off into disappointments and conditional sentences," as Roger Kahn wrote in "The Boys of Summer." Calling himself a one-man "pressure group for civil rights," Robinson traded heavily on his authority as the apotheosis of the American Negro. During the most tumultuous and factionalized years of the civil rights movement, he issued public, and personal, chastisements in his column in The Amsterdam News, across the board: Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Roger Wilkins and Adam Clayton Powell Jr.
He made a quixotic alliance with the Republican Party just as it began its lurch into reaction. Robinson ran aground of history by very publicly opposing John F. Kennedy in 1960. He remained a professed Republican but destroyed his standing in the G.O.P. by endorsing liberal Democrats in the 1964 and 1968 Presidential elections: "Robinson was a loose cannon, a force the party could not count on, and perhaps even a showboat," Rampersad writes. "I do not put personal feelings above the feeling I have for the masses of our people," Robinson stated with the gassy self-importance characteristic of his twilight years. Although his strident independence "would make him often appear noble in his loyalty to principle," Rampersad writes, "it would also make him seem to some people self-righteous and even undependable." By the time of his death in 1972, Robinson was the bitter, disillusioned man evident in the title of his memoir, "I Never Had It Made."
"Robinson was always a symbol, both an individual human being and also a figment of America's guilty, shame-filled imagination," Rampersad writes. His life emphasized how agonizing social transformation would prove to be, how clumsy governments and other established institutions were as agents to rectify abuses of human dignity, that race relations were less a "problem" to be solved than a situation to be lived with. Robinson eventually fell victim to the self-indulgent despair suffered by those who expect ideals to substitute for history -- more forgivable in any pioneer than in posterity, or in the glut of cheap sentiment that presumed to celebrate him this year. To ignore how profoundly the country has changed in half a century is to make nonsense of what Robinson did.
Although Rampersad implies otherwise, Robinson's public significance ended with his baseball career, when he struck out to end the 1956 World Series; and it is within baseball that Robinson's significance will be preserved. ("It's the box score that really counts," Robinson said the first time he met Branch Rickey, "that and that alone, isn't it?" "It's all that ought to count," Rickey replied.) Although it is ritual to bemoan the seasons lost because Robinson was 28 when he broke into the majors, the silver lining is that he was a seasoned athlete in his prime. From 1949 to 1954, Robinson averaged 100 runs scored a year with a combined batting average of .327; among active players, his six straight seasons batting over .300 were equaled by only Ted Williams and Stan Musial. Moreover, on a team of Hall of Famers, Robinson was the drink-stirrer: in his 10 years, the Dodgers went to six World Series (with two spectacular near misses), winning one. Yogi Berra said it best: "He could beat you in a lot of ways."
Robinson's plaque in the Hall of Fame has no mention of race, just as his rookie-of-the-year citation ignored, in the sniffy words of The Sporting News, "the sociological experiment that Robinson represented." (Another split between then and now: today, race alone would be qualification enough.) Absurd as it seems, there is something admirable about this narrow focus: forget everything else, baseball insists; Robby was a hell of a ballplayer. Perhaps baseball kept better faith than Jackie Robinson.

THE ARCHITECT OF DESIRE: Beauty and Danger
 in the Stanford White Family
 By Suzannah Lessard. Delta, $13.95.
The great-granddaughter of one of America's most celebrated architects describes a family life and legacy that were as dark and twisted as White's buildings were elegant and serene. White was not only a hedonist but a sexual predator, she writes; her own father was too, and more, having molested her during her childhood. "Few writers have ever captured the exquisite, delicate balance of architecture and memory as eloquently," Paul Goldberger said here last year.
 
OTHERWISE: New and Selected Poems
 By Jane Kenyon. Graywolf, $16.
The author's life included no small share of suffering: she frequently endured depression and died of leukemia in 1995, when she was only 47. But many of these poems sound an unmistakable note of hope and are a fervent but unsentimental celebration of ordinary things, from centipedes and chickadees to worn nightclothes and baled hay. Earlier this year our reviewer, Carol Muske, wrote, "Her words, with their quiet, rapt force, their pensiveness and wit, come to us from natural speech, from the Bible and hymns, from which she derived the singular psalmlike music that is hers alone."
 
GREAT BOOKS: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau,
 Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World
 By David Denby. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $15.
What happens when a middle-aged film critic goes back to his alma mater, Columbia University, and reimmerses himself in the Western canon? He falls in love again -- or, in some cases, for the first time. "The reader is left with a sense of optimism regarding the future of the humanities," Joyce Carol Oates said in these pages in 1996. Literature is also celebrated in A HISTORY OF READING, by Alberto Manguel (Penguin, $14.95), in which the author discusses not only the content of books but also their production, collection, shape and style. One feels "envious of his passion and grateful," Michael Milburn wrote here last year.
 
 GOOD EVENING MR. & MRS. AMERICA,
 AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA
 By Richard Bausch. Harper Perennial, $13.
This novel traces the sentimental and political education of Walter Marshall, a young idealist in the early 1960's. Hoping to become President, he learns that the road to the White House is rarely paved with good intentions. Its scenes are "funny and colorful," Gary Krist said in the Book Review in 1996.
 
 BRONX PRIMITIVE: Portraits in a Childhood
 By Kate Simon. Penguin, $10.95.
Selected as one of the best books of the year in 1982 by the editors of the Book Review, and now back in print, this memoir recalls immigrant Jewish life in New York in the years following World War I. Our reviewer, Helen Yglesias, called it "a splendid beginning of the wonderful tale of Kaila into Kate Simon." A journey is also at the heart of HALF A LIFE, by Jill Ciment (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95). The author's family moved from Montreal to Los Angeles in 1964, an event that marked the start of her father's mental deterioration and of her rebellion. This memoir is "sad, funny and affecting," Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times last year.
 
 PARADISE POSTPONED
 By John Mortimer. Penguin, $11.95.
The author is known for his Rumpole courtroom mysteries, but this novel, just restored to print, concerns crimes of the heart: why would a left-leaning vicar leave his fortune to an unscrupulous Tory Member of Parliament? "Mortimer's wry authorial tone steers delicately between sentiment and satire," Wendy Lesser said in these pages in 1986.
 
 FOREVER, ERMA: Best-Loved Writing
 From America's Favorite Humorist
 By Erma Bombeck. Andrews McMeel, $10.95.
She wrote about the domestic moments that have been the stuff of women's lives for centuries, but it's no surprise that she also campaigned for the equal rights amendment. This collection of almost 200 of Bombeck's columns "is a modest measure of our loss," Eden Ross Lipson wrote in the Book Review last year.
 
 A WORLD LOST
 By Wendell Berry. Counterpoint, $12.50.
The narrator of this novel, Andy Catlett, looks back on the summer of 1944, when his rakish Uncle Andrew was killed -- not in the war, but in a dispute with another man. "Berry's economical prose works to great advantage," Tobin Harshaw said here in 1996. The same publisher has also reissued Berry's ENTRIES ($12.50), a collection of poems whose subjects range from his Kentucky home to his long marriage to his dying father. "One appreciates that Berry's writing about aging is not designed to comfort but only to tell the truth," one critic wrote in 1994.
 
 THE WINE OF ASTONISHMENT
 By Rachel Mackenzie.
 Books & Company/Turtle Point, $13.95.
Just restored to print, this novel concerns two sisters, ages 29 and 32 years old, whose sheltered lives end when their widowed mother dies. Both fall in love, with potentially ominous consequences. Set in upstate New York in the 1920's and 30's, this is "a big little book," Martin Levin said here in 1974. Laurel Graeber

HEADLINE: FILM;
For the Tapes of a Master, It's Worth the Wait

BYLINE: By PETER M. NICHOLS 

 BODY:
THEY MAY HAVE HAD THEIR differences, but now that the tapes are available, everybody involved with the project agrees that home video has stepped forward to do one of the jobs it is intended to do: acquaint people with a great filmmaker who is relatively unknown in this country.
"Once the video end got going, they did a fantastic job," says Ismail Merchant, who with James Ivory make up the Merchant Ivory filmmaking team. He is also an unstinting champion of the films of the acclaimed Indian director Satyajit Ray. In 1995, three years after Ray's death, Mr. Merchant and Sony Classics arranged the theatrical screening of nine Ray films across the United States. And last August, Columbia Tri-Star, Sony's video arm, released six of the films on tape. 
 "On each one they did very good posters and boxes," Mr. Merchant says with the circumspection of a man who, despite frustrations over a two-year wait for the cassettes, is not about to denigrate a good video promotion once it has begun.
When it comes to foreign films, Columbia Tri-Star's president, Ben Feingold, is more inclined to talk about works like "Das Boot," Wolfgang Petersen's reissued 1981 submarine adventure, which was a best seller for his company this year. As for Ray's films, which are typically closely observed studies of ordinary lives in black and white, they aren't big sellers immediately, but they will have staying power with collectors over the years. "A labor of love," he says of the Ray project.
For videophiles, the point is that Ray's deceptively simple, highly detailed human dramas are now accessible not just at occasional theatrical screenings but at any time. "Ray has always been the figment of critics and festivals," says Milos Stehlik, director of Facets International, a Chicago distributor that specializes in foreign films. "Whereas once you had works you could never see, now you have a whole world open up to you."
Nevertheless, the path to video has been arduous. Mr. Merchant grew up in India but encountered Ray's work only as a student in New York in 1958. Decades later he decided to restore the films, which by then had deteriorated to the point that it was questionable if some of them would even survive.
Hollywood didn't share his enthusiasm. "Studios were keen to distribute the films, but they didn't want to put up any money," Mr. Merchant says. "We went with a beggar's bowl to every Hollywood person we could think of. You couldn't get one of those guys to write a check for $1,000." Eventually the restoration, which cost more than $1 million, was paid for by the Merchant Ivory Foundation.
By then, he and Mr. Ivory had made "Howards End" for Sony Classics, and he was able to parlay that connection into support for the theatrical screenings of the Ray films. Home video, he says, wasn't as forthcoming. At first Columbia Tri-Star issued only the best-known Ray films -- "Pather Panchali," "Aparajito" and "The World of Apu" -- which are known as the Apu Trilogy. The other six films, including "The Middleman," "Charulata (The Lonely Wife)" and "The Big City," went unreleased.
"I sent them a letter of ultimatum," Mr. Merchant said. "I told them, 'If you don't bring them out, I'll get them manufactured and bring them out myself.' "
THE COLUMBIA TRI-STAR videos are finely produced and packaged. Mr. Feingold doesn't shy from the notion that economics apply to Ray films the same as they do to other properties. "We look at these films as works of art. They have their place in certain stores." A "Das Boot," he adds, sells at Wal-Mart.
At the other end of the spectrum, champions of foreign film contend that works by Ray and other major directors help spread appreciation of world cinema, particularly films from regions like Southeast Asia, where there are many large movie industries. "If the Ray films succeeded, it would be great if it opened the way for other Indian filmmakers," Mr. Stehlik says.
But Ray's universal style moves him far from his country's conventional cinema. "Indian films are very distinctive to South Asia," says the director Shyam Benegal, one of India's leading filmmakers. Made in all 16 official Indian languages, the 800 to 900 movies produced a year are often family-oriented melodramas that stress music and dancing. Most of them come without subtitles and, since they can be remakes of remakes, sometimes have the same titles.
"They are very popular in black and Arab Africa, the Middle East, central Asia, places like that," Mr. Benegal says. "They don't work well in Europe and the United States."
Distributors of foreign films on video agree that even the biggest names -- Fellini, say, or Truffaut -- occupy a niche that may not grow noticeably but is slowly expanding. "It's important to get exposure for the filmmaker," says Jose Lopez, executive producer of of New Yorker Video, a prominent distributor of foreign titles.
New Yorker was founded by Mr. Lopez's partner, Dan Talbot, who also owns the Lincoln Plaza, the New York theater where the Ray films were screened in 1995. The company releases the films of Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Werner Herzog among others, as well as the Ray titles, to the educational market. "The more they are shown, the more the film culture grows," Mr. Lopez says.

Helping People Learn to Save Money

BYLINE: By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
CYNTHIA MCINTYRE of Newtown spends her days learning how to save money, and then passing her tips on to other people. Though it isn't exactly how the Kansas-born wife and mother of two envisioned her career niche, Mrs. McIntyre is determined to see her family not only survive but prosper on her husband's salary.
Her monthly newsletter, The Frugal Gazette (Post Office Box 3395, Newtown 06470), features recipes, cleaning solutions, tips on making major purchases -- anything that Mrs. McIntyre finds helpful in keeping a family's budget intact. 
 The following interview reflects Mrs. McIntyre's perceptions about American spending habits and the ways she has found to cut her own family's expenses by 40 percent.
Q. What led to the founding of The Frugal Gazette?
A. When we moved to Connecticut in 1991, at the height of the recession, it was as different from Kansas as day and night. My husband was able to take advantage of the opportunity to work on his M.B.A. full time, but we were shocked at the price of tuition. If we had stayed in Kansas we probably would have had to sell our house to allow him to return to school, because supporting it was based on two incomes. Here, we moved into a two-bedroom condominium. It was more a matter of how we approached the kids and helped them to understand that we wouldn't be living in the same way.
We had always been very frugal. Because of the way I was raised I was never allowed to spend money lavishly. I was raised to count pennies, to treat money in a respectful way.
When he finished school and we moved to Newtown, we decided to buy a house based on one income, just in case. We had been here about a year when I got laid off in Stamford. The last six months that I was working that job, I kept hearing myself as I drove to work, saying "this is not working, this is not working." We started re-evaluating our priorities, and I decided I had to do something different.
I had seen Amy Dcysczyn, editor of The Tightwad Gazette, on television six years before, and I thought, this is a woman of my heart. We're kindred spirits.
Q. Along with publishing your newsletter you have begun to give workshops at colleges in the state. Was this part of the mission of The Frugal Gazette?
A. One of my goals is to spread the word, by any means possible. I think there always has to be a Frugal Gazette. As a nurse I know that there are various types of personalities out there; I had to understand intimately what those were in order to educate people about various health-related issues like cholesterol and AIDS. There are many similar personality types out there in regard to spending habits.
Some people can just take the basic information and directly apply it. They'll go on and they'll be fine, and later I'll hear that they've saved so much money because I taught them the basics.
Other people won't make the connection, and they are going to need, monthly, a little infusion of support and encouragement. That is truly the intent of the Frugal Gazette, to provide that little nudge that says "Come on. Keep going." We are so flooded, constantly, with temptations to spend money, not to save, not to value our life force.
The Frugal Gazette reminds people on a monthly basis to save money. I'm also able to provide very current information. Things change constantly. It's really a war out there. People are trying to steal our money. The credit card people are 20 steps ahead of us and they have a huge marketing department. The grocery stores are out there doing stuff all the time, and we're just trying to make ends meet. The average person is just trying to live, to filter through all this stuff. I hope people get some information so they can say, "yeah, that's right. I can do that."
Q. Isn't this a little like being a personal trainer?
A. I feel like one sometimes. I'm one of very few people doing this. I like teaching because I like to be with people. Writing is lonely. Even the information that I present to people comes not from interviews, but lots of lonely research.
Q. What you're talking about is, in fact, saving both time and money.
A. I try to show people how to use their time and money in the most effective manner. That's the kind of niche I'm trying to fill. I try to reach out to working parents and those who stay at home as well. I don't have time to bake bread from scratch, so I use a bread machine. I look at the options of baking from scratch, using a bread machine, or buying it at the store and present those options. I try not to be judgmental, just give options. I'm just a conduit of information.
Some of my options my be unacceptable. Some people may not want to buy clothes at tag sales and that's O.K.
Q. I get the impression that one of the biggest ways that a family can save is in the kitchen, cutting back on the cost of fast food and eating out?
A. My experience is that this is the biggest source of excess spending. Many people don't recognize that, or if they recognize it, they think they have no control over it, because we have to eat. They think that if they put a lot of thought toward it, then they'll spend too much time. They might believe that it's a more efficient use of their time just to go buy something, when in fact, it's not. When you think of the time it actually takes to prepare something, compared to the time it takes to go to the store, buy prepared food, come home and eat it, you'll see the difference.
People need to plan meals, plan purchases. I struggled with this planning process and that's when I developed the frugal meal planning system. I've taken acceptable main dish recipes, that my family enjoys, and put basic information on index cards. Meals are planned around my supplies or whatever is on sale on a particular week.
Q. What is your favorite cost-cutting measure?
A. Meal planning, because that took the biggest bite out of our expenses. After that, after you have reduced your food expenses, cost cutting becomes a life-long challenge. You're constantly looking for ways to save money.
Q. What are some of the more important things to remember about saving money?
A. Too often people don't pay attention to the prices in grocery stores and the cost per unit. We really need to watch that carefully. We are well protected by laws, but too often stores ignore those laws.
I did a careful evaluation and reported eight different stores to the Consumer Protection Division. They inspected the stores and found them to be in error. The State of Connecticut says each store must be consistent about the unit of measure for unit pricing, so you can compare apples to apples. They can choose whatever unit they want; it can be the price per pound of toilet paper if they want, but then all the toilet paper has to be priced per pound. If you are charged anything, other than the price on the shelf, they are obligated to give you a free product.
Q. What are other important ways to save?
A. The majority of our money goes out for food, and then clothes. For clothes, it's a matter of being creative. Even consignment shops have sales. Also, people tend to buy brand new cars. It's ridiculous because you should really buy cars that are 2 or 3 years old. It has depreciated completely, and yet there's still a lot of life in it. And all the bugs have been worked out.
It's the same with clothes. If you buy things in a consignment shop or at a tag sale, they've already been washed and you know they aren't going to shrink or fade.
There are many other ways to cut back, such as on heating or cooling costs. It doesn't have to be something real complicated; these can be things that you do for yourself.
Q. How does your family feel about living frugally?
A. Our kids were raised with the understanding that Mom and Dad don't have an endless pot of money. They know that we don't have to spend everything; we can save something. They don't seem to notice any difference.
My daughter loves clothes, loves to spend, but she has truly embraced the concept of frugality. She bought 130 books at library book sales for less than $10 this summer.
She has learned, through my example, that there are other ways to reach an objective. And we have taught them that giving of yourself, your time, is one of the best gifts.

Holding Listeners Hostage in the Name of Art

BYLINE: By Bernard Holland 

 BODY:
MUSIC LOVERS BREATHED a sigh of relief when the musicians of the Chicago Symphony voted to accept a new contract this month. Listeners were thus assured that the Chicago would keep on blowing them away with its musical might. It was also nice to know that players wouldn't be rooting around in garbage cans for their next meal.
It is a curious spectacle. One's heart goes out to migrant workers clamoring for a decent meal, a dry place to sleep and a few dollars to take back home. It is harder to visualize the plight of employees whose salaries average in excess of $100,000 a year, and who receive generous benefits and vacation time. Picture junior partners at a Wall Street law firm picketing for bigger bonuses and more clout in management decisions. 
 But higher-echelon orchestra musicians are dead serious about their demands. Threats are the common negotiating currency: "Give us what we want now, or we'll scuttle your opening night." Contract strategies like this are common in opera houses and concert halls across the land, and Chicago was no exception as the orchestra prepared for its gala reopening of a renovated hall. Hostage-taking in the name of art: an interesting concept.
"Unfair," musicians will respond. "Managers are blackguards, assaulting our collective dignity, hoarding the revenues for which we are responsible and robbing us of creative freedom." Fair enough. Musicians trained as soloists in conservatories don't like being told by a conductor how to play, and they don't like being pushed around by their front offices. Admittedly, both sides in this argument are capable of not being very nice; on occasion they deserve each other.
I have spent my life around musicians, and I continually wonder at how the makers of such beautiful sounds can be so prone to malice, spite and envy. Wage standards among the country's top dozen orchestras, for example, begin not at home but at someone else's orchestra. The polite word is parity, but it's really, "Johnny has a bigger piece of cake than I do, and I am going to throw a tantrum until I get one like it." Don't doubt that players in New York, Boston and Philadelphia are thinking, "If Chicago got an $81,900-a-year minimum, we want as much when our contract expires, or maybe more, because we're better."
Forget who is at fault. This is the Balkans. It is also a terrible atmosphere in which to make music. These days, only a truly charismatic conductor can raise American orchestra musicians from their pervasive sulk. Some, bless them, enjoy their work. Others are too busy resenting their lives to waste much time on beauty. A critic who accompanied a major Eastern orchestra on a recent European tour told me that the constant complaining about hotels, rehearsals and travel arrangements so sickened him that he packed his bag midway and came home.
How can we take seriously the musicians of the San Francisco Symphony when they distribute leaflets asking audience members to demonstrate support at concerts? Labor disputes are a time-honored activity in this democracy, but to mix them with the making of music demonstrates poor taste and contempt for the art.
Such strategy generated little sympathy at Carnegie Hall a year ago, even less when San Francisco players naively repeated it in London. British orchestra musicians earn about 60 percent less than their American colleagues. They work harder, and studies show that they like their jobs better. London newspapers had a good time excoriating our exported presumption.
"But we are artists," players tell me, "and we are treated like cattle." Well, maybe they are oboe players and violinists, not artists. And maybe they are treated not like cattle but like employees, which is what they are. I remember a once-prominent Viennese pianist on world tour who found himself barred from Japan. For "occupation" in his passport he had stated not musician or pianist or even Kunstler but artist. The Japanese thought he was a circus performer.
Orchestra musicians work with their hands, perhaps with a bit more refinement than plumbers but with no great difference from cabinet makers or master brewers. "Artist" is one of those inflationary terms that promise much and mean nothing. All beautiful products, whether made of mahogany, rayon or meter and rhythm, come from craftsmen working with love, not artists.
"We have no creative freedom," I am told. Well, orchestra musicians are company employees. I am, too, and so are a lot of you. We do our best to be ourselves, but ultimately we do what we are told. It's part of the deal. If orchestra musicians want artistic freedom, they should relinquish the handsome salaries and benefits, and take their chances in the free market. None of us can have it both ways.
The Philadelphia Orchestra recently resolved a bitter strike. The Chicago players have had their way. Contracts will soon expire in Boston and New York. Who will draw the line? I reserve little sympathy for managements; their cravenness about the bottom line is not a pretty sight. My quarrel with musicians is also clear. My true thoughts are for the public, for listeners fed up with infantile squabbling between well-heeled musicians and their bosses. Even untrained ears are beginning to sense the antimusical effects on performances.
I advocate no strikes, no lockouts. But I think all parties might be surprised to find how nicely cultural life in big cities would survive if management and musicians chose to sit on their hands. In one city I know, the prolonged absence of its principal orchestra would be a ripple barely felt.

Kimchi Alley

BYLINE: By Ruth Reichl; Ruth Reichl is the restaurant critic for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Korean food is so exhilarating that from my very first bite, all I have wanted is more. Asia's most robust cuisine combines everyone's favorite flavors: sugar, salt, spice and peppers. It is fresh, healthy and low in cholesterol. Koreans graze through every meal, cooking at the table and eating with their fingers. Yet even in New York, this fascinating food remains a mystery. Why? A midnight stroll across 32d Street, in Manhattan's Koreatown, offers a couple of answers.
Koreans call it Sam Ship Iga, which simply means 32d Street; its heart is the block between Fifth Avenue and Broadway, but the district extends a few blocks in each direction. Lured by cheap rents, Koreans moved there en masse during the recession of the early 70's, when it was considered a dangerous area. Today, the block feels like one of the most secure in town. Even late at night the restaurants are filled with young people who gather in the new bakery, Pari Pari Ko, drinking coffee, laughing raucously and snacking on curiously delicious pastries filled with beef, pork and onions. 
 Many restaurants are open 24 hours, and one of the busiest is always Gam Mee Ok, which serves just a dozen dishes. Before you order, the waiters bring kimchi, the ubiquitous and breathtakingly spicy pickled cabbage that is cut with scissors as it is set on the table. Nearby, noisy teen-agers eat modum possam, a do-it-yourself oyster taco, made with oysters, pork and chili peppers rolled into pieces of lettuce. If you are in need of a little energy, there is nothing so refreshing as sul long tang, a snow-white soup filled with rice, noodles and pieces of meat. The idea is to add scallions, rock salt and pepper, along with generous lashings of kimchi.
My favorite place is just across the street. Open the door of Kang Suh and you are immediately assaulted by the smell of chilies, charcoal and garlic. Sit down and your table is instantly covered with bowls of savory pickled vegetables and spicy seafood. You could make a meal of these panchan, but they are merely free side dishes whose purpose is to make the rest of the food more interesting. What you probably want is bulgogi, the classic Korean marinated sirloin. The coal man arrives with glowing embers to fuel the barbecue in the middle of the table. You grill the meat, snatch it from the fire and place it on a piece of lettuce. Hot and cool, sweet and salty, bulgogi is eaten with the fingers, a lot like American barbecue, only better. Haemul pajun is another voluptuous dish, a savory seafood pancake also designed to be eaten without utensils.
I could easily sit here all night, sipping beer or soju (Korean vodka) between bites of barbecue and tastes of pajun -- and I can't imagine why everyone else in New York hasn't joined me. Yet I often find that I am the only non-Asian person in the place.
But times may be changing. Several signs suggest that Korean cuisine is finally ready to be the next crossover hit. Manhattan's first upscale Korean-accented restaurant, Mirezi, in Greenwich Village, opened a year ago to great success. And in Sam Ship Iga, where English menus are still rare, one new restaurant, in an effort to be more enticing, now describes the haemul pajun as "Korean pizza." Can "Seoul food" be far behind?

New York's Parallel Lives

BYLINE: By John Tierney; John Tierney is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine. His column on New York, The Big City, appears once a month.

 BODY:
The worlds of New York have inspired many collective metaphors -- melting pot, a boiling pot, a rainbow, a patchwork quilt, a gorgeous mosaic -- and none of them really work. Seven million people do not resemble an inanimate object. The best image of the city's diversity is not an abstraction. It is alive in Central Park and called the Skate Circle.
 Like most of New York's worlds, it evolved spontaneously and haphazardly, starting 20 years ago with a few roller skaters dancing separately to music from their radios on a dead-end road just west of the bandshell and south of the 72d Street transverse. One day they tuned their radios to the same station and danced together. Then a self-appointed disk jockey began playing tapes on a sound system. Soon hundreds of people were skating in concentric rings around the speakers every weekend afternoon: teen-agers in spandex, 60-year-olds in hiking shorts, Wall Street traders, Broadway dancers, Brooklyn detectives, German bankers, Brazilian nurses, Nigerian vendors, celebrities like Morgan Freeman and Margaux Hemingway bopping along next to bicycle messengers. 
 At first glance the Skate Circle seems to be one great melting pot, one big, happy family of man. But of course it's not quite that simple, or friendly. Most of the skaters barely know one another. They arrive separately and leave separately, and as they perform for the international crowd of spectators, they're concentrating on their moves, not on their brother and sister skaters. These dancers, skating side by side, crammed together competing for attention, are a model of the city's chaotic social structure, an assortment of subcultures that occasionally overlap but are mostly oblivious to one another. The worlds are what Tom Wolfe has called statuspheres: self-contained realms where people compete for status according to their own rules instead of traditional class structures. Statuspheres exist in all cities, but they are especially important here because they serve as surrogate families for the millions of displaced and solitary New Yorkers without extended families nearby. No other city has so many strangers from so many different worlds crowded into such a small space.
Consider, for instance, the evening of Oct. 6, a relatively quiet night because it was a Monday and because many people were at home watching the Yankees in a crucial playoff game. Still, Governor Pataki was speaking at a benefit at Lincoln Center; NBC's president, Robert Wright, was addressing another fund-raiser at the Plaza. Senator Edward Kennedy and Lauren Bacall were being honored at two other events. On 57th Street, the usual hordes of teen-agers going to the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood had to negotiate a flock of limousines bringing investment bankers to Carnegie Hall's season opening. On the Upper East Side, while Ivana Trump was attending a book party for Joan Collins at Mortimer's restaurant, a committee of women with older money and more traditional literary tastes was at the Cosmopolitan Club planning a dinner to raise money for the restoration of Edith Wharton's home in the Berkshires.
As lawyers practiced their golf swings at the Chelsea Piers driving range, the staff at Mother, a nightclub nearby, was working on the scenery and props (a caldron and a coffin) for a drag-queen show called "The Witches of East Village." College kids were bowling in the dark -- the pins were illuminated by black light -- as a deejay played trip-hop music at the Bowlmor Lanes in the Village, half a block from a restaurant where a middle-aged crowd was listening to the waitress-opera singer belt out "On the Street Where You Live." A few blocks north, models and people with the right music-industry connections were being escorted through a throng into Cheetah, the black club of the moment, where Janet Jackson and Wesley Snipes were holding court.
Down on the Bowery, Chinese immigrants were taking classes in Word Perfect, and Neil Young and Iggy Pop were attending a party for the film maker Jim Jarmusch at C.B.G.B., the vintage punk-rock club that's next door to a small opera house. As television cameras filmed the guests arriving at C.B.G.B., across the street a Catholic social worker born in Cleveland was handing out egg-salad sandwiches to men living in flophouses. Two of the lodgers, both young and unemployed -- Miguel, from a Puerto Rican family in the Bronx, and Malik, from a black family in Brooklyn -- were amusing themselves by watching the pedestrians go by and guessing which worlds they belonged to: suburban club kids on their way from St. Marks Place, busboys going home to Queens, gay men headed for Chelsea, uptowners trying to fit in downtown.
"I bet they just came out of Bowery Bar," said Malik, pointing to a 30-ish couple in denim walking from the direction of the nightspot favored by the fashion industry.
"No, her dress is too long and baggy," Miguel said. "Watch. I'll ask them." After the couple confirmed his suspicion, Miguel shook his head as he watched them walk away. "They'd never get into Bowery Bar dressed like that."
 These disparate worlds are a result partly of New York's size -- most other cities don't have enough people close together to sustain a thriving subculture devoted to skate dancing -- and partly of its peculiar social disorder. Political capitals like Washington, London, Paris, Rome and Tokyo are dominated by national institutions and traditional aristocracies; most other cities have social ladders determined by the leading churches and families and industries. But New York has never had a fixed, homogenous hierarchy since it was colonized in the 17th century by people speaking 18 languages. The old Dutch families shared the island with their English conquerors, as well as French Huguenots and African slaves. Unlike Puritan Boston and Quaker Philadelphia, Colonial New York was a religious hodgepodge, and later attempts to impose social order, like Mrs. Astor's list of 400, were always doomed by new people and new money.
A meal with the Mayor at Gracie Mansion has no more cachet than an invitation to the right Fifth Avenue parlor, midtown restaurant soiree, downtown gallery opening or nightclub V.I.P. room. New York has old families, but most New Yorkers don't even know their names; it has captains of industry, but too many for anyone to be in charge. The closest thing to an upper class today are the bold names in the gossip columns, and these are a haphazard sampling from dozens of different worlds. They are an ephemeral aristocracy based on talent, power, beauty, money and, above all, style.
The ambitious members of New York's worlds share the basic passion of the dancers in the Skate Circle -- Look at me! -- and these days they're enjoying remarkable success with audiences outside the city. New York has become the most popular destination in the United States besides Hawaii. New Yorkers, accustomed to hearing out-of-towners sneer that they wouldn't want to live here, were stunned by a poll this year in which Americans ranked New York first among the places they'd like to live. The city's hot reputation, though, is deceptive, because the economy is still relatively moribund, except for the tourist industry and Wall Street -- most of those out-of-towners eager to move here couldn't find well-paying jobs or affordable apartments. Los Angeles, Houston and San Diego have more dynamic economies and are attracting their own hordes of immigrants. But the homogenous neighborhoods in these cities will never become tourist attractions.
Now that crime has dropped and news is spreading of New York's safe streets, the city's diversity has probably become its chief economic asset -- a uniquely marketable commodity that distinguishes it from other capitals and tourist meccas. Like Paris, New York has famous sights and a cultured elite in residence, but it is more than a museum city renowned for past glories. Like Los Angeles, it has an eclectic array of industries and cultures, but it also has sidewalks where they all mix -- if only superficially.
On the eve of the 1929 mayoral election, Mayor Jimmy Walker went to Harlem and gave what Walter Winchell called "the shortest and sockiest political speech in the history of American politics." Walker was "pretty squiffed" and needed a little assistance reaching the podium, but sufficiently sober to deliver the following, as recorded and annotated by the columnist:
"Ladies and Gentlemen . . . the usual Walker pause . . . and I mean Ladies and Gentlemen. lusty hand clapping While I was driving up to this last big and most important rally of my campaign, a man on one side was telling me about all the things I did for the Negro while I was in the State Assembly. A fellow on the other side of me was telling me of all the things I did for the Negro while I was Mayor of the City of New York. Well, I'll tell you the truth. In all my political life I never did anything for the Negro! . . . big Walker pause -- with consternation on all sides I never did anything for the Catholics either; I never did anything for the Jews or Italians or the Germans -- because, Ladies and Gentlemen, I don't know the difference! Good night."
Walker was re-elected the next day. The speech was an absurd lie, but one that New Yorkers occasionally like to believe. They have always been ambivalent about their separate worlds: anxious to preserve them but also desirous of a common culture. The melting-pot metaphor has been around at least since 1782, when M.G. Jean de Crevecoeur, a naturalized New Yorker, declared, "Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men." In 1908, the metaphor became the title of a Broadway play in which a Russian deliriously happy to be in New York addresses a group of immigrants at Ellis Island: "A fig for your feuds and vendettas! German and Frenchman, Irishman and Englishman, Jews and Russians -- into the crucible with you all!" The play was an instant hit, but the reality outside the theater remained quite different. "The point about the melting pot is that it did not happen," wrote Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan in their classic 1963 study, "Beyond the Melting Pot."
The ethnic array analyzed in their book -- blacks, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, Irish -- seems parochial in comparison with today's New York. During the 1990's, more than 100,000 people from 187 countries have been arriving every year,further dividing and subdividing the city's ethnic worlds. American-born blacks who have taken the municipal bus-driving jobs once held by the Irish are now in a political fight with Caribbean-born blacks who operate competing private van services. New Spanish-speaking arrivals, like Mexican tortilla-manufacturers in Brooklyn and Dominican bodega owners in Washington Heights, do not necessarily identify with Puerto Rican politicians reared in the city's housing projects. Restaurants are no longer merely Indian or Italian -- they are Southern Indian or Gujarati, Tuscan or Milanese.
The separate worlds are especially obvious after dark, when New Yorkers seek out familiar faces in social clubs, nightclubs and restaurants. This voluntary segregation is often ascribed to hatred and fear, which may sometimes be true, but it might be more accurately caused by love -- or, more precisely, by the urge to reproduce, which is the force that ultimately drives individuals and social groups. When it comes to choosing a partner, people in every culture tend to put aside their ideals of universal brotherhood and practice what anthropologists call "positive assortative mating."
"When you're seeking to form a new family," says Lionel Tiger, an anthropologist at Rutgers University, "it's easier for most people to choose someone from a similar family than to write a letter, 'Dear Mom, I just met the most wonderful Inuit.' It's not surprising that for the courtship rituals that occur in restaurants and nightclubs, New Yorkers freely choose places filled with people like themselves. Where else are they going to find mates? At the Knickerbocker Club?"
New Yorkers like to celebrate the moments when different worlds unite -- veterans of the Skate Circle are proud that their diverse gathering has resulted in at least three marriages and 10 children -- but these are exceptions. "The metropolitan ideal doesn't make sense to most people," Tiger says. "Communities work best when there's a public sphere open to all and private ones to repair to at the end of the day. A Jamaican who spends the day at the World Trade Center negotiating a deal with someone from Sumatra takes comfort going back to Queens to eat ackee and saltfish or going dancing with other Jamaicans. That's one of the city's great gifts: you're a subway ride away from home."
New Yorkers need their separate worlds to cope with what is the most unnatural aspect of the city: the loneliness of people far from their families. More than half of the population was born outside the city -- 2.5 million in foreign countries and more than 1 million in other parts of the United States. One-third of the city's adults have never married; Manhattan has the highest concentration of single-person households in America except for an island in Hawaii settled as a leper colony. No matter how cosmopolitan they think they are, they belong to a species that evolved in small, exclusive clans. They have an innate urge to recreate similar worlds here. The melting pot could never turn New York into a happy family or any other kind of family. No sane human would ever wish for seven million relatives.

HEADLINE: SUNDAY VIEW;
A Curious Voyage Into Uncharted O'Neill

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby 

 BODY:
THE VAGUELY deconstructionist production of "More Stately Mansions," now at New York Theater Workshop (through next Sunday), has its isolated, sometimes quite arresting rewards. Yet it is less a presentation of an essentially realistic play than a stylized analysis of it, performed as if it were a religious rite so familiar that much of its language need not be understood but heard only as the drone of remembered cadences. If you don't know the catechism, you often won't have a clue as to what's going on.
As was reported in detail in these pages two weeks ago, "More Stately Mansions" is the severely abridged adaptation of a Eugene O'Neill play he never completed to his full satisfaction. In 1943 the playwright burned all longhand drafts of his gargantuan manuscript, saving one typescript that was later found in a Yale University library with the note: "Unfinished Work. This script to be destroyed in case of my death! Eugene O'Neill." 
 He died in 1953, but the text, with the approval of Carlotta Monterey, his widow and literary executor, was eventually entrusted to Karl Ragnar Gierow, then director of the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater, in the hopes he might whip it into shape. Gierow cut and rearranged the material, which had been translated into Swedish, and came up with a new text, first performed in Stockholm in 1962, and said to be composed entirely of O'Neill's words.
It is this play, translated back into English, that was the basis for Jose Quintero's 1967 Broadway adaptation, as well as for the production now being performed here, pared down some more and without Mr. Quintero's interpolations. After the intervention of the O'Neill biographers Arthur Gelb (a former theater critic and editor of The Times) and his wife, Barbara Gelb, the current production, which was initially being presented as "a play by Eugene O'Neill, as adapted by Karl Ragnar Gierow," is now being billed as "by Eugene O'Neill, as adapted by Karl Ragnar Gierow from O'Neill's unfinished manuscript."
It is easy to understand why theater people as well as O'Neill scholars are drawn to "More Stately Mansions," particularly as it exists before it was edited. Familiar O'Neill obsessions, echoing such monumental works as "Strange Interlude," "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night," reappear here in significantly new variations. The shade of Freud again haunts the family at the play's center. In this case, however, the characters inhabit a historical time and place whose conflicted social, economic and political values both mirror and shape the split psyches of the characters. American civilization, says O'Neill, is doomed, hopelessly caught between its professed democratic ideals and the greed that fuels its progress.
The play's original fragment -- it is called a fragment though it might run 10 to 12 hours in playing time -- is a work of both grandeur and grandiosity. It was to be the sixth play in "A Tale of Possessors, Self-Dispossessed," which O'Neill planned as a cycle of 11 plays tracing the corruption of America as reflected in the fortunes of the Harford family from the early 19th century into the 20th. The only play of the cycle he completed and offered for production was "A Touch of the Poet," which was designed to precede "More Stately Mansions."
Covering the years from 1832 to 1842 and set in and around a Massachusetts mill town, the original fragment of "More Stately Mansions" is a brilliant, verbose, numbingly repetitious play about an Oedipal triangle: Simon Harford, a young man with the soul of a poet; his ambitious, sensual wife, Sara, the daughter of an Irish immigrant pub keeper, and Deborah, Simon's possessive mother whose fantasies are something more than pipe dreams.
Largely to please the social aspirations of Sara, and to beat his rich father at his own game, Simon abandons letters to go into cotton milling. To everyone's surprise, he becomes a successful, ruthless tycoon, at least in part because he treats it as if it were an abstract game. His goal: a vertically integrated empire of plantations, ships, mills, railroads and retail outlets. (Though "More Stately Mansions" spans only 10 years, O'Neill encapsulates so much of American industrial history in it that you might wonder how he was going to fill the five plays that were to follow.)
The Gierow adaptation of "More Stately Mansions" underplays Simon's business mania, including O'Neill's comments about the Presidency of Andrew Jackson (which sounds like Jimmy Carter's) and how it affects the interests of right-thinking American businessmen. The production at New York Theater Workshop, staged by Ivo van Hove, a Flemish director, goes even further in separating the play's characters from the context in which O'Neill so painstakingly placed them.
Mr. van Hove's "More Stately Mansions" is set in a timeless void, that is, on an orange-carpeted stage against a black backdrop, dramatically lighted from time to time to italicize particular monents. The three principal players -- Simon (Tim Hopper), Sara (Jenny Bacon) and Deborah (Joan MacIntosh) -- enter at the beginning of each act, walk to the front of the stage, bow impassively to the audience and then retire to chairs at the side of the stage to await their cues.
These entrances have the formality of the start of a sumo match, which is probably intentional. What follows is a series of genteelly choreographed encounters -- some of them knock down and drag out -- between husband and wife, wife and mother-in-law, mother and son. Throughout the play, their roles change and change again: adversaries become allies, lovers become competitors. There is one moment when the lusting Simon and Sara tear their clothes off each other for an obligatory, acrobatic nude scene. Deborah doesn't bare all, but she bares her breasts for a Pieta pose with Simon. The production's three supporting actors enter and leave the stage as they are needed.
Even though the text has been freely pruned, there are thousands of words to be gotten through, many of which, especially those in the spoken thoughts that are O'Neill monologues, are delivered in the speedy monotones most often associated with Beckett. Another ploy is to have two characters speak at the same time, which if done consistently, would cut the play's running time in half. That you can't easily understand what's being said seems to be beside the point of this production, which, even in its abbreviated form, still runs about 3 1/2 hours, including two intermissions.
The production takes on dramatic urgency when the director gives the actors time and space in which to realize some of the complexities of the O'Neill characters. Only then is it possible to recognize the gifts of America's greatest playwright. Consider the scene in which Simon invites Sara to his office to make her a proposal. He is fed up with his role as tycoon and has been rendered impotent after years of living under the same roof with both Sara and Deborah; they have merged into a single figure in his consciousness.
To separate his wife and his mother, who have become allies, and to possess each as he did when they loathed each other, he asks Sara to become his daytime mistress in the privacy of the office. After each assignation, he will assign her another share of the company, while allowing her to assume those corporate duties that no longer interest him. Sara tries to act shocked but she is exultant. She loves Simon, but she also loves money.
In time, she becomes more ruthless than Simon, who longs to return to childhood when he and his mother shared her secret garden. Simon, Sara and Deborah are each a battleground on which the forces of light and darkness are in fatal stalemate. As the Harfords go, says O'Neill, so goes America.
Though Mr. Hopper, Ms. Bacon and Ms. MacIntosh are at the mercy of the director, they manage to give identity to their characters when they are not being upstaged by the denaturing formality of his concept. Also commendable is Robert Petkoff as Simon's ineffectual younger brother (whom his mother describes as "God's most successful effort in taxidermy").
For those who might want to further pursue "More Stately Mansions," the complete text of the original fragment is available in the Library of America's three-volume collection of O'Neill's works. It is a long, sometimes boring but frequently extraordinary read, revealing, among other things, how he worked, creating plays out of early drafts from which absolutely nothing was left out. His words being often blunt and heavy, it was like sculpting granite, but he retrieved life from the most inert of raw materials.
I think of Deborah's line when she tells Simon, who has grown away from her over the years, that she would be as indifferent to his death as to the death of a stranger. He protests. She is brutal.
"That is what Time does to us all," she says. "We forget and pass on."

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
Traditions of East and West Gather at the River

BYLINE: By LINDSLEY CAMERON; Lindsley Cameron's biography of the Japanese composer Hikari Oe will be published in the spring.

 BODY:
WESTERN OPERA AND Japanese Noh drama might seem to be incompatible. The word "operatic" has come to be synonymous with "flamboyant." Noh connoisseurs, on the other hand, prize subtlety and restraint. Yet one work, at once powerful and exquisite, successfully unites the two traditions: Benjamin Britten's one-act opera "Curlew River."
The Britten work will be presented along with Juro Motomasa's "Sumidagawa," the 15th-century Noh play that inspired it, beginning on Wednesday evening at the Japan Society, on East 47th Street in Manhattan, as part of its Japanese Theater in the World festival, which runs through February. Although the works have often been performed together in Japan, this is said to be the first professional production of the two together in the United States. 
 "Sumidagawa" ("Sumida River") and "Curlew River" share a simple plot. A widow has gone mad because her young son has disappeared. Searching for him, she boards a ferry, and the boatman explains that crowds are gathering at its destination in hopes that the spirit of a kidnapped boy who died there will work miracles. Hearing details about the dead child, the woman realizes that he must have been her vanished son. Joining in the prayers at his grave, she hears a voice and recognizes it as his, and his spirit appears, restoring her sanity.
"Sumidagawa" is the most popular play in the Noh repertory, undoubtedly because of its striking emotional immediacy. (Performances were forbidden at emperors' and shoguns' palaces from 1600 to 1868, because the story was considered inappropriately upsetting.) Noh, generally, is virtually devoid of action. A typical drama consists of one character telling another about something that happened a long time ago; the character who tells the story often turns out to be a ghost. In "Sumidagawa," rather than just hearing about the protagonist's experiences, the audience makes the crucial discovery along with her, and she regains her sanity on stage.
Hideo Kanze, the director of the illustrious Tessenkai Noh Troupe of Tokyo, will direct "Sumidagawa" and play the Madwoman. Traditional Noh is all-male, and the art is passed down in families. Kan Hosho, who will play the Boatman, was trained from age 7 by his father and grandfather, eminent specialists in such roles. And Mr. Kanze's roots stretch back to Noh's beginnings. He is descended from the "Sumidagawa" playwright, whose grandfather, Kanami, founded Noh in the 14th century.
"The blood line is not so important," Mr. Kanze said by telephone from Tokyo."What is important is the cultural lineage, being raised in the traditions of Noh, which have been cultivated for so many generations."
What do Western audiences need to know to appreciate the play? "Only the story," Mr. Kanze said. "It doesn't matter if they can't follow the words line by line." The Japan Society will in any case provide librettos.
Britten had long been fascinated with Asian music by the time he saw "Sumidagawa," in two different productions, in 1956 in Tokyo. He was intrigued by its musical aspects. It made a tremendous impression on him, he wrote, as "a totally new 'operatic' experience." But it was surely the story that seized his imagination above all. Like many of his operas, it is centered on the death of an innocent figure, and it inspired him to create, in the Madwoman's poignantly fragmented narratives, unforgettable musical evocations of devastating loss. The plaintive motif she shares with the curlew birds that give the river its name uses pitch intervals evoking those characteristic of the chants of Noh drama.
Eventually, "Sumidagawa" prompted Britten to create something radically new of his own: a new kind of opera, a small-scale work that exploits modest resources ingeniously to re-create quintessentially Japanese effects in Western terms. Its haunting libretto, by the South African novelist William Plomer, transposes the play's Buddhist transcendence into Christian terms, preserving the dramatic and many of the poetic qualities of the original text.
The transformation took some doing. Britten did not write "Curlew River" until 1964, in Venice. There he saw a procession of monks, which apparently suggested a solution to the formidable problems involved in adapting a work from an exotic, non harmonically based tradition of musical theater. "Curlew River" begins and ends in plainchant, and the singers, rather than enacting the story straightforwardly, are supposed to be monks representing its characters as though in a mystery play. Just as in Noh, therefore, the whole cast is male. (The role of the Madwoman -- that is, of the monk who plays her -- was written for Britten's longtime companion Peter Pears.)
"Curlew River," created to be performed in a church, was such a departure from conventional Western forms that Britten called it a "church parable" rather than an opera. And because "Curlew River" deploys its stark musical resources sequentially rather than simultaneously, and gives the instrumentalists and singers freedom to proceed at their own tempos, Britten invented a new kind of fermata, or sustaining symbol. Called a "curlew mark," it looks like a bird in flight and indicates where performers should wait for others.
Jonathan Eaton, the stage director of "Curlew River" at the Japan Society, has been involved with Britten's music in England intermittently since his childhood, when he sang the treble solos in the "War Requiem." But Mr. Eaton is probably best known to audiences here for a notably gory production of Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana" in 1992 at the New York City Opera. His fundamental challenge in this "Curlew River," he said, is to find a theatrical substitute for what is lost by not performing in a church, where "you would automatically get a dimension of ritual and ceremony, connecting to the spiritual resolution at the heart of the piece."
He sees the work as Britten's triumphant answer to a longstanding artistic crisis.
"It seems to me he was looking for a new voice, even a new way of writing music," Mr. Eaton said. "Through this piece, he discovers a confluence. The river is an interesting image. It divides East and West, old and new, ancient and modern, the grieving mother from the spirit of her child, the land of the living from the land of the dead. But it's also a meeting point. The revelation about the boy's fate comes in the middle of the river. Threads come together there as well as being sundered. In the piece there's a confluence of Oriental musical influences with Britten's own uniquely English, Western voice, and I think it points forward to the rest of his musical output."
The work calls for no conductor. Joseph Colaneri, a staff conductor at the City Opera and the musical director of this production, will play a small organ on stage and provide musical cues.
"The traditional Noh orchestra basically consists of flute and drums on stage, and Britten adapted that idea," Mr. Colaneri said. "He uses the instruments very economically.
"Noh is fascinating, it moves at a timeless pace, and it's very intense, not only for the performers but even for the audience. There is no counterpart to it in Western music except in 'Curlew River,' where Britten has managed to demonstrate the spirit of Noh without resorting to pastiche. It's miraculous, really."

HEADLINE: Westbury Closing by Venerable Firm Angers Its Workers

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
PHIL KLAUS of Hicksville rode a forklift and worked in receiving at the King Kullen grocery warehouse in Westbury for 21 1/2 years. His late father, Felix, also worked in the warehouse, moving his family from Brooklyn to Hicksville in 1960 to be near his job when the warehouse moved from Jamaica, Queens.
But now, Mr. Klaus said, King Kullen, the sole remaining family owned supermarket chain on Long Island, has turned its back on its employees by closing the grocery warehouse, leaving just the produce and meat warehouses. 
 King Kullen said it had decided to contract out its grocery warehousing for economic reasons and offered the workers severance pay when their contract expired on Aug. 31. The union refused the proposal and set up picket lines on Sept. 2. Talks resumed last week.
On July 28 the company gave the 112 warehouse employees, 27 of whom had worked there more than 20 years, a month's notice "to get our lives in order and go away," he said.
Mr. Klaus, a member of the negotiating committee for teamsters Local 282, said that the employees had heard rumors about the sale of the warehouse but that the management had assured them the rumors were false.
"We fully expected them to sell off part of the warehouse, but we never thought for a minute that it would try to outsource," Mr. Klaus said about the company's decision to hire Bozzuto's Inc. in Cheshire, Conn., for its warehouse operations.
A consultant for King Kullen, Jerry Columbus, said the contract with Bozzuto's was signed after the company had "made a strategic decision to get out of the grocery-distribution business."
"We want to focus on our stores," Mr. Columbus said. "Distribution has become an increasingly specialized business, technology focused with sophisticated systems. King Kullen is family operated, and we had to choose where to focus our business over the next five to 10 years."
A number of supermarket chains have moved to outsource their warehouse operations, according to James T. Rogers, president of the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, which represents 850 retailers, wholesalers and suppliers.
The profit margin in the grocery section of supermarkets is about 1 cent for every $1 of sales, Mr. Rogers added.
"When you combine that profit margin with intense competition -- and there is a great deal of it on Long Island -- supermarkets look to see how they can operate more efficiently," Mr. Rogers said. "As changes occur, unfortunately things like this happen. It's a very difficult situation. There's no doubt about it."
A teamsters' representative, Sandy Pope, said the union workers had decided to "make a stand" after having seen union employees lose their jobs when other warehouses in the region had closed.
In January 1996, she said, Grand Union closed warehouses in Carlstadt, N.J., and Mount Kisco, N.Y., and contracted with the nonunion C & S Wholesale Grocers Inc. in Brattleboro, Vt., causing 500 union employees to lose their jobs.
"Grand Union had been losing money for years and had been in bankruptcy more than once," Ms. Pope said. "Their warehouses were very old, and while we tried to negotiate we couldn't reach an agreement. The company was broke, and we couldn't ask them to invest in the future while we also gave up something.
"This whole area had been served by union warehouses. Grand Union broke that when C & S was able to come in with much lower costs, because of its lower-wage operations in Vermont, Connecticut and Massachusetts."
On the other hand the teamsters' averted a move by Safeway Inc. to close a warehouse in Maryland. "We negotiated to keep them open and gave concessions," Ms. Pope said. "The state helped out, and the company agreed to invest in the warehouse rather than close. We saved 800 jobs."
Last year, when Royal Ahold N.V. of Zaandam, the Netherlands, bought Edwards supermarkets, the union lost 300 jobs from layoffs at a warehouse that Edwards used in Edison, N.J., Twin County Grocers.
"So in the last year and a half we have conducted some boycotting of Edwards and Grand Union and had a fair amount of informational leafleting," said Ms. Pope.
If the union did not take a stand now, she said, it feared that the only other chain on Long Island with its own warehouse, Waldbaums, would also outsource.
The executive vice president for finance and administration at King Kullen, J. Donald Kennedy, implied that King Kullen had little choice after Grand Union and Edwards had switched. Those chains, he added, now had "a distinct competitive advantage over us."
Ms. Pope said the union and its employees believed that King Kullen would change its mind and agree to reopen its warehouse. "We think it can be done," she said. "The contract with Bozzuto's can be broken. We know that if King Kullen's conscience gets the better of them we would be able to find a solution to keep them competitive on Long Island and keep these jobs."
A spokeswoman for King Kullen, Katherine Heaviside, said the president of the teamsters, Ron Carey, was directing the protest from Washington.
"Ron Carey has chosen, as he said, to try to destroy King Kullen," Ms. Heaviside said. "We cannot allow Washington teamsters to try to ruin one of our Long Island companies."
Ms. Pope said Mr. Carey was "not looking for fights" to boost his standing for the next union election.
"Union members here would have hung Ron Carey had he not taken them out on strike," Ms. Pope said, referring to the picketing that the workers have been conducting even after their contract expired on Aug. 31. "This was not a from-the-top-down strike. There is no chance he would do something like this without the overwhelming support of other teamster members and other unions."
"It is the Washington-based teamsters who are making an organized attack on King Kullen for their own purposes," Mr. Columbus said. "They are not supported by any nonteamsters unions. This is purely a teamsters attack."
Of the 4,400 employees at the company, 90 percent are members of other unions, and all are working, he said. The only workers who are honoring the picket lines are 45 teamsters in the produce warehouse, also in Westbury.
Their contract expires on March 31, and Ms. Pope said they feared that King Kullen would close that warehouse on April 1. Executives of the company say no decision has yet been made.
The teamsters also represent 23 employees in the meat warehouse, also in Westbury, who are continuing to work. That contract expires in 18 months, Ms. Pope said.
The executive vice president of operations for the company, Brian C. Cullen, said competition on Long Island had changed from 20 or 30 years ago. Then, he said, multinational supermarkets were not known and neither were large so-called warehouse like BJ's, Price Costco and Sam's Club.
"They have all put more pressure on us to be competitive in the marketplace," said Mr. Cullen, a nephew of Michael Cullen, who started the business in 1930.
"Even if our union members worked for free," Mr. Cullen said, "they would have to pay us for us to realize the kind of comprehensive savings" with Bozzuto's.
King Kullen, Mr. Klaus said, did not base its move on economic considerations, but rather "greed and deception."
"They are saying they are doing it to be competitive with the multinationals," he said. "But their biggest competitor is Waldbaums, which employs 350 teamsters at its Islip warehouse. What they are doing by going to another company is destabilizing the industry. In going to the lowest bidder they are going to start a price war."
"King Kullen," Ms. Pope said, "had other options that would have saved them millions and kept the warehouse jobs. But Bozzuto's saved them more millions, savings that just mean more profit. And customers frequently don't realize those savings."
Mr. Columbus denied that the Bozzuto's contract had an escape clause. It is irrevocable, he said, and King Kullen would be "liable for all expenses should we break it." Those expenses, which he said could run to millions of dollars, include new space to supply the 47 King Kullen stores, adding tractor-trailers and other handling equipment and hiring additional supervisors and workers.
Bozzuto's, Mr. Cullen said, was interested in talking to the King Kullen workers to see whether they wanted jobs in Cheshire. King Kullen, he added, offered workers training like tractor-trailer driving and other skills. He said there was a shortage of drivers on Long Island.
"We do not believe the union communicated that offer to its members, because we know of one employee who spent his own money to learn how to drive a tractor-trailer," Mr. Cullen said.
The workers, he added, could also seek work elsewhere in the company, and "we had strong leads on other Long Island jobs."
Mr. Klaus said all the company did was "give us a list of jobs it got out of the newspaper."
"There were a total of six jobs with no addresses, only a job description and the town," he added.
Mr. Klaus said that it took two hours to drive to Bozzuto's and that he would have had to "uproot my family to work for $280 a week, when I was making $780 here."
"I'd also have to start out at the bottom in a nonunion place," he added, "and my wife, Debi, would have to quit her job as an accounting manager." Mr. Klaus said King Kullen had not given the workers an opportunity to negotiate for their jobs. At the meeting on July 28, he said, "they walked in with a corporate and labor attorney and said they were not there to negotiate."
Mr. Cullen did not dispute that, but said the company was "prepared to try to do the right thing for our employees by providing them with severance and retraining."
Although there was no legal requirement for severance, Mr. Cullen said, on July 28 "we offered everybody one week of pay for every year of service."
"In addition," he said, "we offered to extend the contract, from Sept. 1 through Sept. 30, so they would have had two months' notice."
Asked why the company made its announcement a month before the end of the union contract, Mr. Columbus said King Kullen had begun studying the issue a year earlier and did not decide until late June on the five-year contract with Bozutto's.
"Once we made the decision," Mr. Cullen said, "we had significant concern over the union's reaction. From the time we made the announcement until the last day of the contract, absenteeism was at the 50 percent level. And the productivity of the employees who showed up was equal to the poor attendance record. We couldn't service our stores, because productivity was down 40 to 50 percent. We had to recruit temporary workers to supply our stores. On Sept. 2 the union went on strike."
Although union officials said the company had told them that the decision to close the warehouse was not based on economic reasons, Mr. Columbus said:
"Everything has an economic component. To compete with the multinationals here on Long Island we must streamline our cost structure and offer more items at lower cost. So certainly there was an economic component."
Ms. Pope said the company was using half its 33-acre site in Westbury. "The company is making a very good profit, and it could expand the warehouse if it wanted to," she added. That will not come to pass, said Mr. Kennedy, who added that the company was "actively seeking tenants for the warehouse building."
"We're now selling off the tractors and trailers we don't need anymore," he said.
Mr. Columbus said union suggestions to expand the warehouse and to have King Kullen buy produce for other chains on Long Island were unrealistic. "You're talking about the lifeblood of a business, purchasing," he said. "A supermarket chain is not going to rely on a competitor to buy for it."

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Robert Rosenthal;
From Baking to Investment Management

BYLINE: By DAVID WINZELBERG 

 BODY:
HE has been called one of the new architects of Long Island, and although Robert Rosenthal couldn't tell you much about bricks and concrete, he knows how to make dough.
The former chief operating officer for the bakery corporation Entenmann's, Mr. Rosenthal is currently president of First Long Island Investors in Jericho, managing $800 million in assets of some of the area's wealthiest individuals. As co-chairman and co-chief executive officer of the New York Islanders, Mr. Rosenthal recently helped engineer the pending sale of the team to a consortium of owners, who are planning to build a new arena and develop the area around the Nassau Veterans Coliseum. 
 A past president of the board of the Sid Jacobsen Jewish Community Center, Mr. Rosenthal, 48, serves as vice chairman of the board of the North Shore University Health Network and is also a member of the Dean's Advisory Council for Hofstra University Law School. Active in civic and charitable efforts, he is a father of four and lives with his wife, Jodi, in Old Brookville.
Q. Why is it so important to have a professional sports franchise on Long Island?
A. The Islanders are part of the cultural infrastructure of Long Island. They became a significant part of its history and tradition by winning four consecutive Stanley Cups in the early 1980's. They are also the anchor tenant in a building that provides entertainment for people of all ages. The Islanders as a sports team links all of the kids involved in youth hockey, which has really grown on the Island in the last few years. They can go visit their local pro sports team that is vying for a championship and I think it's really great to be a part of that. We can't afford to lose any more sports teams. We once had the New York Nets. They're gone. We had the Jets, and they're gone. And we had Roosevelt Raceway. That's a wealth of entertainment that now is only represented by the Islanders. We need that cultural mecca.
Q. Is having three N.H.L. teams within a 100-mile radius overkill?
A. You've got three million people between eastern Queens and Montauk Point. If we put a competitive team in the Coliseum with a decent facility, they will support the Islanders. The rivalry between the Rangers and the Islanders and the Devils is probably the most exciting rivalry between three teams in professional sports. It's explosive. If you've ever been to the Coliseum when the Rangers play the Islanders, you know it's a phenomenon. And I think with having three million people who are sports-minded within this small geography there's no question that the Island can support the Islanders.
Q. The new owners of the Islanders are making a pretty big investment. What is going to insure support for the team and how are they going to fill the seats?
A.The new ownership, which includes Steven Gluckstern and his partners, is the whole package in my opinion. They have business acumen, they have a commitment to win, which is very important, and they understand professional sports. With the nucleus of young players that we've given them, and with the cooperation of the county and the state, who we've been working with for the past three years, when you put all of that together with what this group brings to the table, I think they will be very successful.
Q. When you acquired a percentage of the Islanders several years ago, it was valued significantly lower than the price you recently sold it for. How did you build the value of the franchise?
A. We viewed it as three opportunities within the acquisition of the Islanders. The franchise itself, which is a great franchise that won four Stanley Cups but has fallen on hard times. We thought if we could build a nucleus of young players, that would improve the value of the hockey team itself. In addition to that, there was a very unique Cablevision/ Sportschannel agreement for broadcast rights to the Islanders games. I worked with John Pickett to renegotiate that so we have a 35-year agreement, and that has very substantial value, which adds to the overall value of the franchise. The third part would be the building, and the opportunity to derive more revenue from that building and participate in its development. So when you take a rebuilt, revitalized team, the Sportschannel agreement and perhaps the opportunity to participate in a new facility and the space around it, we believed we could enhance the value and we did.
Q. You have talked about a "wholistic approach" to building Long Island's strength as a region. What do you mean by that?
A. There has to be leadership, balance and investment. Government officials and private industry must provide leadership, planning and investment to build the right infrastructure. You have to have a combination of commerce and culture, taking advantage of Long Island's natural assets. I'm a big believer that there's no need for anyone on Long Island to migrate to New York City for basic services such as entertainment and sports, health care, retail, education or financial services. So that combination of balance, leadership and investment builds the right infrastructure and is my approach to building Long Island.
Q. In recent years we have seen record sales volume in Long Island residential real estate, but economists attribute the boom to the success of the stock market. What is to prevent the bubble from bursting as it did in 1987?
A. I believe this is a new economic era. We have an industrial revolution of technology and communications going on that I think is as far reaching and far changing as the old Industrial Revolution of steel and railroads. We have a world that for the most part now has peace, without the threat of nuclear war. We've got a global economy, where people no longer look at the economy as being just coast to coast in the United States, it transcends the entire world. We have very little inflation and we've gone from years of worrying about massive Federal budget deficits to a surplus. All of these factors contribute to a very vibrant long-term economy, which I think helps us all prosper going forward, and will not result in the kind of market crash we had in 1987 or the kind of crash that existed in 1929. However, that is not to say there won't be market volatility. There will. But long term, all of these economic and political factors I think contribute to a very signicant economy of growth with low inflation.
Q. The current favorable economic climate has spawned a great deal of commercial development; including expansion of existing malls and construction of new ones. How many more places to shop do Long Islanders need, and at what sacrifice to rapidly shrinking open space?
A. Long Island needs balance in its development. When we talk about a new Coliseum and people suggest that the surrounding retail space will just be more of the same. Not true. The new Coliseum should be surrounded by sports family entertainment. It should be like a Madison Square Garden east, an entertainment mecca. We need to plan the space intelligently with open space, parks, perhaps outdoor ice skating rinks. It might be coordinated with Hofstra and New York Tech. It should be a unique, family entertainment-type of facility amongst the 70 acres where the Nassau Coliseum is right now. So we're not duplicating the existing malls and retail space, we're complimenting that.
Q. You handle investments for some of Long Island's wealthiest individuals. What advice can you give the average Long Islander who is looking to invest?
A. Be a long-term investor. Invest in great businesses that can endure volatility in economic cycles. Companies like Intel, Pfizer and Gillette. Don't try and time the market. Either getting in with an investment or getting out. Take advantage of the new law on long-term capital gains, which is the difference between a 40 percent effective tax rate and a 20 percent rate.
Q. How did you get started at Entenmanns?
A. My father was the outside accountant and labor adviser for the Entenmann family and I had known the family since I was 5 or 6 years old. There were some manufacturing difficulties that required a more technical business perspective, and I was called in on a college vacation to go out to the bakery and work with William Entenmann and his brother. It was Christmas vacation and I remember my dad said, 'They need you out at the bakery,' and that launched a career. That was back in 1970. I ended up going to law school at Hofstra University, while I worked full time at Entenmann's.
Q. What is your favorite Entenmann's product?
A. There are two. One is the crumb coffee cake and the other is the chocolate doughnut.
Q. There has been tremendous consolidation in health care, and North Shore has been one of the biggest players in mergers and acquisitions of other hospitals. What effect does this have on the quality of care at the smaller community hospitals that North Shore has absorbed?
A. I think that the network we have created, which includes more community hospitals, has been very beneficial to them. There is no duplication of resources, so if a smaller, community hospital is part of the system, we can help develop their strengths. We can provide assistance in gaining financing and increasing the quality of those institutions in the network, so that the people get the benefit of stronger, local institutions. But at the same time if they have a need for more specialized care, that can be handled within the North Shore network, such that we're not spending money in both places.
Q. How can Long Island continue to thrive in the future?
A. For those of us that have achieved some success on Long Island, I believe we have an obligation to invest the time and financial commitment to build the infrastructure of Long Island, to make it an even better place to live and raise our children. It's a responsibility that we have. I think its important that as communities are confronted with challenges in a changing world, that we work together with local government and we support that infrastructure. Everybody involved in our organization has to spend time working in the community supporting philanthropy. I think its something that's vitally important to Long Island, and there are a lot of people who feel the same way. What makes Long Island special is the fact that there are some wonderful people who are willing to spend their time and their money to enhance what already exists here by supporting some worthwhile endeavors. You've got to give something back, you can't always take. That's something that's very important to me and my company.

Condo Market in Fairfield Is on the Upswing Again

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
WHEN Jennifer and Carl Ruspini came to Stamford in 1989, they bought a one-bedroom, 750-square-foot condominium at Harbor House for $205,000. Still in immaculate condition, it has a 24-foot living-dining room, marble fireplace, a small den or breakfast room, top-of-the-line appliances, powder room, and a 25-foot deck overlooking the harbor and 100 boat slips that rent for $72 per foot.
"We are the original owners," Mrs. Ruspini said. "We were the first people to move in. We had our choice of 60 units."
Six weeks ago the Ruspinis' first child, Christopher, was born, precipitating a need for more space. They put their apartment on the market six months ago at $215,000, but it has not sold. "We haven't even had offers," she said. "I think realtors don't want to bother with a 5 percent commission on a condo when they can get so much more selling million-dollar homes." 
 Her reasoning is on target: home sales are booming. And her anxiety is understandable. But she also has reason for hope, because the condo market in Fairfield County is on its way up. "With so many people coming in for Swiss Bank," she said, referring to newest major addition to downtown Stamford, "there's got to be a bachelor out there for whom this would be perfect."
Real estate brokers agree that the roller coaster that propelled condominium prices to precipitous highs in the 80's and calamitous lows in the early 90's has halted. In the last year, prices have risen and condominiums have regained the interest of investors and an array of empty-nesters, first-time home buyers and young professionals.
Joseph L. Policastro, 28, a graduate student studying for a master's in business adminitration at the University of New Haven, bought a two-bedroom, two-bath unit at Chesterfield Condominiums on Bedford Street in Stamford. "I was looking for investment properties to rent out for two or three years, then move into myself," he said. He paid $176,000 for the unit in March and rented it for $1,750 in April. His profit, he said, "is $310 a month, plus a lot of tax benefits." He is planning to buy a second unit in the same complex.
"That is a smart young man," said Lisa Bush, broker at Coldwell Banker in Stamford. "I have advised people to do just what he has done. People looking to buy may be having second thoughts about waiting and saving more money. But they don't understand that when the market is good and the forecast is good, savings are not going to match the rise in real estate prices."
Owning can be cheaper than renting. A hypothetical unit selling for $80,000, she said, "with $3,000 down, will cost about $600 a month for the mortgage payment, $150 a month for common charges, and $110 for taxes, a total of $860. Rent for the same unit would probably approach $1,000."
"Your deduction for taxes and mortgage interest brings the $860 down further," she said, "and you are almost certain to profit on selling, or have a positive cash flow if you move out and rent the unit."
STAMFORD and Norwalk condominiums have only partly bounced back from the 30 percent they lost after prices peaked in 1986, unlike the experience in more homogeneously affluent towns like Greenwich. Average prices there have remained in a relatively close range of $304,000 in 1990, dipping to $280,000 in 1991 and up to $355,885 this year, according to Greenwich Board of Realtors figures.
The William Pitt brokerage concern computed the average sale price this year in Stamford at $149,435, with 463 units sold to date and an average of 86 days on the market. During the same period last year, 369 units were sold in an average of 112 days at an average of $140,169.
The rest of the state has usually suffered more from economic downturns and taken longer to recover.
The Hartford Board of Realtors, for example, lists the average price of a unit at $77,590 today, compared with $130,900 in 1990. But there is a bright side even in Hartford, with an average of 88 days on the market and 479 units sold so far this year, compared with 1990 figures of 187 days on the market and 301 units sold year to date.
"Condominiums always lag about 20 percent below the cost of cheaper single-family homes," said Gurdon Buck, a specialist in condominiums at the Hartford law firm of Robinson & Cole. "When the recession hit, it hit hardest on condos, because the price of single-family homes came down to where people could afford them instead of condos."
Most of the middle-range complexes are now investor-dominated, he said. "If someone is getting $650 a month rent, it's worth $28,000 to an investor, who puts 25 percent down, pays $150 a month for taxes and insurance and gets a 12 percent return." A block of nine units at the 96-unit Claremore Condominiums on Maple Street in Norwalk is for sale to investors. Dan Carlucci of William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford expects them to fetch about $540,000. "Most of the residents work at Norwalk Hospital next door, and pay an average of $750 a month rent," he said.
"We are seeing a lot of activity," he said, "because banks are lending again. Secondly, people have had time to digest the reality of loss. It's difficult to have paid $200,000 and come away with $150,000." Older buildings, he pointed out, those that were converted from rental apartments to condominiums during the boom, have higher common charges because the utilities are included. "That drives the price down and for an investor with cash it's a good deal," Mr. Carlucci said. But, he said, "banks look at common charges, not operating expenses, and demand a 20 percent down payment."
"For a home buyer with 20 percent, it makes more sense to pay 10 percent on a much better unit or a house."
The dwindling supply of condominiums and the attendant rise in prices, estimated by brokers at an annual 5 to 10 percent, depending on age, quality and location, has sparked new construction for the first time in years. Christopher di Martino, head of Executive Land Developing of Pleasantville, N.Y., will begin work this winter on Quarry Close Farm, a 12-unit complex in three buildings opposite Byram Park in Greenwich, expected to open next summer.
Uva Construction Company in Stamford sold out the first phase of two-bedroom units at River Turn, for sale since April of this year and priced at $279,000 and $295,000. A second phase of the 77-unit complex on Turn of River Road will be priced somewhat higher, said Richard Uva, the company president. These are just two examples of a growing number of new projects spread through the county.
While most of the older high-rise buildings are filled and some, like Fountain Terrace in Stamford, are undergoing renovations, the turnover is heavy and expected to increase. Sales prices in such buildings are being influenced by policies of Fannie Mae (the new name for what had been the Federal National Mortgage Association), which favors having investor-owners, rather than renters in such buildings. Because of this preference, Fannie Mae will not accept mortgage loans that have been issued by banks to purchasers in complexes that exceed the 40-60 percent ratio of rental to owner-occupied units unless the down payment is 25 percent.
Consequently, "resident owners who bought for $90,000 are selling for $60,000," Mr. Carlucci said. "They don't like living with tenants. Tenants tend to leave fast food wrappers in the lobby."

In Low-Cost Housing, the Key Is Selling Fast

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
BUILDING moderately priced houses for mostly first-time buyers may not be as lucrative as targeting a higher-income market. But builders say the payoff comes in generating faster sales, thus greatly lowering carrying costs.
When houses sell for $156,600 or less the market is spurred by mortgages offered at below-market interest rates by the State of New York Mortgage Agency, known as Sonyma, to buyers who qualify under the agency's income ceilings. 
 Richard and Larry Rush, the principals of Rush Properties in Great Neck, for example, have started sales at Stratford Farms, a development of 40 town houses to rise on 3.3 acres on Jerusalem Avenue in Uniondale. The property had been a small farm.
Prices range from $123,990 to $149,990 for two- and three-bedroom town houses, all of which are 1,225 square feet in size. The architect is Martin A. Passante of Hauppauge. "We want to sell out fast and so we are being aggressive on our pricing to move the product," said Steven Krieger of Cedarhurst, who is acting as a consultant to the Rush brothers.
The developers are applying for Sonyma's Construction Incentive Program. The program offers first-time buyers of new houses 30-year mortgages requiring no down payments, with initial interest rates that are now 5.25 percent. Rates rise to 7.25 percent in the fifth year of the loan and remain at that amount for the remaining 26 years. Buyers must pay 1.5 points at closing. A point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount.
In the Stratford Farm development, for example, a buyer borrowing 100 percent of the $123,990 purchase price would pay $684.42 monthly in mortgage payments. Monthly taxes are $300 and common charges are $76.69, bringing the total monthly payment to $1,061.11.
If no more than 30 percent of income can go to payments on a house, as most banks require, a family would need an annual income of about $42,500 to qualify.
"We expect to be sold out by the end of the year," Larry Rush said.
Even if a builder is not enrolled in the Construction Incentive Program, Sonyma currently offers a mortgage interest rate of 7.5 percent with a 3 percent down payment and a payment of 2 points.
In all areas except those considered economically depressed, where guidelines are more liberal, annual income of buyers cannot exceed $65,070 for two persons or $74,830 for a four-person household. House prices cannot exceed $156,600.
Sonyma's low-interest-rate programs are often criticized as being unrealistic because of the $156,600 cap on house prices in most areas. But as Stratford Farms demonstrates, some new housing even falls within that guideline in Nassau County, and in Suffolk County several builders are offering new housing below that limit.
Saddle Ridge Properties of Ridge has been selling detached houses in Ridge on half-acre lots at prices that start at $149,990 for a 3-bedroom, 2-bath 1,400-square-foot ranch with a basement and a one-car garage. Since sales began 18 months ago all but one of the 37 houses in the development have been sold, said Gloria Ivezaj, executive director of Saddle Ridge Properties. She added that 96 percent of the purchasers had been first-time buyers.
Crystal Bay Homes in Centereach builds houses throughout central Suffolk at prices that start at $139,900 for a 3-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot ranch on a slab. A 3-bedroom, 1,300 square-foot high ranch with an 800-square-foot unfinished lower level sells for $147,900, as does a 2-bedroom, 900-square-foot Cape Cod with an unfinished 800-square-foot upper level. A three-bedroom colonial with a basement and 1,490 square feet sells for $151,000.
Lots, which are either in small subdivisions or on scattered sites, vary in size from a third of an acre to an acre.
UNDER the Construction Incentive Program, of which Crystal Bay Homes is a member, the purchaser of the $151,000 colonial would pay $1,375 monthly on a $151,000 mortgage, including $400 for taxes, said Daniel Hurney, the builder. A family with a $49,000 annual income would be able to qualify, he said.
Another builder active in that price range is the Toussie Group of Companies, which has its offices in the Manhattan Beach section of Brooklyn.
"We build houses ranging in price from $99,000 to $300,000, from the Nassau border to Exit 66 of the Long Island Expressway," said Isaac Toussie, vice president of the company, which builds about 300 houses a year on Long Island and Staten Island. Lot sizes range from a quarter of an acre to 1.25 acres, he said. Buyers with an annual income of $38,000 can qualify for the $99,000 ranch, which has 3 bedrooms and 1,100 square feet of space, Mr. Toussie said.
In a Manorville subdivision called Northmore Woods, Patmar Development of Manorville is building 30 houses on one-acre lots. Although prices range up to $250,000, a 3-bedroom ranch, with a basement and a one-car garage, is available for $150,000, said Mark M. Salomon, the president of the company. Of the 30 houses, 21 are sold.
The availability of low-cost financing often comes as a surprise to buyers like Christine and Brian McDonald, who will be closing this month on a $156,000, 3-bedroom colonial that they are purchasing from Crystal Bay Homes. They and their two children are currently renting a one-bedroom apartment in Middle Island for which they pay $750 a month in rent. The new house under construction in Centereach on a half-acre lot will cost them $1,100 monthly, Mrs. McDonald said.
"We thought we couldn't afford a brand-new house, but we didn't know about the Sonyma loan," she said. "But when we heard about the interest rate, we realized, 'Yes we can.' "
Also available to Sonyma borrowers is housing sponsored by the Long Island Housing Partnership of Hauppauge and other nonprofit groups, which is sold at below-market prices because of state and Federal grants that provide a $25,000 subsidy to each buyer. Income limits vary according to location and project.
Upcoming Housing Partnership projects, for which builders have applied for grants, include a 50-unit condominium town-house-style development called Victorian Homes at Medford, which Scro & Scro Development of Melville will build on an 11.39-acre site. There will be 25 two-story attached and semi-attached buildings each with two two-bedroom apartments.
New York State grants of $25,000 will be used to reduce the price of each 1,175-square-foot unit to $74,990, said David Scro, president of the development company. Sonyma mortgages will be available. The most a family of four can earn is $47,300.
Although most units receiving grants are initially allocated to eligible buyers through a lottery, those left over for various reasons -- chiefly because original applicants don't qualify for mortgages -- are sold conventionally on a first-come, first-served basis.
For example, the Park Ridge Organization of Ronkonkoma still has 11 houses available in a development in Riverside called Brookside Estates. The 3-bedroom, 1,700-square-foot colonials each on a half-acre lot are priced at $83,990 because of the availability of a $25,000 New York State grant to each buyer. With a Sonyma mortgage, the total monthly mortgage payment, including $200 for taxes, would be $900, said Charles Mancini, vice president of Park Ridge. A family of four can earn no more than $50,720.
Favorable mortgage rates and down payments are also available for low- and moderate-income borrowers from the Federal Housing Administration and from banks that resell loans to the Federal National Mortgage Agency, known as Fannie Mae. Mortgages with down payments as low as 3 percent are available.
Fleet Bank is providing down payment assistance loans of up to $7,500 to first-time buyers. The interest rate is the same as the mortgage interest. The down payment loan may be repaid over a maximum of 15 years.
For families making less than $66,500 a year, the EAB bank offers mortgages with interest rates .25 percent lower than the prevailing rate. The loans require a 3 percent down payment.
And Roosevelt Savings Bank of Garden City also has loan incentives for moderate-income buyers. It allows borrowers to spend up to 33 percent of income on mortgage debt instead of the standard 28 to 30 percent. It also waives its $550 attorney fee if buyers fill out mortgage applications over the phone.

HEADLINE: Where Pollution Hampers New Uses for Old Buildings

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
THEY used to make hats in Danbury, so many hats that it was nicknamed the Hat City. They used mercury to make the hats. Today, the hat makers are gone but the mercury remains, scaring away investors from redeveloping the properties where the hats were made.
Danbury's former hat factories are among approximately 500 unused industrial properties throughout Connecticut that have been termed brown fields. These properties are contaminated with pollutants not badly enough to be declared Superfund sites and qualify for emergency clean-up funding, but sufficiently to discourage any banks from loaning money to rebuild on them. 
 "They're wastelands," said Dennis Elpern, Danbury's director of planning. One of the properties, the former Mallory hat factory, is a half-acre parcel on Rose Street. The abandoned building, which is said to have served as a drug den and squatters' camp until it was badly damaged by arson, was condemned, and torn down. Mr. Elpern remembers how the factory used to pour pollution into the Still River. "You could tell the color dye they were using for the hats that day by the color of the river," he said. Today, the soil on the empty land is contaminated with mercury and oil that may still be leaching into the stream. Danbury has foreclosed on the property for back taxes, and hopes to add it to its development program. Five years ago, that would have been far more difficult than now.
For Connecticut, brown fields present a serious hurdle to economic development in the old mill towns along rivers, and in cities and villages near inlets and harbors along Long Island Sound.
The communities have lost taxes and jobs as developers by-passed them in favor of cleaner properties that had never been used for industrial purposes. But in a few years, local and state economic development officials have made progress through creative development programs and laws to help reclaim the commercial value of brown-field properties. New Federal initiatives sponsored by two of the state's congressmen are expected to add to the momentum toward a solution.
Tax legislation sponsored by Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican of Stamford, and Representative James Maloney, a Democrat of Danbury, and signed by President Clinton in August, allows brown-field developers to write off all their clean-up costs in the year they are incurred, rather than over 20 to 40 years as the tax code previously provided.
The legislation will cost an estimated $1.5 billion nationwide in lost tax revenue, but the two congressmen expect that by making the redevelopment of brown fields more profitable, it will generate more than that amount in increased revenues through business and job growth. It may also add local tax revenues in older industrial cities, which in Connecticut have had the greatest difficulty recovering from military industry cutbacks.
Besides its effect on economic development, brown fields are also an environmental issue. Cleaning up the pollutants that contaminate them is a benefit as much as is job growth or expanding local tax bases. "If you make an investment in one of these properties, you can make a big difference in the quality of the environment, and to a community's finances," observed Mr. Maloney.
One reason that economic development officials in Connecticut have been as creative as they have is that the state's environmental laws are among the strictest in the nation. These regulations require the owners to bear the expense of removing pollution from their properties, and in most cases they bear that liability even if previous owners contaminated the properties long ago. Banks that hold mortgages on those properties may even find themselves financially responsible for cleaning them up. Another difficulty is that state and Federal environmental laws were poorly designed to address brown fields. Usually the laws and regulations required far more environmental remediation than some think is necessary to reuse brown-field properties for commercial or industrial purposes.
Higher clean-up costs give many properties a negative value. A former factory property in Norwalk would be worth about $200,000 if it were available for development, but removing mercury in the soil and asbestos in the buildings is estimated at $900,000, according to Edward Musante, executive director of the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency.
Often, brown-field properties are abandoned by their owners, who cannot afford to pay for their restoration. The banks that hold their mortgages and the cities owed their taxes refuse to foreclose for fear they will become responsible for cleaning them up.
The state has created a revolving loan fund to help pay for assessing the clean-up needs, said Kip Bergstrom, the economic development director in Stamford. To build up the fund, 20 percent of the local property taxes from redeveloped brown-field properties is paid into it. "We think that will help move some sites that have been sitting in limbo," Mr. Bergstrom said.
Interest in redeveloping brown-field properties in Connecticut grew when the state's economic recovery began about five years ago, allowing local officials to turn their attention to the nagging problem. They discovered that their greatest stumbling block was that little was known about either the extent or type of contamination at most brown-field properties, or how much their remedial clean-up costs would be.
Two of the earliest efforts were in Waterbury and Bridgeport. In both cities today, the fruits of those labors are clearly evident. A new shopping mall has opened on the site of a former brass factory in Waterbury, and construction of a minor-league baseball stadium has begun in Bridgeport where a valve factory once stood.
There are many others. The redevelopment of an old brass rolling mill in Thomaston is underway, part of a concentrated, cooperative brown-field program of communities along the Naugatuck River.
Officials in Derby hope to reclaim that city's waterfront by cleaning up O'Sullivan's Island, a contaminated peninsula at the confluence of the Naugatuck and Housatonic rivers.
Mr. Maloney said that as a state senator, he had helped Waterbury secure a $30 million grant through state bonding in 1994. Two-thirds of those funds were used to level and clean up the 100-acre Scovill Brass property along Interstate 84, which had been used as a brass mill since the early years of the Industrial Revolution and was contaminated with asbestos, metals and lead paint. "You had a kind of toxic cocktail," he said.
The property is now the home of Brass Mill Center, a shopping mall, creating hundreds of jobs for the Waterbury economy and adding $160 million to the city's grand list of taxable properties. "It's recognized as the major urban development in Waterbury since the Second World War," Mr. Maloney said.
That project got Mr. Maloney interested in brown-field redevelopment, but he said he didn't realize the extent of the problem until he began his campaign for Congress last year. He discovered that nearly a third of the state's identified brown-field properties are in the Naugatuck Valley between Torrington and the river's confluence with the Housatonic.
Redevelopment officials from those cities who met with him begged for his help, he said. They had already banded together regionally, aided by a coalition of church groups, unions and others who were interested in reducing unemployment and stimulating economic growth in their communities.
Jay Klemendt, executive director of the coalition, the Naugatuck Valley Project, said the Valley Regional Planning Agency realized it needed to take a united regional approach toward brown fields after failing in 1995 to get a Federal grant for property contamination assessment.
It required abandoning the traditional approach of Connecticut municipalities to work alone and compete with each other. The new approach worked, and the agency won a $90,000 grant from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency last year. The grant will be used to complete an inventory of brown-field properties in the region and begin assessing their clean-up needs and costs. "If we're going to attract resources to our part of Connecticut, we're going to have to work together," Mr. Klemendt said.
Michael Freimuth, director of planning and economic development in Bridgeport, said his city knew since the 1980's that it had to address its brown-field problem. "In a city where 98 percent of the land is developed, you have to reuse the old," he said. In 1994, Bridgeport acquired a $200,000 Federal EPA grant to support one of two national pilot programs on brown-field recovery. Besides identifying the brown-field properties and assessing them, Mr. Freimuth said the city decided policy changes were also necessary to allow their redevelopment to proceed faster and less expensively.
Bridgeport was joined by other cities in a lobbying drive aimed at revising cumbersome state laws and regulations. He noted that the cities did not ask that environmental standards be lowered, just that they set different criteria for different land uses. Industrial or commercial land need not meet the same standards as land for residential development, he said.
Danbury hopes to return the Mallory property to its tax rolls soon as well. It received a $45,000 E. P. A. grant to determine exactly how much pollution there is and if there are other ways to address it besides excavation, which could further pollute the river. Jack Kozuchowski, director of environmental and occupational health services, said they might use bacteria or plants that absorb pollutants and neutralize them. Investors have been inquiring about the property. "It's going to work," he said.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Fight the March Of Big Retailers

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
LIKE Davids fending off advancing giants, many small merchandisers are waging a battle for survival. Mom-and-pop businesses, in Westchester and the rest of the United States, are digging in their heels despite the onslaught of mammoth retailers.
"Sometimes I feel as though we're on the verge of extinction; other times I know we can win," said Jack Nicolais, a 47-year-old pharmacist and owner of Saxon Chemists who ekes out a living in the shadow of a busy CVS in White Plains. 
 "I work hard," Mr. Nicolais said. "I'm honest as the day is long, yet somehow the big guys keep getting bigger."
Statistics indicate that, in fact, the big-box merchandisers -- a phenomenon of the last decade -- are gaining ground. In Westchester, superstores occupied 10 percent of the retail market last year, according to the County Planning Department.
While some small merchandisers are surviving, others have been unable to hold out in the face of mounting competition.
In Yonkers, Herbert Lockwood recently shuttered his building-supply and home center, a fixture in the region for 70 years. Nearing retirement, the 60-year-old Mr. Lockwood said he was not willing to risk his life's savings to compete with the Home Depot, which opened in nearby New Rochelle a year ago. Another Home Depot is to open next year in Yonkers.
"The little guys made our country what it is," a weary Mr. Lockwood said outside his empty lumberyard. "For a long time, we were the nation's backbone. Now some of us are being pushed aside."
In addition to the Home Depot in New Rochelle, three other big-box retailers had moved into the county by last year: Sam's Club in Elmsford, BJ's Wholesale Club in Yorktown and Price Club (now known as Costco Wholesale) in New Rochelle, according to the Planning Department. Another Home Depot is opening in Cortlandt on Oct. 30.
"Small businesses shouldn't just drop off the face of the earth," Mr. Nicolais said. "There has got to be room for all of us."
North of the main thoroughfare in White Plains, in a shopping center that serves many thriving neighborhoods, Glenn Jacobi, the owner of Kadish Pharmacy, is similarly determined to be what he calls "my own man." Next door to his pharmacy, a Stop & Shop is expanding, adding a prescription department and threatening the small businessman's livelihood. The chain offered jobs to the druggist and his employees, but for his part, Mr. Jacobi refused.
"They offered me the position of chief pharmacist," Mr. Jacobi, 43, said. "But I've gone that route before. I've spent 10 years with the chains, and now I want to make it on my own."
Armed with a stack of petitions from his customers -- who are grateful for the personal service the pharmacist offers, the credit he extends when they need it and the knowledge that he will drive to the store to fill a prescription even in a blizzard -- Mr. Jacobi decided not to sell out.
"The easiest thing would be to take the money and go work for the competition," he said. "The alternative is that I have a wall of I.O.U.'s, and sometimes I get beat. But my customers are like family to me, and I'm not going to let them down."
Although news of a big-box retailer's arrival often engenders fear of unfair competition, traffic jams and other ills, and sometimes sets off zoning battles, superstores are welcomed in many quarters.
Such a dichotomy can be seen in Port Chester, where the Home Depot's proposal to build a 101,400-square-foot retail outlet and an 18,000-square-foot outdoor garden center has sparked a bitter contest between two municipalities.
While Port Chester's Mayor, Christine Korff, said her village would be happy for the added business and increased tax revenues that the superstore would bring to the struggling village, nearby Rye fears overburdening its residential streets with traffic.
In New Rochelle, Mayor Timothy C. Idoni could not be more pleased with two superstores in his midst and $2.5 million a year in sales-tax revenues from them -- which is the equivalent of an 8 percent property tax increase, he said.
The successes of Costco Wholesale and the Home Depot have also spurred renewed interest in other commercial real estate in New Rochelle. In particular, the New Rochelle Mall, which closed in 1995 after Macy's left, is planning to open once again with new tenants.
Big-box retailers can indeed prove to be a boon to municipalities, said Katrina Blauvelt, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based Home Depot. The company offered 275 jobs to residents in New Rochelle, hiring "master plumbers, do-it-yourselfers, second-career workers and employees from all walks of life and age groups," she said.
"As people get to know us, they realize we can be a real asset," she added.
The chain had 512 retail outlets nationwide at the end of 1996, and projections are that there will be 623 by December. Budd Bugatch, a senior researcher at Raymond Jones & Associates, business analysts in St. Petersburg, Fla., called it "the best retailer in the world."
Still, merchandisers like R. G. Brewer in Mamaroneck say they can offer shoppers something better. The hardware store, which has been in business since 1879, has carved a niche for itself over the years and thereby withstood the vicissitudes of a fickle market, Anthony Lividini, the general manager, said.
"Our customers may go away for a while, but they come back," said Mr. Lividini, whose store specializes in fine woods and marine supplies.
In White Plains, Mr. Jacobi said service was the key to his success. "That's what I have in my slingshot," he said. "That's my ammunition.
"There's a Revco up the street, so if my customers thought a chain was better, they would have left by now. My wife and I know everyone's name. It's the old-fashioned touch that works."
Many hardware stores, pharmacies and other small concerns have joined cooperatives to maximize their purchasing power. In Chicago, the Truserve Corporation, the parent company of True Value and Servistar Stores, has 10,000 members.
"In the late 1980's and early 1990's, as the big-box stores marched up the East Coast and across the country, there was a significant fallout among the weaker independent hardware stores and home centers," said Paul E. Pentz, president and chief operating officer for Truserve. "Now they're able to fight back."
Mr. Nicolais, chairman of the board of directors of the Westchester and Rockland Society of Pharmacies, said there was a net loss of 400 pharmacies in the state last year because of competition from the chains.
He has also joined a purchasing cooperative, which has enabled him to match prices with CVS.
Dr. Kenneth Stone, an economics professor at Iowa State University and an expert on the impact of superstores on small businesses, said there are a "fair number of success stories" out there.
"I tell retailers not to go head to head with the competition, because they'll seldom win at that game," Dr. Stone said. "They have to learn to do it better, differently."
But not all economists are optimistic.
"The reality is that these big stores are called category killers for a reason," said Al Norman, nicknamed "the guru of the anti-Wal-Mart movement" by "60 Minutes," the television news magazine. "Their culture is to decimate the competition. The best way to fight them is to keep them out to begin with -- to stop them at the pass."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
An Ancient Tragedy Told as a More Recent One

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
IN stunning prologue to "The Darker Face of the Earth," a celebratory rush of resplendent theatrical effects spills over the stage of the Crossroads Theater Company: choral chants, grand gesture, masks and movement everywhere. Slaves and conspirators, among a company of 20 are momentarily conjoined in an invocation of life. The ritual ends in a moment of exultation. A newborn child is lifted high, as if favored by the gods.
What a way to set the stage for a tragedy. Destiny's chosen child is a universal symbol of mythic transport from an outcast in exile at Colonus to the leader of an insurrection in antebellum South Carolina. Oedipus, a sacrificial victim and a symbolic savior through suffering, is morphed into Augustus, a slave born of a white mother and a black father. He, too, is a savior, honored for freeing the other slaves. 
 True to a classical vision of inevitability -- preordained freedom for all black people -- Rita Dove, who was the poet laureate of the United States from 1993 to 1995, has dreamed up one striking parallel to Greek drama for her first full-length play.
Where she means to be prophetic, Ms. Dove is working on the side of dramatic logic and theatrical tension. But the poet-playwright is not merely retelling a classic tale with both primordial and psychological connections; she is also overreaching to the other side of credulity with analogies between the ancient rites of sacrifice and America's racial divide.
Although Ms. Dove has said and written much about clarity and economy of phrase, the play (which has been published by Story Line Press of Brownsville, Ore., twice, in 1994 and last year with an altered ending) is murky and long-winded. The Crossroads production, staged last year by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, is more notable for theatrical embellishment, like the viscerally exciting prologue and striking performances, than for poetic language. The play is mightily served by the theatricality of Ricardo Khan's direction, Dianne McIntyre's choreography and Richard L. Hay's set design, which takes in the cotton fields, the slave cabins and the big plantation house, not to mention dream sequences.
Momentum is more hindered than helped by the lamentations of a Greek-style chorus wailing ("There's a curse on the land," "Lord help us all," "Mercy, mercy"). Ceaselessly reminding the audience that "the net draws closer," "the net draws tighter," the imposing Trazana Beverley, hunched over and twisted as Scylla, is a conjure woman and doomsayer for the ages. Ramon Moses touches nobility as the demented slave Hector, catcher of snakes and Augustus's father, even when the actor is given lines like "What are you doing in my swamp?"
With a rare touch of levity, Ezra Knight as the adult Augustus observes, "The Greeks were a bit too predictable." Although he is made to intone "Sometimes I feel like a motherless child," Mr. Knight is a force to behold.
Amalia (Augustus's mother, owner and lover) is no warmhearted Jocasta type, but a "she-fox" who "grows eviler year for year." In the role, Felicity La Fortune travels an enlightened, painful journey of pre-feminist rage and confusion, from retaliatory wife of a philandering husband (David Adkins as Louis, the plantation owner) to haughty slave owner to helpless, doomed woman, out of control.
Ms. Dove has not grasped the vital signs of classical drama, but how she has reached. And how Crossroads has delivered something really big.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Thinking Small, but Acting Globally

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
WITH small-company stocks rallying in the United States, can the rest of the world be far behind?
"It's just a matter of time before the fundamentals assert themselves," said David Herro, manager of the $70 million Oakmark International Small Cap fund. The bottom lines of many small companies overseas are strong, he said, but they have gone largely unnoticed. Conditions in Europe, meanwhile, are particularly ripe for the kind of economy that benefits small, domestic-oriented companies and encourages investors to buy them. 
 "International small cap is probably one of the most attractive and oversold areas of the global equity universe," he said.
Lately, however, nearly all the market's vogues and vagaries have hurt small foreign companies. The current fascination with index funds, for example, benefits mostly large corporations, while the United States productivity revolution has left much of the rest of the world in the dust. The only foreign companies to profit from a strong American dollar have been exporters -- usually big companies. And a currency calamity in Southeast Asia is hurting the economies of that region -- punishing small companies the most because their business is mostly domestic.
A result has been fire-sale prices among the stocks of small foreign companies -- and of the mutual funds that invest in them. The data base of Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in Chicago, includes 18 foreign-only funds whose median market capitalization is below $1 billion. Their average gain in the first nine months of the year was a lackluster 8.5 percent, or considerably short of the 10.4 percent gain in the most common international benchmark, Morgan Stanley Capital International's EAFE index, a measure of mostly large companies in Europe, Australia and the Far East.
"It's been quite hard for international funds over all to do well," said Iain Clark, chief investment officer of Seligman Henderson in London. He added, however, that he expected foreign stock markets to pick up in coming months, particularly in Europe.
"Two things are happening," he said. "We're getting quite a solid economic recovery now, and that's generally not a bad period for small caps. Second, we're getting quite good earnings growth in Continental Europe, as we see companies there taking a closer interest in what they're delivering to shareholders."
Corporate restructuring fueled explosive growth in United States stocks early in this decade, and the same kind of revamping is beginning to spread from Britain onto the Continent, said Simon Rudolph, manager of the Templeton Foreign Smaller Companies fund, one of the few international small-company funds to outperform the EAFE this year. And a flurry of recent billion-dollar deals and hostile takeover bids -- perhaps the most flamboyant being a $9 billion hostile bid by Generali, the Italian insurer, for AGF of France -- only accelerate the European push toward improved efficiency and competitiveness.
"Restructuring is one of the very good reasons why Europe is looking more attractive," Mr. Randolph said. His fund has 55 percent of its $108.3 million of assets there and only 15 percent in Asia, mostly in Hong Kong.
In picking a fund that invests in foreign stocks, the ability of its managers to pick the right spots geographically is probably more important than any other consideration, said Lewis J. Altfest, principal of the financial planning firm bearing his name in Manhattan.
"There are great diversities abroad," he said. "If you've invested in Europe, you've been a winner. If you've invested in Asia, which was known as the area of guaranteed growth, that has been a major disappointment."
Economic problems have been festering throughout Asia, from recession-scarred Japan to Malaysia and Thailand, which have seen their currencies devalued.
"In Southeast Asia, economic growth is probably 5 percent or 6 percent, which is much stronger than growth in any of the developed markets but still slower than it used to be," noted Leila B. Heckman, head of global asset allocation for Smith Barney. "And they're raising interest rates to defend their economies, and that's a drag on the stock market."
Small companies usually command higher prices than large ones, relative to their earnings, because of greater growth potential. In the United States, the ratio of current prices to forecast 1998 earnings is 19.5 for small companies and 17.7 for big ones, according to Smith Barney, reflecting in part the high number of small high-technology companies on which investors have pinned hopes for outstanding growth.
Overseas, however, the roles are often reversed. In Brazil, the ratio is 12.7 for big corporations and 7.5 for small ones, according to Smith Barney. In the Netherlands, it is 17.6 for big companies and 13.7 for small. China has the most extreme disparity, with big-cap companies selling at 71.4 times prospective earnings, compared with 19.6 for small caps.
Mr. Herro, of the Oakmark fund, says many of his holdings trade at a fraction of the prices of bigger companies, especially those based in the United States.
He cited the example of Enix, a Japanese maker of computer games. "It sells at five times cash flow," he said. "Among larger-cap companies, whether in Japan or elsewhere, 10 or 20 times is usual."
Lambert & Fenchurch, a small British insurance broker, trades at five times this year's forecast earnings. "A comparable big-cap United States insurance broker would trade at close to 20 times earnings," he said.
Fyffes, an Irish vendor of bananas, sells for nine times this year's earnings, Mr. Herro said. By contrast, Dole Food's multiple is 17 and Chiquita Brands' is 18. "And Fyffes is a much better company," he asserted. "It's much safer financially and has a management that's more value-adding than these bigger names."
Mr. Clark of Seligman Henderson cited the example of Tarkett, a German maker of floor coverings. The company recently absorbed the floor-covering business of a French rival, making the combined concern "a genuine global competitor to Armstrong," the United States leader in this industry, he said. The Seligman Henderson Global Smaller Companies fund, which invests in the United States as well as abroad, owns shares of the company.
"We think they can achieve cost savings amounting to 50 percent of operating profits over the next two or three years," he said. "That should produce earnings-per-share growth of 25 percent-plus in the same period." Tarkett's price-to-earnings ratio, however, is only 13 times this year's expected earnings.
THE bargains in international small-cap stocks only brighten their fundamental allure for American investors: their value in diversifying an equity portfolio. Joseph Leung, manager of the Barr Rosenberg International Small Capitalization fund, said the United States stock market and the international small-cap market have had a low correlation over the last five years -- meaning that they have not tended to move in tandem. Their correlation was 0.22; by contrast, markets with the maximum correlation, 1.0, move in lockstep.
Barr Rosenberg, a pioneer of the school of investing known as modern portfolio theory, demonstrated that international small caps, unlike domestic ones, reduce risk because of this low correlation, as well as enhance returns for portfolios that are mostly invested in large United States stocks, said Dick Saalfeld, president of Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds.
"You can invest one-third of your equity assets in United States small caps and get the benefit of increased return," he said, "But you'll also pick up incremental risk. Only with international small caps do you get the double benefit of reducing the risk and increasing the return."
Ronald W. Roge, a financial adviser in Bohemia, N.Y., says he recommends that investors put one-third of their equity capital into foreign stocks. He uses the Tweedy, Browne Global Value fund and the Sogen International fund, both of which own American as well as foreign stocks.
Mr. Roge acknowledged that international small-cap investments could provide useful diversification. But among mutual funds that use a foreign-only small-cap strategy, he said, "we haven't found anything that's got an outstanding record long term."

Outside the United States, small-capitalization stocks are generally selling for lower multiples of price to earnings than their larger brethren. The multiples are higher in the United States because many of the small-cap stocks here are high-technology companies, where explosive growth is often expected.

HEADLINE: 2 Candidates, Different Plans

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
IN most states, voters consider a politician's position on education, taxes or the economy when they go to the polls. But not in New Jersey this year. According to recent polls, voters have auto insurance on their minds.
While both of the two leading candidates for governor have promised to help motorists agonizing over their high premiums, their approaches are miles apart. 
 Governor Whitman, a Republican, wants to lower premiums by limiting the number of lawsuits that can be filed after an accident, and by reducing legal fees and excessive medical bills -- some of the main causes of the state's high rates.
Under Mrs. Whitman's proposal, drivers could choose between several plans that would allow them to save between 5 percent and 25 percent of their premiums. The most savings would go to those motorists who gave up their right to sue for pain and suffering. Such damages exist over and above the cost of medical bills and lost wages, which would be covered.
The Governor's Democratic rival, State Senator James E. McGreevey, who is also Mayor of Woodbridge, says that as governor, he would order insurance companies to reduce rates for all drivers by 10 percent. Unlike Mrs. Whitman, Mr. McGreevey says that all drivers would get lower rates without giving up their rights to sue.
Mr. McGreevey says that the across-the-board rate cut would force insurance companies to crack down on fraud, which insurance regulators estimate could be inflating premiums by as much as 20 percent. But several experts who have reviewed Mr. McGreevey's proposed rate reduction say that it could be struck down by the courts if the insurance companies were able to prove that it hurt their ability to earn a fair profit.
Mrs. Whitman's plan to limit lawsuits is not without its own problem: It is unclear whether it could ever become law. Her proposal faces fierce opposition from the state's trial lawyers, who have widespread support among state legislators, many of whom are lawyers themselves.
Mrs. Whitman offered a similar proposal early this year, but only months later had to put the plan on hold. She could not find enough support for it from legislative leaders, even though her own party controls both houses of the Legislature.
Mr. McGreevey has attacked Mrs. Whitman's record on auto insurance during her first term, saying that she seems to be too close to insurance companies, and has been too easy on them as a regulator. Regulators approved 11 rate increases for 11 insurers , on top of the automatic annual rate increases of at least 3 percent that all insurers received in the first three years of her term.
Mr. McGreevey wants voters to elect the state insurance commissioner, rather than having the top regulator appointed by the Governor. He says an elected commissioner would help keep state regulators independent from insurers and responsive to consumers.
To fight fraud, Mr. McGreevey would add a special criminal prosecutor's office to the Department of Banking and Insurance. And, he also wants to permanently revoke the state licenses of doctors, chiropractors, lawyers and body shops who commit fraud.
Experts on auto insurance often say that Michigan has one of the country's best auto insurance systems. Mrs. Whitman has incorporated part of Michigan's law into her plan.
Michigan, like New Jersey, has a no-fault insurance system, which allows accident victims to get reimbursed automatically for medical bills without filing a lawsuit or proving who was at fault. Unlike New Jersey, Michigan has put strict limits on lawsuits so that only the most seriously injured can sue for pain and suffering damages.
In Michigan, a lawsuit can be filed to recover those intangible damages only in cases of death or serious injury. And, even though a Michigan auto insurance policy provides more medical coverage than a policy in New Jersey, Michigan drivers now pay $645 on average to insure each vehicle -- $368 less than motorists in New Jersey.
Mrs. Whitman has put similar lawsuit restrictions in her plan. For example, those drivers who wish to save 10 percent on their current rates would be subject to the limits similar to Michigan's.
Trial lawyers also oppose this portion of the Governor's plan, which makes it unclear if it could ever become law.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CONEY ISLAND;
Just How Does the Killer Klown Get Through the Winter?

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
On a chilly Columbus Day, Coney Island is a shadow of its summer self. Rubbish piles up on sidewalks and streets. Most stands and stores are shuttered, and scream-inducing rides are shut down. A lone couple rides the carousel on Surf Avenue; on the boardwalk, one child bounces on a caterpillar ride.
The desolation, the emptiness, prompts a question (or three): Whither two-foot-tall Gloria, billed as the world's smallest adult? Where is Koko the Killer Klown? And how is Zenobia, the Bearded Lady, paying her bills? 
 Just as California has its strawberry pickers and Colorado its ski instructors, Coney Island has its seasonal workers, from the sideshow attractions to the army of laborers who sell tickets and operate rides.
The ways they pass the winter are as varied as their job descriptions, and often determined by their place in the employment hierarchy. Owners vacation, lounge in Miami, travel to amusement park conventions around the country and refurbish their rides. Their workers, in contrast, may return to homes in Caribbean islands or Coney Island. Some will collect unemployment, others find odd jobs. Some squirrel away their summer pay, often minimum wage, and live off it the rest of the year, and in winter take a nominal vacation. "I just take it easy, hang out at home," said Louise Bennett, 70, who has sold tickets and trinkets at the Eldorado arcade for 30 years.
The performers at Sideshows-by-the Seashore have their own ways of making do in their dry season. Koko the Killer Klown, who chose not to reveal his real name, said he has a 1-month-old baby to help care for, and a new job with a Subway sandwich shop on Coney Island. As a Subway Man, clad in a giant sandwich costume, he will travel to schools to lecture children about nutrition.
The Bearded Lady, whose real name is Jennifer Miller, said she would rehearse and raise money for her one-ring Circus Amok, which performs occasionally in parks in the summer. But to earn money, she said, she needed freelance gigs, and so far, this year has been dry.
If no work surfaced before her money ran out, she said, she might resort to bike messenger work. She said, however, that her quest for off-season work was complicated by a form of discrimination: she said she had been rejected for jobs, including a stilt-walking stint just last week, because of her beard.
Frank Hartman, inside talker and master of ceremonies, whose talents include fire-eating and sword-swallowing, said he tried to survive on bookings for private events. If not, he said, he would rely on "good old-fashioned standbys": welding, cooking and unemployment compensation. "You do what you got to do to pay the bills," Mr. Hartman, 26, said, adding that he missed the sideshow desperately in the off season.
Then there is Brendan Goldblatt, who in winter and summer is the company face, but for different companies. In winter, he is a greeter for Sprint PCS in the Flatiron Building in Manhattan, bidding customers hello and directing them to the appropriate customer service representative. In summer, he is the outside talker at Sideshows-by-the Seashore, exhorting passing ladies and gentlemen to pay to view the "congress of oddities" on display inside.
Mr. Goldblatt, 19, seemed to be handling the transition with aplomb. "Instead of wearing a costume on a stage, I'm in a suit," he said. "And not as many people are screaming at you." AMY WALDMAN

Chart: "LIVES: Off-Season Odyssies"
A sampling of the Coney Island labor force's off-season plans:
 
DENNIS D. VOURDERIS, co-owner, Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park
Will refurbish park's rides, attend amusement park conventions in Cleveland and Florida, and "chill out with the wife and kids, making up for lost time," working 60 to 80 hours a week at season's peak.
 
CLAUDE OLIVER, sweeper at Nathan's Famous on Surf Avenue
Will return home to Trinidad, as he has done for the last three years, then return for the next season. In winter, his hours are cut back and at $5.15 an hour, he said, "it's not worth it" to stay in New York.
 
WINSTON MYERS, manager, Gregory & Paul's Restaurant on Surf Avenue
Will vacation in Jamaica, Florida and Toronto, before returning to Berkeley Business School in Manhattan, where he is studying travel and tourism.
 
JOHN WEST, director of operations, Astroland
With a team of six, will spend next few months trying to put the Cyclone's battered tracks back together,%%??%% then, when the cold drives them indoors, begin taking the trains apart.
 
GLORIA, the two-foot-tall woman
Whereabouts unknown. Her trailer has vanished from the lot at Surf Avenue and West 12th Street. A man who had parked his own trailers (home and office) on the lot, and declined to give his name, said he thought Gloria had hit the road or gone to "Gibtown, " Gibsonton, Fla., unofficial winter quarters for the Eastern carnival set.

HEADLINE: Disinflation, Anyone? Prices of New Cars Are Declining, for a Change

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
CAR and truck prices are falling, for the first time since the nation entered its current period of economic expansion in 1991.
The chief reason: the industry's excess production capacity, with auto makers around the world turning out more vehicles than they can easily sell. 
 The chief beneficiary: the American consumer, who stands to get more car for less money as manufacturers cut suggested prices and offer rebates even on models that were just redesigned.
"We're seeing an outright decline in average new car prices year-to-year," said David Littmann, senior economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit. "In August -- for the first time in the six and a half years of this business cycle expansion -- car prices dropped. And the declines will continue."
Indeed, the Consumer Price Index for September showed that new-car prices fell 0.28 percent from August and were down 0.7 percent, adjusted for seasonal variations, from a year earlier. Mr. Littmann said he expected prices to drop further through next year. The average selling price of a new car has fallen back to about $19,000 after rising above $20,000 this year.
And manufacturers are keeping their suggested list prices flat, or even cutting them. The Ford Motor Company is holding its average prices constant for the 1998 model year. The Chrysler Corporation has reduced car and truck prices by six-tenths of a percent. The General Motors Corporation raised prices by an average of 1.3 percent, its smallest increase in a decade.
But G.M.'s Saturn Corporation unit recently adjusted its 1998 prices and sent refunds of the difference to buyers who had already paid the higher prices. Saturn reduced the price of its SL1 sedan by $300. It raised the prices of its SL2 sedan, SW2 station wagon and SC2 coupe, but added air-conditioning, normally a $950 option, as standard equipment, so that the cars cost less with comparable equipment. About 14,000 people who had paid higher prices for 1998 models received refunds of $300 to $960.
Chevrolet also reduced prices for its 1998 Prizm, which has been completely redesigned and has more standard features. The most basic Prizm sedan now starts at $12,463, down from the initial 1998 pricing of $14,118 and a 1997 price of $13,245.
Even before the recent price adjustments, 1998 prices had held relatively steady compared with 1997.
Honda, which completely redesigned its Accord for 1998, increased the price of four-cylinder models by only $110, or five-tenths of a percent, and reduced prices of the V6 version by $950.
In announcing prices this week, Nissan's luxury division, Infiniti, kept prices of its Q45 luxury sedan and QX4 sport utility at 1997 levels.
Even though 1998 prices are flat or falling, and although the '98 model year began just three weeks ago, some manufacturers are also offering rebates and low-interest financing on the latest models.
Chrysler is offering rebates of $1,500 on the 1998 Dodge and Plymouth Neon and as much as $1,000 on 1998 Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler mini-vans. An alternative to rebates is financing of 1.9 percent on loans as long as 60 months. The Neon program is in effect through Jan. 5; the mini-van incentives expire on Oct. 31. For the Jeep Grand Cherokee, loans of up to 48 months are available with an interest rate of 4.8 percent, through Jan. 5.
Ford is also offering cash rebates or low-interest financing on numerous 1998 models. A rebate of $500 or financing of 2.9 percent to 6.9 percent is available on the Ford Ranger, Ford Escort and Escort ZX2 and Mercury Tracer. The Ranger is all new, and the ZX2 was introduced only last spring.
Ford is paying $750 or providing low-interest financing on the Ford Contour and Taurus and on the Mercury Mystique and Sable. It is offering $1,500 on the Windstar mini-van and $2,000 on the Mercury Villager, for which interest rates as low as 1 percent are available.
"The trend of prices is very clearly downward," Mr. Littman said. "The consumer couldn't ask for a more ideal market."

HEADLINE: Speed Limit and Deaths

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A study of 1996 data by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that higher speed limits caused a substantial increase in traffic fatalities (news article, Oct. 12). The story is not that simple. 
 According to the National Safety Council, traffic fatalities rose 1.9 percent in 1994 and 2.8 percent in 1995. But when speed limits were increased in 1996, the fatality trend dropped to essentially zero growth. This trend is continuing to decline in 1997.
Comparing the first five months of 1997 with the same period in 1996, fatalities increased in two of states reviewed by the insurance institute but declined in nine. The jury is not yet in on the question of speed limits and fatalities.

'87 Crash: The Other News

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Where were you when the lights went out on Wall Street?
Ten years ago today, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 508 points, the worst day in the stock market since the crash of 1929. Or, as The New York Post put it, "WALL ST. BLOODBATH." 
 But the financial news did not completely dominate the day. In fact, there seemed to be no such thing as a slow-news day back then, with much of the excitement coming from the New York criminal-justice system.
No less than four major trials involving homicide or assault were beginning, under way or ending that Monday. The "Subway Vigilante," "Howard Beach," "Westies" and the "Preppie Murder" trials, to give them their tabloid headlines, were all part of the late 1980's traffic jam of news.
Television, movies and the theater provided New Yorkers with some escape by providing alternate versions of New York. That evening, the top-rated Cosby show depicted the Huxtable family as the picture of family devotion in a Brooklyn brownstone.
In the No. 1 movie, "Fatal Attraction," Michael Douglas, as an adulterous Manhattan lawyer, fought off a knife-wielding Glenn Close. On Broadway, Patti Lupone was winning rave reviews in the Cole Porter revival "Anything Goes" as the New York cabaret singer who gets no kick from champagne.
Still, the real-life New York was interesting, too. Billy Martin savored his return, his fifth time at bat, as manager of the Yankees. Mia Farrow was expecting Woody Allen's first child and shopping for baby clothes. And Bernhard Goetz, who shot four young black men he said were about to assault him, was sentenced to six months in jail for weapons possession and promptly told The Associated Press that he would shoot them again if he had to.
Elsewhere, community groups were mobilizing against Donald Trump's proposal (since scaled back and relocated) for a skyscraper complex called Television City on the Upper West Side. "It's so obviously a mistake," said Robert Caro, a West Side resident and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "The Power Broker."
And on the Lower East Side, the principal and teachers at Junior High School 22 were wearing boots, long johns and coats because the school, on top of a major mice and rat infestation, had no heat.
But if this October day was anything, it seemed to be the nexus of several sensational trials. Not only had the Goetz saga come to a close, but the Howard Beach trial was under way. Timothy Grimes, one of three black men said to have been attacked by white youths in Howard Beach, Queens, exploded with obscenities after hostile questioning by a defense lawyer. The three accused white men were later convicted of manslaughter.
And in another Manhattan courtroom, a prosecutor accused eight men of being part of the Westies gang, which "terrorized" Hell's Kitchen with "horrible and ghoulish acts of murder, kidnapping and assault." Seven of the eight were later convicted of racketeering charges.
Meanwhile, the "Preppie Murder" case was about to start. Robert Chambers, a former private school student, was accused of killing Jennifer Levin; he said the death was accidental and had occurred during "rough sex." Mr. Chambers later pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter.
New York sports was at a crossroads, too. "Replacement football" came to a close for the Giants and Jets as a 24-day players strike of the National Football League ended, but without a collective bargaining agreement.
The big story, however, was Billy Martin. Martin, 59, had been angling to return as manager, despite his four previous dismissals by George M. Steinbrenner 3d. Martin's hiring marked the 14th managerial change in the 15 years Steinbrenner had owned the team. In a prepared statement, Martin said that he was "anxious" to return.
And what of the "bloodbath" on Wall Street? Not quite so bloody as first thought. While the market continued sluggish into the 1990's, hurting the local economy, the bull market eventually roared back, more than quadrupling the Dow to more than 8,000. ANTHONY RAMIREZ

A Gang of Hustlers Turns a Dime Bank Into a Cash Cow

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
One economic postulate of the streets holds that where there is cash, there is crime. But even hard-boiled police officers are marveling at the ingenuity of the latest low-end scam to hit the East Village. Beat cops from the Ninth Precinct report that a gang of ragtag hustlers are picking off bank card codes of unsuspecting customers at the Dime Savings Bank branch at Eighth Street and Second Avenue and taking thousands of dollars from their accounts.
The police say one gang member stands outside the bank's large plate-glass and peers in at the customer using the nearest automated-teller machine, which has a large, easily readable touch pad. After the customer completes a transaction, the machine asks if he would like to do anything else. Often a customer leaves and neglects to clear the machine. Account information can be gotten and additional transactions carried out just by re-entering the access code. No bank card is needed. 
 If the machine has not been cleared, another hustler, who appears down on her luck and trying to earning an honest dollar, graciously steers customers away from the "hot" machine to other available ATM's as the man outside the glass window flashes the departed customer's access code to a third associate in line for the ATM near the window. That person proceeds to withdraw the maximum amount from the account.
Although bank cards usually allow withdrawals of no more than $500, someone with a credit card access code may withdraw up to the card's limit. Lieut. Arthur F. Monahan said that in late August, the gang took nearly $5,000 using the credit card access code of a Japanese tourist in the East Village. "It is an obvious scam, if you have your wits about you," Lieutenant Monahan said. "But people don't typically want to put off a person who looks homeless." At least 10 people have been victimized, the police said.
The precinct has stationed an officer outside the bank for six weeks and five people have been arrested inside, mostly for trespassing, the police said. More serious charges could be filed after a review of surveillance tapes, the lieutenant said. The manager at the Dime branch, Anthony Vattuone, declined to comment and calls to the director of marketing, David Totaro, were not returned.
The police said they have identified the core group of scam artists, including Ronald Furgeson, 35, who was charged with assault on a police officer and criminal trespassing after an incident on Sept. 1 in which he struggled with Lieutenant Monahan who was working undercover inside the bank. They tumbled through the plate glass window when Mr. Furgeson reached for the lieutenant's gun, according to the police.
The police recommended that bank patrons do not take directions from homeless people, that they notify the nearest police officer if they feel they are being harassed; that they not use the machine if drunk, and that they complete each transaction and take their bank card. CHARLIE LeDUFF

HEADLINE: Faces of the New York Economy;
A Laborer At Hard Jobs For Low Pay

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
"IF you can survive the New York economy," Jennifer Fields said, "you can survive anywhere."
Ms. Fields, 42, has survived, though many New Yorkers would have trouble understanding how. 
 A single mother of three, she has traveled through the city's labor market, underground economy and maze of public assistance to land a job that pays her $15,192 a year plus a bonus, taking her place among the city's estimated 900,000 working poor.
Calculating whether the city's lowest-income workers give more than they receive comes down to hard cases like Ms. Fields.
She has become a productive worker with the help of city programs that many taxpayers resent, but she still needs government help to maintain her status.
Ms. Fields attended public schools in New York, as do her children.
She received welfare benefits for eight years while one or another of the children was in preschool, and Medicaid benefits for longer.
She has used city-financed homeless shelters and drug-treatment programs; one of her children spent time in city foster care. She lives in public housing built partly with city funds.
But Ms. Fields has contributed to the city's economy, as well, by performing low-paying, difficult, but much-needed work.
She has provided respite to families caring for sick relatives and remedial help to public school students in Bushwick, the Brooklyn neighborhood where she grew up. She also worked making perfume boxes in a Brooklyn factory.
Now she is a full-time aide at Concord Family Services, a nonprofit agency in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, where her work ranges from filing to doling out affection and discipline to teen-agers in foster care.
For that, she gets health insurance and $1,266 a month -- triple her welfare income, and enough for cable television, manicures, sofa slipcovers and Timberland boots for her children.
Ms. Fields still gets government help, however: subsidized rent, child care and food stamps.
Moreover, her salary at the Concord agency is paid under a city contract, a tiny portion of the $2.6 billion that the city spent on social service program contracts in the 1996 fiscal year.
At least until now, by cold, hard calculation, she might be classified as a debit on the city's ledger.
But Ms. Fields says she has moved to the credit side.
"No matter what your past is, with effort you can change," she said. "You can be a productive citizen." AMY WALDMAN

Big Earner, Big Spender, Little Burden

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
PHILIP G. POTTER, who develops investment products for high-net-worth clients of Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, likes to think of himself as an "uberconsumer."
Last year, he spent his bonus on a 50-inch TV and a $3,500 Rolex watch. He wears custom-made $800 suits, custom-made $80 shirts -- always with white collars and white French cuffs -- and $200 shoes. He is "totally wired," as he puts it: His home phone forwards messages to his pager; he answers them over a tiny $800 cellular phone. 
 A member of what he calls the "young affluent" class, Mr. Potter, 25 years old, represents the icing on the cake of New York's economy.
Though he declined to say exactly how much he earns, he allowed that depending on his bonus, he may well make "just over the goal line" of six figures this year. That would put him into the highest city tax bracket, meaning that City Hall will take at least $3,300 from his paycheck.
He spends at a rapid clip, whether at stylish restaurants in his Park Avenue South neighborhood, at downtown clubs like Lucky Strike or the 10th Street Lounge or in replenishing the Bombay Sapphire and single-malt Scotch in the bar at home.
Besides the rippling economic effects of tipping waitresses and buying drinks for his friends -- he drops $300 into the pond on an average weekend -- Mr. Potter's spending returns sales taxes to city coffers.
Yet he asks little of the city. Single, childless, healthy and young, Mr. Potter uses virtually no services; he rarely even rides the subway.
Moreover, like so many young people, his money stays in Manhattan. "I never leave the city," he said. "I just don't want to. I'm so in love with the city, I start getting withdrawal symptoms the moment I go over a bridge or in a tunnel."
His devotion to the city flows naturally from his work. "New York is where it's at," Mr. Potter said. "You need to be sitting down the hall from the division manager, not in a branch office in Minnesota. I wouldn't be able to do anything like this except at the headquarters."
Mr. Potter graduated from Yale in 1994 with a degree in physics, and after a short stint at a hedge fund, joined Morgan Stanley that November. He acknowledges that he has never been through a sustained market downturn but says he is confident that he would survive any Wall Street bloodletting.
"I can continue to come up with new products, to add value," he said. "I'm not responsible for getting money. Getting it's hard when the market goes down. But there will still be products to sell. It'll just force me to be a little more creative." DAVID M. HALBFINGER

HEADLINE: Faces of the New York Economy;
Immigrants Providing a Global Link

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
IN 1994, Zan Ng, a commercial photographer, persuaded Joseph Liu, an advertising executive, to join his fledgling ad agency, which Mr. Ng hoped would attract business from American companies trying to sell products to Asian consumers.
Today that midtown agency, Admerasia, employs 50 people and bills $20 million a year, joining a growing number of immigrant-owned businesses that have successfully capitalized on ethnic connections. 
 "The cultural and ethnic mix gives New York a special energy that makes it possible for people like us to succeed," said Mr. Liu, the agency's managing director.
Mr. Ng started Admerasia in 1993 with $250,000 that he and his two brothers had saved over the years. For advertising skill, he turned to Mr. Liu, who had started an agency of his own but had grown weary of the entrepreneurial headaches and now wanted a job with less risk but some chance of building equity.
Both came to America in 1975 and are now United States citizens. Mr. Ng, 40 and a father of five, was a penniless immigrant from a poor village in Fujian, China. Mr. Liu, who was reluctant to give his age but quick to say he is single, arrived on a student visa from Hong Kong with only a rice cooker, hoping to find work as an artist.
Drawing from the city's large pool of talented professionals who are native speakers of Asian languages, the agency quickly built its business by helping American companies sell to Asian consumers in the United States. Its clients now include Citibank, MCI Communications and Ajinomoto U.S.A., the American subsidiary of the Japanese manufacturer of seasonings and processed foods.
Admerasia's business is expanding to include a telemarketing company, 618 Easy, and services that help American companies market their products in Asia. The company plans to open an office soon in Los Angeles.
Mr. Liu said New York's rapidly growing immigrant populations allowed him to select the best talent from a variety of ethnic groups, including Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and Russian. Staff members say they are often overlooked by mainstream Madison Avenue agencies because they lack a native's grasp of American language and culture.
"I had a lot of creative experience in Taiwan," said Jeff Lin, the agency's creative officer. "But American agencies would not hire me because my English isn't perfect." JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: A Financial Capital? Yes. A Model Economy? No.

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
MAYBE it isn't the economy, after all.
While voters' economic insecurities propelled Bill Clinton to the White House, New York City's economic prospects hardly seem a factor in the mayoral contest. Just two weeks before the election, the campaign is mired in quarrels about pressing matters ranging from Rudy Guiliani's bedside manner to Ruth Messinger's ambivalence toward porn parlors. 
 That certainly fits Gothamites' fatalistic pride in their ability to roll with the economic punches. After all, the city went down for the count in the national recessions of 1969, 1974 and 1990 -- and was shaken to the core by the stock market collapse just 10 years ago this week. But New Yorkers have always brushed aside predictions that the local economy would be overwhelmed by the problems dogging older American cities since the 1960's.
The current cycle of recovery seems to be proving them right again. Optimists are crowing about the city's 7.6 percent gain in wage income last year and the prospects for an equally strong increase in 1997. Office buildings are filling up, Manhattan co-ops are selling for record prices and the city budget is balanced. "The whole image of New York as a place to live and work has turned around," said Randy Mastro, New York's Deputy Mayor for operations.
Pessimists, though, have no difficulty finding the dark lining in this silver cloud. While employment has been rising the last five years, the city has recovered only half the 650,000 jobs lost from 1987 through 1992. Unemployment remains above 9 percent -- nearly twice the national rate -- even as New York enters an era in which Federal welfare reform will force tens of thousands into the job market. And while income growth has been strong, the gains have been concentrated in the top niches of the notoriously cyclical financial services sector.
"Now more than ever, New York City is captive to forces beyond its control," argues Carol O'Cleireacain, an economist at the Brookings Institution who was the city's Finance Commissioner in the Dinkins administration.
On first (and maybe second and third) look, the facts favor the gloom and doomers. By most measures, New York has lost its competitive edge in the national economy, and few experts see much chance that the city can reclaim it. New York seemingly has neither the financial resources nor the political will to make the radical changes needed to attract the sorts of businesses that fled to the suburbs and the Sun Belt during the last three decades.
But while the city's strengths are less tangible, they should not be dismissed. New York continues to dominate a variety of high-paying, high-profile service industries ranging from advertising to broadcasting to theater. It still exudes a sense of vitality that attracts the best and brightest. And both history and cultural diversity give it a claim to pre-eminence in the global economy. "New York is the economic capital of the world," concludes Robert Hormats, an executive at Goldman, Sachs who contributed to a new Council on Foreign Relations study, "The City and the World."
 
The Drawbacks
Let's start with the bad news:
 
DEPENDENCE ON WALL STREET In the mid-1950's, nearly a million New Yorkers worked in manufacturing. But in each postwar recession, manufacturing jobs were lost and never returned. Today, just a quarter-million of these jobs are left.
Fortunately, declines in both manufacturing and government employment the last four years have been more than offset by job gains elsewhere, with retail trade, business services, media, finance, insurance and real estate leading the way.
The catch is that the good new jobs have been concentrated in relatively few businesses. Rae Rosen, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, notes that the incredible incomes of a few thousand deal makers and traders pulled up the earnings of the average securities industry worker to $169,500 in 1996, more than four times the average New Yorker's pay. Member firms in the New York Stock Exchange reported profits of $11 billion in 1996 -- up from just $1 billion in 1994.
Of course, when Wall Street prospers, the benefits spill over directly into accounting, legal services, advertising, insurance and public relations -- and indirectly into myriad businesses that service the high life. What's more, the resulting windfall in income taxes yielded a modest budget surplus this year that allowed Mayor Giuliani to increase spending on overcrowded schools.
But with 15 percent of City Hall's tax revenue coming from income levies on Wall Street, and with multibillion-dollar budget deficits looming just a few years away, New York's fiscal future seems precarious. "When the securities business hits a bump, it will be payback time for the city," warned David Hensley, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
 
BLOATED BUSINESS COSTS Patrick Howie, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa., estimates that the cost of doing business in the New York City region is 29 percent above the national average and more than 40 percent above the average in Sun Belt cities like Houston, Dallas and Oklahoma City.
In part, these costs reflect economic strength rather than weakness: high rents in Manhattan are driven as much by demand as by supply. By the same token, high wages are largely offset by high labor productivity: James Parrott, an economist in the office of New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, calculates that "unit labor costs" -- wages per unit of output -- are just 3 percent above the national average.
The Guiliani administration has instituted "one-stop shopping" for a variety of commercial licenses, busted up the mob-dominated commercial garbage collection cartel and cut business taxes on commercial rent and unincorporated business income.
But there are still high hurdles to commerce in New York -- from traffic congestion to regulation to taxes, which aren't likely to become competitive in the foreseeable future.
For one thing, the city must contend with a huge tab for deferred maintenance: tens of billions of dollars would be needed to bring schools, roads, bridges and other infrastructure up to snuff. For another, it has a property tax that, by state law, is biased against business: Commercial buildings representing 30 percent of the value of city real estate pay 50 percent of the tax.
Dean Mead at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission points to a third problem: deeply ingrained government inefficiency affecting everything from the size of the public school bureaucracy to the location of firehouses. While there have been marginal improvements, he estimates that "the city still uses 25 percent more employees than average to deliver services, who are on average paid 25 percent more than employees of other cities."
 
CHRONIC POVERTY Like the rest of the nation, New York suffers from a wide -- and widening -- gap between rich and poor, explained largely by strong demand for skilled workers and weak demand for the unskilled.
Ms. Rosen of the New York Fed notes that many of the 180,000 manufacturing jobs lost in the last recession -- not to mention the 36,000 government jobs lost to downsizing in 1995 and 1996 -- came at the expense of unskilled workers. Roughly two-thirds of all the growth in wages during the recovery has been in financial services, where all the rewards go to the skilled and the lucky. The State Comptroller's office estimates that bonuses, almost exclusively associated with high-wage Wall Street jobs, represented 23 percent of all wage growth in the city from 1990 through 1995.
Along with making New York a less attractive place to work and live, poverty makes it more expensive. While crime rates have fallen sharply, New Yorkers have paid heavily for the benefits. Last year the Police Department employed 46,800 people -- 8,000 more than in 1994. And while the welfare rolls have fallen by a quarter-million since 1994, one New Yorker in eight is still receiving cash grants, and the city's bill for public assistance and medical care is a near-record $5.5 billion this year.
 
The Bright Spots
But wait, there's good news for the city, too:
 
DECENTRALIZATION IS AN OLD STORY According to the conventional wisdom of the 1980's, the tumbling cost of communications and air travel would gradually undermine the economic advantages of urban density. Manhattan, the densest urban center of all, has indeed suffered, losing dozens of Fortune 500 corporate headquarters to both the suburbs and to Sun Belt cities with lower wages, taxes and rents.
But Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Taub Urban Research Center, argues that countervailing forces are also at work. In the high-fashion business, for example, the flexibility that comes from being close to designers and wholesalers offsets higher production costs.
Strikingly, the city economy has benefited even from what might be casually perceived as the mother of all threats: the computer age. New York is home to "Silicon Alley," more than 1,000 small companies in the software business. And according to the calculations of Mr. Moss and his Taub Center colleague, Anthony Townsend, New York has the highest concentration of Internet domains of any large city. "Density still counts," Mr. Moss concludes.
New York has also proved adept at recycling obsolete manufacturing and commercial space, making it profitable for some cost-squeezed businesses to stay in the city and for others to come in. The publishing industry moved from midtown to lower Fifth Avenue. Big retailers colonized the lower part of the Avenue of the Americas. Wall Street moved north (while the advertising industry moved south) into TriBeCa. Led by the Walt Disney Company, Times Square is again a center for glitzy entertainment.
 
DIVERSITY PAYS While New York's capacity to support radically different cultures is often celebrated as an achievement in itself, diversity has more direct payoffs. The city's welcome mat for gays and lesbians, for example, helps sustain its edge in arts and entertainment, which nourish both tourism and high-end consumption by residents. More prosaically, gays and lesbians have high average incomes and relatively few dependents -- meaning they pay a lot of taxes and, with the AIDS epidemic past its peak in the gay community, make few demands on city services.
The acceptance of ethnic differences also creates uniquely efficient market niches. Ten Korean grocers trying to break into business in a large city would face daunting challenges. But a thousand Korean grocers can support their own wholesalers and lenders and create a labor exchange for immigrants not fluent in English. "There are economies of scale to ethnicity," said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in California.
Probably most important, diversity attracts the young and talented. The Harris survey in May 1997 that ranked New York as "the city Americans would most like to live in" may be a fickle barometer. But high-end businesses are apparently having little difficulty recruiting, despite high living costs. And there is no doubt that diversity has also helped make New York the nation's most popular destination for foreign tourists, which creates jobs for the unskilled as well as reinforcing the city's dominance in theater, music, dance and the visual arts.
 
GLOBALIZATION While New York has a hard time delivering services competitively in the American economy, it is in a favored position to capture the fruits of global economic integration. New York may have high costs compared with those of Chicago or Houston, but even with today's relatively strong dollar it remains a bargain compared with Tokyo, Frankfurt or Milan. And the city has been able to capitalize on this strength in industries where it is already a big, if slipping, domestic player. "If you're a foreign bank that is only going to have one branch in America, that branch will probably be in New York," Ms. O'Cleireacain said.
In the brave new global economy, people as well as goods and services cross borders. While New York's attraction to immigrants is a mixed blessing -- the city's schools are crowded with their children -- immigration's constant renewal of the city's energy has almost certainly outweighed the costs.
For one thing, immigrants have filled the void in many neighborhoods left by deindustrialization and corporate downsizing. The city's foreign-born population, just 18 percent at its nadir in 1970, reached 28 percent in 1990 and is still rising rapidly, with Dominicans, Russians, Chinese, Jamaicans, Guyanans and Indians leading the charge.
For another, immigrants reinforce the city's strengths as an international financial center. The presence of large, distinct immigrant communities makes it easier to house and school foreign nationals, as well as to find local labor that speaks foreign languages. And "unlike Los Angeles, New York has strong ties to Europe as well as Asia and Latin America," Mr. Hormats of Goldman, Sachs said.
Immigrants also create natural markets for ethnic products that give manufacturers a chance to expand to the rest of the country -- and the world. For example, the House of Spice in Queens sells some $30 million of packaged Indian foods nationwide and exports to the Caribbean. Doreen Interiors, a firm started by Yemeni Jewish craftsmen, sells high-end upholstered furniture and draperies in Europe and the Persian Gulf.
 
The Prognosis
The Wall Street boom will end: it's not a matter of whether, but when. And the resulting fall in securities industry wages, bonuses and profits will send shock waves through a dozen key New York industries, from law to real estate to high-end retailing. That, in turn, will probably prompt a fiscal crisis for City Hall, which is projecting budget deficits in the next few years even if the local economy remains strong.
How the city weathers this crisis (and the next and the next) turns on a host of imponderables. The exchange rate of the dollar and economic growth abroad affect both the appeal of New York to foreign tourists and the demand for financial services. Albany's generosity, or lack thereof, will decide whether school class sizes grow and whether the inevitable spikes in the welfare caseload are buffered with cash. Elusive social factors will decide whether the coming demographic bulge of teen-agers raises the incidence of crime and single-parent households.
Some experts -- notably those not in government -- argue that New York could pull itself up by its bootstraps. And at least in theory, there is no end to the potential for making the city a more attractive place to work and live: increasing the efficiency of government, deregulating housing, developing the waterfront, rationing access to congested Manhattan streets. "If there's a will, there's a way," argued Mr. Mead of the Citizens Budget Commission.
But the mayoral candidates are long on generalities and short on controversial initiatives. Both see improvements in public education as crucial to the city's economic viability. Beyond reducing classroom sizes with money from unspecified sources, however, their plans are unclear.
Ms. Messinger, the Democratic candidate, wants to refocus economic development aid, notably tax breaks, from large to small businesses. And she wants city contractors to draw their unskilled workers from city residents.
Mr. Giuliani, the Republican incumbent, argues that the business-friendly face of his administration has restored half the jobs lost in the last recession, and that the key to continuing success is further progress in cutting crime, delivering government services for less money and paring business taxes.
With either candidate as Mayor, then, probably the best that one can hope for is incremental progress in containing the liabilities that too often make daily life in New York harsh. But with or without good luck, good government and the will to self-improvement, a striking number of urbanists are bullish on the city's long-term prospects.
"In the final analysis New York has what it takes to be a renaissance city," said Mr. Kotkin of Pepperdine -- "creativity and diversity."

Glamorous Internships With a Catch: There's No Pay

BYLINE: By DAWN GILBERTSON 

 BODY:
HOPE WAGNER, a sports administration major, scored a dream summer job.
Ms. Wagner, a senior at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, worked in the media relations department of a professional sports team. She drafted news releases, clipped newspaper articles and helped with community relations programs. 
 Her big project, the one that will be front and center on her resume, was a 75-page media guide for the coming season, which she helped finish over Labor Day weekend.
Ms. Wagner, one of five interns, took home plenty of souvenirs from the team -- T-shirts, bumper stickers, key chains and watches -- but not a penny, not even gas money for all the errands she ran.
She was an unpaid intern, one of thousands of students working for nothing but experience and, sometimes, for college credit.
"They treated me well while I was there, but I just think the whole idea of unpaid internships isn't fair," Ms. Wagner said. "At times I just got so frustrated thinking how many hours I put in for free."
Internship experts estimate that 50 to 60 percent of all student internships are unpaid. The figure is closer to 100 percent in glamorous fields like entertainment and politics, they say.
To be sure, there are plenty of paid internships, some of them with bigger paychecks than the students' parents earn.
Intel, the chip maker, pays undergraduates $450 to $750 a week and provides moving expenses, discounted housing and a free rental car, according to "America's Top Internships" and "The Internship Bible," sister guides that are part of the Princeton Review series by Random House.
Interns at General Motors earn $450 to $600 a week and receive health insurance, paid vacation days and round-trip travel, according to "The Internship Bible."
BUT internship listings often show no compensation. And the programs aren't all offered by struggling nonprofit organizations or small businesses. The Princeton books and "The Yale Daily News Guide to Internships" list unpaid internships for well-known businesses like Barney's New York, Merrill Lynch and NBC.
Although internships seem largely unregulated, there is a law governing the programs. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established minimum wage and overtime protections for workers, lists six criteria employers must meet for interns to be considered trainees and thus not guaranteed the minimum wage. Even internships that offer academic credit must comply.
Labor lawyers zero in on two stipulations: the intern cannot displace a regular employee and the company must derive no immediate advantage from the student's work.
"The bottom line here is whether the activities primarily benefit the individual or the employer," said a spokesman for the Labor Department.
Ms. Wagner's internship experience was not uncommon, and neither was that of Kerrie Brown, a St. Bonaventure University student, two years ago. Ms. Brown, now a senior, worked for a small cable television station in Maryland. She wanted to get a taste of broadcast journalism and was told she would learn about news writing, production and more. All she did was answer phones and watch television for commercials the station produced.
"They had me doing secretarial work that they should have been paying someone else to do," she said, adding that she quit when a paid internship opened up at a local newspaper.
So how do so many businesses and organizations continue diving into a gigantic pool of free labor year after year?
College career counselors and others say various factors are at play. First, the law is not aggressively enforced and is somewhat ambiguous. Second, there is no shortage of applicants for unpaid positions, especially in glamorous fields.
And both the interns and the businesses seem to enjoy, or at least tolerate, the benefits of the system enough to not rock the boat. Interns can gain invaluable training and good credentials, and there is not much of an incentive for blowing the whistle; the businesses gain free labor and a first peek at workers who are about to graduate.
"In the 12 years I've been in the field I've never heard of a case where an employer has been even chastised for abusing that law," said Dawn Pettit, executive director of the Cooperative Education Association, an organization in Columbia, Md., that promotes work-classroom programs.
A Pittsburgh labor lawyer, Donald O'Connor, said there had been some cases, including one nearly three years ago in which a public relations agency reached a settlement over billing of clients for the unpaid work of interns. The firm agreed to pay more than $30,000 in back pay to a group of former interns and to pay future interns.
The Labor Department says there have not been many violations, but concedes that it typically does not investigate a company unless there are complaints.
"It's not like we have an enforcement program focused on interns," the Labor Department spokesman said.
Ms. Pettit said she would be concerned if a student's unpaid work contributed to big profits.
"When the student is going there and they're part of a team working on a project ultimately resulting in millions of dollars of income -- some software program, for example -- then, no, it's not fair if she's the only one not being paid," she said.
Unpaid internships, however, may be seen as a rite of corporate passage. As Samer Hamadeh, 28, co-author of "The Internship Bible" and "America's Top Internships" says, "This is the way you break into the work world in America."
The numbers bear that out. Some internships attract a flood of applicants. "America's Top Internships," for example, says the "Late Show with David Letterman" gets about 750 applicants for 30 unpaid positions, even though they rate high on the guide's busy-work meter -- running lots of errands, making copies and answering phones. Penguin Books gets about 200 applications for eight unpaid positions in editorial, marketing, sales and other departments, while 250 applicants vie for one summer internship at Elite Model Management in Beverly Hills, Calif., the Yale guide said.
Mr. Hamadeh, whose internships included a paid stint pumping airplane grease through pipes for Chevron, now hires interns and pays them. But he said there were additional costs for a company.
"You have to spend a lot more time training them," he said. "They're often much younger and have no office skills."
The companies would "never hire any of these people otherwise," he added.
INCREASINGLY, said Jack Tinker, director of career services for Connecticut College in New London, Conn., potential employers want -- and schools require -- work experience. And that encourages the current system, with would-be interns unwilling to demand pay.
Mr. Hamadeh, quoting figures from the National Society of Experiential Education, said that as recently as 1981, just one in 36 college graduates had done an internship. Ten years later, the figure jumped to one in three. Mr. Hamadeh said that more recent surveys put the figure at about two out of three.
Supporters of unpaid internships say the benefits outweigh the short-term sacrifices.
"Our students are coming out with contacts, they're coming out with confidence, they're coming out with stronger resumes," said Laura McKaie, assistant dean of career education at the Long Island University Brooklyn campus, where the median age is 26 and many students support families.
Internships are especially crucial in industries where contacts are the only way in the door. Steve Cook, a 1997 graduate of Northwestern University's film school, said the Hollywood jobs in which he was interested were not advertised, so it was essential to have a network of people to call regularly.
Mr. Cook, who just directed his first film, "The Choir Invisible," started internships as soon as he graduated from the Lawrenceville School near Princeton, N.J. He spent his college summers in California, working without pay for companies including Hollywood Pictures, NBC, the Gersh Agency and Prufrock Pictures, the actress Meg Ryan's production company.
Despite her frustrations and empty bank account, Ms. Wagner said she would do her internship with the sports team all over again. She sought the job and volunteered to do the media guide, for which the team was prepared to hire a graphics artist.
"I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to try something big like that," she said. Ms. Wagner lived with her parents, who took care of her bills.

HEADLINE: Along the Old Silk Road, a New Effort to Shine

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: KHIVA, Uzbekistan

 BODY:
Historians say that no one knows when this ancient Silk Road town was founded, but that has not prevented President Islam Karimov from declaring October as its 2,500th anniversary.
For weeks laborers have been working frantically to clean Khiva's streets, repair its imposing monuments and build towering scaffolds to hold powerful lights and loudspeakers brought from Germany for the occasion. Mr. Karimov has planned lavish celebrations to which he has invited officials from around the world, and to spice the invitation he has announced that this month is also the 2,500th birthday of the town of Bukhara, where he is staging another extended party. 
 Khiva, Bukhara and nearby Samarkand are built around spectacular mosques and palaces that testify to this region's astonishingly rich history. Each was once the center of an empire, attracting titanic figures like Alexander, Genghis Khan and Tamerlane.
Because it stood at the heart of the Silk Road, the land that is now Uzbekistan attracted traders from across Europe and Asia. It acquired a sense of self-importance and destiny that President Karimov now seeks to embody.
Mr. Karimov -- whose term of office expired in 1995 but was extended for five years after a referendum in which a reported 99.6 percent of the people voted to keep him in power -- also embodies the tradition of authoritarian rule that has dominated life here for centuries.
With 23 million people, Uzbekistan is the most populous of the five Central Asian countries that emerged in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed, and senior officials make no secret of their ambition for regional leadership. The celebrations they are holding in Khiva and Bukhara, like their failed attempt to bring the Olympic Games to Tashkent, the capital, reflect their desire to lift Uzbekistan out of anonymity and make it a player in world affairs.
The Central Asian republics are being courted by outside powers in part because of their strategic location between Russia, China, Iran and the Indian subcontinent. Their markets and resources, which include large oil and gas deposits, have only begun to be exploited. A country that can emerge as dominant in this region, Uzbek leaders reason, will have a voice in international politics.
But those ambitions are stumbling over political and economic obstacles. Although Mr. Karimov insists that he is committed to reform, the habits he and other Uzbek leaders learned while rising through the Communist system have proved hard to break. Their plans for opening the country to democracy and foreign investment are clashing with their instinctive fear of losing control.
Human rights conditions here have improved since the early 1990's and especially since President Karimov's visit to Washington last year. Still, there is no independent press, protest meetings are forbidden and opposition political parties are banned.
But despite the slow pace of change, there is no ground swell of protest against the Government. Two neighboring countries, Afghanistan and Tajikistan, have been consumed by ethnic and religious wars, and many Uzbeks seem willing to accept Mr. Karimov's heavy-handed rule as long as he keeps the country stable and at peace.
"Ninety-nine percent of the people in this country don't even think about democracy and human rights," said Tohir Bokayev, a metalworker in Bukhara. "Their main concern is everyday life. People here have no experience with Western-style democracy."
Mr. Bokayev is trying to chip away at the monolith. He applied several months ago for permission to start an independent newspaper, and as he expected, it was denied. Now he plans to publish a newsletter that will carry only advertising and information like bus and train schedules.
"You don't need permission to start a newsletter as long as it doesn't carry news," he said. "I want to start this way, and then as time passes maybe we can expand it into a newspaper."
As in most parts of the former Soviet Union, life is hard for most of Uzbekistan's people. Even in Tashkent it is unusual to find an ordinary person who earns more than $1,000 a year. Prices are high, and many people find that rising costs have put health care and other social services out of their reach.
Efforts to diversify the cotton-based economy depend largely on foreign investment, but corruption and broken promises have driven some investors away and deeply frustrated those who remain.
Currency controls are so strict that foreign businesses often cannot withdraw their own money from banks. Local employees may not be paid in dollars, and companies that want to send Uzbeks abroad for training often find it impossible to obtain exit visas for them.
To put it another way, conditions for foreign business here are so difficult that not even McDonald's has arrived yet.
"They sign contracts without even reading them," a German hotel manager said. "When you have a disagreement with a local partner, you tell him to look at what's written in the contract and he says: 'Contract? What's that?' "
The impulse that makes the Government reluctant to open the economy also leads it to equate political opposition with subversion.
"Because of Karimov's authoritarian style, Uzbek society is stagnating," said Mikhail Ardzinov, leader of a human rights group the Government does not recognize. "In Russia you see dynamic economic thinking and open debate about problems and possible solutions, but Karimov will not tolerate that here."
Although the Government denies holding political prisoners, Mr. Ardzinov estimates that there are 32, nearly half accused of fomenting Islamic radicalism. The powerful security police keep close watch on mullahs and other religious figures, determined to prevent the growing interest in Islam from spilling over into politics.
"I am very happy that our President is banning Islamic fundamentalism," said Dildora Alimbekova, a Tashkent seamstress who has formed an association of female entrepreneurs. "I'm a bit surprised to see what is happening in my own family. I have 48 nieces and nephews. These young people are very interested in Islam, and half of my nieces are covering themselves in the old Islamic way. I discuss it with them, but they don't accept my point of view and argue strongly against me."
Uzbekistan remains a decidedly secular country where there is no taboo against drinking alcohol or wearing short skirts and where one of the capital's most popular restaurants is called Pork Chop. But especially in the northeast Fergana region, the country's most densely populated, there are signs of an Islamic revival.
At the bazaar in Kokand, one of the largest towns in Fergana, it is no longer unusual to see veiled women. Vendors sell cassettes on which prominent mullahs extol the virtues of religious education and belief.
In Andijan, another Fergana town, a 60-year-old trader, Abdulrahim Abdulaim Oghli, said he had dreamed all his life of making the hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca but never believed it would be possible because such pilgrimages were banned by the Soviet authorities.
"Now, praise Allah, I have made the hajj twice," he said. "Since independence, people have followed their desire to become more religious. My grandson is reading the Koran and is about to finish it."
President Karimov, though determined to prevent fundamentalism from taking hold, has sought to conciliate and co-opt the Muslim leadership rather than repress it. Always seeking to balance competing forces, he speaks warmly about Islam despite the fact that for years he served an officially atheistic system.
Confronted with a choice about whether to make the hajj himself, which might set too strong a religious example, or to stay at home, which might offend practicing Muslims, Mr. Karimov came up with a typically adroit compromise. He traveled to Mecca, but although he visited holy sites he did it out of the hajj season so he would not seem to be encouraging excessive devotion.
"You may not like Karimov, but most people think he's what we need at this moment in our history," said Odil Ruzaliev, a reporter for one of Tashkent's Government-controlled television stations. "Let's give him a chance. In such a young country, why criticize?"

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Betting on Sector Funds to Cash In on Deals

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
INVESTORS looking for a way to participate in the consolidation wave that keeps sweeping over vast sections of the economy might consider industry-specific sector funds.
The three-way bidding war for MCI Communications -- involving Worldcom, GTE and British Telecommunications -- is the latest and largest manifestation of merger mania. But aside from telecomunications, a number of other industries -- from financial services to utilities to military contractors -- are still in the process of molting into businesses dominated by fewer, bigger participants. 
 "Consolidation really is everywhere," said David J. Williams, a managing director of the United States Trust Company and manager of its proprietary $230 million Value and Restructuring fund, which invests in a wide array of restructuring or consolidating industries and is up more than 40 percent this year. "To the extent there is too much competition, there tends to be consolidation."
So far this year, telecommunications funds have done well, slightly outpacing the growth of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But they are not the best-performing collection of sector funds; those funds that concentrate on financial service companies are currently in the lead.
As a group, the dozen telecommunications funds tracked by Morningstar are up just over 29.5 percent this year, compared with 29 percent for the S.& P. By comparison, the 19 funds that focus on financial service companies were up 39 percent through Thursday, according to Morningstar's figures.
Buying into a fund that holds a number of stocks in a particular industry reduces the risk of placing wrong bets on a couple of individual stocks, analysts said.
Kevin Gooley, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, said that just now such diversity is particularly valuable in the telecommunications industry.
"The difficult thing right now, especially in the United States, is the uncertainty that is hanging over the market," he said. "The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was supposed to open all the elements of the telecom market to new competition, but none of that has really happened. Given that uncertainty, making a bet on individual companies is risky, with certain exceptions."
One of those exception, Mr. Gooley noted, is Worldcom, an upstart provider of a range of telecommunications services that is not as heavily regulated as AT&T or the Baby Bells.
Bruce E. Behrens, co-manager of the Flag Investors Telephone Income fund at Alex. Brown Investment Management, owns a good bit of Worldcom and a chunk of GTE. But in an interview he stressed that playing the consolidation game is not what the fund, which was formed in 1984 after the breakup of AT&T, is about.
"Consolidation is not why we are in this industry," he said. "This is a sector with a difference, and the difference is that it is a really big industry with enormous capitalization that cuts through a lot of aspects of the economy and society. It has enormous financial possibilities and there is a lot of opportunity for entrepreneurs."
Peter Di Teresa, an equity fund analyst at Morningstar, said that while consolidation was something for investors to think about, it should not be a driving force in selecting a sector fund.
"If you are a long-term investor, it should be a low-ranking priority," he said. "Market timers might tend to make a decision this way, but more often than not they tend to get burned."
Mr. Di Teresa said that of the dozen telecommunication funds tracked by Morningstar, the best performers have tended to be those with foreign exposure. Over the last year, a number of former government-owned telephone companies have been privatized, and portfolio managers are upbeat about growth prospects in those markets.
"If we take the United States as a model, most developed and developing countries have room for a lot more line growth," Mr. Di Teresa said.
So far this year, the best-performing telecommunications fund is Invesco Worldwide Communications. The fund, which is up more than 36 percent through Thursday, lists Telebras, the recently privatized Brazilian telephone company, as its biggest holding. But it also has significant positions in Portugal Telecom and Telecom Argentina.
Although it has some foreign exposure, Alex. Brown's Flag Investors Telephone fund is primarily invested in American telecommunications companies for now.
"We can have up to 20 percent foreign exposure and have been as high as 15 percent," Mr. Behrens said. "Currently, we have about 5 percent to 6 percent exposure because we think there is better opportunity domestically."
At least some investors seem to agree. The fund, which has close to $700 million in assets under management, has seen an increase in inflows in recent weeks, Mr. Behrens said. The fund has risen 33 percent so far this year and is up nearly 8 percent over the latest four weeks.
"For the past couple of years, we have been steady at around $600 million," he said. "But we have seen a reasonably significant uptick in cash flows over the last couple of weeks. I don't know if it is because of MCI, or the improving performance of the fund."

HEADLINE: Iran Sees Pistachio Ban As Foul Play by Enemies

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Oct. 15

 BODY:
It is not often that something as small as a pistachio can create so much stir, but remember this: in Iran, pistachios are big business.
After oil and carpets, pistachios are Iran's biggest source of foreign currency, bringing in about $600 million a year. More than 350,000 people earn a living from the nut, most of them in vast groves of the desert oases in the country's southeast. The bountiful harvests make Iran the largest exporter of pistachios in the world. 
 It is little wonder, then, that a decision by the European Union last month to suspend imports of Iranian pistachios has drawn dark allegations that someone, somewhere, has decided to wage economic war.
European officials said they had imposed the ban after discovering a shipment contaminated by a cancer-causing toxin. But Iranian officials said the move had to have been political.
"The ban is triggered by America, not the Europeans, because they want to replace us in the world pistachio market," said Mohammed Shams-Fard, president of the Dried Nuts and Fruit Exporters Association.
More than two-thirds of Iran's pistachio exports end up in Europe, so Iran has reason to be worried. The ban has left in limbo thousands of tons of nuts that were en route to Europe and has left the farmers completing their annual harvest with little to do but wait.
"All we want is to prove that our pistachios are safe," said Iran's Agriculture Minister, Isa Kalantari.
An alarm was raised in Europe last July after Dutch authorities found unacceptable levels of the carcinogen aflatoxin B1 in 275,000 pounds of Iranian pistachios shipped via Dubai.
Iranian officials have blamed improper storage in the emirate for the problem; the high heat and humidity there help to foster the growth of molds that produce the carcinogen.
But the Europeans have said that several countries found high levels of aflatoxin in as many as 70 percent of Iranian batches they had tested, and the scare reached such a level that one country, Belgium, went so far last month as to ban the sale of all pistachios, no matter what the origin.
Determined to demonstrate that what was discovered was nothing more than an isolated case, Iran opened its warehouses and inspection sites to European experts who visited the country earlier this month. Although the ban runs until Dec. 15, Iranian officials have said they hope it will be lifted soon, once they report their findings at a meeting in Luxembourg.
"On the whole, they were fully satisfied with what they obtained from here," Mr. Shams-Fard, the Iranian industry official, said in an interview.
But the Iranian efforts to mend fences have not overcome the suspicion that something bigger than pistachios must be at work. Relations between Europe and the Iranian Government have been rocky since last spring, when the European Union withdrew its Ambassadors from Teheran after a German court implicated Iranian leaders in the murder of dissidents in Berlin.
Although Europe is now ready to send the Ambassadors back, their return has been snagged over Iranian insistence that the German diplomat be the last to return, a condition that other European countries have unanimously rejected. Some Iranians have suggested that the ban on nuts is somehow connected to the diplomatic tussle.
But within Iran's vast pistachio industry -- in which the family of the former Iranian President, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, has a large share -- the main theory is that the United States must be behind the current troubles.
No pistachios from Iran are sold to American markets because of a United States trade embargo.

HEADLINE: LEGACY OF THE '87 CRASH;
A Decade and a Bull Ride Later, Complacency Reigns

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
AS trading moved toward a close on the worst day in stock market history, a crowd of young investment bankers gathered around the fringes of the trading floor at one of Wall Street's premier firms.
They did not work on the trading floor, and arguably had no business being on it. But there they stood, in stunned silence, watching the electronic ticker tape march across the wall. 
 It did not matter to them that the prices on the tape were hopelessly out of date, an hour or more old and, in some cases, dozens of dollars higher than the real prices at which trades were being made. The bankers were watching what was obviously an epochal event, wondering if it meant the end of their careers and of the comfortable, even extravagant, way of life that had made Wall Street an oasis of wealth.
The chief stock trader, who had spent the day desperately trying to preserve the firm's capital while witnessing selling on a scale never before seen, looked up a little before 4 P.M. and saw the assembled bankers. "I'm sure," he said, a bit testily, "that you have other things to do."
They didn't, of course. But they rapidly dispersed. It was not the time to offend senior management.
When the tape finally caught up with all the trading, the Dow Jones industrial average ended that day -- Oct. 19, 1987 -- down 508 points, or 23 percent, at 1,738.74. It was the greatest crash ever, or certainly since 1929. There had never been a day when prices fell so far.
Now, a decade later, the 1987 crash seems like a footnote in the great bull market that began in 1982 and still lives. That is true even after the Dow fell 210 points in the final two days of last week, in what one wag called "an anniversary celebration." Larger dips have been quickly reversed many times since 1987, as investors learned what has become the great lesson of the crash. That lesson is not one that seemed apparent at the time.
"The No. 1 lesson was that you should buy when Wall Street has a one-day sale," said David Shulman, the chief equity strategist of Salomon Brothers. "That lesson may be overlearned by now."
It certainly has been widely learned. Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's chief strategist for global equities, tells of trying to find a plumber in Ketchum, Idaho, where he has a home, over Labor Day weekend this year. Most were on vacation. The one he finally found knew quite well who Mr. Biggs was, and was scornful of his recent bearishness.
"You're lucky to get me, because I'm doing less plumbing these days," the plumber told Mr. Biggs. "I've got $300,000 in the market on margin. I'm making three times as much money this year from trading stocks as I am from plumbing, and I don't have to stick my hands down other people's drains. For years now, I've bought stocks on dips when you Wall Street guys were beating your breasts and crying bear."
In 1987, the crash seemed to teach quite different lessons. One that may be the most relevant today was that sophisticated derivative securities were highly destabilizing to the market, even though they were being used in what investors thought were conservative ways. Now there are new techniques -- being used in different ways -- that could have a similar impact, by leading to heavy selling after prices fall. If the market ever does break sharply again, those strategies will come under intense scrutiny.
A LESSON of 1987 that seemed clear at the time, but not now, concerned valuation. Stock prices by many measures were very high at the 1987 peak, and the crash seemed to vindicate those who had been warning of severe overvaluation.
Now, by many of those same yardsticks, stock prices are much more overvalued. Yet Wall Street for the most part does not care. It is said that prices are quite reasonable, given falling interest rates, the outlook for low inflation and continued economic growth. Those who spoke of excessive valuations a year ago have been largely discredited by the market's continued advance.
Immediately after the crash, one certainty to many people was that the plunge must have contained an economic warning. Stock prices, after all, are part of the index of leading economic indicators.
"Analysts all said that the market is saying something, and what it is saying is that 1988 is going to be a very bad year," recalled Richard Pucci of I.B.E.S. International Inc., a company that tracks earnings estimates by Wall Street analysts and publishes consensus figures. "So they lowered estimates dramatically."
In fact, the economic effect of the crash was minimal, and the analysts spent the rest of 1988 raising estimates. It was the only year since 1980 that analysts, as a group, underestimated a year's corporate profits at the beginning of the year.
The crash did have a depressant effect on Wall Street, and on the New York economy, for a number of years. For instance, a woman who sells very expensive furniture in Manhattan says that only this year has business been as good as it was in the months before the 1987 crash.
But for most of America, there was little impact. In fact, it is possible that business was a little stronger in 1988 than it would have been without the crash. The Federal Reserve Board, which had been pushing interest rates up, changed course abruptly after the market plunged, stimulating an economy that was doing fine anyway.
It took some time to appreciate just how much of the selling on Oct. 19 and the days around it had come as a result of an institutional investment strategy known as portfolio insurance. Details varied, but the basic idea was that institutions could lock in profits, at minimal cost, by selling stock index futures contracts as prices fell. Then, every future sold would lock in previously made profits on the stocks. Or so the theory went.
What happened was that such selling overwhelmed the market, driving down prices in the futures market much farther than they otherwise would have fallen. It did not start the crash, but it made it much worse. (It is also possible that the confidence induced by portfolio insurance drove prices higher before the crash than they otherwise would have risen, because investors who thought stocks were overvalued saw no need to sell them, given that they had an insurance policy against losses.)
Portfolio insurance was destabilizing precisely because it required selling at the worst possible time -- when prices were already falling. Such selling drove down the prices of stock index futures and brought in index arbitragers, who bought the futures and then sold individual stocks.
In the aftermath of the crash, portfolio insurance got a very bad name. Because it relied on selling index futures only after prices had begun to fall, it was compared to buying fire insurance amid the flames.
That particular strategy has died. But related ones have made strong comebacks in recent years. Those strategies depend on options of one sort or another, and come in all kinds of flavors. Most are based on so-called over-the-counter options, which are usually sold to institutions by investment banks and commercial banks.
Such an option might protect an institutional investor with a lot of technology stocks by giving it the right to sell a basket of those stocks at a certain price by a certain date. In return for an upfront payment for that kind of option -- a put option -- the investment bank would guarantee that the technology stock investor would lose no more than a certain amount. To keep the insurance analogy going, that is equivalent to buying insurance before a fire begins.
The investment bank that issued that option probably does not want to bet on technology stocks. So it can hedge its exposure in a variety of ways. One way, called dynamic hedging, bears a suspicious resemblance to the portfolio insurance of old. If prices fall, the bank will hedge by shorting the underlying stocks. It they rise, it will buy back stocks. Either way, it is going with the market flow, thus adding a bit to volatility, which has been high lately.
How much of that volatility is due to dynamic hedging? No one knows, because no figures are made public on trading in over-the-counter options. "I suspect there is less now than in 1987," says Bruce I. Jacobs, a principal with Jacobs Levy Equity Management in Roseland, N.J., and a longtime critic of dynamic hedging. "But it is hard to know. It is a total unknown."
Such hedging has the potential to destabilize the market as portfolio insurance did in 1987. The dynamic hedgers will do fine if the next bear market is a gradual affair, but will suffer greatly if prices plunge before they can put their hedges into place.
The increasing sophistication of derivative securities has made it possible to cut up the risks of owning stocks, and to transfer all or part of those risks to any number of others. Whether those risks are being handled wisely, and whether they pose threats either to individual firms or even to the overall market, cannot be known now, while stock prices are high.
Were there to be another crash, the economic impact could be much greater. Such a crash, of course, might signal something fundamental about the economy. In any case, a prolonged slump in stocks would directly affect more people, if only because there are more investors now. While many aren't as deeply invested as Mr. Biggs's plumber, many now have retirement money in defined-contribution plans, like 401(k)'s, rather than in traditional pension plans, and would thus feel pain if stocks fell sharply.
IT is unlikely, but not impossible, that stock prices will again fall 23 percent in one day. The New York Stock Exchange has put in place circuit breakers that would halt trading temporarily at various levels after sharp declines. The longest planned halt, of an hour, would come if the Dow fell 550 points, about 7 percent at current levels. But such a halt could come early enough that the market would reopen late in the day with no more artificial floors.
Circuit breakers have worked relatively well in commodities markets, including in stock index futures, where they have clicked in on some bad days. But while a rule that restricts some trading strategies has often been invoked, circuit breakers have never halted stock trading. It is possible they would perform as hoped, giving investors time to conclude that prices were cheap and send in buy orders. But investors might see the halt as a chance to submit sell orders before prices fell further.
In 1929, those who sold at the first crash proved to be the fortunate ones. Those who held on were wiped out in the ensuing depression. In 1987, those who bought in the first crash -- which turned out to be the only one -- were the fortunate ones. Since then, the belief that stocks are always the best long-term investment has been embraced by many investors and market commentators. That theory, which would have seemed incomprehensible to someone who survived the 1929 crash and the long bear market that followed, will no doubt stimulate buying on weakness and make a new crash less likely.
In connection with the crash anniversary, Elrick & Lavidge, a polling firm, conducted a survey for American Century Investments, a mutual fund group. Most respondents said they thought there would not be a crash in the next five years, and a majority agreed with the statement that if there was a crash, it "would not be a major concern to me because I am a long-term investor."
In 1987, the crash traumatized investment bankers and small investors alike. A decade later it has produced something that no one could have forecast: complacency.

The 21st Century Belongs to . . .

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
LISTENING to President Clinton's speeches in Latin America last week, audiences might have concluded that Washington's economic hopes and preoccupations lay to the south. But wait a week. Next Sunday, China's President, Jiang Zemin, arrives in the United States for an official visit. And chances are that visions of a vast Chinese market with a bottomless appetite for consumer goods -- or of a repressive and militaristic China -- will relegate every other place to the sidelines again.
As the summit meeting approaches, television sets and newspaper columns, seminar rooms and breakfast talkfests are already resounding with opinions about a nation that seems, for good or evil, to loom over the next century like no other country in the world. Apart from its size -- 1.3 billion people -- its economic independence and aloofness make China all the more irresistible to those who see its potential as largely untapped. Add to that the so-far seamless return to China of British Hong Kong, an economic dynamo in its own right, and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that China is a land of destiny writ large. 
 But some economists -- as well as politicians and foreign policy experts -- think this obsession with China is not healthy or smart, not for foreign policy or even for trade and investment, especially when other areas of the world are also enjoying robust economic growth.
"We are obsessively obsessed by China because of its huge numbers and rapid growth rates," said Jagdish Bhagwati, professor of economics at Columbia University. "But no one can maintain these growth rates in the long term. Sooner or later China will have to rejoin the human race. It seems to me that as you look around the world, China is a big market, but only one market. There are other sizable economic powers. And China is still full of uncertainties."
Among the regions economists suggest as alternatives worth looking at are not just Latin America -- where the average growth rate has settled at just over 4 percent, a climb out of negative growth two years ago -- but also South Asia, dominated by India and Pakistan. That region's growth rates hover around 6 percent and are expected to rise. And with India nearing the billion-people mark, South Asia will soon surpass China in population.
Moreover, raw economic data like growth rates don't tell the full story of a place's potential. The nations of the European Union had an average growth rate of only 1.6 percent and the United States' gross domestic product increased by only 2.4 percent last year, but few find either fact reason enough to avoid those nations.
Professor Bhagwati, who toured Latin America recently, said the region is reaping the benefits of democratic government, a free climate for economic activity and a new respect for economists. The Latin military can no longer demand a major role in industry as the army does in China.
"The spirit of reform is enormous in that part of the world now," he said. "The success that economists have enjoyed in having killed things like hyperinflation gives them enormous credibility. New governments have replaced old dictatorships. They are opening up in a very dramatic way." By 2010, Clinton advisers say, United States trade with Latin America will surpass trade with Europe and Japan combined.
Susan Kaufman Purcell, vice president of the Council of the Americas in New York, said that Latin American countries have always faced harsher scrutiny than have China or other Asian nations -- and that this puts them at a disadvantage.
"If you look at U.S. policy toward Latin America, to a much, much larger extent, we have pressed for democracy," she said, adding that it might be time to revise old opinions in light of the currency turmoil in Southeast Asia. "There was this vision that Asia was a very stable place and that even though many of its governments were authoritarian it was perceived that somehow they had better business values than the Latin American governments. But now people realize that the Asians are only beginning to focus on what Latin Americans have already accomplished in terms of opening their economies, privatization, democracy, transparency."
Europeans score even higher in the reliability sweepstakes, as the recent movement there of battered funds from Southeast Asia demonstrates.
"There is compatibility in the rule of law, openness in the economy," said Christopher Matthews, a spokesman for the European Commission in New York. "There is also a longstanding link with the United States: they are each other's biggest investment partners and trading partners -- over a trillion-dollar relationship."
 
Dismissing the Hype
Western Europe also thinks of itself as a gateway to the countries of the former Soviet bloc. "Some of them are small and coming up from a very low level, but their growth rate is very high." Mr. Matthews said. In addition, European companies have begun a wave of mergers and, cautiously, layoffs that are producing higher productivity and profits.
Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic member of Congress from California who has pressed for a harder line on human-rights issues in dealing with Beijing, thinks too many Americans have been sold inflated dreams about the riches to be had in the China trade.
"The facts are that we do not have access to the Chinese market, except for a small exporting elite," she said. "What the Chinese want is access to our markets and that is what they have. When they do allow a U.S. brand name to be sold in China, they immediately ask for an export plan. They want our technology, and they insist on technology transfer. Then they start their own production. It is a hoax to say that U.S. jobs are dependent on China. Under 200,000 jobs are."
Not everybody agrees with Ms. Pelosi. In fact, disputes between human-rights hard-liners like her and those who emphasize economic engagement do much to keep attention focused on China.
And so the decibel level will rise again next week. But as it does it may be worth recalling all the cheerleading about Latin America only a few days ago during President Clinton's visit, and considering what is not being said very often about some other places.

HEADLINE: Citizens;
France Confronts Its Jews, And Itself

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
AS a bloody century wanes, repentance is in vogue, a sort of global purging of the soul before the millennium. A world relatively becalmed, perhaps moderately bored, is confronting the upheavals of the past hundred years as a form of atonement. British colonialism, Nazism, Communist totalitarianism, apartheid: the candidates for expiatory examination are rich and varied. But nowhere, perhaps, is the process more fraught or obsessive than in France's contemplation of its treatment of the Jews during World War II.
The forces pushing France toward an orgy of retrospection are similar to those at work elsewhere: the passing from power of the generation that lived the war years; the end of the cold war with its bending of truth to strategic imperatives; the odd moral magnetism of the number 2000, so evocative of a circle completed as to be an invitation to what Pope John Paul II has called "the purification of memory." 
 Here, as in other countries, there appears to be an almost physical realization of the sheer weight of the century's slaughter, and the triumph of the ideology of human rights in a post-ideological age leads naturally to the examination of past brutality.
 
Moment of Masochism
Yet in France, whose Revolution of 1789 shattered the old theocratic order and ushered in the shifting modern age, this penitential process has acquired a special intensity. France, which competes with the United States as a model of enlightenment, seems determined to clear its conscience. It is as if the first avowedly modern state -- that of the empowerment of citizens, of the enshrinement of dignity in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, and of the first formal emancipation of the Jews, in 1791 -- is unready to take on a new century without sweeping away the shadows that form part of France's eternal, sometimes maddening, ambiguity.
"This is a moment of extraordinary masochism in France," said Michel Lussault, a sociologist. "We have a need to make a spectacle of our past errors and settle every outstanding account."
Apologies to the country's 650,000 Jews are pouring in -- from the Roman Catholic Church in France, from the French medical association, from the police -- for acts of commission and omission that date back more than a half century, to the time when the Vichy regime ruled at the sufferance of France's Nazi occupiers.
Couched in terms of great humility, these requests for pardon have been marked by extraordinary frankness for a country traditionally more inclined to the discretion of a church confessional than the public display of emotion, and which has long wrestled with its "Jewish question." Until 1995 France portrayed Marshall Philippe Petain's Vichy regime as an imposed aberration that left unsullied the French Republic, an institution coeval and so eternally synonymous with the quest for equality and dignity.
At the same time, the trial in Bordeaux of 87-year-old Maurice Papon, the first and almost certainly the last Vichy official to be prosecuted for the deportation of Jews from France, has confronted the French with an agonizing fact: Mr. Papon is not a monster, but everyman, a bureaucrat par excellence, a servant of the French state and a product of its meritocracy who prospered under both Vichy and the subsequent Gaullist Republic, whose views on the Jews in the 1940's were almost certainly quite average, neither rabidly anti-Semitic nor inclined to see the Jew as a citizen like any other. His trial is therefore that of a certain France, one whose death throes now appear to be in progress.
These death throes involve different forms of absolutism that have at times blurred memory and fueled conflict: the infallibility of the church, the honor of the Republic, the doctrine of the glory of France itself. In their place, some now see a new France emerging: more tolerant, more pluralist, less dogmatic. Naturally this shift is not without opponents, particularly the rightist National Front, but a change is perceptible.
That this transition involves Jews is perhaps inevitable. For the Jewish question in France has never been a peripheral one; it has occupied a place near the heart of what are sometimes called "les guerres Franco-Francaises," the internecine struggles of the French.
From the Revolution to the Dreyfus Affair, from Dreyfus to Vichy, and from Vichy to the contemporary National Front, the place of the Jews in French society has been a recurring issue. Its resolution would be a significant turning point.
The Revolution of 1789 created the concept of a nation constituted by the will of its equal citizens, and those citizens included the Jews. French nationality became, in Ernest Renan's words, "a daily plebiscite," an act of personal volition. Jew, Provencal and Longuedocien were all citizens, and citizenship was nationality.
This, for the long-oppressed Jew, was deliverance. It opened avenues previously closed, and some led to the heart of power. Adolphe Cremieux, one of the first Jews to be a minister in a French government, held that a new Trinity had been created: God, the Revolution and the Republic of 1870. To these deities Jews owed their devotion.
Marc Bloch, the great French historian who was killed by the Nazis, declared, "The time of the Messiah came with the French Revolution." Before his execution, he declined the presence of a rabbi. "I will die as I lived," he said, "as a good Frenchman." For many, many years, even after Vichy, the peculiarity of Franco-Judaism was its intense patriotism.
But of course the Revolution was fiercely contested, and it divided France. Where the American Revolution ushered in a nation of citizens on relatively virgin soil, the French involved the destruction of an old order. As Toqueville remarked, Americans were lucky enough to be born equal, rather than having to become equal.
The French attempt to become equal was naturally a violent process. The effect of the Revolution, the historian Francois Furet once said, was to turn the French into "this strange people that cannot together like all their national history."
The old order was strongly represented in the Roman Catholic Church, and for the counterrevolutionaries it was natural to portray the forces out to destroy the Catholic soul of France in the name of secularism and egalitarianism as a collection of Jews, Protestants and Freemasons. In the trumped-up charges against Captain Alfred Dreyfus, the Angst of French society reached an apogee. The fact that Dreyfus, a Jew, had risen to represent a pillar of French tradition, the army, made the case explosive; for French anti-Semites, it showed that the danger was now within.
 
Revenge of Dreyfus
The cracks engendered by the Revolution never entirely disappeared, perhaps because they were not fully acknowledged. The rear-guard action continued to involve anti-Semitism. The Jew remained a potential proxy for all that was not traditionally French. For the influential writer Charles Maurras, Vichy was the "divine surprise," and his conviction for treason at the end of the war "the revenge of Dreyfus."
Of course, if three-fourths of France's Jewish population survived the war, it was precisely because many people rejected such attitudes and helped the Jews. Still, an easing of tensions after the war never involved a full accounting of what had happened under Vichy, and official attitudes to the Jews proved vulnerable to the politics of the Middle East. In a notorious phrase, de Gaulle, in 1967, called the Jews "an elite people, sure of itself and dominating."
The two sides of French society clung to their divisive myths: the church to its immaculacy, the Republic to the illusion that it had nothing to with Vichy's deportation to their deaths of 70,000 Jews.
Here, it seems, lies the critical importance of the events of the last few weeks. Both church and state have abandoned their pretensions. The church, by confessing to errors and begging the Jewish people for forgiveness, has adopted a position of striking modesty. It has, said Pierre Birnbaum, a sociologist, "Finally abandoned any notion that it represents some eternal France."
Similarly, after President Jacques Chirac's acknowledgment in 1995 that Vichy was the French state, the start of Mr. Papon's trial has exposed the human failings of the Republic. The fervent religion of republicanism -- one that many French Jews embraced -- has been dealt a blow, leaving more space for the reasoned embrace of republican values.
These changes, Mr. Birnbaum suggested, could herald a France with its old battles behind it, a more adaptable France shorn of its divisive myths. "Without quite embracing an American multiculturalism, we are turning toward a more pluralist model," he said. Certainly, a Jewish community invigorated by the arrival of large numbers of North African Jews has changed its attitudes: emancipation is no longer synonymous with the abandonment of Jewish traditions.
Resistance remains virulent. The National Front, with 15 percent of the vote, is now the third-largest party, and last week its paper, National Hebdo, bore the screaming headline "JUDAPO." This is the acronym the party uses for what it calls "politically organized Judaism," the malevolent force it sees behind the Papon trial and the bishops' statement of repentance.
The Front is the standard bearer of a new rightist coalition, bolstered by France's 3.6 million unemployed, if largely deserted by the church. Its central theme is an old one: the degeneration of France through the pollution of traditional values. That pollution, for the National Front, has many sources: Arab immigration, globalization, Jews and the like. But for now this force seems unlikely to outweigh the powerful tug of a millennial reconciliation of the old French demons.

HEADLINE: Not So Fast;
Speed Has Hit the Wall

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
ON an ancient, dry lake bed in Nevada last week, a British team broke the sound barrier on land, 50 years after Chuck Yeager first did it in a plane. Just for fun, General Yeager reprised his performance again last week, this time making a routine flight in an Air Force jet. Also last week, more than 100 million Americans got to work by car and more than 10 million others took airplane flights. But they didn't get there any faster than the week before, the year before or the decade before.
The experiment in the Nevada desert showed that science can develop the technology for greater speed. Less remarked upon is the fact that there is probably not the means to put it to practical use. On land, sea and air, for reasons of economy, ecology, safety and mundane factors like congestion, people are not moving any faster these days -- a departure from centuries of advances in the speed of everyday travel. 
 "It's neat that they did it," said Mark Edwards, the head of the safety department at the American Automobile Association, commenting on the British speed team. "But I don't think it makes any difference to the average American." In fact, he said, the speed record had lost some of its allure since racers started using jet engines instead of internal-combustion engines; he called the Thrust SSC, which set the record, "a military plane with the wings sawed off."
 
Slowing Down
Even though every now and then some whiz-bang technology lets someone break a speed record, ordinary vehicles are tending to move slower, in a reversal of a long trend.
Take ships. The Titanic was a marvel in 1912 partly because it cruised at 22 knots, about 24 miles per hour -- pretty swift for the time. Forty years later another passenger liner, the United States, crossed the North Atlantic (with considerably more success) at 36.8 knots. But the Queen Elizabeth 2, launched in 1969 after the speed derby had been lost to airplanes, was built to cruise at only 32 knots, and today passenger liners no longer race across the Atlantic. Pretty much the only big passenger ships afloat now are cruise ships, which amble from port to port at 14 to 18 knots. And hydrofoils -- the ballyhooed speedboats that ride just above the water at speeds of up to 40 knots -- seem to have gone the way of supersonic transports: there are some, but they haven't really caught on. Problems include cost and environmental considerations.
In the air, the costly Concorde, the only supersonic passenger plane, is a prime example of the speed versus practicality problem. Introduced in 1975 and capable of flying 1,336 miles per hour, it now appears to be at a technological and economic dead end. Beyond the national airlines of Britain and France, which built it, no other airline bought one, and it is not clear when anyone will build another supersonic plane. For a long time commercial planes went faster and faster. A benchmark was set in January 1970, when Pat Nixon christened the first Boeing 747 in commercial service; it could cruise at over 600 miles per hour. Now Boeing's new 777 usually flies at only about 500 miles per hour. That's plenty fast enough to keep up with traffic in the sky, which gets denser all the time.
Around the United States, many trains run slower now than they did 40 years ago because railroads decided to scrap expensive and complicated high-speed signaling equipment. Amtrak's metroliners reach 120 miles an hour between Washington and Boston, not much different from 40 years ago. Amtrak is trying to replace its Metroliners with American Flyers that will go 150, but the railroad's financial survival is not assured. Europe and Japan are still pushing trains to greater speeds, though.
 
Reaching the Limit
The question becomes: Are mere mortals pushing up against some kind of natural speed limit?
In the world of everyday travel, it would seem that way. Cars really can't go much faster (legally anyway) largely because of traffic and speed limits to insure people's safety. And every air traveler knows about airport congestion and delays -- the practical problems of getting from one place to another quickly.
With speed, the envelope isn't being pushed so much as it is being filled, with more people. Even if planes are not getting faster, the number of people riding in them is climbing rapidly. In this country, there will be almost 550 million passenger boardings this year, and the industry anticipates almost 830 million by 2008. It does not anticipate faster planes, though.
"I think speed has reached a limit," said Matthew Lynn, a British journalist and author of a recent aviation history, "Birds of Prey: Boeing vs. Airbus" (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1997). "The Concorde halved the journey time from London to New York from six hours to three hours, but the number of people prepared to pay for the extra hours was never that great.
"You could put the same argument to the supersonic car," he added. "If they could sell it to you, your journey time to your office might go from 1 hour to 4 minutes, and you'd pay something for that. I don't know what this car costs, but you wouldn't pay $2 million -- A, because you haven't got it, and B, wouldn't be worth it." Among other problems, he said, would be finding a road to drive it on.
In Washington, the Government is supporting a major push for improvements in cars, but these would be in fuel consumption, emissions and safety. Maintaining acceleration is on the list, but speed isn't.
There are some long-term long-shots, like "intelligent highways" where computer controls allow cars to travel bumper to bumper at 80 miles per hour. But don't hold your breath.
"That just sounds awful," said Ivan Amato, an expert on technology and author of another new book, "Stuff, The Materials the World is Made Of" (Basic Books, 1997). "There you are 10 yards behind and in front of some other car, or maybe 10 feet, and maybe you can get people up to 70 or 80 miles per hour." Then, he said, what happens when one car stops?
 
Virtual Travel
Still, some experts say that if cars could go 20 percent faster on highways, highways could handle 20 percent more cars, without adding any new lanes. It sounds as futuristic as, well, a supersonic car.
In some parts of Europe, of course, speed reigns. The Germans have some roads without speed limits, where a 175-mile-per-hour sports car can actually approach 175 miles per hour. But this is the exception, not the rule.
And even in Europe, there are moves to slow things down. This month the Swedish Parliament adopted "Vision Zero," a goal to eliminate road deaths. It calls for traffic humps and other devices to reduce speed, and lets local governments cut speed limits to 30 kilometers per hour (about 20 mph) from 50 kilometers per hour.
Some things go faster, of course. Runners, for example, are always breaking records. And an important factor making travel, and travel speed, less essential is ever-swift communications.
"I think technology has moved elsewhere, to computers," said Mr. Lynn. "You can now get from New York to a virtual London, and do that instantly."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Becoming Unstuck On the Suburbs

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
PLYWOOD has a lifespan of 40 years. Over time, the glue that holds plywood together dries up. Then, walls buckle, split and peel. Panels pop loose. Rooms, doors and windows morph into trick-or-treat versions of themselves. Suburban America, this is to say, is becoming unstuck.
Fifty years ago, the first Levittown opened in Hempstead, N.Y. A planned community of 17,000 identical houses, Levittown instantly became the prototype for the mass suburban development that would pour over the countryside in the decades to come, displacing pastures, potato fields and orange groves with affordable versions of the American dream. 
 Fifty minus 40 equals a nice round 10. The postwar suburban dream is now entering its second decade of physical obsolescence, and there's not much Martha Stewart can do about it. No wallpaper pattern, potpourri scent or colonial stencil can reverse the effect of passing time on the ranch houses, Cape Cods and saltboxes that millions of Americans have called home. What planners call the first-ring suburb, the belt of single-family houses built between 1947 and 1977 around metropolitan cores, is fast wearing out. But some planners believe that the recycling of the first ring is the key to determining the way that Americans will live in the next 50 years.
The social glue in these communities has also weakened. The population of the first ring is aging. The parents of the baby-boomers, the Depression Era generation that pioneered what the historian Kenneth T. Jackson called the crabgrass frontier, are long retired. Houses are not only physically decrepit; their designs are out of date. As recently as 1978, 79 percent of the residents in the first-ring suburbs of Minneapolis were members of one-job, two-parent nuclear families. By 1996, the proportion had declined to 28 percent. Zoning prevents the redesign of suburban houses and the subdivision of lots to meet the needs of the new population.
The relationship between suburb and city -- bedroom communities and urban workplaces -- has been eroded by edge cities, office parks, and second and third rings. This new suburban configuration is poorly served by public transportation. The commercial corridors that once linked housing, jobs, shopping and social services now connect mainly to car dealerships, fast food outlets, big box superstores and other overly identified flying objects of the free-floating American landscape.
New, poorer first-ring residents find it hard to gain access to a physically dispersed job market. The transition from an industrial to a service economy has undermined the security of the blue-collar middle class. In short, the first ring is in a state of emergency similar to that suffered by the cities suburbanites fled.
 
City to Suburbs: Drop Dead
No doubt many city dwellers would love to see that headline. After all, aren't suburbanites the people who left the city to rot? Who drained the city of middle-class stability? Who abandoned the public realm in pursuit of private gratification? Who cares if their ticky-tacky walls come tumbling down?
In fact, according to William Morrish, a professor of architecture at the University of Minnesota, the older center cities have a major stake in the future of the first ring. Mr. Morrish, director of the university's Design Center for Urban American Landscape, points out that 40 years ago, first-ring suburbs defined the metropolitan edge. Today, they have been repositioned from the edge to the middle. A deteriorating first ring gives investors and corporations one more reason to bypass cities altogether in favor of the second and third rings. Why jump into an even larger rotting core?
Moreover, the border separating the urban center from the first ring has become porous. Suburbanites fear the spread of crime and other social problems from the city, but the reverse can also happen. Rundown suburban communities can destabilize adjacent city neighborhoods. Inadequate schools and libraries can serve as a reverse magnet, propelling first-ring dwellers toward already overtaxed amenities in the city.
Thus far, the first ring's predicament has drawn scant official attention; it doesn't look as apocalyptic as inner-city blight. Buckling plywood may make an ideal subject for "This Old House," but not for the evening news. And there is a perception that Federal and state governments have already done too much for suburbs at cities' expense: Highways, mortgage programs, artificially low prices for gas.
In recent years, new ways of thinking have emerged to grapple with suburban development. The Congress for the New Urbanism, a group founded in 1993, has drawn nationwide attention for advocating compact communities composed of neo-traditional houses. Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, two of the group's founders, came to prominence with the planning of Seaside, an elite resort town on Florida's Gulf Coast.
The Congress has concentrated its energies more on improving the design of new suburban developments than on rehabilitating old ones. Still, its annual conferences have helped foster a corps of architects and planners who specialize in suburban redevelopment. And it has increased public awareness that the city has spread far beyond its historic 19th-century dimensions.
By contrast, the Design Center for American Urban Landscape has less faith in architectural esthetics. Physical solutions alone will not solve economic, social and political problems, Mr. Morrish says. With his wife, Catherine R. Brown, a landscape architect, he has developed an approach based on coordinating public policy, town planning and environmentally responsible design.
In 1995, the center embarked on a two-year project devoted to reversing first-ring decline. Sponsored by the McKnight Foundation of Minneapolis, the enterprise, Community Connections, has thus far focused on suburban communities encircling the Twin Cities. Next year, the group will sponsor the first national conference on first-ring issues.
Mr. Morrish and Ms. Brown begin with the assumption that the first ring confronts planners with an unprecedented historical condition. They believe it should be seen as a testing ground for new urban models. As an example, he points to the recycling of National Boulevard, a decayed industrial strip in Culver City, outside Los Angeles.
Over the the past decade, Frederick Smith, a developer, and Eric Owen Moss, a leading California architect, have gradually converted several large factory sheds into offices for graphic designers, movie makers and other media-related firms. The result is an impressive fusion of economic renewal, innovative design and cultural awareness. Factories left empty by the export of manufacturing were transformed into a lively boulevard of the informational city.
National Boulevard illustrates a basic principle of the Community Connections project: rejuvenating aging major commercial and transit corridors. It advocates relaxing zoning rules to allow greater density and to give homeowners more freedom to alter their houses. Community-based organizations, this thinking goes, should provide social services.
 
Counting on the Wives
There is an important cultural dimension to this group's work. That is the argument, implicit in much of the new thinking about suburban redevelopment, that the first-ring suburbs are trapped by cultural forces as well as by physical and economic ones. Their problems are hard to solve in part because many Americans prefer not to acknowledge that the cultural conditions that produced them no longer exist.
It is not an accident, for example, that the first ring is poor in mass transit and other services. In the postwar decades, the wife provided many of the services. She shopped, drove and helped organize community as well as domestic life. Her entrance into the work force deprived the suburbs of a key component of its basic infrastructure.
Yet it is deceptive to regard the one-job, two-parent nuclear family as traditional. As the political analyst Kevin Phillips documented in "Boiling Point" (Random House, 1993), the Levittown family was a historical aberration produced by postwar prosperity, a blip that lasted less than 30 years. Most 18th- and 19th-century wives worked, albeit often at farm chores rather than as part of the outside work force.
The suburbs lured millions of Americans into thinking they had found the new repository of American virtues. Half a century after Levittown, that dream is coming apart at the seams.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Levittown at 50: No More Potato Fields -- When William J. Levitt started mass-producing small inexpensive houses on Long Island potato fields, the country had a severe housing shortage. Today a rare find is a Levitt Cape that hasn't grown as much as the trees the developer planted (above); the house to its right once was identical. Lawns still are prominent (left). But beyond Levittown's grown-up neighborhoods is another familiar suburban sight, highway sprawl (upper left). (Photographs by Chris Maynard for The New York Times)

MERGERS
Another Suitor for MCI
Joining America's richest corporate takeover battle ever, the once-stodgy GTE, the nation's third-largest local telephone company, made an unsolicited $28 billion offer for MCI Communications. That's $2 billion less and two weeks later than a bid in stock from upstart Worldcom. The original suitor, British Telecommunications, with three board seats and 20 percent of MCI's shares, may now emerge as kingmaker... An Italian insurer, Generali, made a hostile $9 billion bid for AGF of France, and the Zurich Group agreed to take over B.A.T. Industries' insurance business, creating one of the world's biggest financial services companies....Is accounting's Big Six (only a few years ago it was Big Eight) about to become Big Four? Ernst & Young and KPMG Peat Marwick are expected to announce a merger, although neither would confirm it on Friday. Coopers & Lybrand and Price Waterhouse have already agreed to merge.
 
MARKETS
Earnings or Expectations?
It has become a mantra on Wall Street: the market is earnings-driven. Actually, it's greed-driven. Or, to put the matter more sophistically, is the existential question reality (earnings) or illusion (expectations thereof)? Compaq Computer reported a 41.6 percent profit increase on Thursday, topping the consensus forecast by 3 cents a share, but the market slashed 6 percent from its share price. The Street wanted more. Ford reached a 52-week high of $50.25 on Monday, beat forecasts with a 64 percent profit gain on Wednesday and saw its share price nibbled; G.M.also had solid earnings but slipped in price. Merck had a 19 percent increase but was a penny below estimates. Traders pushed its shares down 4.5 percent, and it helped grease the skids under the Dow, which finished the week at 7,847.03, off 198.17. Intel reported earnings of 88 cents a share, 3 cents below forecasts, and its shares, too, were pounded, despite news of an ultrafast microprocessor chip that it is developing with Hewlett-Packard. The Nasdaq composite lost 77.18 TK for the week, closing at 1,666.85. But the houses behind all this trading did well. Big profit gains were reported by Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, Travelers, Bear Stearns and other Wall Street firms.
 
GOLDMAN, SACHS
Teachers for a Day
To be fair, some on Wall Street are taking time off from doing well to do good. Some 2,000 employees of Goldman, Sachs & Company, from secretaries through investment bankers, are serving as teachers for a day in New York City public schools. Besides giving lessons on basic business concepts, they hope to demonstrate to students that successful business people are not that different from them. Andy Derrow, above, skips rope in Inwood. "In a lot of these neighborhoods the most successful business person is the local drug dealer," said Peter Mertens, executive vice president of Junior Achievement of New York, which coordinates the volunteers.
 
NOBEL LAUREATES
A $1 Million Formula
Since the Bank of Sweden began awarding the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1969, Americans have dominated the list of winners the way the Yankees once dominated the American League. This year Robert C. Merton, right, of the Harvard Business School and Myron S. Scholes, left, a Canadian-born professor emeritus at the Stanford Business School, will share the $1 million award for helping to devise a mathematical formula published in 1973 to answer a simple but seemingly insurmountable problem confronting Wall Street: how to measure the worth of an option? Their solution served as a foundation for today's vast global marketplace.
 
AUTOS
A Clean, Lean Machine
Toyota beat its rivals -- not only Nissan and Honda, but also Detroit's Big Three and Volkswagen -- in unveiling the world's first gasoline-electric hybrid car. Hiroshi Okuda, Toyota's president, climbs into the car, the Prius, which the company said got as much as 66 miles a gallon during test drives while emitting only half the carbon dioxide of a regular gasoline engine. It will sell for $17,700 in Japan -- a loss leader, since analysts estimate it costs $41,000 to produce each one. Consider the difference an advertising expenditure, they said, as Toyota cloaks itself in the mantle of environmental leader. It may be sold in the United States in about six months, Toyata said.
 
NEW ORLEANS
The House Goes Bust
New Orleans, whose unofficial motto is "let the good times roll," has rolled snake eyes. Casino gambling, legalized by the Louisiana Legislature in the early 1990's, was to sweeten the city's allure to tourists and challenge Las Vegas and Atlantic City for a piece of the action. But over the last three years, all three downtown riverboat casinos, including the Flamingo, above, have foundered on economic, regulatory and legal difficulties. The city's only land-based casino has folded, too. Analysts cited high taxes on the take -- 18.5 percent, compared with an average of 7 percent elsewhere -- as a chief problem. Hillary Crain, chairman of the State Gaming Control Board, called for "some creative financing."
 
THE ECONOMY
The Taming of Inflation
Retail sales rose three-tenths of 1 percent in September and were revised upward for July and August. That pushed down bond prices on Wednesday, but analysts contended that the gain masked an economy that was actually decelerating. Indeed, the Consumer Price Index for September edged up a less-than-expected two-tenths of 1 percent. Because of inflation's slowdown, Americans who receive Social Security and other Federal benefits will receive an increase of only 2.1 percent in January, the second-smallest since automatic cost-of-living adjustments began in 1975.

HEADLINE: LEGACY OF THE '87 CRASH;
The Next Crash Foretold, or Maybe Not

 BODY:
When will the next crash come, and why? Here, from a game group of financial professionals and one layman, are some answers, including several that dispute the premise.
 
Burton G. Malkiel
Professor of Economics, Princeton University
 The next crash will occur for some unexpected reason. It could be Iran and Iraq go to war again and the supply of oil is curtailed, or there is a revolution in the former Soviet countries. I think it is basically unpredictable and the timing is unpredictable.
 What concerns me is hearing so many investors say the market's been going up 15 to 20 percent for years and therefore it will continue to go up. I also worry about that so-called New Era thing, that the business cycle has been repealed and we are in a new world where the old relationships don't hold. We said the same thing in 1929. I do not believe it is correct.
 
Byron R. Wien
Chief United States strategist, Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company
A crash could happen sometime, but I don't think it is likely to happen soon, and if it does it will be for different reasons than in 1987. A confluence of fundamental and technical factors led to that crash. The stock market was extraordinarily overvalued back then, interest rates were rising and we were just feeling our way with equity derivative products.
Today, the market is not as overvalued and we have learned a lot more about equity derivative products. An important culprit of the '87 crash, portfolio insurance, is no longer part of the mix. On a scale of 1 to 10, my level of concern about a crash is about a 3.
 
Harald B. Malmgren
President, the Malmgren Group, trade and financial consultants in Washington
A market correction of as much as 15 percent is possible. But then everyone will be back, chasing yield. That is so because the American economy, objectively, is by far the most attractive capital market in the world. The banking and manufacturing crises are behind the U.S. market. Interest rates are low. No other country or region has those fundamental positives. Japan is in bad shape. Southeast Asia has problems and Europe, which has very heavy social burdens, will have turbulence.
In addition, the populace of the advanced countries is getting older and the pension funds, be they public or private, are looking hard at how to raise yield. The pressure is greatest in Japan -- the source of about one-third of the world's savings and a country which has a huge percentage of that savings in fixed-income investments.
 
Edward Yardeni
Chief economist, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
In 1999, there is an increasing likelihood of a 20 percent decline in stock prices, as investors become concerned about the year 2000 problem, in which many computer systems, if not fixed in time, will recognize 00 as 1900 rather than 2000.
This is a trivial yet overwhelming problem that is unlikely to be 100 percent repaired by 2000, and there are bound to be economic disruptions. No one can be certain if those will be relatively minor and uneventful, or serious enough to cause a recession.
 
Ron Chernow
Author, "The House of Morgan" and "The Death of the Banker"
The same bountiful cash that has buoyed the stock market and financed new technologies has also created a surplus of everything from espresso bars to giant bookstores. Within a year or two, we will be sated with miracle gadgets and will need time to digest the excess. So I worry about overcapacity and deflation more than resource shortages and rising wages.
Though I can picture a thunderous correction that might feel suspiciously like a crash, 'a la 1987, we are probably safe until the gluts translate into lower profits. A repeat of the 1929 crash is unlikely since so many investors are now prisoners of retirement plans and cannot desert financial assets for sustained periods.
 
James S. Chanos
President of Kynikos Associates, a money-management firm that specializes in short-selling
 A more important question than a crash is what might cause the next bear market. Crashes and panics are relatively short-term affairs, with lots of causes. The last traditional bear market was in 1990; people forget that it was occasioned by falling interest rates. I think we will have another bear market in our lifetime. The question is how bad it will be and how investors will handle themselves.
 
Thom Rogers
Software engineer in Denver
I'm not concerned. I subscribe to the view that things have improved so much with the global economy. There's a cachet to things American that didn't used to exist. There's a sense here that anything is possible.
Granted, I'm not old enough to remember '29, but excess lending went on then. And I just don't see other alternatives. If you're a guy like me, 40 to 45 years old, you're not going to put your money in the bank.
 
G. Kenneth Heebner
Manager of the CGM Capital Development fund, one of the best-performing stock funds of 1987.
If we have a big market decline, it will happen slowly, not suddenly like it did in 1987. Since then, confidence has grown enormously that stock prices will always bounce back. The depth of that conviction will not be destroyed in a short period of time.
In the last big market decline, it took five years, from 1969 to 1974, for the mood to go from euphoria to despair. Plus, we've now set up a whole new industry of investment advisers, which has created a process of looking at Morningstar reports and selecting a five-star fund. That has given mutual fund investors a perception of safety and protection -- which, in reality, isn't there.
 
Richard C. Breeden
Former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
For the average person, those of us who are not Alan Greenspan, we can't expect that we're going to spot the trigger of a potential problem. So I shouldn't invest more than I am capable of losing or having become illiquid. The question is: Can you ride through? Can you pay the rent, keep food on the table, send your kids to college? The question to ask yourself is: If the market did shut down, would I be all right?

Graphs: "Then and Now"
Since 1987, the financial world has changed immensely, and not at all. Graphs show statistical snapshots.
 
THE STOCK MARKET
Traditional yardsticks that said stocks were overpriced in 1987 have been left even further behind in 1997; trading is busier than ever.
 
ON WALL STREET
Stock offerings have kept pace with the bull market; mergers and acquisitions have grown faster, though paying for them with junk bonds is less common.
 
MUTUAL FUNDS
The number of funds has tripled and their assets have quintupled; most of the money is now in equities.
 
ON MAIN STREET
Unemployment and inflation are lower and households now have nearly twice as much of their wealth in stocks.
 
INTEREST RATES
Inflation seems a more distant threat in 1997 than it did in 1987; interest rates are lower, and bond yields include smaller premiums for inflation risk.

HEADLINE: In America;
Days of Terror

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The bonfire was symbolic, as was the noose that dangled from a lower limb of the willow oak outside 29 East Fourth Street in the East Village. The film maker Ric Burns was shooting a scene for his 10-hour PBS documentary history of New York City. The events symbolized by the fire and the noose, collectively known as the draft riots, took place in July 1863. It was a period of panic and terror that is difficult to imagine today.
The story is not well known. Historians and other chroniclers tend to give it a nod and move on. It's as if the city were still ashamed. 
 "It was the largest civil insurrection in American history other than the South's rebellion," said Eric Foner, the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University.
The rioting began on July 13, a hot and muggy Monday morning. Enormous crowds, enraged by the wartime draft imposed by the Lincoln Administration, surged through several neighborhoods in Manhattan, heading at various times toward Central Park and the draft board offices at Third Avenue and 46th Street and Broadway and 29th Street. The people in the crowds were mostly poor and mostly Irish and they carried with them a long litany of resentments.
The war had already driven prices up and wages had not kept pace. Moreover, the Army had broken strikes in New York City just a year earlier. Abraham Lincoln was not seen as a friend of the economically distressed immigrants and sons of immigrants who were now subject to the draft. They saw no reason to fight and possibly die in a war that they assumed would result in tremendous numbers of Negroes being freed and coming North to compete with poor Irish immigrants for jobs.
Men could legally avoid the draft by paying a fee of $300. But that was not an option for workers with families who were lucky to make $500 in a year. The existence of the fee only fueled the resentment of the poor.
More and more people, men, women and children, took to the streets that Monday morning. The rhetoric and the passions escalated and at some point the crowds went wild.
Certain types of people were subject to attack on sight. They included police officers, known Republicans, anyone who looked prosperous and, especially, Negroes. Mobs went from house to house, pillaging and burning. The Colored Orphan Asylum at Fifth Avenue and 43d Street was invaded and the children were driven out. One of the orphans, 10-year-old Jane Barry, was killed when a bureau dropped from the window of an upper floor landed on her head.
While many people were murdered, the atrocities committed against blacks during the four days of rioting were at least as grotesque as anything that ever emanated from the Deep South. A disabled black coachman named Abraham Franklin was dragged from his home by a mob and hanged from a lamppost. "In a grisly denouement," wrote Iver Bernstein in his 1990 book, "The New York City Draft Riots," "16-year-old Irishman Patrick Butler dragged Mr. Franklin's body through the streets by the genitals as the crowd applauded."
Mr. Bernstein added: "After yet another hanging . . . rioters cut off their black victim's fingers and toes."
No one knows how many people were lynched. Maybe 15, 18, a couple of dozen. William Jones was hanged from a tree on Clarkson Street. Then a fire was set beneath the body so the leaping flames could burn his flesh.
Other blacks were forced into rivers and drowned.
The rioting raged out of control until Thursday. Police officers, in some cases armed only with sticks and clubs, fought several desperate battles with mobs that at times numbered in the thousands.
"New York was tipping toward anarchy," said Mr. Burns, who is making the documentary with a colleague, Lisa Ades. "There was a real question whether it was possible to maintain order in a humane way."
More than 100 people were killed and some estimates put the toll at 1,000 or more. Many thousands were injured. Whole neighborhoods were destroyed. Order was not restored until Federal troops that had been called back from Gettysburg took command of the streets.
The most lasting lesson of the draft riots was a fundamental one. The middle and upper classes, shaken and appalled, vowed never again to allow the city to spiral so far out of control. That led to the beginning of modern law enforcement in New York.

HEADLINE: Libya Is Reported to Lobby to Settle Pan Am Explosion Case

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Apparently encouraged by African and Asian support for its campaign to have United Nations sanctions lifted, Libya is lobbying the families of people killed in the explosion of a Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988 in the hope of persuading them to settle the case, the mother of one victim says.
Libya has been under limited sanctions forbidding international air traffic in or out of the North African country because it has refused to turn over for trial in Scotland two Libyan suspects the United States and Britain want to see tried. 
 Susan Cohen, the mother of Theodora Cohen, who was 20 when Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, said in an interview that families in the United States received a letter early this month from Libya's United Nations representative drawing attention to speeches made in support of his country in this fall's General Assembly debate.
The letter said that only Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain objected in speeches to Libya's request to have the sanctions lifted before the suspects are extradited.
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, has made various offers over the years, most recently agreeing to have the two tried under Scottish law and by Scottish judges -- but not in Scotland. He has suggested a trial in a third country, or at the International Court of Justice. Britain and the United States have rejected the offer. This week, Libyans have been in The Hague, arguing that the International Court should take over the case.
Libya has been accused of being behind not only the destruction of Pan Am 103, with the loss of 270 lives, but also the explosion that destroyed a French airliner over Niger in 1989, in which 171 people died.
Mrs. Cohen, who lives in Cape May Courthouse, N.J., said families of the Lockerbie victims were divided about how to keep their campaign alive, with some relatives urging others to accept compensation from the Libyans. She said a group of lawyers has been asking American families to settle out of court.
A similar offer is making some headway in Britain, she said, as is backing for Libya's plan to hold a trial in a third country.
"I am very worried about this," Mrs. Cohen said. "I don't want Qaddafi to get away with a payoff. My life's been destroyed by this."
Some families have filed a civil suit hoping to settle with the Libyan Government. But Libya's main purpose in lobbying the families is to get their agreement for a trial outside of Scotland, which would open the way to removing the sanctions.
Recently, the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity adopted positions sympathetic to Libya. Many diplomats are convinced that enthusiasm for continuing sanctions has been steadily waning.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, current chairman of the Organization of African Unity, told the General Assembly in his speech that the settlement of the Lockerbie case and the lifting of sanctions were of great concern to Africans.
"In addition to the families of those who lost their lives, many other innocent third persons continue to suffer as a result of the sanctions imposed on Libya," Mr. Mugabe said.
A debate over the high human cost of sanctions, particularly prolonged sanctions, has been steadily building at the United Nations. Relief organizations are most concerned about Iraq, which has been under a comprehensive embargo since 1990, with no relief in sight.

HEADLINE: Best-Paid College Leader Is at Northeastern U.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
When John A. Curry resigned as president of Northeastern University last year, he received $711,358 in an early-retirement and severance package in addition to his base salary of $284,000. The total of $995,358 made him the most highly paid college president in the nation in the 1995-1996 academic year, according to an annual survey of private colleges and universities conducted by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The next most highly paid executive, Joe B. Wyatt, who is the chancellor of Vanderbilt University, received $479,072. Seven other presidents received more than $400,000. 
 The 22-page survey of pay and benefits is based on data gathered from Federal tax returns filed by 477 of the nation's leading institutions of higher education. It will appear in the issue dated Oct. 24, due out on Monday.
The tax returns studied were the latest available.
Dr. Curry declined to be interviewed, but George F. Matthews, chairman of Northeastern's board of trustees, said that Dr. Curry's large compensation was a one-time event and reflected "his absolutely sensational 35-year career at Northeastern."
"He nearly doubled our endowment, pushed student S.A.T. scores up more than 80 points, oversaw a $100 million building program and greened the campus, which won an award from Barbara Bush as one of the best-looking urban campuses," Mr. Matthews said. "If he had done that in the business world, his compensation would have been a lot more."
Janet Hookailo, a spokeswoman for Northeastern, said that the breakdown of Dr. Curry's benefits package included a $295,000 buyout of a five-year teaching contract and a $100,000 bonus for "exemplary service," recommended by the school's trustees.
Northeastern, in Boston, has 11,000 full-time undergraduate students, mostly from the Boston area, but it has more than twice that number counting part-time students, as well. Tuition, fees, room and board amount to $20,468.
Michael Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Vanderbilt, in Nashville, said that Dr. Wyatt's compensation reflected the facts that under his leadership the university's endowment grew to $1.3 billion from $200 million, that academic programs have "risen dramatically in quality" and that Dr. Wyatt's 15-year tenure makes him one of the most senior of the leaders of major research universities in the nation.
Dr. Peter Diamandopoulos of Adelphi appeared near the top of the list because he was still active, and highly paid, at $421,070, as the president of Adelphi University in the 1995-96 academic year. He and the trustees of Adelphi were dismissed by the New York State Board of Regents in February.
A spokeswoman for Hofstra University, Valarie Zurblis, said that Dr. James M. Shuart's benefits had been unusually high, $411,922, because they included a deferred compensation package intended to go into effect when he retired at 65. But the school's trustees persuaded Dr. Shuart not to retire and therefore he received two sources of income in the 1995-97 academic year.
Kevin Cox, a spokesman for Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, N.C., said that Dr. Thomas K. Hearn Jr.'s salary and benefits, $447,748, had been justified by the trustees because he must oversee not only the undergraduate college but also graduate programs, the business school, the law school, the medical school and plans for a divinity school scheduled to open in 1999.
Scott Jaschik, deputy managing editor of the weekly newspaper for academicians, said that Form 990, the Internal Revenue Service form used in the study, might not provide a complete picture of compensation at private colleges because some institutions may have found ways to hide parts of the money or benefits that they give their chief executives.
"These forms are the best possible source of information we have, but of course it's not perfect," Mr. Jaschik said.
The average total pay and benefits for presidents of research universities was $333,239. It was $176,482 at doctorate-granting universities, and $170,180 at baccalaureate institutions.
About half of the nearly 400 presidents who worked full years in the 1995-96 academic year had pay increases of at least 4 percent while the national rate of inflation was 2.8 percent.
Presidents were not the most highly paid professionals in academe. Seven professors of medicine reported pay and benefits of more than $1 million, and another dozen professors of medicine earned more than $800,000.
Coaches and athletic directors were also highly paid. The top earner was John Robinson, head football coach at the University of Southern California, who was paid $484,250 in salary and $20,766 in benefits.

HEADLINE: Argentina Backs U.S. In Restricting Global Gases

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: NAHUEL HUAPI NATIONAL PARK, Argentina, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Framed by the ancient Patagonian wilderness, President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina appeared with President Clinton here today to endorse Mr. Clinton's call for developing nations to join developed ones in restricting gases that contribute to global warming.
Under pressure at home and abroad to address global warming, Mr. Clinton is seeking to negotiate binding limits on emissions for all countries, including developing ones. Many of those countries say industrialized countries that have benefited most from polluting should bear the costs of addressing it. 
 Mr. Menem declared "we agree with the United States when you say that a global problem such as climate change requires a global answer, coming from all countries."
But he also made clear that he expected the United States, the world's leader in emitting greenhouse gases, to bear the greatest burdens. Unless the United States takes on "the greatest of responsibilities," he said, "any achievement arrived at will be of short duration or not deep enough."
After rarely addressing the issue in his first term, Mr. Clinton began to sound an alarm over the summer that climate change could cause flooding, drought and outbreaks of disease. He is preparing for a December conference in Japan at which more than 150 nations plan to negotiate over reducing greenhouse gases. Talks to prepare for that meeting are to begin in Germany on Monday.
Mr. Clinton is seeking what he calls "realistic and binding" limits for greenhouse gas emissions by all nations. But he has not completed his proposal on limits, and it is far from clear what mechanism he would want -- or what Mr. Menem, or any other leader, might accept -- to enforce such restrictions. Mr. Clinton plans to announce his emissions proposal later this week.
During the announcement by the two Presidents today in this remote and stunning park, pollution seemed a distant problem. As they stood on a hillside here, a blue wrinkled lake stretched away behind them and all around stood iron-gray Andean crags, joined by razorback ridges and surmounted by snow.
The two countries agreed to enact "joint implementation," under which a company in one of the countries can receive credits for reducing emissions by helping a company in the other to cut greenhouse gases. The program is intended to speed the spread of effective environmental technologies to developing countries.
In his remarks today, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that industrialized countries produce most greenhouse gases, although industrial groups and some scientists argue that uncertainty about the climate justifies the delaying action on . "But emissions from the developing world are expected to grow dramatically," he said. "Forty years from now, they will exceed those of developed countries."
Mr. Clinton's aides said that they regard Argentina as a developing nation. But because it is one of the most industrialized Latin American countries, with a high per-capita income, the aides said Argentina was particularly attractive as a partner in emissions control.
"These are precisely the guys we need to get," said one senior White House aide. "We don't need the desperately poor countries."
Mr. Clinton planned to fly home overnight tonight after his weeklong Latin American trip, devoted primarily to promoting his goals for free trade in the hemisphere. He has also spoken regularly about global warming. Brazil and Venezuela, the other countries he visited, have not yet agreed to a declaration like the one issued here today.
Jim Steinberg, Mr. Clinton's deputy national security adviser, praised Argentina's move as a "concrete commitment to the idea there should be emissions limits."
He acknowledged that no mechanism was spelled out for enforcing any limits but said "it would not be meaningful, in our view, unless there were some assurances" that the limits would be met.
Industrial groups and some scientists argue that uncertainty about the climate justifies delaying action on such limits.
Five years ago, at an environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro, the United States and other industrialized nations agreed to reduce their emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. But most now acknowledge that they will not achieve that goal, and the United States is projected to be 13 percent above it.
To the dismay of environmentalists, some of Mr. Clinton's economic and environmental aides have urged him to delay until the year 2010 or beyond any deep reductions in pollution. By contrast, European nations, who would have an easier time restricting their emissions, have proposed reductions of 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010.

HEADLINE: ANALYSTS EXPECT HEALTH PREMIUMS TO RISE SHARPLY

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
After four years of near stability brought about by the spread of managed care, the premiums that most Americans pay for their health insurance are poised to rise significantly next year, industry groups and health care consultants report.
Many say the average charge for health benefits, deducted from paychecks, will go up at least 5 percent, or more than twice as much as wages and inflation have been rising. For very large employers with great negotiating clout, the increases could be smaller, they say. Such companies in California, for example, appear to be holding the line at 1 percent. But across the nation, at some small companies with older and illness-prone employees, analysts say, the premiums might rise as much as 30 percent. 
 "We're finding about a 5 to 10 percent increase across the board with our renewal rates" for managed care plans, said Mark Psleger, director of marketing for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in Chicago, which represents the nation's Blue Cross companies.
"I'm sorry; it's going to happen," said John C. Erb, a principal of the William M. Mercer benefits consulting firm who surveys employers on health care trends. Mr. Erb, who is based in Miami, said he had three large clients in the area. One negotiated a health benefit increase from its insurance company of 3.5 percent. "But one had 12 percent," he said, "and the other had about 6."
Chris Jennings, President Clinton's chief White House health care adviser, said: "Do I expect premiums to go up at a higher rate than in the last few years? The answer is probably yes."
But with most private industry contracts still being negotiated, with the economic impact hard to discern as yet and with costs stable in two big Government health insurance programs -- Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor -- Mr. Jennings said he did not yet see grounds for Government complaint or intervention.
Most experts doubt that the 1998 increases portend an explosion in premiums like that of the 1980's and early 1990's, which was driven by surging hospital and doctor fees. That led to Mr. Clinton's failed effort to overhaul the health care system, and to the proliferation of managed care plans that have achieved most of the cost savings that were one of the President's goals.
Many health industry analysts expected significant increases this year, too, as insurance companies and managed care organizations began trying to raise premiums to recapture profits that they were losing after they froze or cut premiums in the intensely competitive market for patients and their employers. And they had predicted that medical costs would increase by 5 to 10 percent in 1998, increasing the pressure to raise premiums.
But in contract negotiations this year, employers resisted the pressure. Thus, the average premium has risen just 2.1 percent this year, said Jon Gabel, director of the Center for Survey Research at KPMG Peat Marwick, a large accounting and consulting firm.
"But they underpriced their products," Mr. Gabel said. "They ran out of profits. And now they're trying to catch up."
This fall, one giant, often trend-setting employer, the Federal Government, agreed to substantial increases for the first time in five years. Nine million Federal employees, retirees and family members, from members of Congress to park rangers, are covered by contracts negotiated by the Office of Personnel Management. Under the 1998 contracts that the office signed last month, Federal employees face an average 8.5 percent increase under the 350 health plans covering them.
Because of the formula used to allocate payment of the premium, many employees will actually pay about 15 percent more each month, though still somewhat less than most private industry workers with equivalent coverage. The Government, which, like most employers, shares the cost of health insurance with its workers, will pay 6 percent more.
As a result, Federal workers who insure only themselves will see an average charge of $27.74, up from $24.42, for health care in their twice-monthly paychecks next year, an increase of 14 percent. The average charge for family coverage will rise 16 percent, from $54.15 to $62.79.
What is also driving the increase is an underlying 6 or 7 percent annual rise in medical cost inflation, a result of new technology and an aging population, said Edward Flynn, the personnel office's associate director for retirement and insurance.
Managed care programs helped purge the health care system of cost increases exceeding medical inflation, he said. "But there's a point at which the big gains from managed care begin to diminish," he said, and future gains will be much smaller. "All employers are going to face the same things we have this year," he said, "and I don't think they will be as successful as we have been."
Indeed, managed care groups can be expected to invoke the contracts they worked out for Federal employees in negotiations with private industry. "That program's a bellwether of what we'll see in rates," said Kate Paul, president of the Rocky Mountain division of Kaiser Permanente, a part of the nation's largest health maintenance organization.
The parent Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals has said it will lose money this year for the first time in its 50 years in business. Many other health care organizations and major insurance companies like Aetna, the Cigna Corporation and the Prudential Insurance Company of America are suffering losses this year or acute erosion of their profits.
The dynamics of the marketplace have shifted in other ways. In many communities, the fierce competition for customers has driven out some contenders, leaving those remaining freer to seek higher rates.
Meanwhile, doctors and hospitals, once pressed by insurers and health maintenance organizations to cut charges and fees if they wanted to participate in the organizations' programs and keep their patients, are now uniting into stronger bargaining groups. "They're not stupid," Mr. Erb of the Mercer firm said.
In addition, employees are demanding more choice in their health plans. In a reaction against the closed system of a health maintenance organization, in which patients make appointments with a "gatekeeper" doctor who can refer them only to specialists within the network, employees are choosing more open preferred-provider organizations and point-of-service plans that let them bypass gatekeepers and seek out specialists anywhere.
Greater choice also involves higher costs. Tom Bowser, executive vice president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City, predicts increases of 5 to 8 percent for H.M.O. members, but 9 to 12 percent for preferred provider organizations. For very small programs with disproportionately high numbers of chronically sick members, he predicts increases exceeding 30 percent.
Only the largest employers, and those in cities where competition for customers remains fierce, are expecting lower increases than the 5 percent or more that most face.

Rise in Health Premiums Of at Least 5% Is Expected
After four years of near stability brought about by the spread of managed care, the premiums that most Americans pay for their health insurance are poised to rise significantly next year, industry groups and health care consultants report.
Many say the average charge for health benefits, deducted from paychecks, will go up at least 5 percent, or more than twice as much as wages and inflation. 1
 
Interest Groups Join Debate
A diverse array of civic, religious, business and labor groups -- including the American Heart Association, the Gray Panthers and the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association -- are actively taking part in the often-arcane campaign finance debate over unregulated soft money, issue advertisements and political action committees. Their effect on the issue suggests that the procedural votes the Senate held this month are unlikely to be the last word. 1

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Republican Candidate;
A Mercurial Mayor's Confident Journey

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK and IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
There he is in the photos, aflame with conviction and heady with success: class president, editor on the law review, bold young prosecutor, No. 3 man at the Justice Department, crime-fighting United States Attorney, archenemy of the Mafia, the 107th Mayor of the City of New York. Quite a run!
And now, working from City Hall, Rudolph William Giuliani, 53, has become New York's one ubiquitous figure, hurrying from a burned-out building to a subway derailment to the bedside of a wounded police officer. He is Gotham's action hero, self-cast as the take-charge guy who is reliably among the first at every scene. 
 By most reckonings, including those of many adversaries, Mr. Giuliani has coupled this celebrity with effective leadership. A seemingly ungovernable city now seems responsive to discipline, its crime rate in a plunge, its tourist-stocked streets palpably safer.
Still, however many his accomplishments, there is something else striking about the Mayor: his temperament. He seems to believe in mayoral infallibility, at least so long as he is the Mayor. To question his righteousness is to risk his wrath. A devil's advocate often seems regarded as the devil himself.
Rudy Giuliani has been described as the best and worst of New York, combining its exceptional talent and its ruthless energy.
This makes for a strange set of paradoxes, for some of Mr. Giuliani's strengths are his weaknesses as well. The adept and decisive manager can be imperious, to the point where surveys show his manner to be his greatest political liability. The candidate who, according to polls, seems headed to an overpowering victory on Nov. 4, can unleash attacks on his opponent that verge on fury. The man with a clear vision of a safer, more livable city can be disdainful of even well-intentioned critics.
"He is a good mayor, but he'll never be a great one," said Edward I. Koch, once a committed ally who now says he will vote for him with a reluctant pull of the lever.
"He can't accept disagreement," Mr. Koch said. "When it occurs, he wants to destroy you. He goes for the jugular."
Despite -- or perhaps because of -- these contradictions, Mr. Giuliani has risen to become the city's most important politician of his generation, a nationally known figure with larger political aspirations.
To understand Mr. Giuliani's rise to City Hall, it helps to have a map of his boyhood and earlier career. Signposts include a Roman Catholic education, doting parents and prominent mentors. Directions come from schoolmates, teachers and colleagues.
The Mayor himself was a grudging participant in this article. For two months, his press office pledged cooperation only to withhold it.
Finally, just before publication, the Mayor agreed to be interviewed. He attributed his wariness to recent articles in several newspapers and magazines about rumors of an extramarital affair, which he has strongly denied. He also complained about what he called unfair political coverage in The New York Times.
Seated in a comfortable armchair in his office, however, the Mayor seemed relaxed and genial. He said he knew all too well that people thought he was harsh and overbearing. But at least on this occasion, such characterizations made him laugh.
"I've been accused of storming out of press conferences that I'd been at for 45 minutes," he said with a chuckle. "Maybe I just had to leave. Maybe I had to go to the bathroom. So I would say, 'That's the last question,' and walk out. The next day it would be written that I stormed out, or that I was bristling. It fits the stereotype."
Anyway, the perception often works to his advantage, the Mayor added, because when people meet him, they say, ' "Oh my God, he's very different from what I thought.' "
 
Parents
Strong Convictions And Early Instruction
A grandson of Italian immigrants, Rudy Giuliani grew up in richly Catholic surroundings, before Vatican II, with meatless Fridays and the mysteries of the Latin Mass. Goodness, he was taught, required diligence. And his teachers say that young Rudy, more than most, was hard-working and intellectually keen.
Immigrant struggle was a staple of family lore. His father, Harold, traced his roots to Florence and nearby Montecatini, and his mother, Helen, to Avellino and other towns near Naples. Their stories were many because their families were big.
Harold and Helen wanted a large family of their own, but year after year they were disappointed. Friends say that on May 28, 1944, when the Giulianis' only child was born, they considered him a miracle baby, a blessing born of prayer.
Harold and Helen took Rudy home to East Flatbush, Brooklyn. Harold supported his family by tending bar at a place he owned with a brother-in-law, near Kings County Hospital.
At home, Rudy grew up under the instructive hand of his parents and his maternal grandmother. Helen, according to her son, had excelled in high school and been a spelling champion. Her dream had been to be a teacher, but her chance at higher education was frustrated by financial difficulties and, later, the demands of motherhood.
Her son would be her only pupil. Biographies and history books were Helen's selections for reading aloud, even when Rudy was a toddler. Must-see TV included political conventions and the Kefauver hearings on organized crime.
Unlike her husband, Helen was a Republican, though she would switch over to the Democrats with the rise of that wonderful young Catholic, John F. Kennedy.
Of the two, Harold Giuliani, who died of cancer 16 years ago, was more of a churchgoer, attending Mass every week, his son said. Harold suffered bad eyesight and a weak heart. Tending bar did not fulfill the promise of his sharp mind.
"My father wasn't terribly successful, but he had no bitterness," the Mayor said, pausing for an afterthought: perhaps his father's need for achievement "was sort of pushed into me."
Harold was a forceful, gregarious person who had many friends, though Vincent Noce, whose father owned a funeral parlor near Harold's bar, also recalls a moody man whose smarts often inflated into arrogance.
During summers, with doors open and a huge fan blowing, the sound of Harold's voice blustered into the street. "If you were walking by the bar," Mr. Noce said, "you could hear him yelling, telling people, 'You don't know what the hell you're talking about!' "
The Mayor extols his father's warmth and generosity while also recalling an extremely direct man whose temper was sometimes the tripwire to unpredictable explosions.
Many of Harold's convictions were unshakable. Among those beliefs, the Mayor said, were a love of the Yankees -- bold for a bartender in Dodgers territory -- and a hatred of the Mafia, which gave Italian-Americans a bad name.
Harold also believed that life provided a continual series of tests -- of character, of friendship, of respect.
These tests occurred during times of tragedy and need. A real sign of friendship, the Mayor quoted his father as saying, is showing up "at wakes and funerals, not at weddings."
"At a wedding everyone is joyous. They don't need you."
 
School
A Quick Study Flirts With the Priesthood
Peter J. Powers, the Mayor's friend since high school and until August 1996 his first deputy, commends Mr. Giuliani's "incredible ability to assess a situation." Mr. Powers first observed it, he said, during their senior class trip to Washington. One night, he, Rudy and several others began a carpet-sopping water fight in their hotel. The manager, furious, ordered them to pack up and be downstairs in 10 minutes.
"Most of us were scared silly," Mr. Powers recalled. "We thought we'd get kicked out of school, never graduate. But Rudy just said, 'He's bluffing, and I'm going to bed.' And Rudy was right."
They attended Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn, run by the De La Salle Christian Brothers. Each parish in Queens and Brooklyn and on Long Island could send only two of its best male students.
For Rudy, the commute to Loughlin required a tedious ride on the Long Island Rail Road. When he was 7, his parents had joined the exodus to suburbia, first to Garden City, then to a split-level in North Bellmore.
Most of the enrollment at Loughlin came from working-class families -- Irish, Italian, Polish -- and nearly all went on to college. It was a rare chance for the sons of blue collars to be like those of blue bloods, good boys with good educations headed for good things.
"We thought he was going to become a priest," said a North Bellmore neighbor, Ray Jacobelli.
So did Rudy. Priests, brothers and nuns were so much a part of growing up Catholic that many young men and women felt the pull of a religious calling.
Indeed, at Loughlin, the air itself seemed consecrated. Each class began with a prayer: "Let us remember that we are in the holy presence of God."
Rudy thrived. "He was a bright kid, on the honor roll, a rather charming kind of person," said Brother Peter Bonventre, a school administrator. Fellow students recall his mischievous humor -- he could be quite the cutup. But some also thought him an oddball -- enthralled by the Kennedy family and so in love with opera that he started an opera club.
Rudy's best friends, Mr. Powers and Alan Placa, were club recruits, sharing in the world of Verdi and Puccini. The students would also double-date, their brotherly companionship often more important than the young women.
"After we'd drop off the girls, Rudy and I would spend hours in the car or walking down the sidewalks, debating ideas: religion, the problems of the world, what we wanted to be," Mr. Placa said. Similarly, Mr. Powers recalled he and Rudy abandoning their dates in the living room while the two of them talked current events in the kitchen with Helen Giuliani.
Weekends were often spent near an idyllic cliffside off Sound Beach, at a cottage rented by Rudy's grandmother. Aunts, uncles and cousins frequently spent the night. Suppers brought everyone together, with talk of politics as much a part of mealtime as the pasta.
The summer of 1961 would bring another topic to the table: Come fall, would Rudy go to college, pursuing vague plans to become a doctor, or to the seminary, to prepare for life as a missionary?
His parents had a preference. "The Giulianis wanted grandchildren," Mr. Jacobelli recalled.
Rudy did not quite decide, enrolling at Manhattan College while still pondering the priesthood. His mind would teeter back and forth during the next four years, he said: Was God truly summoning him?
Not until he began law school did he finally rule it out. "The priesthood is a vocation," the Mayor remembered, "and I probably didn't have it. I probably just thought I had it."
Like most young men, he was feeling a hormonal calling as well. "I had dated and enjoyed it," he said.
The choice would probably have been different "if the priesthood had encompassed marriage."
Manhattan College, in the Bronx, had much in common with Loughlin. It was all male, overwhelmingly white and run by the Christian Brothers. Mr. Powers and Mr. Placa were at Mr. Giuliani's side.
Mr. Giuliani majored in political science and minored in philosophy. He relied more on a good memory than a quick pencil, a former classmate, B. J. Leddy, said: "He would sit back and make a note or two. He was so self-collected. He knew what would be demanded in the end."
Doctor, lawyer, priest, pilot, journalist: he considered all of these careers. Once, Mr. Giuliani said, he and Mr. Placa even thought of getting Ph.D.'s and becoming "practicing philosophers," hanging out a shingle and "just sitting somewhere, developing ideas and thoughts."
A political career, the Mayor said, was not often on his mind, "like fourth of fifth on the list." Nevertheless, he ran for his first office, winning the sophomore class presidency. He lost the following year, and his main extracurricular interest shifted to Phi Rho Pi, his fraternity.
Manhattan College was a commuter school, and none of its fraternities had a house. Still, the groups were a good way to make lasting friendships. Mr. Giuliani had first pledged to high-status Alpha Sigma Beta, but he hated the hazing, especially "getting beat up with a paddle."
So he approached Phi Rho Pi, which had only a few members. They welcomed him and several of his buddies, agreeing to go easy on the humiliations.
Mr. Giuliani was a commanding figure at meetings, with "a sense of standing, a sureness about what is right," said a fraternity brother, Thomas Hefele.
As Phi Rho Pi grew, a rift opened. Sal Scarpato was the leader of a more boisterous faction that wanted more raucous parties, more tormenting of pledges. Mr. Giuliani was the champion of the better-mannered. They ran against each other for the presidency, and Mr. Giuliani won.
Mr. Scarpato said that before the vote, he got a very unexpected phone call from Harold Giuliani. As he remembered it: "Rudy's father took the liberty of asking me to withdraw from the election.
"He said it was more important for Rudy to be the fraternity president, more important because Rudy was someone going places."
 
A Law Career
The Inquisitor Makes The Front Page
In 1965, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Powers enrolled at New York University Law School. "I went in with the mental attitude that if I enjoy it, I'm going to stay," the Mayor said. "If I don't, I'm going to leave, get a master's degree in history or something."
But he was quickly smitten with torts, contracts and the rest. The courses stimulated his highly rational mind, the Mayor said. He excelled, making the law review.
Irving Younger was Mr. Giuliani's faculty adviser. The two opera lovers would retreat to the professor's office and listen to an aria while Mr. Younger reminisced about his days as a prosecutor. He made it sound as if no life was complete without a stint as an assistant United States attorney.
Mr. Giuliani surely had the makings. To be a prosecutor pointing an accusing finger seemed a natural pose for Mr. Giuliani, with his virtuous ire. His classmates found him bright, memorably combative and, to their astonishment, able to function on four to five hours of sleep a night.
"He was very funny, but he was also much like he is now," said Peter D. McKenna, a friend who became the law review's editor in chief. "He could give a joke but not take one. When he thought he was right, he'd become arrogant and call the other guy a crybaby."
Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island, said, "I was struck by him being very, very smart and really, really liberal."
The two men had met in 1967, when they were summer interns at a law firm that included Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Giuliani, the Kennedy zealot, talked briefly with the future President on two occasions, both times managing to refrain from using his scornful nickname for Nixon: the Trickster.
"That summer, there were riots in Newark and Detroit, and Rudy was very sympathetic to the rioters," Mr. King said. "He told me he had gone to a bar and started in on a black guy because he wasn't radical enough. Rudy said before the conversation was over he'd turned him into a Black Power guy."
A week before Mr. Giuliani graduated, an assassin murdered his hero, Robert F. Kennedy, but even that could not destroy so promising a spring. He was departing with cum laude honors. He had lined up a prestigious clerkship with Judge Lloyd F. MacMahon of Federal District Court in Manhattan.
And he was getting married.
Regina Peruggi and Rudy Giuliani were hardly strangers. They had dated sporadically in high school and college, then more seriously during Mr. Giuliani's final year of law school. Their fathers were first cousins.
The wedding and reception, on Oct. 26, 1968, was as much a family gathering as a marriage celebration. For their first dance as newlyweds, the couple chose Frank Sinatra's classic pledge of love, "All the Way."
Among the guests was Judge MacMahon. A tall, forbidding man, he could be gruff with his clerks. But he treated Mr. Giuliani as a protege, guiding his young career.
Surely, the clerkship saved that career from an interruption common during the Vietnam War; the judge wrote a letter to the draft board, securing his clerk a deferment. Any further chance of induction was later forestalled by a high number in the draft lottery.
Judge MacMahon strongly recommended Mr. Giuliani for a job as an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York. Once on the job, Mr. Giuliani assumed twice the normal caseload.
"Rudy had this ability to focus, more than any other person I've ever worked with," said Michael B. Mukasey, a Federal district judge who was then a fellow prosecutor. He recalled how grateful he was when Mr. Giuliani "rounded up a bunch of office people and came to my father's funeral," barely weeks after the two lawyers had met.
In the autumn of 1974, Mr. Giuliani's courtroom skills catapulted him onto the front pages during the bribery trial of Bertram L. Podell, a former three-term Brooklyn Congressman. After hours of Mr. Giuliani's grueling cross-examination, Mr. Podell -- quite calm at the start -- became so flustered that he poked out a lens of his glasses, requested a recess and then pleaded guilty.
Yet however ferocious Mr. Giuliani might sound as an inquisitor, he hardly looked the part. He was still on the wrong side of pudgy, with an oversized forehead and slouching shoulders.
When Bob Leuci, a corrupt police detective who had turned Federal witness, first glanced at Mr. Giuliani, he saw a nerdy kid in a sloppy suit. But as the prosecutor began to talk, Mr. Leuci sensed a rare combination of formal education and street smarts. "He's asking one question, but he's like seven moves ahead of you in the chess game," Mr. Leuci said.
Mr. Giuliani's task was to get the detective to testify against his partners -- his best friends. The prosecutor's persuasiveness would later become part of the movie "Prince of the City." Glossed over was the fact that the two men became close friends.
Mr. Giuliani was overcoming his social gawkiness as power tilted his way, Mr. Leuci said. "He could see that when he said something, people would listen and he could develop a fan club. Once Rudy got that, he lost weight, he began working out, he recognized that all of a sudden women were attracted to him."
The one thing that did not change, Mr. Leuci said, was the obsessive work. At Mr. Giuliani's office, the detective would sometimes ask: " 'Don't you have a life?' And he would tell me: 'I have a life. It's right here. I don't enjoy anything more.' "
 
Washington
A Rising Star Sees His Marriage Falter
In 1975, Mr. Giuliani gained a mentor in Harold R. Tyler Jr., a Deputy Attorney General in the Administration of President Gerald R. Ford. Mr. Tyler needed nimble assistants, and his friend Lloyd MacMahon had always filled his ear about Rudy Giuliani.
Mr. Tyler brought the young prosecutor to Washington as his deputy. He said he never regretted the choice, though "once in a while I'd have to tell Rudy to pipe down: 'I'm in charge, you're not.' He was so ambitious, and still is, God love him."
Mr. Tyler was a Republican. But Mr. Giuliani was politically adrift, having grown impatient with a Democratic Party that he thought was "naively" sliding far to his left. He registered as a Republican.
The following year, Jimmy Carter's victory would mean the boot for Republicans in high places. Mr. Tyler accepted a named partnership in what became Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler, a trusted guardian of old money. Mr. Giuliani followed his boss, also becoming a partner.
The work was tame compared with the pursuit of renegade cops, but Mr. Giuliani became something of a mythic figure to younger associates. Admired for his competence, he was also known for practical jokes, an irreverence toward senior partners and occasional partying at trendy nightspots into the wee hours, sometimes ending one day with breakfast for the next.
"He asked me to dance, and I had no idea who he was," recalled Renee Szybala, then a rising young lawyer at the firm. "He told me he was one of the partners. I was flabbergasted. This was not the usual way to meet partners."
By the mid-70's, Mr. Giuliani's marriage was in trouble. The couple agreed to a trial separation in 1975, but the remedy would prove insufficient.
"Rudy's wife was very nice, very quiet, and we could sense the unhappiness there," Mr. Tyler said. "I don't think she liked the limelight.
"And Rudy, of course, did."
 
The Reagan Years
A Crime Fighter Defends a Dictator
That limelight intensified when Ronald Reagan became President in 1981. The Justice Department needed an experienced crime fighter in its top ranks. With Harold Tyler as an advocate, Mr. Giuliani was given the No. 3 job, in charge of all the United States attorneys, drug enforcement, immigration and prisons.
Much of his time was spent in South Florida, where each month hundreds of Haitians were floating ashore in flimsy sailboats -- or drowning in the effort. The Administration considered the vast majority to be fugitives from hunger and want, not refugees from political repression. Mr. Giuliani became the point man for a policy that combined attempts to intercept the Haitians at sea and detain those who made it to land.
Amid class-action lawsuits and public quarreling, Mr. Giuliani made a two-day trip to Haiti, then testified about his findings in Federal court. In words that would be unforgettable to a generation of Haitians, he said that "political repression, at least in general, does not exist" in that dictatorship, and that the boat people were in no danger when sent back.
Mr. Giuliani later insisted that his remarks -- though repeated many times in his testimony -- were quoted out of context. "I knew there were people who fled political oppression in Haiti and that they were entitled to asylum," the Mayor said. "But I also knew that the vast majority of people were coming for economic reasons."
The chief purpose of his trip was to guarantee the Haitians' safety upon return, he said. Indeed, during his testimony, he recalled a 75-minute conversation with President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier: Mr. Giuliani demanded and received the brutal dictator's "personal assurance" that the boat people would be safe.
At the time, Mr. Giuliani seemed to relish the verbal combat, often appearing on network news programs.
But while his work in the capital carried the weight of importance, he was unhappy living in what he considered a one-industry town. People related to each other according to a pecking order of political clout "rather than interacting like normal human beings," the Mayor said.
Regina Peruggi had not accompanied her husband to Washington. In 1982, Mr. Giuliani filed for a legal separation and, within a year, divorce. After 14 years, the marriage would also be erased in the eyes of the church through annulment.
The grounds for annulment, the Mayor said, involved the couple's unintended failure to obtain a dispensation -- necessary at the time for "second cousins once removed" to marry.
"This has been painted as, well, something sneaky," Mr. Giuliani said. "But I was under the impression that we were third cousins because I never calculated the lines of consanguinity. I can't tell you what Gina thought. I don't think we ever discussed it in any great detail."
After his divorce, the Mayor said, he inquired about a possible annulment to Alan Placa, his longtime friend, who had entered the priesthood.
"He said, 'You were related, you must have gotten a dispensation,' " Mr. Giuliani remembered. "I said: 'Alan, I don't recall doing that. I don't recall realizing that I had to get one.' He said, 'Well, you know, the priest may have gone ahead and done it anyway' " because -- as church experts confirm -- approval would have been routine.
But a search through church records found none of the required paperwork, said the Mayor, who, like his former wife, had previously refused to discuss the matter. Ms. Peruggi, also a person of accomplishment, has been the president of Marymount Manhattan College since 1990.
Divorce and annulment had become matters of immediacy for Mr. Giuliani. In early 1982, a friend had met Donna Hanover, a divorced Miami newscaster, and later played matchmaker.
Mr. Giuliani ordered his secretary to phone her, arranging not a date but an interview. The couple then began a two-month courtship before Mr. Giuliani proposed, at Walt Disney World.
On April 15, 1984, Father Placa presided at their church wedding.
To some, returning to Manhattan in 1983 to be the United States Attorney seemed an odd career move. Wasn't he already the boss of all the Federal prosecutors? But at age 38, Mr. Giuliani was returning to the work he loved in the nation's most visible city.
The Colombo crime family, the mobster Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, the briber and former Bronx Democratic leader Stanley M. Friedman, the stock manipulator Ivan F. Boesky: the convictions by Mr. Giuliani's office seemed to connect the dots through the money-mad 1980's.
Never shy about success, Mr. Giuliani was an obliging star at news conferences. When accused of showboating, he would typically respond, "I feel a Government office should be open, and I have an obligation to maximize public education."
His good press would prove insulation from much of the bad -- an important thing, because not every big case went his way.
By the time Mr. Giuliani left office, critics were accusing him of overzealousness, prosecuting cases to serve his political ambitions.
In 1987, Mr. Giuliani anguished publicly over whether to run against Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. But the decision was never really a close call, the Mayor said. If he was ever going to endure the "terribly difficult experience" of a campaign, he wanted to end up running something, not legislating.
His options, then, were governor or mayor -- and he seemed to favor City Hall. Advisers warned against it, Mr. Giuliani said: The city was a mess, the job a career-killer.
His last day as a Federal prosecutor was Jan. 31, 1989. By early February, he and Mr. Powers were charting campaign strategies. Presumably, the race would be against Mayor Koch, though possibly his Democratic challenger, David N. Dinkins.
"We had no money," Mr. Powers said. "Politically, it was so naive."
But they had read the polls.
The renowned crime fighter was 20 points ahead.
 
The Mayor's Office
A New Giuliani Takes A Political Turn
The race was the political novice's to lose, and lose it he did, with the help of an elbow to the ribs from Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Mr. Giuliani was an awkward campaigner, and he would be bruised before winning the Republican primary. Ronald S. Lauder, heir to a cosmetics fortune, spent $14 million to tarnish his reputation. Mr. Lauder's political oomph was supplied by Mr. D'Amato, whose off-and-on relationship with Mr. Giuliani was in a phase of darkness.
Mr. Giuliani lost the general election to Mr. Dinkins, whose victory as the city's first black mayor seemed to be tipped by the racially motivated killing of a black teen-ager in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
But the defeated candidate had someone else to blame: "To the extent that Al D'Amato was a large part of it, then he has to take responsibility for that."
The media, too, had disappointed Mr. Giuliani. When he was a Federal prosecutor, reporters seemed in competition for fresh superlatives. Now, like human seismographs, they recorded his every quake and slip. At times, they made him seem like an ogre.
The public had him pegged all wrong, he complained. Donna Hanover shared a painful memory several years ago in an interview with The New York Times. On the night of his defeat, Mr. Giuliani crumpled at the foot of their bed and asked, "Do they really think I'm mean?"
Looking toward a 1993 rematch, the candidate would find ways to become new and improved. He spent hundreds of hours in a self-designed seminar, inviting experts to tutor him on urban reforms. He also submitted to a political airbrushing by new strategists. Weight was lost, a tan was added. He danced a two-step at a hoedown in SoHo, greeting people with "Howdy."
At heart, however, Mr. Giuliani was still the scrappy prosecutor in a city where voters seemed willing to blame the incumbent for a staggering murder rate, homelessness and a general sense of disorder. He believed then -- as he does now -- "that in New York, you have to be a fighter."
He beat Mr. Dinkins by a margin of two percentage points, becoming the city's first Republican mayor in a generation. His campaign themes were true to his roots: part nostalgia, part law and order. He promised nothing less than to restore a better quality of life.
His inaugural speech seemed the dare of a new sheriff, busting through the saloon doors. "The era of fear has had a long-enough reign," he said. "As of this moment, the expressions of cynicism -- New York is not governable, New York is not manageable, New York is not worth it -- all of these I declare politically incorrect."
Mr. Giuliani considered himself a warrior in the free-for-all between cops and robbers. He was the people's choice for top cop, and, therefore, to oppose him was to rob the public of its collective will.
In his third month as Mayor, the one-time political science major had occasion to describe his philosophy of government at a New York Post forum on crime. His passage from the liberal beliefs of his younger years was complete.
Freedom does not mean "people can do anything they want, be anything they can be," he said. "Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do and how you do it."
In New York, he seemed to announce, that lawful authority was his.

HEADLINE: Two Republican Rivals, One Purpose on Taxes

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: SMYRNA, Ga., Oct. 18

 BODY:
The House Republicans' antitax road show came rolling through Newt Gingrich territory on Friday night, playing a tune that might well have been called "50 Ways to Loathe Your Tax Code."
Before a whooping, cheering, overflow crowd of several thousand, a country-music-quoting Representative Dick Armey of Texas squared off in amiable debate against Representative W. J. (Billy) Tauzin, a tub-thumping Louisiana orator. The Congressmen's topic: whether to replace the graduated income tax with a flat tax or a national retail sales tax. 
 With an implicit wink, the two men used much of their two-hour debate for a common purpose: to demonize the income tax for the sake of the Republican Party's re-election agenda next year. By night's end the lawmakers had the audience on its feet demanding the repeal of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1913 to allow the collection of a Federal income tax. Unlike many Americans, the people in this crowd knew what the 16th Amendment did.
After two previous debates, in Ohio and California, the Congressmen were well practiced in their facts and their banter. "This current tax code is anti-family," Mr. Armey said. "It makes you hate your brother-in-law. How many of you know darn good and well that your brother-in-law has got benefits and breaks under that tax code that you don't have and he ain't telling you about?"
Mr. Tauzin described the Internal Revenue Service as an agency "drunk with power" and recommended, "If you've got an agency that's drunk with power, the first and most important thing you do is take the liquor away -- the I.R.S. code itself."
It is not clear how quickly the Republican Party plans to progress beyond the debate tour, intended to stoke sentiment for change, and actually try to pass either a national sales tax or a flat tax. The road show was to continue tonight in Chicago.
Mr. Gingrich, who welcomed the debators into his Congressional district in this town just outside Atlanta, promised a healthy national dialogue. He said the debate would contrast with what he described as President Clinton's effort "to cram" a health-care overhaul "down people's throats" in 1994.
"When you talk about something like replacing the entire tax code, that's in every family's life," Mr. Gingrich said. "Every American deserves to know what the alternatives are, deserves to have time to think about it."
The Democrats were nowhere in sight but are already on the defensive. Mr. Clinton came up last week with his own modest package of ways to rein in the I.R.S. And Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, has been clamoring unsuccessfully to be allowed into the Republican debate.
Mr. Gephardt, who has his own tax-simplification proposal, said recently that Mr. Armey's flat tax "dramatically helps taxpayers at the top and hurts taxpayers in the middle and the bottom." He threatened that a "Democratic fair tax caravan" would follow the Republicans' tour.
Democrats were only mentioned as whipping boys on Friday night, with even Mr. Tauzin taking a ribbing for being a recent convert to the Republican Party. And if the evening was any indication, the Republicans are mining a rich vein of discontent.
Drawn by talk radio, the crowd at the Cobb Galleria Centre was so large that hundreds of people were left outside the debate room to watch on television.
"The tax situation in this country is ridiculous," said Jennie Johnson, the 38-year-old owner of a car repair shop. "It's so hard to follow and there's no reason for it."
Ed Powell, 65, said that he had long favored a switch to a national sales tax because it would make members of the underground economy, like "prostitutes and bookies," pay taxes.
Both Republican Congressmen insist that their rival plans would vastly simplify the tax code.
Mr. Armey, who favors a flat tax, displayed on an easel a 10-line tax form that Americans would use under his plan.
Mr. Tauzin, offering to show what a tax form would be like like under his national sales tax, drew laughter when he put up on his easel a blank white piece of paper.
"April 15th becomes just another day," he crooned.
Mr. Armey's flat tax would set a single 17 percent rate on both indiviudal and business income. Individuals would pay taxes only on wages, not on interest, dividends or capital gains. All the current tax deductions and credits would be repealed, including the popular home-mortgage deductions and benefits approved just this year, including the $500-per-child tax credit. But a large personal exemption -- $33,800 for a family of four -- would help the poor.
Mr. Tauzin's proposal would abolish the income tax, along with the I.R.S., (but not the payroll tax for Social Security and Medicare) and replace it with a national sales tax of 15 percent. That would come on top of any state or local sales taxes. To help the poor, who generally spend a larger percentage of their income than the wealthy, Mr. Tauzin would give every family below the poverty line periodic rebates.
Citizens formed long lines to ask questions ranging from how they could afford a 15 percent sales tax on the purchase of a new home, to how they could be assured that a flat tax would not eventually grow back into the current tax code.
A flat tax, said one questioner, Don George, a 50-year-old physician, "really depends on the self-discipline of Congress, and self-discipline is not the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Congress."
Fending off concern that his plan would eliminate the cherished home mortgage deduction, Mr. Armey said at one point: "The great American dream is not to own your own home. The great American dream is to get your kids out of it."
Even skeptics rose to their feet when Mr. Tauzin called on the hall to remember America's rebel roots in the Boston Tea Party. "This is not just about money," he said to thunderous cheers. "This is much more serious than that. This is about freedom and liberty."

HEADLINE: In New Jersey Governor's Debate, Focus on Taxes and Car Rates

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Locked in a tight ace, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and State Senator James E. McGreevey used their first televised debate to draw sharp contrasts today between their approaches to the two biggest campaign issues: property taxes and auto insurance.
The one-hour debate at Rowan University in Glassboro gave voters their first chance to see Mrs. Whitman and Mr. McGreevey on the same stage. Recent polls show their race to be close, surprising some political analysts who predicted only months ago that Mrs. Whitman would easily win re-election. 
 Mr. McGreevey, who is also the Mayor of Woodbridge Township, had the most to gain from the debate, because he is not well known around the state and needs to show that he is an acceptable alternative for voters unhappy with Mrs. Whitman's record but reluctant to make a change.
Appearing more relaxed and confident today than he did in the debates during the Democratic primary, Mr. McGreevey seemed well prepared as he hammered Mrs. Whitman's record on auto insurance and property taxes. He tried to portray himself as the candidate who better understood the needs of working families. "The basic problem with auto insurance in the State of New Jersey," he said, "is whose side is the Governor on?"
He also attacked her fiscal policies: "The problem of what has happened in New Jersey in the past four years is that the Governor cut the income tax by a third, but then increased spending by $2 billion."
But Mrs. Whitman, who first proved that she was a formidable debate opponent during her 1990 campaign against United States Senator Bill Bradley, let no accusation go unchallenged, and swatted away much of Mr. McGreevey's criticism by repeatedly attacking his legislative voting record.
"I heard the Senator say that I had increased spending $2 billion," she said. "In one budget that he voted for, under the Florio administration, he increased spending in one year more than I have in four budgets, in four years."
Questions came from the audience of southern New Jersey residents in a town-meeting setting. The debate, sponsored by The Philadelphia Inquirer and New Jersey Network (NJN), was broadcast live on NJN from 1 to 2 P.M. It will be rebroadcast Sunday by NJN at 7 P.M. and by WPVI-TV, Channel 6, in Philadelphia at 5 P.M.
In response to a series of questions about automobile insurance rates, Mr. McGreevey accused Mrs. Whitman of allowing 12 rate increases and not cracking down hard enough on insurance fraud. He said that if elected he would order insurance companies to cut rates by 10 percent.
"We're not prosecuting fraud, we're paying for it," he said.
Mrs. Whitman said she had already taken steps to curb fraud, citing nine pieces of legislation she had signed since 1994. "That is a good start," she said. "Unfortunately, my opponent voted against most of those bills."
The Governor dismissed Mr. McGreevey's auto insurance proposal, which he says would impose a mandatory 10 percent reduction on auto insurance rates. She said that his plan was "a cruel hoax" and that hers would allow most consumers to save 10 percent, and up to 25 percent if they accept limits on the amount of damages they can seek in a lawsuit.
"What he is proposing is unconstitutional," she said. "The only people who are going to benefit from what Mr. McGreevey is proposing are lawyers."
Mrs. Whitman and Mr. McGreevey shared the stage with Murray Sabrin, the Libertarian Party nominee, who used the forum to present himself as the only candidate committed to making substantial change. Both Mrs. Whitman and Mr. McGreevey virtually ignored him and his comments.
But Mr. Sabrin offered an energetic and spirited performance, and sometimes sounded like the college professor that he is. He received the most overall cheers and applause from the studio audience, particularly when he promised to return decision-making about public schools to the communities and to reduce taxes significantly by dismantling state government.
On auto insurance, his solution was simple. "We need a free, open and competitive market," he said. "It is called freedom. It is called free enterprise. It is called getting government out of an area that they have no business in."
Mr. Sabrin is the first third-party candidate to raise enough campaign contributions to receive taxpayer dollars and earn a place at the official debates. The state's campaign finance law requires that all gubernatorial candidates who receive public funds participate in at least two debates.
On property taxes, Mrs. Whitman dismissed Mr. McGreevey's criticism that her 30 percent cut in the state income tax forced communities to increase local taxes to compensate for lost revenue. She faulted local governments for not restraining local spending the way she has done at the state level, but she said she would make reducing property tax rates a top priority in a second term.
Mr. McGreevey said there was "a property tax crisis" in the state. "The Governor says that is not her priority," he said. "I want to make it my priority." He vowed to use future tax revenue growth to help school districts lower property taxes.
On the subject of education, questions focused on the Governor's academic standards and school financing. When one member of the audience suggested that her income tax cuts had forced reductions in state education aid, Mrs. Whitman said more money did not necessarily improve education.
Mr. McGreevey, meanwhile, seized the opportunity to attack Mrs. Whitman's academic standards, calling them among the "worst in the nation." He also said that the Governor's income tax cuts had led to a decrease in state spending on schools and an increase in the property tax rate.
The state share of local school costs "fell from 42 percent to 37 percent," he said, "so who makes up the burden? We do, middle-class property-tax payers."
All three candidates will meet again for two more televised debates in the coming week. On Tuesday night, the state Chamber of Commerce is sponsoring a forum in Whippany. The final debate will be held on Friday evening at William Paterson College of New Jersey in Wayne.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Remarks by Whitman and McGreevey

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the remarks of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and State Senator James E. McGreevey during a debate yesterday in Glassboro, N.J.
 
Auto Insurance
 Q. What would you do to crack down on fraud, so that auto insurance premiums could be reduced? 
 McGREEVEY: I support a fraud prosecutor. For the last year of the previous administration, there were $7.3 million of fines. And this past year, $2.5 million in fines. We're not prosecuting fraud, we're paying for it.
The Governor criticizes my plan. Governor Cahill had a 15 percent rollback in 1973. And, I'll do it in 1998. The point is that over the past four years, the Governor has granted 12 increases. We're paying a billion dollars more, while auto insurance companies have doubled their profits.
WHITMAN: We've already taken the first steps on that. I've signed nine pieces of legislation since 1994 dealing with auto insurance. One of those makes it easier for us to get at the books of the insurance companies.
Just this spring, I signed legislation that stopped the insurance companies' ability to have an automatic rate increase every July 1, stopped their abilities to put surcharges on your license, stopped their ability to drop good drivers for no particular reason, increased the number of fraud investigators to the highest number we've ever had, gave us the ability to fine insurance companies up to $25,000 each and every time that they fail to report fraud to us, and gave us the ability to take away the licenses of people who engage in fraud.
 
Education
Q. Should all public education be funded by a broad statewide tax and not the property tax to reduce the tax burden on homeowners?
 McGREEVEY: There is a tax crisis in New Jersey. It's a property tax crisis. The problem of what has happened in New Jersey in the past four years is that the Governor cut the income tax by a third, but then increased state spending by $2 billion.
Ultimately, the state share to municipalities of state aid and to the school districts fell. The percentage for school districts fell from 42 percent to 37 percent. So who makes up the burden? We do, middle-class property-tax payers.
WHITMAN: Property taxes, as you know, are basically and finally and foremost a function of spending decisions at the local level, with the state having a great deal of responsibility in helping those districts. Today, state aid to localities is $29.8 billion.
I heard the Senator say that I had increased spending $2 billion. In one budget that he voted for, under the Florio administration, he increased spending in one year more than I have in four budgets, in four years.
 
Closing Remarks
McGREEVEY: I was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, raised in Carteret. My dad's a Marine Corps drill instructor. My mother's a nurse. We grew up in a middle-class neighborhood, and those are the families that I represent.
In the past four years, we have had a growing national economy. Certain states have used it as an opportunity for lower property taxes and to raise educational excellence. But not in New Jersey. With Governor Whitman, we have the highest auto rates in the nation, we have the highest property taxes in the nation, and now we have $10 billion worth of debt. Eighty percent of workers have lost in terms of real income. And our educational standards have been found to be the worst in the nation.
What's up should be down, and what's down should be up. I want to tackle these questions.
WHITMAN: Four years ago, the people of the state of New Jersey gave me a job to do. They said cut taxes, cut government spending, restore jobs, get our education system educating our children, go after crime and break the back of welfare. They were big jobs, but we did it.
We have cut government spending to a 50-year low. Cut taxes 14 times. More people are working today in the state of New Jersey than ever in our history. We have world-class academic standards. And crime is at a 23-year low. Our welfare rates are down 31 percent.
With the same determination that we put at those issues, we need to now go after property taxes and auto insurance. And I promise you that in a second Whitman administration, it will be that same level of energy and focus.
We've done a lot. We've made progress in those areas. But we can do better.

RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI
 To reporters at a firehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn: 
 "The most important poll that came out this week for the future of the city -- reaching its hundredth anniversary on January first of next year -- is the poll that said that 55 percent of people on Staten Island are against secession now and are in favor of being part of the city of New York. That concerned me greatly four years ago when I ran for mayor. Staten Island voted to secede, over 60 percent, four years ago. Queens had a secession movement that was beginning, and they wanted to get into the same position as Staten Island. They wanted a resolution on the ballot. And Howard Golden gave a speech saying they were going to consider it. The city of New York could have split apart if we didn't take the city and change the direction of the administration of this city out into the boroughs."
 
RUTH W. MESSINGER
To reporters after the Columbus Day parade yesterday in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn:
"I travel all over the city, as I have been telling you guys for about eight months. I travel all over the city; I go to all kinds of neighborhoods. There are people who have come up to me since I've gotten here who tell me very specifically they wanted me to know that they were voting for me. Council member Albanese has a following in his district and in this community; there are people who will listen to him. There are a whole bunch of people in this city that will vote for me because I'm committed to improving their schools and restoring their after-school programs and addressing the problem of unemployment, which hits a community like this as well. "

HEADLINE: Guggenheim Built in Spain Opens Under Militant Cloud

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: BILBAO, Spain, Oct. 18

 BODY:
When the new Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opens to the public on Sunday, visitors entering the strikingly unusual titanium and stone-covered building will walk past bouquets of flowers marking the spot where a Basque policeman was shot and fatally wounded this week while foiling a terrorist attack.
The Basque separatist group known by its initials E.T.A., which stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom, had apparently planned to disrupt the inauguration of the museum today by King Juan Carlos of Spain. The ceremony went ahead as planned this evening under heavy security, but celebrations were muted by mourning for the policeman, Jose Maria Agirre, and by a new wave of public anger at E.T.A. 
 The terrorist action on Monday nonetheless served to underline the important political as well as cultural role that the museum is expected to play here. For many people, it represents the city's desire to turn its back on its recent past of industrial decay and separatist violence and to present a new image of economic and urban renewal and openness to the world.
The museum's architect, the American Frank O. Gehry, has described the bizarrely shaped building on the banks of the Nervion River as a ship run aground. Tonight. the Basque region's President, Jose Antonio Ardanza, said he saw it as a ship about to be launched, its "valuable cargo" carrying a message.
"For us Basques, it is a message of confidence in ourselves, in our capacity to renew and innovate, in our determination to overcome the traumas of the past and to come back to the path that leads to the future," he said.
Although the museum is to be administered by the New York-based Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, the Basque regional government has covered the $100 million construction cost. Furthermore, it has donated $50 million for new acquisitions, paid a $20 million fee to the Guggenheim and agreed to subsidize the museum's $12 million annual budget.
But for the Guggenheim Foundation, it also represents a gamble: besides its New York museums on Fifth Avenue and in SoHo, it already runs the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, it will open the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin in the Deutsche Bank headquarters in November, and it is hoping to establish a permanent presence in Asia. But the Guggenheim Bilbao, which is almost twice the size of the Frank Lloyd Wright building on Fifth Avenue, represents the foundation's biggest expansion in almost 40 years.
On the eve of its public opening, at least part of the gamble has paid off. Although several hundred people demonstrated against the museum this afternoon, complaining that the investment should have gone to local culture, the Basque authorities and most Bilbaons seem to have embraced the project with enthusiasm.
"I walk down the street here and people grab my hand to thank me," said Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim Foundation.
And architecture and art experts who visited Mr. Gehry's building during construction as well as during two weeks of previews this month have almost unanimously acclaimed it, above all its soaring atrium, its "tumbling boxes" profile and its 430-foot-long "ship" gallery.
Resembling a huge sculpture from afar, the museum had raised questions whether its powerful architecture will overwhelm the art on display. But Mr. Krens said, "The art has a sympathetic resonance with the architecture." And among many visitors here this weekend, John Walsh, director of the Getty Museum, and Norman Rosenthal, artistic director of the Royal Academy in London, said they were impressed by how the art works look here.
The opening exhibition, "The Guggenheim Museums and the Art of This Century," features some 300 works from the Guggenheim's 10,000-piece collection along with some 50 works newly acquired by the Guggenheim Bilbao.
"This is essentially a 'collection' show," said Lisa Demmison, chief curator at the Guggenheim. "It is not an encyclopedic show because the Guggenheim is not an encyclopedic museum like the Met. We have used the 19 galleries to provide chapters of a -- not the -- story of modern art, from Braque and Picasso to Damien Hirst."
The art works loaned by the Guggenheim in New York and Venice will rotate, but Bilbao will also hold temporary exhibitions that will travel here from New York. The main disappointment so far was that the Reina Sofia Art Center in Madrid refused to lend Picasso's "Guernica" -- his homage to the bombing of the nearby town of Guernica by Nazi planes during the Spanish Civil War -- on the ground that it was too fragile to travel.
Mr. Krens said he still hoped to show the huge oil painting here.
"We have developed a plan, including construction of a special climate-controlled truck, so the painting could be brought here without having to be unstretched and rolled," he said. "I'd like to think we will show it some time in 1998."
The Guggenheim Bilbao has tightened security after the E.T.A. action this week, when three militants dressed as gardeners tried to install 12 remote-controlled rocket-propelled grenades in a large flower-covered sculpture called "Puppy" by Jeff Koons. When the policeman on guard spotted false plates on the delivery van, he approached the militants, who shot him. One of the three guerrillas was later arrested.
Tonight, Mr. Ardanza and other speakers paid tribute to Mr. Agirre in the presence of King Juan Carlos.
Earlier today, Mr. Krens said that during six years of coming here, he had received no threats from E.T.A. But last Monday coincided with the opening of a trial of 23 members of E.T.A.'s political front, Herri Batasuna, in Madrid. The visit of the King today also guaranteed that any terrorist action would be given wide coverage. "But I don't think this will be an ongoing issue," Mr. Krens said. "After all, the museum is a Basque institution."

HEADLINE: Big, Bold Effort Revives the Danube Wetlands

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: TULCEA, Romania

 BODY:
Marius Condac, a wildlife warden in the immense delta of the Danube River, remembers when a sudden frenzy rippled through this quiet, waterlogged world, one where change is normally measured by the rising and falling of the seasonal floods, by the reed harvest or the nesting of pelicans.
It was the mid-1980's and Romania's Communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, a man known for ambitious and destructive schemes, had decreed that large slices of the delta be transformed into grain fields. He sent 6,000 men to build dikes and pump the land dry. Water plants died and animals were driven from more than 240,000 acres and the new grounds were flattened and planted with wheat and rice. 
 There was more. Uncounted pelicans and cormorants were shot because they were eating too many fish. The birds were upsetting a state plan known as "optimizing fish species."
By the time Mr. Ceausescu was himself executed by a firing squad in 1989, the delta scheme was failing.
"The soil was not suitable and there was no money for chemicals," said Mr. Condac, 39, standing on deck of a boat as it chugged along one of the river's murky branches near its mouth at the Black Sea.
In the name of economics and the environment, scientists and engineers from several countries are now trying to reverse one of the biggest land-grabs in recent history.
They have already punched gaps in half a dozen dikes and dams and let the river spill back over more than 9,000 acres. Other drained areas are set to be reflooded. The agency overseeing the project is the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, which was created by the Romanian Government in 1991 and encompasses most of the wetlands' 2,200 square miles. Ukraine, which owns about one-sixth of the delta, is expected to join. Financing comes from the World Bank's Global Environment Facility and other foreign donors.
The boldness of the restoration project has caught the attention of engineers and ecologists elsewhere in Europe and in the United States.
"Nothing on this scale has ever been tried before," said Erika Schneider, a scientist at the German Institute for Flood Plains Ecology, an arm of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which is involved in the plans. "We know about no other delta being destroyed and restored within such a short period."
Converting wetlands into arable land and construction sites is, of course, an age-old practice and such land is rarely returned to nature. But that view is being slowly eroded by a new movement to restore wetlands and flood plains for the purpose of protecting wildlife and control flooding by giving the river more space. The thinking is that fish or flood protection may be more valuable than farmlands, as in the Danube delta, where agriculture barely succeeded. Experts involved in restoring flood plains along great rivers like the Mississippi and the Rhine are keenly interested in the Danube plan, Miss Schneider said.
"For restoration projects along the Rhine," she said, "people are already happy with a few acres."
The Ceausescu technicians damaged almost one-fourth of the delta on the Romanian side, said Marian-Traian Gomoiu, until recently the head of the Biosphere Reserve. "They completely changed the philosophy of water circulation, and they made a mess." He explained that the reclaimed lands quickly became too dry, producing prairie vegetation, and that irrigation with river water was difficult because water evaporated quickly and left behind too many minerals.
At this point, the remains of the grand scheme are still visible in the extensive network of levees. Discarded rusting machinery is scattered along the banks downstream from Tulcea.
But the Danube delta remains Europe's largest wetland west of the Volga. Straddling the border of Romania and Ukraine, it is a vast patchwork of islands and swamps created by the river's final split into three main branches, each with its channels and backwaters where water and nutrients breed a multitude of living things.
On the flyways of many migrating birds, the delta serves as breeding, resting or feeding grounds for 325 species, with large flocks wintering here. Some are rare and threatened, like the black stork, white pelican and pygmy cormorant.
In spring, shad and sturgeon make spawn runs up the river and there are fat carp, bream and pike nudging among the rushes and the water lilies. President Ceausescu and senior Party officials used to come here to hunt wild boar and deer.
Of the 20,000 people living in this watery maze, a number were forced to move to make way for the Ceausescu plan. But many others remain in small villages and hamlets in the swamps, trapping fish and game and earning tiny sums from harvesting the reeds they sell as mats, roof covering or, especially, for cellulose. Some keep bees, taking advantage of the summer blanket of wildflowers.
"It's lush now, but it's very harsh here in winter," said Radu Mihnea, a biologist at the Marine Institute in Constanta, already noting the autumn chill. "People are cut off, sometimes they have to use icebreakers to get to a doctor. I've seen swans with their feet stuck in the ice."
For the delta's people, long removed from the outside world, the fall of Communism has brought its own changes. For example, they are seeing a new species: the first Western tourists, led by tour operators who have spotted an exotic destination. The visitors -- among them devoted bird-watchers -- stay on ships because hotel accommodations remain rudimentary. In Tulcea, a savvier town of rundown shipyards and fish canneries, word is already out that the tourist boats are largely self-sufficient and leave little money behind. There is talk of starting a catering business.
There is also the novel notion of protecting nature. Mr. Condac commands a new contingent of 92 wildlife wardens. He said he needs another 40 of them because poaching is much worse since the dismantling of Communism.
"Poachers respect nothing -- fish, otters, wild boar -- even if it's the breeding season," he said.
A fishing ban for sturgeon is under consideration. Once plentiful, it has dwindled because its roe is prized as caviar.
Unexpected support has come from the Eastern Orthodox Church. Its spiritual leader, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who is based in Istanbul, has made the defense of the region's damaged environment church policy. Last month he invited scientists and priests to a symposium on the Black Sea, including the Danube delta.
On the Ukrainian side of the wetlands, Orthodox clerics have recently signed an agreement with the nature-reserve director, Alexander Volaskevic. Mr. Volaskevic will use some of his funds to repair old monasteries and priests will exhort the faithful to respect God's creation. Boris Alexandrov, a marine biologist from Odessa, recalled some recent meetings in Vilkova, in the delta, attended by fishermen, scientists and priests. As a result, Vilkova fishermen are now replanting reed beds. They also were told from the pulpit not to fish until two weeks after Easter.
Other crucial issues cannot be solved in the delta. From its source in southern Germany, the Danube -- Europe's grandest waterway -- sweeps through eight countries and a catchment area of 80 million people, collecting untreated sewage and farm and industrial runoff along the way. The delta acts as the river's giant kidneys, a great sedimentation bed where minerals are transformed and water is purified. But the kidneys have been failing because of the overload and the delta's imbalance is visible in the algae blooms that regularly suffocate other life. The Danube countries have signed an agreement to clean up the river, but progress is slow.
Delta restoration is moving faster. The waterscape will not be the same because the old natural ponds and channels were flattened by bulldozers. But Julia Orlatan, a botanist, said land that was reflooded two years ago already has rushes and coot nests and she saw plenty of carp in the muddy water.
Mr. Condac recalled the day he watched the breach of an embankment.
"It was spring, the water was very high," he said. "So as soon as the machine had dug a hole, the water broke through with great power. We all cheered. The river was winning back its land."

HEADLINE: Money's No Object in This Council Race

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
It took a staggering $900,000 -- most of it his own money -- for Andrew S. Eristoff to win and keep his City Council seat in two elections four years ago as a Republican representing the heavily Democratic East Side of Manhattan.
This year, when most Council incumbents are expected to sail to re-election, Mr. Eristoff, 34, the scion of the industrialist Henry Phipps, is having another run for his money. 
 Once again ignoring the city's voluntary campaign spending limits, he has raised more than $315,000 and does not rule out an infusion from his personal accounts. His opponent, Eva Moskowitz, a 33-year-old college professor, has denounced his campaign spending but has pulled in nearly $180,000 herself, an astounding amount for a first-time political candidate. The combined sums virtually guarantee that their Council race will be among this year's most expensive and hotly contested.
Mr. Eristoff, a former tax lawyer, said he was taking nothing for granted, because Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1 in the district. While often referred to as the "silk stocking district" because it includes the Upper East Side, the district in fact, he said, "runs the gamut in terms of economic and social makeup" as it snakes down the East Side from 96th to 14th Streets.
He also is mindful that his margin of victory was wafer thin in 1993. He defeated his Democratic challenger, Jane R. Crotty, by 57 votes in a special election to fill out the term of Carolyn B. Maloney, who became a Congresswoman, and then beat Ms. Crotty by a mere 201 votes nine months later in the general election.
Mr. Eristoff enjoys certain advantages of incumbency. He has been endorsed by the United Federation of Teachers, even though his opponent is a professor, and by District Council 37, the city's largest municipal employees' union. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has also endorsed him, and echoing one of the Mayor's principal themes, Mr. Eristoff is campaigning on a record of having pushed for quality-of-life improvements. Mr. Eristoff wrote legislation restricting panhandling near bank machines and banning reckless Rollerblading.
Ms. Moskowitz assailed Mr. Eristoff as weak on education and blindly loyal to Mayor Giuliani, pointing to his votes against an independent police review board and his lone vote for the Mayor's failed proposal to make it easier for so-called megastores to come into the city. She reserved her harshest criticism for his refusal to participate in the campaign finance program.
"When you don't abide by the city's spending limits, it means that instead of the candidates' being selected on their merits, it's just a fund-raising race," she said.
A history professor who has taught at the Staten Island College of the City University of New York and who now runs a faculty seminar on American studies at Columbia University, Ms. Moskowitz has assembled a list of campaign contributors that includes dozens of professors and teachers and at least one student (who gave $1). Mr. Eristoff's list includes big donations from the Republican County Committee of New York ($10,000, according to his last filing) and from the Republican Pro-Choice Political Action Committee ($1,000) and occasionally reads like the Social Register, with names like Rockefeller, Frick, Loeb and Luce.
Mr. Eristoff stressed that his support was very broad based and that the average contribution was $159.
Mr. Eristoff has given only $700 to his campaign this election, a tiny fraction of the $600,000 he put into his two campaigns in 1993, but he said he would increase the amount if necessary to counter actions by his opponent. With two weeks to go until the election, Mr. Eristoff has already blanketed the district with two mailings and run his first radio commercial. Ms. Moskowitz has spent very little of the money she has raised and waited until this weekend to send out a general mailing on her candidacy.
Despite her financing disadvantage and the fact that this is her first run for office, Ms. Moskowitz is not a political novice. She coordinated the volunteer effort for Councilman A. Gifford Miller in 1995 and ran Ms. Maloney's campaign last year.
"She may be a newcomer to the public spotlight, but she's not new to politics," said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Manhattan Democratic leader. He said the Democratic Party had not given her campaign any money, "but whatever we can do for her, we have tried to do because all races against Republican incumbents in this day and age are important." She has been endorsed by United States Representative Charles E. Schumer, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Ms. Moskowitz said that if elected she would be an advocate for education and would lobby to end tenure for principals and to improve training for teachers. Acknowledging that the Council has little direct influence over those issues, she said, "I wouldn't underestimate having an advocate who's constantly asking the question, 'Why isn't education on the front burner?' "
Mr. Eristoff said he would like to sponsor the creation of a master plan for the East Side and continue attacking quality-of-life problems like the posting of advertising stickers on doorways and phone booths.
As for Ms. Moskowitz's criticism that he lacks independence, he said he was a strong supporter of Mr. Giuliani, but that he had voted against him on several issues, including some of the Mayor's proposed budget cuts in 1994 and more recently on a measure allowing college students on welfare to perform their workfare assignments on campus.
"I am independent, but I also want to be someone on the Council who is willing to help the administration move forward rather than throw up obstructions in the name of limited political gain," he said.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Buying the House and Fixing It Up With One Loan

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
A YEAR ago Kim and Robert McBratney bought their neighbor's house, at 131 Elizabeth Street in the West Brighton section of Staten Island. Mrs. McBratney explained how it happened.
They were living in Mr. McBratney's mother's two-family house at 121 Elizabeth Street, where Mr. McBratney, a 34-year-old fireman, had lived since he was 2 years old. With growing dismay, they were watching their neighbor's house go to wrack and ruin. 
 The owner had moved to Seattle. Her son, who was living in the house alone, was a drug addict. So dreadful had the condition of the house become that neighbors wanted it condemned and demolished.
Why not buy it and renovate it for our own family, thought the McBratneys, who have four children. They have done just that. They paid $56,000 (plus closing costs) for the house a year ago and spent $50,000 on an eight-month reconstruction job, with Mr. McBratney acting as his own contractor. They moved in last July.
"Now everybody is coming by and asking us how we did it," Mrs. McBratney said.
They did it with a $100,000 acquisition-and-rehabilitation loan, a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage. Through a mortgage banking company on Staten Island, Community Home Mortgage, in New Dorp, they obtained a specialized loan that has been offered for years under the Section 203k of the Housing Act of 1961, a mortgage-insurance program administered by the Federal Housing Administration of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
But the Section 203k program, while usable in many locations in the metropolitan area, is often inapplicable in places where house prices are too high for its mortgage limits. Now Fannie Mae (the name formally adopted by what was once the Federal National Mortgage Association) has come forward with its own version of a mortgage that includes money for rehabilitation.
The new Fannie Mae loan could become the vehicle for greater marketability of older homes, and more affordable improvement activity, in the metropolitan area. Many buyers use more expensive forms of credit -- including credit-card loans -- to do improvements after they buy a house. Or they put them off or do not do them at all.
The mortgage limits under the F.H.A. program are $160,950 on a single-family house, $205,912 on a two-family, $248,887 on a three-family and $309,337 on a four-family.
In the Fannie Mae program, the limits are $214,600 on a one-family, $274,550 on a two-family, $331,850 on a three-family and $412,450 on a four-family. As much as half the loan can be devoted to rehabilitation, as opposed to acquisition. The lender's appraisal is based on the post-rehabilitation value, and the borrower is expected to put in at least 5 percent of the total cost in cash.
The acquisition-and-rehabilitation loan is one of several forms of rehabilitation-oriented home loans that Fannie Mae's New York office -- which embraces Long Island, Westchester and Rockland Counties -- has lately been aggressively promoting.
These mortgages are not made directly by Fannie Mae, but rather by major banks and other lenders who originate the loans and then resell them to Fannie Mae. By making a secondary market for the loans, Fannie Mae encourages lenders to offer them. It also provides direct information to consumers by phone (1-800-7FANNIE) or internet (www.fanniemae.com).
Another form of rehabilitation-related loan that Fannie Mae is promoting can be used to refinance an existing mortgage on a one- to four-family house, with money for rehabilitation added to the mortgage amount (and mortgage limits the same as they are for the acquisition-and-rehabilitation loan). Another is a pure home improvement loan, made as an F.H.A.-insured second mortgage (up to $25,000 for a one- or two-family house). A third would enable an investor-owner of a 5- to 12-unit building to upgrade the property with an F.H.A.-insured second mortgage, limited to $60,000.
How widely these programs are used depends not only on how well-tailored they are to the market's needs but also on how vigorously they are promoted by sales brokers, who often lead buyers to sources of mortgage financing. And their vigor often depends on how quickly and efficiently the processing can be done. Brokers (and buyers and sellers) are unenthusiastic about programs that require too much paperwork and delay a closing during the weeks it may take to qualify a buyer.
"Three to four weeks between a handshake and a commitment from a lender is normal," said Glen Calderon, a broker with Prudential Action Real Estate in Ozone Park, Queens, who handles many 203k loans. "At worst, it's three months." The lender has to send in a contracting consultant as well as an appraiser to estimate the cost of the work. As the work goes forward, the lender releases payments to the contractor.
In an interview last week, Naomi S. Bayer, director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, elaborated on the new Fannie Mae loans. She noted, for instance, that in a house that now has one or more rental apartments, rents are deducted from the the owner's monthly housing costs in determining how much money the owner can borrow. "That can make as much as a $20,000 difference in the income the buyer has to have to get a rehabilitation loan," Ms. Bayer said.
Over the last year, only 236 renovation loans have been purchased by Fannie Mae in New York City, she said, suggesting that the company has been only a modest factor in this form of lending so far. Through the F.H.A.'s 203k program, 1,085 loans were made in the metropolitan area over the last year, up from 634 loans the year before.
A loan made two years ago in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn exemplifies the type of sales activity that may be stimulated by the Fannie Mae program. Pascale Kersaint, 34, an assistant manager at Bell Atlantic, set about to buy a house by studying bank listings of foreclosed real estate. She wanted a foreclosed property needing extensive renovation.
She found the four-story brownstone at 257 Carlton Avenue, a rundown building set amid well-maintained brownstones on a tree-lined street. "It had great bones, and seven marble fireplaces," she said. It was selling for only $180,000 but it needed $100,000 in improvements.
MS. KERSAINT found a $236,000 acquisition-and-improvement mortgage running 30 years at 8 percent from the Dime Savings Bank of New York. She moved in in July 1995, found two renters, and has been renovating the building ever since. "The inside is great now, but I haven't started on the exterior yet," said Ms. Kersaint. A graduate of Stuyvesant High School and the University of Pennsylvania, she started buying United States savings bonds in 1989 and cashed them all in to make the down payment on her house.
Emerson Atkins, the broker with the Wallabout Management Corporation in Brooklyn who found the loan for Ms. Kersaint, said that a third of the two or three dozen sales made through his office each year were of houses that could use upgraded kitchens or baths or plumbing or windows or other features, usually at a cost of $10,000 to $30,000.
"It's always better to get the money for rehab in one package," he said. Instead, some buyers use credit cards, piling a maximum debt on several cards. "Nine times out of 10, they get in trouble," he said.
In Staten Island, Robert McBratney said that he had never taken out a mortgage in his life before he went to the New Brighton office of Neighborhood Housing Services, a national nonprofit organization that assists moderate-income urban home buyers. He took classes over a two-month period on mortgage finance and other aspects of home ownership. The office led him to Jay Sullivan, of Community Home Mortgage, who got them the F.H.A. loan.
"Would I do it all over again?" Mr. McBratney asked rhetorically. "Without a doubt. I put down only $8,000 to buy the house."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
Modern Creed For Ancient Church

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: ODESSA, Ukraine

 BODY:
SOME have called it "the greening of the Bible." In Europe they talk about "eco-missionaries." In the United States, a recent magazine headline asked, "Science and God: A Warming Trend?"
Across the West an alliance is linking theology and science, two forces that long ago diverged in their search for truth. What unites them is a concern over the destruction of nature and the recognition that each can use the other to rally to its defense. 
 Sometimes their plans to protect the Creation unfold in unusual ways. A highly visible strategy session was held last month aboard a huge Greek ferry that circumnavigated the polluted Black Sea for seven days with 300 biologists, philosophers, economists, priests and a sprinkling of politicians and Jewish, Islamic and Hindu scholars. The host for this symposium was the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, since 1991 the spiritual leader of some 170 million Orthodox Christians. The Patriarch will arrive in the United States today for a 30-day visit.
As the ferry called on ports of the six countries along the Black Sea's shores and other Orthodox patriarchs and their retinues boarded, the message became unmistakable: the Orthodox Church was speaking out on the environment.
The Eastern Orthodox Church is not the pioneer of environmentalism. In 1971 the Anglican Church declared that abuse of nature was "blasphemy." Since the late 1980's, in Europe and America, clergy of all the major faiths have talked with scientists about the need for action.
Patriarch Bartholomew has now made the fight against pollution church policy. The Patriarchate has even declared abuse of nature a sin. In 1995, Metropolitan John of Pergamon, an influential theologian, spoke words approved by the Patriarch himself: "Evil is not only a matter for human beings but affects the entire Creation."
Many followers have been been surprised by the activism because they know their church more for its lengthy Byzantine rites and mysticism. It is a faith that has largely managed to avoid the impact of the Reformation, the Enlightenment and the political and industrial revolutions.
 
A Cost to Humans
 Much of the Church's drive to embrace this modern creed comes from Patriarch Bartholomew, who is said to be troubled personally by the enormous health problems caused by pollution during the Communist years. He wants to modernize Orthodoxy but needs a consensus since the world's 15 Orthodox churches are self-governing. Church conservatives and nationalists have already criticized him for his openness to the West and ecumenical conciliation.
But environmentalism is a unifying theme in a church full of rivalries. On this journey, it appeared to work. In Novorossisk, a dirty Russian oil port, the local archbishop said, "Our once health-giving waters have turned into a source of disease."
Defending the Creation poses no theological problems. "The Orthodox are less focused on mankind alone," said Deacon Tarassios, who is close to the Patriarch. "They never abandoned the view that man is part of nature."
The church has just published a book in several languages, titled "Orthodoxy and Ecology" (Syndesmos), which quotes Scripture and provides ideas for community activities. In Greece and elsewhere in the Balkans, monasteries are clearing waste and protecting their wildlife.
The Black Sea was perhaps a natural choice for the trip. Orthodoxy is dominant in five of the six countries on its shore -- Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria. Islamic Turkey is the exception. Some believe that this sea, once a freshwater lake, was the site of the Flood.
But now overfishing, raw sewage and industrial and farm runoff have made the Black Sea one of the planet's most damaged waters. A 1994 convention to clean it up has faltered because of a shortage of both political will and funds.
With his voyage, the Patriarch hopes to galvanize both. Among the passengers were some practiced in the dialogue between religion and science, including Richard Chartres, the Anglican Bishop of London, and Jane Lubchenko, a marine biologist and outgoing president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Europe's Commissioner for the Environment, Ritt Bjerregaard, pledged funds.
In the end, funds can be found for projects, and priests can preach about nature. But the harder part may be addressing the consensus that emerged on the ship: protecting nature, the support system for human life, is not an economic or technical question but one requiring a reordering of social values. "We have left it to the politicians to deal with the environment crisis," said Bishop John of Pergamon. "We must realize that politics cannot be effective without a moral code."

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By RAY CORMIER

 BODY:

Renting a Yacht
 Q. Five couples want to rent a power yacht with staff for a weeklong Mediterranean cruise next summer. Can you list any agents who can help? -- Eugene Kraft, Detroit 
 A. There is no shortage of ads for agents and brokers in sailing magazines. But to avoid getting seasick over a bad charter experience, Terri Jacome, charter manager for Yachting magazine, says your best bet is to work with a charter broker.
She advises that you call several brokers and work with the one you feel most comfortable with. "A charter can be as formal or as informal as you want," she said, "and it's vital to let the broker know exactly what your desires are."
In choosing a broker, she and others strongly suggest asking whether they are members of one of the major broker associations -- the American Yacht Charter Association, the Charter Yacht Brokers Association or the Mediterranean Yacht Brokers Association. Other questions: How long have they been in business? Do they attend trade shows and inspect the yachts? Are they bonded? Where do they hold deposits? (They should at least keep an escrow account.)
Beverly Parsons of Interpac Yachts is a director of the Charter Yacht Brokers Association. Brokers are "basically travel agents, but only do boats," she said. American Yacht Charter Association members, like herself, generally have more familiarity with Europe than do brokers who are in the Charter Yacht Brokers Association only, she said. Interpac is at 1050 Anchorage Lane, San Diego, Calif. 92106; (888) 999-2248, fax (619) 222-0326.
Lynn Jachney, the American Yacht Charter Association president, said that the group's 25 members must have at least five years in the business and be recommended for membership. She runs Lynn Jachney Charters, Post Office Box 302, Marblehead, Mass. 01945; (800) 223-2050, fax (617) 639-0216.
The Mediterranean association is for European brokers, like Alex Braden of Yachting Partners International, Department Y, 28-29 Richmond Place, Brighton, Sussex BN2 2NA England; (44-1) 273 57 17 22.
These brokers are among dozens listed in the September issue of Yachting. The magazine is at 20 East Elm Street, Greenwich, Conn. 06830; (203) 625-4480, fax 625-4481; subscriptions, (800) 999-0869.
National tourism agencies can provide listings of agents and brokers, too. For example, the French Government Tourist Office, 444 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022, offers an "Easy Reference Guide -- France," which includes listings for boat and yacht rentals; call (212) 293-9173, fax (212) 838-7855.
No matter whom you choose, Ms. Jachney said, you should expect to pay 50 percent of the rental when you sign a contract, and the balance a few weeks before sailing. There will also be an extra fund for expenses, like food and fuel, usually about 25 percent of the charter price.
How much will you pay? Ms. Jachney said the 108-foot Admiral Bolitho, a "reasonable" Mediterranean ship that sleeps 10 and has a crew of 6, this year rented for $31,500 a week plus expenses and tax.
 
A Day in Guayaquil
Q. I will be in Guayaquil, Ecuador, for a day and would like a tour of the city, in English, in the afternoon. -- Sally Bachrach, Brooklyn, N.Y.
A. In the 1997 Lonely Planet Guide's "Ecuador and the Galapagos" ($19.95), Rob Rachowiecki lays out a two-to-three-hour walking tour past most of the major sites of Ecuador's largest city.
But many guidebooks and even tour agents warn that there are some areas in Guayaquil best avoided on foot. So, despite the traffic, you might consider hiring a tour guide and car. South American Journeys, 419 Park Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10016, offers three such tours, says the manager, Louis Espinosa.
One lasts three hours and takes in the major attractions. These include Simon Bolivar Park, where iguanas roam; La Rotunda, a statue commemorating the only meeting of South America's two great freedom fighters, Bolivar and Jose de San Martin; the Barrios Las Penas, where many colonial homes have been turned into art galleries, and the busy waterfront. There is a panoramic view at Santa Ana Fort.
Mr. Espinosa also offers a tour of three museums. It stops at the Anthropological Museum of the Central Bank; the Municipal Museum, famous for its tzantzas, or shrunken heads; and Museo Nahim Isaias Barquet, a religious art museum.
A third option is a five-hour trip to the Botanical Gardens, about 40 minutes outside Guayaquil. This garden is famous for its tropical species, especially orchids.
Mr. Espinosa says the cost for these tours would be about $50, or about $30 to $35 each if sharing the car. Call him at (800) 434-0540, fax (212) 696-2607.
 
Working in Rome
Q. I am a college professor and lawyer and am moving to Rome. How can I find out about job opportunities there, including teaching? -- Ron Senese, New York, N.Y.
A. The bad news is that unemployment in Italy has been above 12 percent this year; Transitions Abroad, a magazine about living and working overseas, says "the job search in Italy will be extremely difficult for citizens of non-European Union countries." The good news is that there is no shortage of resources.
The Italian Embassy suggests contacting Vittorio Tedeschi in the Italian Commercial Office, 1601 Fuller Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009; (202) 328-4750, fax (202) 328-5538. Also, the American Chamber of Commerce in Italy, 1 Via Cantu, 20123 Milan, Italy, publishes a newsletter in which you can take out a want ad (for about $50); it goes to about 2,000 companies. You can also buy its directory of 1,200 member companies plus 7,000 others doing business in Italy for about $175, including postage; call (39-2) 869-0663.
Transitions Abroad publishes an extensive list of reference material and organizations dealing with studying and working abroad. It is $4.75 an issue from Post Office Box 1300, Amherst, Mass. 01004; (413) 256-3414, fax (413) 256-0373.
One listing is International Employment Hotline a newsletter of current job openings, Post Office Box 3030, Oakton, Va. 22124; (703) 620-1972. But for jobs in academia, the newsletter's editor, Will Cantrell, recommends The Chronicle of Higher Education, Department E, 1255 23d Street, N.W., Washington, D.C 20037; (800) 728-2803. The listings are also on line at http://chronicle. merit.edu.

HEADLINE: Premium Shock

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
ON a gloomy day in April, Paul Pugliese strapped a wooden barrel around his nearly naked body, glued an auto inspection sticker to his chest and headed to a protest rally at the foot of the State House steps.
For years, Mr. Pugliese, of Long Branch, had paid more than $2,000 a year to insure his 1992 Toyota Tercel and 1981 Chevy van. The barrel, he said, would soon be all he could afford to wear if nothing was done to bring down his rates. 
 The rally drew hundreds of angry drivers to Trenton. They wanted Governor Whitman to know their disgust at paying the nation's highest average car insurance rates. Later that day, the Governor said she understood. After all, she and her husband, John, who live on a farm in Hunterdon County, where premiums cost less than in most other counties, paid $2,533 a year to insure a 1993 Volvo 850, a 1992 Mercury Sable and a 1990 Ford pick-up.
But the Governor's sympathy is not enough for frustrated drivers in this largely suburban state, who have little choice but to own a car because even the local market may be miles away.
Motorists here open their insurance bills each year to find premiums that seem almost haphazard in their calculations. A traffic ticket, a move to a city or a teen-ager who begins to drive can add hundreds or thousands of dollars to the bill.
And then there are drivers who may be paying thousands of dollars more than they need to, simply because they did not shop around.
For example, a couple in Jersey City with a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am and a 1990 Chevrolet Astro van may be offered rates ranging from $1,439 to $3,709 for the same coverage, their final premium depending on which insurance company they happen to call.
But whatever the variations, one thing is clear: the average cost of auto insurance in New Jersey is now more than 50 percent higher than the national average.
While experts say that New Jersey's rates may always be high because of the state's high cost of living and congested roads, they also say the premiums do not need to cost as much as they do now.
Part of the problem is that insurance companies must now pay out more in legal fees, medical bills and financial settlements for pain and suffering in New Jersey than in most other states.
And when insurers spend more on such claims, they make up for it by charging all drivers higher rates.
Think of the state's auto insurance system as one big pool that all drivers toss money into each year. Out of that pool, insurance companies pay commissions to their sales agents as well as advertising and routine office expenses. But mostly they pay claims.
New Jersey lawmakers tried to save policyholders money several years ago by limiting lawsuits in accidents involving minor injuries. Since all accident victims get their medical expenses paid automatically under the state's no-fault laws without having to file a lawsuit or prove who was at fault, there is little need for people with minor injuries to sue. But lawyers have found loopholes in those laws so that even someone who complains of a sore neck can win thousands of dollars for pain and suffering -- damages that are over and above the cost of lost wages and medical expenses. And one way to get those hefty legal awards is to show a court a pile of medical bills for that sore neck, which adds to the cost of medical claims that are paid for by all New Jersey drivers.
Insurance companies are also now taking more money out of the pool for themselves in the form of profits. The state's auto insurance companies almost doubled their average profits in 1995 -- to 7.7 percent from 4.1 percent in 1994. But almost all of that money was earned on the portion of insurance premiums known as collision and comprehensive coverage, which pays to repair or replace damaged or stolen vehicles. In fact, even though motor vehicle thefts are declining rapidly in New Jersey, premiums for comprehensive insurance rose three times faster here than in the rest of the nation in the last four years.
Finally, state insurance regulators estimate that as much as 20 percent of the money in the pool could be going to pay for fraud, which they say is more pervasive in New Jersey than elsewhere. Some of that fraud is due to outright scams. For example, insurance company investigators said this year that they had uncovered the nation's largest organized auto insurance fraud ring in northern New Jersey, a scheme that involved hundreds of people who faked fender benders and filed at least $75 million in bogus claims. But most of the fraud happens when drivers, medical providers, lawyers and body shops take advantage of state insurance laws to pad insurance claims after a real accident.
While many New Jersey politicians have offered solutions, almost every time lawmakers have set out to bring down rates, the result has usually made the system more expensive and more complex. Legislators have found themselves repeatedly under siege from special-interest lobbying by trial lawyers, medical providers and insurance companies, who each earn hundreds of millions of dollars from the auto insurance pool, and even more as premiums rise.
J. Robert Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner who has studied New Jersey's system and is now director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said it doesn't have to be that way. While New Jersey's premiums may always be high, he said, drivers do not have to be throwing as much money into the pool as they do now.
For example, Mr. Hunter said New Jersey could adopt a no-fault law similar to one in Michigan, which strictly limits lawsuits by allowing only the most seriously injured accident victims to sue. Even though drivers get much more medical coverage in Michigan than they do in New Jersey, rates in Michigan are about 35 percent lower.
"You can't get rid of the fact that you have the highest concentration of cars and high average salaries," Mr. Hunter said. "But things can be done."
 
A National Leader In Auto Premiums
In 1995, each New Jersey driver spent an average of $1,013 to insure each vehicle they owned, while the average cost nationwide was $665.
But New Jersey drivers are not alone in their frustrations over high rates. In New York, each motorist spent an average of $906 on auto insurance in 1995. And, in Connecticut, the average cost was $881.
In fact, thousands of drivers in neighboring states pay auto insurance premiums that are just as expensive as New Jersey's rates, or even more so. And, some of those drivers wonder what the fuss over auto insurance in New Jersey is all about.
"It's nonsense," said Leonard Kramer, who just moved to Brick Township, N.J. from a rural town in northern Westchester County, New York and was surprised when his $2,000 premium did not rise after the move. "It really is."
Some of the factors that make insurance expensive in New York and Connecticut, also make it costly in New Jersey. And, many of these factors are hard to control.
For example, most things cost more in the New York City metropolitan area, including medical care and auto repair, which forces insurance companies to charge higher rates to cover the cost of accident claims.
The region's roads are crowded with cars, making accidents more likely than in rural areas and keeping accident claims flowing into adjusters' offices. New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the nation, has more registered vehicles per square mile than any other state, and lies in between New York City and Philadelphia, which makes the state a corridor for even out-of-state commuters.
The region's residents also have high annual incomes, and they like to protect their wealth, as well as their Lexuses and BMW's, with expensive insurance policies. In 1996, each person in New Jersey earned an average of $31,334. Of the 50 states, only the residents of Connecticut earned more.
Because of such demographic factors, New Jersey, like its neighbors, is bound to have high auto insurance premiums.
But based on dozens of interviews and a review of numerous auto insurance studies, statistics and public records, New Jersey's premiums do not have to be as expensive as they are now. The review found that New Jersey's auto insurance system is fraught with problems that have added unnecessary and excessive costs to accident claims, which insurance companies simply pass on to their customers.
 
'See You in Court': Words That Cost Money
In a state where residents are the nation's most litigious and where there are more lawyers per capita than anywhere else, accident victims in New Jersey are much more likely to hire a lawyer than in most other states.
That means that more of each dollar spent on insurance premiums goes to lawyers. In 1995, for example, $16 of every $100 spent on insurance premiums went to lawyers in New Jersey, according to estimates by the Insurance Information Institute, a New York City research group that is funded by insurance companies. That is about 33 percent higher than the average for the nation where lawyers received $12 of every $100 in premiums.
New Jersey legislators have long known that excessive lawsuits -- and the higher legal fees, medical costs and financial settlements that result from those lawsuits -- have added to the cost of New Jersey's auto insurance. But numerous legislative attempts to rein in the litigation has failed because of powerful lobbying by the state's trial lawyers. The lawyers give hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to the campaigns of both Republicans and Democrats serving in the State House.
Gerald Cardinale, a Republican who chairs the State Senate committee that debates insurance issues, tells a story about a fund-raising party he held on a golf course in the late 1980's. That day, a lobbyist with the statewide association of trial lawyers made the Bergen County Republican an offer: If the senator would vote against a bill pending in his committee that was aimed at limiting the lawsuits filed after auto accidents, the trial lawyers would pay the entire cost of his next campaign.
"I refused," said Mr. Cardinale, after retelling the events recently. "But they continued to come to my fund-raisers."
But the trial lawyers have successfully wooed the majority of state legislators -- many who work as lawyers themselves. And, the legislators often fulfill at least some of the wishes of lawyers, who argue that they are simply trying to ensure that accident victims are compensated for their pain.
Perhaps the trial lawyers' biggest coup was a last minute amendment to a bill in 1972 that created the state's no-fault insurance system. The amendment helped create what became the most expensive auto insurance system in the country.
"They reworked the details," said Senator Cardinale. "And we've been trying since the early seventies to rearrange the details."
Under no-fault insurance, a policyholder is automatically reimbursed for medical expenses after an accident without having to file a lawsuit or prove who was at fault. But to pay for those new, expensive medical benefits, the 1972 legislation had tried to save costs elsewhere by limiting the number of lawsuits filed by people with minor injuries such as neck and back pains. The goals of the proposed no-fault law: that all accident victims get their medical care paid immediately, that more money go to people with serious injuries, and that less money go to lawyers.
The last minute changes in 1972, however, made it easy for lawyers to keep filing cases. Unlike a successful no-fault law in Michigan, which allows only the most seriously injured accident victims to sue, New Jersey's amended no-fault law allowed a person to sue if their medical bills amounted to $200, an amount that proved almost meaningless.
While state legislators later tightened the litigation limits in New Jersey's no-fault law, making it harder for those with minor injuries to sue, lawyers are still finding ways around the law. The lawyers make their money be keeping about 33 percent of the settlement that an accident victim receives for pain and suffering damages.
Only 13 states have passed no-fault laws. And, since accident victims in those no-fault states do not have to sue to get their medical bills paid, the involvement of lawyers should be less in those no-fault states than in those states without no-fault laws.
But that is not the case in New Jersey.
According to a 1994 study by the Insurance Research Council, a group based in Wheaton, Illinois that is funded by insurers, 61 percent of the people filing accident claims in New Jersey in 1992 had hired a lawyers compared to 46 percent of the people filing claims nationwide. Only Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island had a higher level of involvement by lawyers in claims.
Lawyers say that they are not to blame for the high cost of insurance premiums. They say that they are only making sure that all accident victims are properly cared for and justly compensated for their pain. And, they say that insurance companies force many accident victims to file lawsuits by refusing to pay their medical bills.
"If they did not have medical bills that were piling up and not being paid, they would not have to hire an attorney," said Michael S. Berger, president of the New Jersey chapter of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America.
The insurance companies' "job is to make money, and they make money by denying claims," Mr. Berger said. "Our goal is to get what is justly due to our clients."
 
The Fraud Business: Bilking the System
It is the lure of golden legal settlements for pain and suffering that is also fueling some of the recent brash acts of insurance fraud, a problem that state insurance officials say adds as much as 20 percent to the cost of premiums.
In Passaic County, for years, members of an organized fraud ring have piled four to six people into cars, slowly driven the vehicles into each other and then filed claims and lawsuits to collect for pain they never suffered, according to several lawsuits recently filed by insurance companies. The insurers filed the lawsuits in an attempt to stop payment on the ring members' claims that they estimate have reached $75 million.
In another multimillion dollar example of fraud, Attorney General Peter Verniero announced in April that he had settled a case against two chiropractors who had billed two state-run auto insurance pools for $52 million in unnecessary medical care to bolster the pain and suffering settlements of more than 5,000 people. The chiropractors lost their licenses for at least five years and were forced to pay $750,000 to the state, but state prosecutors were criticized for not filing criminal charges against the two men.
And, this summer, Dr. Henry Miles Sherman, a physician in East Orange was ordered jailed for two-and-a-half years for routinely filing claims for examinations he never provided. Some of Dr. Sherman's patients were caught by state investigators when they scrambled aboard a public bus after an accident that the investigators set up in a 1991 sting operation. The sting was an attempt to catch insurance cheats and "ghost riders," those who falsely claim they were injured in public transportation accidents so that they can collect insurance settlements.
The insurance companies say that some of the same legal provisions that allow people with minor injuries to collect thousands of dollars in settlements for pain and suffering are also leading to fraudulent medical claims and to medical bills that are excessive or unnecessary. Claims for medical bills are now the fastest rising cost of auto insurance in New Jersey.
For example, to sue for pain and suffering in New Jersey, most accident victims must prove they have a serious injury. Judges and juries are more likely to decide that an injury is serious if they see a pile of medical bills.
"Injuries are serious, if they cost a lot of money to treat," said Senator Cardinale. "There's a lot of doctors who work hand in glove with the attorneys. The incentive is too make things cost more. It's a vicious treadmill."
People do not like to be treated by chiropractors, he said. But they do it "because there is a pot of gold offered to them."
 
A Regulated Industry Reaps Larger Profits
Between 1991 and 1995, the number of car thefts in New Jersey declined by about 30 percent. But while insurance companies may be paying out less money as they replace fewer stolen cars, drivers are not paying any less to insure their cars against theft. In fact, they are paying much more.
During those same years, the premiums charged for the comprehensive insurance that pays to replace stolen cars rose three times faster in New Jersey than the national average, allowing insurance companies to earn hefty profits on that portion of each auto insurance bill. About 50 percent of the comprehensive premium covers stolen vehicles. The rest of the premium covers such things as vandalism, broken wind shields, and stolen stereos.
And, the insurance companies have also boosted the cost of collision premiums, which pay to repair or replace a vehicle after an accident. New Jersey's average collision premium rose seven times faster than the national average between 1991 and 1995.
With those rate hikes, New Jersey's insurers earned a 20 percent profit on comprehensive and collision premiums in 1995, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
"Those rates could be cut now," said Robert Hunter of Consumer Federation of America.
One reason for those high comprehensive and collision rates can be tied to a 1989 state law that allowed auto insurance companies to raise rates by at least 3 percent a year whether they needed it or not. The law was changed this summer so that now insurers must prove to state regulators that they need to raise rates to cover their costs.
The law was part of pages of state laws that makes New Jersey's auto insurance market one of the most regulated in the country. In New Jersey, the state requires insurance companies to get approval before raising rates, regulates how claims are settled and limits the profits that insurers can earn.
Governor Whitman's insurance officials say that even if the automatic rate-increase law allowed insurance companies to earn high profits on comprehensive and collision premiums, another state law makes sure that they cannot earn more than 6 percent in profits overall.
Under that law, if insurers make more than 6 percent a year, after their profits are averaged over three consecutive years, the companies must pay rebates to policyholders.
So while the companies may be making excessive profits on collision and comprehensive insurance, the state officials say, they are making far less money, or even losing money on the rest of the insurance premium, which covers injuries to drivers and passengers.
"That's the way the current system works," said Donald Bryan, an assistant insurance commissioner.
But even so, after years of losses or meager profits, auto insurance companies are making money in New Jersey.
According to the most recent statistics kept by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, New Jersey insurance companies' 1995 profits were the highest since 1986.
And, while insurance premiums are now rising less than the inflation rate across much of the nation, that is not the case in New Jersey, where the automatic annual rate increases and the additional rate increases approved by the Whitman administration allowed premiums to rise overall by 5.2 percent in 1995.
Executives with New Jersey's insurance companies say that their profits have been far from lucrative and below the national average for years. Company officials say that much of the recent increase in profits is due to healthy earnings on their investment funds. And, they say that while the number of car thefts is declining, the cost of replacing the vehicles is increasing.
But some legislators in Trenton, including State Senator James E. McGreevey, the Democrat who is trying to unseat Mrs. Whitman in next month's election, contend that the insurance companies are hiding their true profits and using accounting shenanigans to get around the state's profit limit.
Instead of recording higher profits in some years, these legislators say, the companies are putting the money into a separate reserve fund, saying that they will need it to pay future accident claims. That way, the companies do not have to pay rebates, the legislators say.
"The company may ask for an increase in its rates because of a lack of profit," said Assemblyman Sean F. Dalton, a Democrat from Gloucester County, "but it is not a true picture of the company's economic status."
Mr. McGreevey says that insurers may be charging their auto insurance policyholders too much for administrative expenses, such as top executive salaries and office costs. And, he wants state regulators to examine insurers' financial books every two years to make sure they are not earning more than the 6 percent profit they are allowed under state law.
 
Once No-Fault; Now Whose Fault?
ONCE, more than a quarter-century ago, the price of auto insurance did not fester in the minds of New Jersey drivers. Then, cars did not have to be insured.
But in 1972, Gov. William T. Cahill changed all that by signing a bill that made auto insurance mandatory.
That bill, which also created the state's no-fault insurance system, was intended to lower premiums. But a last-minute amendment, tacked on by state legislators after lobbying from the state's trial lawyers, increased insurance costs by making it easy for accident victims to file lawsuits, even after their medical expenses had been paid under no-fault.
No governor since has been able to fix the flaws, and some administrations have made things worse.
When Gov. Brendan T. Byrne refused to raise insurance rates to cover the rising cost of accident claims, the insurance companies responded by refusing to insure thousands of drivers, who were forced into a special insurance pool that charged extremely high rates.
To help those drivers, in 1983 Gov. Thomas H. Kean created a state-run insurance pool, known as the Joint Underwriting Association. That move essentially put state government into the business of insuring automobiles, a complicated job that proved to be fiscal folly. The fraud-ridden pool, in which state officials allowed insurance companies to decide how to spend public money and to earn more commissions for themselves the more public dollars they spent, was soon more than $3 billion in debt.
To pay for the mess, the state demanded that every driver in the state pay surcharges as high as $220 a year, which angered motorists across the state. In 1988, one angry driver, forced to take out a loan to pay his $4,400 insurance bill, battered a jalopy with a sledgehammer near the State House's front door.
Buoyed by that rage, Jim Florio made promises of lower premiums a key to his successful gubernatorial campaign in 1989. But while Governor, he ended the surcharges, and premiums fell to the second-highest in the nation for the first time in years. He also created another state-run insurance pool as a temporary replacement for the Joint Underwriting Association; almost immediately, the pool turned pink with the red ink of costly claims it could not pay.
Governor Whitman inherited those unpaid bills -- more than $1.3 billion. She ordered insurers to pay part of that debt, and she borrowed $705 million to pay the rest. Those bonds will be paid off by a surcharge on bad drivers until the year 2011.
But Mrs. Whitman also eliminated the state's Office of the Public Advocate, a watchdog for consumers that could challenge insurers' requests for rate increases, and premiums rose steadily during her first three years in office.
In January, the Governor herself reminded voters that they were paying too much for auto insurance. In her State of the State address, Mrs. Whitman vowed to take on the trial lawyers and the insurers by proposing to lower rates as much as 25 percent if drivers gave up their right to sue for pain-and-suffering damages after an accident.
But a few months later, she gave up on that plan when she found little support from her fellow Republicans who control both the Senate and the Assembly. The lawmakers had been heavily pressured by the trial lawyers to reject any bill that limited their livelihood.
However, with Mrs. Whitman's prodding, the Legislature passed a bill that ended the practice of letting insurers raise their premiums by three to six percentage points every year, regardless of whether the companies needed the money. MELODY PETERSEN

Charts: "Lower, but Still Highest"
Though the average automobile insurance premium in New Jersey fell in the early 90's, it is still the highest in the country. One reason is that payments for injuries, below, are much higher than in other states. Graphs track average insurance premium and average cost per vehicle for injury claims, since 1987.

"Are You Paying Too Much?"
To help drivers buy auto insurance, the State Department of Banking and Insurance does an annual survey of rates. The survey shows that drivers can save hundreds of dollars by shopping around. Copies of the full survey for your area can be obtained by calling (800)446-7467.
 
Chart shows a selection from the survey, highlighting the rates offered in urban, suburban and rural areas. The examples assume that the vehicle is used mostly for pleasure (driven less than 7,000 miles a year or for a daily commute of less than three miles one way). The examples also assume that the drivers have no traffic tickets or accidents on their records, and that they agree to accept the no-fault insurance law's verbal threshold, which allows accident victims to file lawsuits only if their injuries are serious enough to meet the legal threshold.

Nothing about the way New Jerseyans drive can explain why rates here are the highest in the country. Charts shows difference in a side-by-side comparison of costs per type of claim.
 
"See You in Court" shows the share of the average premium in 1995 that went to pay various insurance costs.

"Cost-Saving Tips"
 
SHOP AROUND -- The Department of Banking and Insurance does an annual survey of rates. To obtain a copy, which includes a phone number for each insurance company, call the department at 1-800-446-7467.
 
REVIEW YOUR BILL -- One family in Gloucester County recently found that their insurance company was charging hundreds of dollars too much by placing them in the wrong county. The insurance company charged the premium based on the family's zip code, which covered parts of both Gloucester and Camden counties.
 
DISCOUNTS -- In New Jersey, insurers must offer discounts for certain anti-theft and safety equipment. A defensive driving course could also lower rates.
 
OLD CARS -- If you own an older car, it may no longer be prudent to buy collision and comprehensive insurance coverage.
 
MEDICAL COSTS -- You may be able to lower your premium for personal injury protection, which is often referred to as PIP, by selecting your health insurer to pay for medical bills after an auto accident rather than your auto insurance. (pg. 9)

Floyd Flake's Middle America

 BODY:
The congregants of the Allen African Methodist Episcopalian Church started lining up early for the 8:30 service one morning in July. It was a momentous occasion: the unveiling of the church's $23 million cathedral at the edge of the St. Albans neighborhood in Queens. The older women wore hats -- raspberry-colored straw numbers with the brims rolled up, bluebird confections decorated with lace and little pearly beads. Many of the men were in suits; the ushers had on white dinner jackets and white gloves. In their daytime lives, these men and women were bus drivers and police officers and electricians and small businessmen -- members of the vast black middle-class community that stretches eastward from St. Albans to the Nassau County line. And the soaring new cathedral, with its burgundy carpet and oak pews and its great balcony suspended way up in the air, held an almost allegorical power for them. It spoke of prosperity and permanence and shared sacrifice. Last year, the congregation had coughed up $5.3 million, or close to $1,000 per adult. Allen takes in more in a week than many black churches do in a year.
By the time the service began, at least two-thirds of the cathedral's 2,500 seats were filled. The church was brimming with good feeling; I've never been hugged by so many strangers in my life. (It wasn't easy to imagine the all-white setting in which a black person would be welcomed with such open arms.) After the crowd had been primed with some preaching and gospel singing, the pastor, the Rev. Floyd Flake, sprang to the pulpit. In his daily life, Flake was the Congressman from southeastern Queens, though the following week he would announce that he was stepping down to devote himself full time to church affairs. Flake is an elegant, dark-suited figure who moves comfortably among New York's bankers and plutocrats. Behind the pulpit, however, he was a different man. One of the worshipers told me that in the old church, the reverend would sometimes vault over a railing at moments of high passion. Today he was wearing a splendidly embroidered black floor-length gown that his wife, Elaine, had bought in Africa. He announced the theme of his sermon: "purposeful forgetfulness." 
 At first Flake talked about people who haven't succeeded because "they are carrying around so much negative baggage." Then he said, "There will always be somebody who will not tap in or tune in to your dream." It had happened to him. As a boy, people had told Flake, 1 of 13 children of parents with fifth- and sixth-grade educations, that he would never go to college. But they hadn't reckoned on his mother, who taught the kids how to sew and wash and cook, or his fiercely self-improving father. "What people don't understand," he thundered, pointing an index finger into the sea of faces, "is that if you have a good work ethic, it doesn't matter what people say about you!"
Here was the traditional oratory of the pre-civil-rights black church -- the language of self-reliance, of "values." It might have drawn a smirk in some quarters, but the worshipers at Allen burst into delighted applause. And Flake had a sharp and stinging post-civil-rights point to make. "So if all you're doing in life," he cried out, "is sitting around and saying, 'I'm black, I can't do it"' -- and here his voice went sardonic and whiny -- "'all the laws are working against us, they don't give us a chance, they're taking away our affirmative action, they're taking away our welfare,' I say to you, there was a time when we lived without it, and if they take it away, we can live without it again!" Now the whole congregation rose as one. The organist was making musical punctuation marks. Flake shouted that the K.K.K. era was in the past -- plunk -- that white people were no longer the enemy -- plunk -- that he was tired of "1970's rhetoric." And he ended by pointing all around the marvelous cathedral, saying: "This is now. This is where we are. This is a new thing." And the folks around me, in their suits and hats, nodded and said softly, as if to themselves, "This is a new thing."
If the worshipers at Allen respond passionately to what Flake calls his "middle-class message," it's because they see themselves in him. They are, like him, first-generation success stories, and they have good reason to feel that the rules have worked for them. The quarter-million black people who live in the neighborhoods of southeastern Queens that Allen draws upon for its congregation constitute one of the country's largest black middle-class com-munities. According to 1990 figures compiled by Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College, household income for blacks in these two districts is $43,456, about 60 percent higher than the average figure for blacks in New York City -- and $1,000 more than the comparable figure for whites in the area. Four percent in the area receive public assistance -- a fifth of the rate for blacks in New York. Rates of educational attainment are significantly higher, and crime rates much lower, than those in black neighborhoods elsewhere. In its values and in its hard-won prosperity, southeastern Queens resembles middle-class ethnic enclaves in older cities all around the country. If that seems surprising, then perhaps we need to examine our racial stereotypes.
The black presence in southeastern Queens dates to the 1930's and 40's, when entertainers like Count Basie and Lena Horne began moving into the large Tudor homes in the Addesleigh Park section of St. Albans. For wealthy blacks barred from the actual suburbs, St. Albans became the suburban alternative to elegant Harlem neighborhoods like Convent Avenue and Strivers' Row. After the war, the black population began to fan out northward and eastward into vast tracts of middle-income housing, displacing white Catholics who were moving farther east to Nassau County. These newer Queens neighborhoods look more like Middle America than anything else in New York City. Starting in the center of Laurelton, which borders Nassau, you can drive for a mile in any direction and see virtually nothing but one-story brick homes with retractable awnings and scrupulously maintained patches of lawn.
A few days after the church service, I went to visit Gerard McBean, who had been sitting a few rows behind me with his three children and his wife's grandmother; his wife, Karen, was backstage working on the audio system. The McBeans live in the old section of Laurelton, where the streets are lined with big shade trees. Gerard has been living in the house since 1974. The family next door has owned its house since it was built, in the 20's. Longevity in the neighborhood is the norm.
Karen said: "Our block is a very old-fashioned block, where you still have neighbors who watch out for the children, parents who watch out for the children. And we're some of the parents who do that." Karen is a small, delicate woman. Gerard, who was still wearing his hard shoes and faded green trousers from work, has bulging biceps and, at 33, the beginnings of a gut. Neither of them attended a four-year college, though they have associate degrees. Both of them work at the Port Authority, Gerard as an electrician and Karen as a computer technician. Karen worked the midnight shift for five years while Gerard went through his union's apprenticeship program.
They have now reached a sort of plateau -- secure jobs, good kids, postponed dreams. It is a life that is all foundation and not much ornament. The living room we were sitting in was almost bare of furniture. Gerard and Karen are proud that all three children are in gifted and talented programs at school, but Gerard conceded -- without noticeable bitterness -- that "in all likelihood, we won't be able to pay for the best college for all of our children."
The McBeans are acutely aware of the bedrock of values upon which their success rests. Gerard's mother had moved the family to bucolic Laurelton from Queensbridge, a rough area where, he recalled, "everybody robbed somebody." She had enforced the kind of rules that come engraved on tablets: "If you want to eat, you're going to church." And, Gerard added, "you didn't ever not go to school." Karen's parents had emigrated from Panama as teen-agers. She inherited their strong sense of propriety and self-restraint. "My grandparents raised my parents in a certain way," Karen said as her 5-year-old nestled on her shoulder. "And my parents raised me that way, and we're raising our children the same way."
Gerard and Helen were Catholics who left the church because, Gerard said, "I wasn't learning anything." Both had felt disengaged. At Allen, which has dozens of "outreach ministries" and innumerable activities, they have as much engagement as they could want. Gerard volunteers for the Rites of Passage program for adolescents; the kids are in the Shekinah youth ministry. The church offers them an institutional incarnation of the values they absorbed as children.
Flake does not have to convince the McBeans of the merits of his bootstrap, post-civil-rights philosophy. When I asked Gerard if he had experienced much racism, he laughed and said: "Oh, yeah. During my apprenticeship program, I got called a lot of names, really bad names. But, you know, you have to laugh at it. You're not going to change a person's upbringing. And if you don't laugh, you're going to become self-destructive. I've known a lot of people who have ruined their lives that way." In any case, he said, racism has never materially hindered his progress.
Over the course of several weeks, I talked at length with a dozen or so people with some connection to Allen. Virtually all of them had stories that resemble the McBeans'. They grew up in the projects in Brooklyn or the Bronx; they were pushed hard by a parent; they saved up and they persevered to get through school. Most are not immigrants, but they have what we now think of as "immigrant values" -- the values that the securely suburbanized middle class has had the luxury to jettison. They do not see race and racism as the defining
feature of their lives. Nor do they seem to share the sense of racial embitterment that Ellis Cose chronicles in "The Rage of a Privileged Class," his disturbing account of blacks who have made it into the white-collar, and very white, middle class. I often wondered why that was the case. Perhaps it's because the lawyers and academics and corporate executives whom Cose talked to live in a world of heavily coded signals and informal networks where kinship and fellow feeling have so much to do with success. The hierarchies that govern bus drivers and corrections officers are much more explicit. And people like the McBeans have the safe harbor of home. Integration is a nonissue for most of them. They are people who work in a mixed environment and live in an all-black one -- and that's fine with them.
Late last month, Floyd Flake became one of the few black officials to endorse the re-election of the Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He was swiftly denounced by the Rev. Al Sharpton, who had sought the Democratic nomination. Flake is well out in front of his congregation in this regard. Most of the people I talked to credited the Mayor with reducing crime but couldn't imagine voting for him. They consider racism a powerful force in the larger world and had words of encouragement for Sharpton, though they didn't seem eager to vote for him, either.
The literature of race relations tends to gloss over these relatively contented and politically moderate citizens, but there's good reason to believe that they represent a vanguard. Many blacks have begun to have doubts about the efficacy of the regime of entitlements established over the past 30 years. Twenty-seven percent of black voters in California came out in favor of Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action in public institutions. These doubts are not inconsistent with racial pride: nobody would mistake Flake's congregants and constituents for the snobs and dandies whom E. Franklin Frazier excoriated in "Black Bourgeoisie." The McBeans and the others are members of a post-civil-rights generation who gratefully acknowledge that they owe their union and government jobs to the struggle against racial injustice. But they do not think of themsleves as victims needing redress. They sound, in fact, like homeowners everywhere. Gregory Ford, an accountant with the Police Department, said to me, "It's nice to come home and pull out a chair and watch the stars." His dream is to move to the suburbs someday. "I want to be able to not hear a siren at night," he said.
Allen A.M.E. is best thought of as a community-development project fueled by the commitment and wealth of the church and its worshipers. Since Floyd Flake arrived in 1976, he has turned the attention of his congregation steadily outward. The church has built a 300-unit housing complex for seniors and a highly successful private school for children in grades pre-K to 8. It has turned a row of dilapidated storefronts across from the school into a clean and bustling strip mall, and it has spawned a for-profit transportation company that now owns five luxury buses and grossed almost $900,000 last year. The church's annual budget is $25 million, and it employs 800 people. It is often described as a model of church-based economic development.
Allen is also one of the major suppliers of new housing in central Queens. Five years ago, working with the New York City Partnership, the church took over a piece of va-cant land and created a new neighborhood of 71 houses. Last November, the church and the Partnership opened up another such development, Allen A.M.E./Hall Estates, which is situated right behind the senior-citizens complex. The 50 homes are beige vinyl-and-brick-veneer boxes placed on either side of quiet dead-end lanes and separated by tiny lawns kept in perfect trim. Each house costs $157,000 with the help of a subsidy and has three bedrooms downstairs and three more in a separate unit upstairs; the owner rents out the upstairs for $850 to $1,000, thereby defraying about three-quarters of the mortgage costs. Potential purchasers have to be earning between $33,000 and $53,000 and must be first-time owners. The whole system, devised by the Partnership, is designed to create a new class of bottom-rung homeowners -- a budding version of Laurelton or Cambria Heights.
At the monthly meeting of the Allen/Hall Estates Homeowners Association that I attended, most of the people looked to be in their 30's. The meeting began with a "meditation": "We come together, a new community, with an opportunity to be an example to the community around us. ... We have made an investment, and we want to see our investments flourish. ... Amen."
Floyd Flake is a thoroughly worldly figure who wears fine suits and drives a big Mercedes. His political career almost came to an end in 1990, when he and his wife were indicted for failing to report $177,000 in income, which they had allegedly diverted from church accounts. The case was dropped when a judge ruled crucial evidence inadmissible, but it may have ended whatever hopes Flake had of pursuing higher office. Even within his congregation, where he seems generally to be deeply respected, Flake has not been immune to muttering: in the 6:30 A.M. service that opening Sunday, his wife, Elaine, who is also an ordained minister, railed pointedly against the "rumor" and "hearsay" that dog the successful.
Flake is a restless figure, a builder and a doer, and as a Congressman he has been known for skipping the polemics and bringing home the bacon. A 1995 Daily News survey found that Flake had won more Federal dollars for his constituents than any other downstate New York Congressman. He has benefited mightily from his friendship with Alfonse D'Amato, and the Republican Senator gets a warm welcome on his regular visits to the church. (On one such visit D'Amato pledged $10,000 toward the new cathedral.) Flake is a little bit of an old-time machine politician, but he is also a genuine dissenter from racial orthodoxy. He was one of only four members of the Congressional Black Caucus who supported Republican legislation authorizing school vouchers -- which, of course, would benefit the Allen Christian school -- and one of three to support the capital-gains tax cut.
With his passionate belief in the virtues of hard work and self-reliance and his scorn for the politics of protest, Flake is a kind of modernized version of Booker T. Washington. When I spoke to him a few days before he inaugurated the cathedral, he kept returning to the observation that black leaders have denigrated the free-market system and thus helped keep blacks from following the route to success traced by other disadvantaged groups. "We basically take the economic arena out of play," he said, "and then we wonder why we're always playing this game of catch-up or looking for some set-aside." Flake also argues that the successes of the civil rights movement made blacks put too much store in political power, and he worries that far too many of his own constituents and congregants work for the government -- an employment sector with a poor future. (He himself once worked as a marketing analyst for Xerox.)
Flake's resignation from Congress thus has a symbolic dimension: he is leaving politics to focus on his job as head of a large, growing enterprise. The church had taken on a $15 million loan to build its mighty cathedral, and Flake felt that he needed to "build a new infrastructure to increase the cash flow and service the loan.
Flake understands the alchemy required to turn devotion into money. Back on that first Sunday, he had paced around the pulpit explaining just how much the church would need to pay off the mortgage. The faithful marched up to deposit their tithes in big brass buckets. But Flake wasn't finished. He brandished a crumpled piece of paper that apparently held the price of one of the gorgeous pews. "Is there anyone who can trust the Lord for $20 this morning? he cried. I heard the soft sound of checks being torn from checkbooks all around me. "All the $20 folks, stand up!" People popped up throughout the church. "Everyone who will give between 10 and 20, stand up! Everyone who will give between 5 and 10. Everyone who will give anything!" Now the entire congregation was on its feet. The money poured up to the front of the church. Here was the kind of tangible token of commitment that Flake appreciated. And only when the giving was finished did he stride back to the pulpit, open his Bible and begin his sermon.

 THIS book is an extensive selection of conversations taped by Lyndon B. Johnson during the first nine months of his Presidency -- beginning on the day of the Kennedy assassination and continuing through the close of the Democratic National Convention in 1964, at which Johnson was triumphantly nominated. There are no stunning revelations and no recorded moments of epochal importance. But "Taking Charge" is a riveting book nevertheless. This is partly because it has been superbly edited and annotated by the historian Michael R. Beschloss, who has made everything -- even the most arcane references -- accessible to ordinary readers. But it is also because the book gives us an incomparable picture of the character and style of one of the most remarkable personalities ever to inhabit the Presidency.
The Lyndon Johnson who emerges from these conversations is simultaneously dazzling and dismaying. He is a man of volcanic energy, monumental ambition, large vision and great pettiness; a man who seized power quickly and decisively at one of the darkest moments of recent American history, who very rapidly enacted a historic legislative program, who positioned himself to win re-election by the largest margin in modern times, but who through it all was almost morbidly sensitive to even the mildest criticism and deeply fearful of his rivals in the Kennedy family and among their allies.
Johnson taped both telephone and office conversations extensively, although selectively, throughout his Presidency and frequently used transcripts of them to remind himself of what he had said to whom. And for good reason, if the conversations in this book (most of them conducted over the telephone) are any indication; for Johnson often dramatically changed his position on an issue from one minute to the next, depending on the views of the person with whom he was speaking. When talking to his longtime mentor, Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, and other Southern conservatives, he described himself as an almost passive observer of the progress of the 1964 Civil Rights Act through Congress -- a bill, he liked to claim, that he had inherited from Kennedy and had no choice but to support. (He disingenuously told Senator Russell Long of Louisiana: "This civil rights thing -- I came in. The bill was up there. I couldn't say, 'Tear it down, I'm against it.' I haven't called a human being" to lobby for the bill.) When talking to liberals and civil rights leaders, he presented himself -- much more accurately -- as the dynamic and inexhaustible legislative genius he was, pulling levers, twisting arms, doing anything humanly possible to steer the bill to enactment.
When talking to Robert Kennedy's friends and family, and to Kennedy himself, he was an earnest, solicitous friend to the Attorney General, working to help insure his bright political future. When speaking with almost anyone else, he was suspicious and resentful and spoke contemptuously of what he considered Kennedy's lack of accomplishment, his excessive ambition and his unscrupulous efforts to force himself onto the ticket with Johnson in 1964 -- something Johnson spent an enormous amount of time and energy working to deflect. Johnson's unctuousness has been one of the best-known aspects of his personality. But even some of those who knew him intimately will probably be unprepared for the levels of flattery, manipulation and insincerity that these conversations reveal.
It is hard, however, to read these conversations without also feeling considerable admiration for Johnson's unmatched political skills, for his ability to make enemies into allies, for his capacity to juggle dozens of issues and problems simultaneously without letting any of them fall. Much of his time in his first months in office was devoted to dealing with what then seemed an ominous scandal involving his relationship with the Democratic political operative Bobby Baker, with whom Johnson apparently had some questionable business dealings before he became President. (In a scenario unthinkable in today's scandal-obsessed political culture, he successfully stymied investigations into his convoluted financial history simply by withholding information and offering evasive responses to difficult questions.) But the Baker affair, which Johnson considered a very serious problem at the time, appears to have had no effect on his ability to focus on other issues as they came up and to deal effectively with the very members of Congress who were attempting to fan the flames of the scandal. He could hang up from a conversation with friends in Texas about "handling" the investigations and a moment later talk forthrightly and decisively with Robert McNamara or Dean Rusk about problems in Cuba or signals from the Soviet Union. His ability to compartmentalize -- to prevent troubles in one area of his life from intruding into other areas -- was something he later seemed to lose, but it is impressively on display in these conversations from 1963 and 1964.
Almost everything Johnson did in his first months in office was shaped in some way by his awareness of the coming election. He pushed the civil rights bill to passage because he knew he had to establish his liberal credentials with Democrats in the North (and also, it seems clear, because of genuine, if newfound, conviction that it was the right and necessary thing to do). But he worried constantly (and presciently) about the effects of his success on the Democratic Party in the South and sought to shore up his conservative credentials with a conspicuous economy drive and a lean Federal budget. He took an almost obsessive interest in his public opinion polls and quoted them frequently in conversations with people he was attempting to impress or cajole. Almost from his first days in office, he began to dream of winning 48 states in 1964; much of his concern about the South, in fact, had less to do with fears of losing the election than with the prospect of winning by something less than a historic landslide.
Perhaps his lowest point in these early months in the White House was not the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination (during which he was publicly subdued and even humble, but privately very much in charge) but the controversy in the opening days of the Democratic Convention over the seating of the Mississippi delegation. Two groups of delegates -- one representing the regular, all-white party regulars, the other representing the integrated, mostly black Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party -- were fighting to be seated; Johnson's fabled abilities to forge a compromise seemed to be making no progress. Convinced that an open floor fight would drive the entire South out of the party and alienate black voters in the North, Johnson considered -- apparently quite seriously -- withdrawing from the race on the eve of his nomination and throwing it open to the convention (which he had no doubt would, if left to its own devices, nominate Robert Kennedy). "I do not believe I can physically and mentally carry the responsibilities of the bomb and the world and the Negroes and the South," he told his aide Walter Jenkins as he wrote out a statement announcing his withdrawal. He complained self-pityingly about what he considered the uniformly negative press coverage he was receiving (in reality, Johnson's press was very good throughout 1964). Only when Hubert Humphrey -- desperate for a place on the ticket with Johnson -- finally helped cobble together a compromise that prevented a floor flight and limited the walkouts to the two Mississippi delegations did Johnson's spirits revive and the talk of withdrawing cease.
Competing with the personal, political and legislative issues that preoccupied Johnson during most of his first year in office was the steadily darkening problem of Vietnam. The material here does not add anything dramatically new to what we already know about the process leading to the disastrous American intervention in the conflict, but it does suggest the need for some modest revisions to existing accounts.
The Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964, long seen as a critical moment in the escalation of the war and as a somewhat cynical pretext for exacting a resolution from Congress in support of increased military efforts there, appears here to have had a rather more complicated history. Johnson's first instinct after North Vietnamese patrol boats fired on an American ship was to respond with restraint and minimize the incident. Its importance grew as the news media began reporting the events and as Johnson became concerned about attacks on him from the right if he did not react more decisively. He and his aides were even more reluctant to respond to an alleged second North Vietnamese attack, which ultimately precipitated the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, because they themselves were uncertain about whether it had actually occurred. But once again, the press began reporting the attack even without official confirmation, and Johnson feared that he could not deny that it had happened without seeming weak.
JOHNSON does not appear to have had any doubts about the domino theory and the importance of "credibility" to American foreign policy and about the connection of Vietnam to both. But more than most of those around him, he also understood the dangers -- both to himself and to the nation -- of a deepening involvement in the war. These conversations help confirm the arguments of Leslie Gelb, Larry Berman and other scholars who say that Johnson resolved this issue much as he resolved others -- politically. The political risks of failing to respond decisively, he consistently concluded, were much greater than the dangers of increasing the commitment. And in 1964 -- with the antiwar movement in its infancy, with Johnson facing his biggest political problems in the South and with the President in the midst of a campaign in which his opponent, Barry Goldwater, was a right-wing hawk -- it would be hard to argue that in the short term, at least, he was wrong.
The appearance of "Taking Charge" helps mark the beginning of an important scholarly project: the publication of taped conversations of three of the most important postwar Presidents. Besides this book and the impressive volume drawn from tapes made in the Kennedy White House during the Cuban missile crisis, there is a volume drawn from recently opened Nixon tapes, edited by Stanley I. Kutler, scheduled for publication in February. These, and others that are certainly still to come, will give us a picture of the private world of the Presidency that we have never had before and will probably never have again. (There was no extensive taping of conversations by any President before Kennedy; and, as far as we know, there has been none at all since Nixon.) They also provide us with a very rare opportunity: the chance to hear the spontaneous, unfiltered voices of major historical figures. No collection of manuscripts, no after-the-fact oral history, no contemporary account by a journalist will ever have the immediacy or the revelatory power of these conversations. Reading them is an extraordinary experience.

Where The Boys Went

BYLINE: By Jesse Green; Jesse Green, a regular contributor to the Magazine, is writing "The Velveteen Father," a memoir.

 BODY:
He called himself -- right there in the Yellow Pages -- the Legend of the Village, and I suppose it was part of his legendary status that, on the Sunday night of Labor Day weekend, 1980, in the middle of the kind of heat wave that makes even the brownstones weep, he alone among air-conditioner merchants answered the phone. The unit that ended up in my window that midnight lasted only one season, and the tag dangling from its chassis provided instructions on the use of a hand grenade ("remove pin . . . "), but it was my first night in Greenwich Village and I was overjoyed because my neighborhood offered everything in the world, or something like it, and I was now part of the legend, too.
Hard to say what that legend was, exactly, but it had something to do with late rent, intellectual coffee, naked theater, naked men. Here in the Village -- just that unmodified noun, as if there were only one in the world -- the fringe became the garment itself, no longer just the decorative brocade. Even as a child I would have known from musicals like "Bells Are Ringing" and "Wonderful Town" that this was where young people with artistic hopes went to change the world, and where older people with artistic chagrin dragged on, making weary remarks about how the world changed them. Somehow, too, I would have known that this was where gay men went if they wanted more from life than drawn blinds, florist shops and special pen pals. In the Village, the bars had picture windows, and love was made wherever it was found. 
 Whether you were a celebrant or a celibate, the sense of freedom was compelling. I had come for graduate school, or so I told myself and my parents, but when that fizzled I didn't rush off somewhere else. My real education was just beginning, and the subject of my anti-bachelor's thesis was how to be gay without being an exile from the cultural mainstream. It wasn't hard to learn in the Village. That first grenade-cooled morning, I looked out my window to find a large tour group looking right back. "Here we see a tiny Federal townhouse, built by Aaron Burr in 1829," the guide bellowed. "Later it was a stop on the underground railroad, then a Jazz Age bohemian salon -- and now me! In 1980 it was still possible to connect the life I lived in my little rooms to the life described in books by Villagers like James Baldwin and Djuna Barnes.
Barnes -- the author of an early lesbian novel -- had lived on Patchin Place, a quaint cul-de-sac of low brick buildings arranged about a cobbled courtyard as if this were Montparnasse. It took hours to find it the first time I looked; every block seemed to be a quaint cul-de-sac of low brick buildings. Yes, a street might start out straight, but inevitably it twisted itself into a question mark. In the Village, macadam was destiny. Settled before Manhattan's grid got superimposed on the wilds north of Wall Street, much of the neighborhood was platted along Indian paths now long forgotten, forcing last century's map makers into such marvelous perversities as the intersection of 4th Street and 10th Street, of Waverly and Waverly. These unlikely conjunctions provided generations of Villagers with a model for the unlikely conjunctions of their lives -- not to mention the sudden turnings and obscure cul-de-sacs in which to live them.
This was heaven for gay men, of course, but it was heady even if you weren't gay. Tourists came to see the show with minds cautiously open -- to entertainment, at least. Nuclear families could be seen photographing themselves below the marquee for "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom" or pointing discreetly at the fauna of Christopher Street, little knowing they were mostly pointing at one another: that furry man in the leather chaps and not much else was probably from New Jersey. Indeed, for all its sweaty peep-show decadence, the Village was never really about sexual display. It was instead a hometown for those who had left their hometowns behind. It was where gay men's history, the only history they knew about, had happened -- though by the time my own diaspora brought me there, the Stonewall Inn, hallowed as the Bastille of gay liberation, had become a bagel shop.
If the Village was a neighborhood of exiles, at least it was a neighborhood. Many mornings, so Barnes's biographer tells us, her friend E.E. Cummings called out through his window on Patchin Place, "Are ya still alive, Djuna?!" -- as if she could answer if the answer were no.
By 1985, the Stonewall was a Chinese restaurant and Washington Square Park a 10-acre drug mart. Little fires popped up in the night; one's garbage got rifled for five-cent redemptions. What forces wreaked havoc on the Village in the 80's were only those forces wreaking havoc everywhere: trickle-down economics, corporate hubris, the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill. Oh, and a virus. A realtor I knew told me with only a tinge of regret that she'd never had so much business: filling the studios of men who'd gone home to die with Wall Street trainees who skated to work. She didn't say what happened to the men whose families wouldn't have them back, but I knew; I saw them hobbling down pharmacy aisles, all belt and cane and Adam's apple.
Had I been the kind of person to venture above 14th Street -- well, I had gone to Williams-Sonoma to ogle the armadillo chutney -- I might have learned sooner what was happening to Chelsea: it was becoming the new gay mecca. Gay men had always lived there, of course; the Chelsea Hotel was for years a redoubt of silk robes and swish. But a few closeted homosexuals were not enough to give the place a discernible identity. In fact Chelsea's identity was a lack of identity: it was the emptiness between the Village and Macy's. As a result, it had been beyond the usual process of quaintification, in which gay men and other bohemians move into characterful, historic but seedy areas, pretty them up and then get priced out.
But if Chelsea had once been No Man's Land, it was now undeniably Boystown; in an episode of spontaneous mass self-exile reminiscent of religious schisms, the subculture formerly headquartered at Christopher Street had transplanted itself, lock, stock and leather, a mile to the north. Yet it was not the same subculture when it arrived -- and not just because the dead and the drag queens got left behind. Organized along broad avenues, not inchoate "places" and polygonal "squares," the New Land offered a new life. On Sixth Avenue, superstores ensconced themselves in former Ladies Mile megaliths to serve the cash-rich gay colony. On Seventh, male couples in baseball caps, chinos and other tropes of suburban normality cruised the aisles of Calphalon. But it was on Eighth that the brave new culture came into its own: every dusk on the Avenue of the Deltoids was a regimental parade of the pumped.
Visitors from what's left of the Old Land may not feel welcome. The promenaders, for all the exposure, are more imposing than inviting; instead of sexuality you sense a hard, cold challenge. Quick, jump out of the way of the skater! Look out on the left for the lethal cheekbones! At a bar called Splash the go-go boys are no more shapely (or shaven) than the patrons. On the narrow sidewalks, men with pectorals the size of saute pans wait for tables at trendy eateries with defensively retro names like Big Cup. Is this a neighborhood or an underwear ad? Whatever it is, at least it's alive; while ghosts were busy colonizing the Village, hard bodies had come to Chelsea in droves.
The two facts are not unrelated: no one likes to build on a graveyard. It's apt that the first outpost of the gay migration was the establishment in 1982 of the Chelsea Gym, for the theme of the new order was Muscle -- not just political muscle and the rejection of ingrained social passivity, but also muscle as a literal response to the waste and wasting of the epidemic. New Gay Man did not see a contradiction between his sexuality and his world. He was, for most of the day, a suit, gay in his body only; naturally his body became baroquely articulated to signify that. No "gay" energy remained for Village Man's traditional pursuit of poetry and street beautification. As a result it is not pretty in Chelsea, and never will be, except for the people.
Or is it too soon to tell? The transformation that began in 1982 has only recently completed its first stage -- a milestone best marked, perhaps, by the 1994 relocation to 19th Street, after 10 years on a tawdry West Village block, of the community's major bookstore, A Different Light. Or perhaps it is best marked by a more ominous Chelsea development: the dramatic rise in antigay violence (which continues to decline in the Village). If gay men no longer see themselves as very gay, certainly their antagonists do. Which may mean that the promise of normalcy that Chelsea represents is as dangerous as it is alluring, for no matter how much we may wish to dissociate ourselves from our former calamities, calamities have a way of persevering.
But young gay men do not want to be reminded of the unfortunate times. They do not want to repair a past, let alone consort with it; they want to fit into a healthy mesomorphic present, to abjure the ghosts not only of AIDS but also of the whole weird struggle for liberation. They are already, God knows, liberated; liberated into what is another matter. Aside from their physiques they are indistinguishable from their heterosexual contemporaries, and wasn't that the point? They feel they have earned the right to be square: square haircuts, square chests, square apartments on square streets. Here, where the Manhattan grid takes over in earnest, there are only right angles as far as the eye can see.
That 17th Street never intersects itself does not make Chelsea soulless. And there are advantages to a community that aims to serve its residents and not just amuse the tourists. As a place to live and buy efficiently, Chelsea has more to recommend it than the Village ever did: more supermarkets, more movie theaters and now, thanks to a migration of galleries, more art -- or at least more of the business of art. In the Village, which generally rose at noon for its first cigarette, all this would have seemed too purposeful. The people who for decades made their homes there were employed in a kind of labor that efficiency studies cannot detect. They were scientists in our culture's research-and-development lab, conducting astonishing experiments into the nature of freedom -- of the body, of the mind -- and trying to tinker with the prevailing balance between the ideal of individual liberty and the need for sustainable community.
If the Village ultimately erred on the side of liberty, it has paid too dearly. Are ya still alive? is the cry that echoes, often unanswered, in its irregular courtyards and incorrigible streets. The men staring out of the bars' picture windows seem not so much bold as impassive now, and even the reincarnated Stonewall cannot attract enough customers to survive. It took a Village to make Chelsea possible, but it seems that the Village outwitted itself. Rents are too high for the neighborhood to spawn any more revolutions. And now the thing blase gay men say is not I never go above 14th Street but I never go below.
Meanwhile, Aaron Burr's house is for sale; know any poets with $1.4 million to spare? And the Legend of the Village is no longer listed. Not to worry; if a gay man moves to the city on a hot summer night, he's probably moving to Chelsea, and he can buy a nonexploding air-conditioner, along with a map-of-the-world shower curtain, at Bed, Bath and Beyond. He will hardly miss anything, up there. Anything but the legend.

HEADLINE: Inflation? Where?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Maria Ramirez is right when she claims that additional Federal Reserve monetary tightening would be a mistake (Op-Ed, Oct. 14). However, her reasoning is incorrect. The Fed should not be tightening because there is no inflation or any sign of it. 
 Increased global competition, deregulation in many industries, the growth of discount operations in retailing and the increased use of new technologies have all reduced pricing flexibility in most industries. In fact, the vast majority of companies are now under the assumption that they cannot raise prices at any time in the near future.
Ms. Ramirez's assertion that consumer debt is too high is just not substantiated by the facts. The increased use of credit cards and the increased propensity of home ownership have accounted for a significant portion of the increase in consumer debt. Also, much of the debt is held by those who are benefiting from the huge increase in the stock market -- their overall financial conditions have actually improved, despite higher debt levels.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
National advertisers strive to brand their product names on the minds of the consumer.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

DATELINE: DANA POINT, Calif.

 BODY:
IF, as they say, the future is where we will spend the rest of our lives, America's biggest and most persistent consumer marketers are striving to insure that we will spend that future, well, spending.
"Branding the Future" is the theme of the 88th annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers, which began on Friday with about 580 people at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel here. The featured speakers, as well as those attending the conference, have been ebullient in their belief that name-brand products have recaptured the hearts and minds of consumers -- as the booming economy indicates. But they urged marketers in competitive categories to remember that keeping that loyalty is no sure thing. 
 " 'Branding the Future' is right on target because, for the consumer, a trusted brand is a continuous promise of future satisfaction," said Irvine O. Hockaday Jr., president and chief executive of Hallmark Cards Inc.
Brands are for "a competitive and, incidentally, an economic advantage," he said, referring to the higher prices that brands often command, "a differential."
Hallmark is working to "move from being a brand consumers prefer to a brand consumers insist on," Mr. Hockaday said, through efforts like intensified brand-building advertising and improving distribution and display at retail outlets.
That latter point is becoming more important, said Ralph Rydholm, chief executive and managing partner of Euro RSCG Tatham, a unit of Havas Advertising, because of "the way the retail business has evolved into mega-stores where there is no one to help you at the point of sale.
"The brand has to speak for itself," he continued, "so consumers have to have a good idea of what the brand stands for."
If a brand must speak to a consumer, the reverse also needs to be true, asserted John Hayes, executive vice president for global branding and advertising at the American Express Company.
"The real branding opportunity today is to create and sustain a dialogue with your customer," Mr. Hayes said. "Those who know how to do that well will be the ones with an advantage over other brands." Interactive advertising can play a crucial role in supporting such two-way brand communications, he added.
Charlotte Beers, chairwoman emeritus of American Express's principal advertising agency, the Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group P.L.C., said the "brand relationship" American Express had built with customers bought the company time to fix its problems earlier this decade when credit cards began eroding the market share of the American Express green charge card.
But, Ms. Beers warned, a decision to support brand-building efforts is by itself no guarantee of success because "brands are still failing and declining."
That was underscored by the juxtaposition of two events on Friday. As the McDonald's Corporation announced lower-than-expected earnings because of problems selling its fast food in the United States, a primary rival, the Burger King Corporation unit of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., was honored at the conference when Paul Clayton, president of Burger King North America, was named a Marketer of the Year for 1997 by the trade publication Brand Week.
The top honor, Grand Marketer, was shared by two executives for their efforts in helping make the inaugural season of the Women's National Basketball Association so successful. They are: Val Ackerman, president of the women's league, and Rick Welts, chief marketing officer of the National Basketball Association, which developed the new league.
In all, 15 marketing executives received the Brand Week awards, including three in media and entertainment: Howard Roffman, vice president for licensing at Lucasfilm Ltd.; Karen Edwards, brand management director of Yahoo Inc., and Judy Fearing, chief marketing officer for the ESPN cable television network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company.
Preston Padden, president of another Disney media unit, the ABC television network, offered a slick presentation of his network's much discussed branding campaign, carrying the theme "TV is Good."
The campaign, which was debated for its tongue-in-cheek tone, "takes the love side of the viewer's love-hate relationship with TV," Mr. Padden declared.
And Lisa McRee, a new co-host of ABC's "Good Morning America," showed attendees at a general session a videotape promoting "The Century," an ABC News series of six two-hour programs about the 20th century scheduled to be shown in early 1999. The audience, of course, was filled with potential buyers of commercial time on those special programs.
ABC's competitors are also taking turns sponsoring portions of the conference: The CBS unit of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the Fox Broadcasting Company unit of the News Corporation and the NBC unit of the General Electric Corporation. Each network is paying the association $100,000 for its sponsorship, hence the hard sell during each network's presentation ranging from the ABC commercial for "The Century" to a visit from an NBC sitcom star to notepads with CBS eye logos.
In business matters, the association made its annual change in elected officers. James J. Garrity, senior vice president and advertising director at First Union National Bank, part of the First Union Corporation, was named the 1997-98 chairman. Mr. Garrity, who was vice chairman for the last year, succeeds the 1996-97 chairman, Ronald O. Cox, group vice president of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company.
John Costello, senior executive vice president and general marketing manager of Sears, Roebuck & Company, was elected the 1997-98 vice chairman.
Separately, Mr. Cox was presented the Robert V. Goldstein Award for his work as campaign manager for a child abuse prevention effort produced by the Advertising Council. The award is named for a former member of the association and the council.
The conference continues through Monday.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
'Quintessential Salesman' Is Poised to Take the Helm at AT&T

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19

 BODY:
When C. Michael Armstrong became the chief executive of the Hughes Electronics Corporation in 1992, he wasted no time. He and his lieutenants labored night and day for three months on a plan to restructure the bloated military contractor and cut thousands of jobs.
When the plan was ready, a former Hughes executive recalls, Mr. Armstrong summoned the corporate staff into an auditorium and spoke for more than an hour, without a written text, about the need for the change. His speech was so inspiring and convincing that the audience gave him a standing ovation -- even though half of them were about to lose their jobs. 
 The story illustrates his extraordinary intensity and brilliant salesmanship, two of the main attributes that he is expected to bring to the AT&T Corporation. The announcement of Mr. Armstrong's appointment as the new chief executive at the telecommunications giant is expected as soon as Monday.
His experience at Hughes would help in efforts to cut AT&T's bureaucracy and costs, shore up its eroding lead in the long-distance business, move it strongly into local phone service, and steer the company through a consolidation in the telecommunications business that in some ways resembles the same process in the aerospace industry.
Mr. Armstrong's move from Hughes to AT&T would not be his first from aerospace to telecommunications. He has already made a similar shift within Hughes itself.
He has transformed the Los Angeles-based company, which is a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, from a military contractor that valued technology over profits into a customer-oriented and global company focused on some fast-growing segments of the non-military telecommunications business such as DirecTV, the nation's largest satellite-to-home television service. Hughes's stock was less than $20 a share when he took over. It closed at $65.25 on Friday.
"Hughes was absolutely third in a two-man race when it came to competing, other than on technical excellence," said Michael Beltramo, an aerospace consultant in Los Angeles. "He really changed that."
Mr. Armstrong is expected to be succeeded at Hughes by Michael T. Smith, who is vice chairman and head of the military business. Mr. Smith was a financial officer at General Motors who worked on the acquisition of Hughes in 1985. He then came to Hughes as chief financial officer and began the process that Mr. Armstrong continued -- instilling business discipline into the company.
Mr. Smith, who has been based in the Washington area, is described as having a good sense of humor and being strong on financial analysis. "He's much more likely to explain a decision in terms of numbers," said one senior Hughes executive. "Armstrong is more likely to try to capture your imagination."
Mr. Smith is the younger brother of the General Motors chairman John F. Smith Jr., but Hughes executives said they had no worries that this would cause awkwardness in the day-to-day contacts between the two companies.
The moves come at a critical juncture for Hughes. Mr. Armstrong was scheduled to embark in early November on a road show aimed at winning G.M. shareholders' final approval for what has been termed Hughes's "triple play" reorganization.
The company's defense business will be sold to the Raytheon Company for about $9.5 billion. The Delco automotive electronics unit -- which General Motors combined with the old Hughes Aircraft Company to create Hughes Electronics -- will be returned to G.M.'s direct control.
Hughes will be left with communications satellite manufacturing, wireless and satellite communications and DirecTV. These businesses had revenues of about $4.1 billion last year, of a total of $15.9 billion. But Hughes is a leader in all those segments and Mr. Armstrong has said he expected them to grow at least 20 percent a year.
Still, the future of even this remaining part is open to question. Aerospace executives say that General Motors might spin off Hughes, which has little connection to its automobile business. Or it might sell all or parts of the subsidiary. Aerospace industry executives say the Boeing Company has shown some interest in buying the satellite manufacturing business.
With the transition of Hughes nearly complete, and with Hughes shrinking to a third of its former size, Mr. Armstrong, who turned 59 on Saturday, might have felt it was time to move onto the bigger stage at AT&T.
He himself has not commented publicly about the long-rumored move to AT&T, though in a Hughes internal newsletter last month he seemed to disavow interest. "The reality is, I'm not looking for another job," he wrote. "I've just bought a new home in the Los Angeles area, I thoroughly enjoy what I'm doing at Hughes and I am enthusiastic about our prospects for the future."
Hughes executives said they do not expect any problems completing the breakup. And they insisted that Mr. Smith and other managers will be able to carry on well without Mr. Armstrong.
Still, General Motors wanted to keep Mr. Armstrong enough that earlier this year it gave him a grant of $10 million in its class H stock, which tracks Hughes's performance. He will lose that grant if he leaves the company before 2003. That retention agreement apparently convinced Mr. Armstrong, who had been renting a house, that he would stay put long enough to buy one.
Mr. Armstrong, a gregarious but demanding manager, was born in Detroit and studied business and economics at Miami University of Ohio, where he also played football.
He spent three decades at the International Business Machines Corporation, ending up as head of its international marketing operations. One blemish on an otherwise stellar career was that I.B.M. began to squander its lead in personal computers under his watch.
Still, Mr. Armstrong was considered a leading candidate to become the next leader of I.B.M. until, in late 1991, he was told by the company's chairman, John Akers, that he would not get the top job. The reasons were not clear, though it might have been because Mr. Armstrong was too old to have much time in the top post after Mr. Akers retired or because I.B.M.'s board had already decided that an outsider was needed.
So Mr. Armstrong left I.B.M. to head Hughes, the company founded in 1932 by the eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes. Until the acquisition by General Motors, the company had been owned by the nonprofit Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and it paid little attention to costs and profits.
Mr. Armstrong has cut more than 25 percent of the Hughes work force, shuttered or sold noncore businesses, changed the salary system to reward performance and re-directed research labs from blue-sky projects to those aimed at the bottom line.
Mr. Armstrong is to some extent harvesting crops planted before he arrived. Hughes had already developed DirecTV and other telecommunications businesses.
And the ultimate success remains to be seen. DirecTV, which transmits 175 channels of television to pizza-pan-sized antennas, has 2.9 million United States subscribers, but its growth has been slower than initial rosy expectations. And competition has intensified. AT&T owns 2.5 percent of DirecTV with options to expand its stake.
Those who know him say that Mr. Armstrong is a hard worker, sometimes making round trips in a single day to Washington in the company plane.
As a manager, he thoroughly dissects each business and draws up detailed plans laying out each person's responsibility. "Assume nothing" reads a sign he keeps on his desk, reflecting his belief that a manager cannot assume things will get done unless subordinates are held accountable.
"There are no excuses working with him," said one Hughes executive. Mr. Armstrong will review the progress of a project every quarter, this executive said. But if targets are missed, the reviews will increase in frequency to every two months, then every month, then every week. After that, the manager will be replaced.
Mr. Armstrong is at his best listening to customers and making pitches to them. "He's the quintessential salesman," said John E. Koehler, a former executive. "You could brief him and then he'd go in and his arguments would be better than what you hoped."
But Dr. Koehler, who is now president of Tachyon Inc., a communications company, said that Mr. Armstrong sometimes vacillated rather than take a firm stand. "A really good salesman is a chameleon," he said. "I guess I think there was an awful lot of that in Mike."
Mr. Armstrong brings the same intensity to recreation. In tennis, he is not overpowering but returns almost every volley until his opponent makes a mistake. And after he began riding a Harley Davidson for fun, he became so smitten he invested in the motorcycle company and discussed strategy with its management.
On Friday night, Mr. Armstrong attended a small retirement dinner for a Hughes vice president at the Regency Club in Los Angeles. While he told the people that he could not say anything about the news reports, he went on to thank those there for the good times he had at Hughes.
The dozen or so people there could not applaud something that was not official but emotions were high just the same. Said one attendee: "It was more like an unspoken acknowledgement that we're going to miss him."

HEADLINE: Why the U.S. Fell Short of Ambitious Goals for Reducing Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Four years ago, President Clinton stood in the Rose Garden and declared that by the end of the decade his Administration would reverse the increase in the nation's emissions of pollutants that threaten to warm the planet's climate.
On Oct. 17, 1993, as he issued a 50-point plan, the President said, "Today, I reaffirm my personal, and announce our nation's, commitment to reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000." To skeptics who called the plan too weak, he promised periodic reviews and modifications to keep the reduction of emissions on track. 
 Mr. Clinton's detailed promise, and how the nation is breaking it, will be at the heart of the Administration's problem this week in Bonn when representatives from around the world once again meet on the climate. They will be negotiating how quickly the industrial nations must rein in the emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases that build up in the atmosphere and trap the heat of the sun.
The talks are supposed to end in December in Kyoto, Japan, with a new treaty on climate change to strengthen the one most of the world's nation's agreed to in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. And while the United States has called for a binding new treaty, it is also calling for what the White House calls realistic targets and timetables for reducing emissions that cause the greenhouse effect.
At the current rate of growth, the emission of greenhouse gases by the United States will be 13 percent above the level of 1990 by the end of the decade. The Administration has indicated that it will most likely postpone until the year 2010 or beyond the goal Mr. Clinton pledged to meet by 2000. Instead of accomplishing the goal in the year Mr. Clinton leaves office, the country would have to wait until well after his successor finished a second term.
The reason, many critics say, is that the Administration refused to impose mandatory measures, like requiring the fuel efficiency of automobiles to be increased, or raising energy taxes to force people to conserve fuel. Greenhouse gases come mostly form burning fossil fuels, like coal and oil, and one of the best ways to reduce their emission is to save energy.
"The only thing we know for absolute certain is that voluntary programs won't work," said Jessica Tuchman Matthews, an environmentalist who worked for Mr. Clinton at the State Department and is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "And that is progress. It was probably a stage that we had to go through."
Kathleen McGinty, the top environmental aide at the White House, cited three main reasons for the failure of the 50-point plan to achieve its goals: Congressional cuts in financing for energy conservation, the unexpectedly high rate of economic growth and fuel prices that were cheaper than anticipated.
Other factors, too, helped to undermine the Administration's efforts. Congress temporarily blocked the Energy Department from issuing new energy efficiency standards for household appliances, and the department itself failed to issue new efficiency standards for electrical distribution transformers on power lines, where about 7 percent of all the nation's power simply leaks away.
A proposal to label car tires so that consumers could tell which ones provided the best gasoline mileage went nowhere; the same fate awaited a tax proposal to discourage employers from subsidizing parking spaces for their employees. And forestry agencies missed the goals for planting trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow.
Only 70 percent of the projected reductions in greenhouse gases materialized, and even these reductions were offset when the booming economy brought a growing demand for fossil fuels.
When Mr. Clinton issued his action plan four years ago, he projected that it would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by about 109 million tons a year by 2000. That would be enough to return emissions to their 1990 level: 1.58 billion tons of carbon, an amount that had grown only slightly to 1.59 billion tons in 1992, the year before the plan was announced.
Instead, the emissions in 1995 totaled 1.67 billion tons, and when the annual report for 1996 is issued later this month, it is virtually certain to show further growth. To be sure, the growth would have been even greater without the energy-saving plan.
Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, called the reductions achieved "nothing to sneeze at."
"It is a very big achievement, that voluntary programs were able to do that well," he said. "The trouble is, the legs were cut out from under the voluntary program. Volunteerism works a lot better when it is matched up with mandatory measures. Jawboning is going to be less effective unless there is a cap on emissions."
A report by the State Department in July predicted that if the present levels of spending on energy conservation programs are continued under the plan, the emission of greenhouse gases would exceed 2 billion tons by the year 2010 and 2.2 billion tons by 2020.
So the Administration wants to impose a new cap on future greenhouse gases. Under its plan, companies would be given permits to emit greenhouse gases, but at a reduced level. Companies that can inexpensively reduce their emissions below the cap would be allowed to sell their excess permits to companies that have a harder time cutting emissions. This approach, advocates say, would drive down the overall cost of compliance while guaranteeing that the nation's emissions' goals would be met.
But the utility industry, which did more than any other sector to slow the growth of emissions under the voluntary plan, opposes stricter measures.
"We just have a basic disagreement," said Robert A. Beck, vice president for environmental affairs of the Edison Electric Institute. which represents electric companies, "We believe you have not maximized the voluntary programs yet."
Hundreds of utilities signed up for a voluntary program called the Climate Challenge, and the steps they have promised to take are estimated to have cut 45 million tons from emissions of greenhouse gases that otherwise would have occurred by 2000.
But despite those reductions, the total emissions from the utility companies nationwide are going up, not down, and many of the reductions came from actions like switching to natural gas from coal, which might have occurred anyway.
Of the reductions utilities say they achieved, 30 percent came from nuclear power plants, which do not emit any polluting gases, notably the opening by a Texas utility of a nuclear power plant that was ordered decades before global warming appeared on the nation's agenda. Only 7 percent of the reduction came from renewable energy projects, for example solar and wind.
In the transportation sector, which accounts for about a third of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, the action plan offered almost no proposals to reduce emissions in the short term, and none were forthcoming. A series of negotiations among industry, environmentalists and Government officials, aimed at achieving 2 percent annual increases in automotive fuel efficiency, broke down in disagreement.
Instead, the Administration is banking on long-term research into new technologies, expecting that in the decades ahead automobiles can go two or three times as far on a gallon of gas -- or some other fuel.
Opposition in Congress to spending on energy conservation and renewable energy appears to be waning. Based on actions in Congress so far, it appears that spending on these areas at the Energy Department next year will grow 10 percent, to about $924 million.
Although that is still less than the $1.1 billion spent in 1995, the Sustainable Energy Coalition, a group of business, consumer, environmental and policy organizations, said the shift "reflects growing Congressional awareness that energy efficiency and renewable-energy programs offer a cost-effective solution to environmental pollution -- including global climate change."
The Administration's voluntary programs have helped demonstrate that big companies can easily adopt more lighting that uses less electricity and otherwise conserve energy in commercial buildings.
But some of the most effective actions taken under the Clinton Administration's plan were not voluntary. Rather, they involved old-fashioned command and control regulations.
The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, sets rules under the Clean Air Act that require large landfills to capture and burn their emissions of methane, a gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect. When the agency issued the rules in 1996, it acted more strictly than planned, and the latest estimates are that the emission of greenhouse gases will be reduced by 8 million tons by the year 2000. That is 60 percent more reductions than the original plan predicted.

HEADLINE: U.S. Alliance Brings Prestige To Argentines

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 19

 BODY:
For many Argentines, President Clinton's decision last week to name their country a non-NATO ally of the United States was the latest proof that Argentina is finally returning to prominence in the industrialized world after decades of social and economic ruin.
While the distinction of non-NATO ally is largely symbolic -- title holders have access to surplus military equipment -- Argentina is the first country in the hemisphere to receive it, joining Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Japan, South Korea and Australia. 
 "There is a certain amount of prestige, real or imagined, associated with having this official title of close friend of the United States," said Felipe A. Noguera, a political analyst for Mora y Araujo Noguera, a major polling concern.
"Argentines have always thought of themselves as more advanced than the rest of Latin America, and for many people this non-NATO distinction justifies those sentiments, at least vis-a-vis the United States," Mr. Noguera said.
Mr. Clinton, who left Argentina and returned to Washington today after a weeklong trip to South America that included stops in Venezuela and Brazil, said he intended to make Argentina a close United States ally as a reward for sending troops on 16 peacekeeping operations from Bosnia to Cyprus to Haiti.
"In recognition of your country's extraordinary contributions to international peacekeeping, I have notified our Congress of my intention to designate Argentina as a major non-NATO ally under our laws," Mr. Clinton said. "Our alliance of values goes beyond our efforts against threats to peace and security, but it begins there."
President Carlos Saul Menem, who has often tried to convince Argentines that recent economic and social reforms are returning their country to the first rank of developed countries, praised Mr. Clinton's decision.
In the 1940's, Argentina was one of the world's 10 most affluent countries, but a string of coups and economic missteps sank it into chaos.
Just a decade ago, it seemed implausible that Argentina, then a staunch critic of the dominant presence of the United States in the world, would become its most loyal ally in Latin America.
But since taking office in 1989, Mr. Menem abandoned the isolationist polices of former President Juan Domingo Peron, and shifted Argentina's historically antagonistic relationship with the United States to one of almost unconditional support, particularly in foreign policy.
For example, at the request of the United States, Mr. Menem's Government abolished its program to build medium-range ballistic missiles with the help of Egypt and Iraq, placed its once-secret nuclear program under international inspection, and strongly backed such United States policies as Washington's military intervention in Haiti and its continuing condemnations of human rights violations in Cuba.
At the same time, Mr. Menem pushed economic changes, including selling off unprofitable Government businesses and lifting tariffs, that have brought stability, more foreign investment, and high growth rates to a country once plagued by hyperinflation.
Mr. Menem also restructured the armed forces, placing them fully under civilian control after years of military repression in which more than 30,000 people are estimated to have died or disappeared.
"We have seen a 180-degree change in the way the Argentine Government deals with the United States," said Carlos Fedrigotti, president of the American Chamber of Commerce here.
But Argentina's neighbors, Chile and Brazil, are upset that the United States did not grant them the same status and expressed concern that Argentina's designation could upset the regional balance of power.
Asked about that possibility, Mr. Clinton said: "There is nothing here designed to upset the military balance in South America. We want Argentina to be working with Chile, to be working with Brazil."
Foreign diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Argentina had pressed the Clinton Administration to grant it the non-NATO ally status as a show of good faith, after the United States, against Argentina's wishes, agreed to sell Chile F-16 fighter jets.
In the past, the diplomats said, the Clinton Administration had rewarded Argentina with "mere crumbs" for its strong support of United States policies. For example, Mr. Menem was the first Latin American leader to visit the White House after Mr. Clinton took office. And last year, the Clinton Administration eliminated the visa requirement for Argentine citizens traveling to the United States temporarily for business or pleasure, making them the only Latin Americans who do not need a visa.

HEADLINE: 'Soft Money' Talks

 BODY:
With the battle over campaign finance reform legislation resuming in Washington today, opponents of reform are again arguing that Americans do not much care. Many citizens may not be able to see how their lives are affected by all those coffees, receptions, telephone calls, fund-raising letters and other campaign rites. But any suggestion that hustling for dollars has no bearing on ordinary Americans is dispelled by a new report from Common Cause outlining how the open-ended donations at the center of recent scandals have had a far-reaching effect on government.
Common Cause examines 11 elements of the budget and tax deal enacted earlier this year. Its conclusion is that the biggest winners in that accord were not Americans in general but the individuals and companies that since 1995 generated $300 million in the virtually unregulated category of contributions known as "soft money." These donors, in effect, got billions of dollars in help from the Government in exchange for millions of dollars in contributions. 
Some of the country's biggest corporations, for example, won a change in the way their business taxes will now be calculated, saving them billions of dollars over the next five years. The revision involves a relaxation of the rules governing the so-called "alternative minimum tax," enacted as part of the tax reforms of 1986. This tax was designed to insure that companies taking advantage of tax breaks were at least required to pay some minimal tax. By far the heaviest lobbyist in favor of the change was the oil and gas industry, which had contributed $13.4 million in soft money to the Republicans since 1995 and $5.5 million to the Democrats.
One of the best-known provisions of the tax bill, a $50 billion tax credit for tobacco companies, was repealed this fall as soon as the public realized its connection to the $11 million soft money contribution by the industry to the Republicans. Another provision allows broadcasters to retain the licenses for their current broadcast bands even after they make the transition to digital television. Media companies were almost equally generous to both political parties, contributing $2.2 million to Democrats and $2.6 million to Republicans.
The cut in the capital gains tax also resulted from lobbying, largely by the securities industry, which contributed $10.5 million in soft money to the Republicans and $7 million to the Democrats. When the capital gains cut was approved, Congressional supporters advertised it as a way to boost the economy. The more obvious explanation is that it was a payoff to the rich individuals who have become the bankrollers of the political system.
The list goes on and on. A change in the Medicare law allowing recipients to set up tax-exempt Medical Savings Accounts gave a tremendous benefit to the companies that will now make money from setting up the accounts. These companies were major donors to the Republicans. A restructuring of the Superfund law failed to extend the life of certain taxes that had become a major liability for oil, chemical and insurance interests. These industries were generous donors. A change in the tax on airline tickets will be more onerous for passengers on low-fare airlines than on major carriers. The major airlines gave $2.4 million to both parties in soft money, while the smaller airlines gave $200,000.
The practice of giving political donations and getting benefits is never going to be eliminated, but Congress has a chance to impose some restrictions. The best means would be a ban on soft money contained in the McCain-Feingold bill. If members of Congress care at all about the deepening cynicism of Americans toward their corrupt political system, they will approve the bill.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Says Global Trade Surplus Rose 37%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Japan said today that its merchandise trade surplus in September rose 37.1 percent from a year earlier, to $8.81 billion. The increase, though significant, was smaller than economists had expected.
The politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States rose 30.2 percent, to $4.28 billion, from September 1996, the Japanese Finance Ministry said. 
 Japan's global surplus has tripled since April, when higher taxes slowed sales of imports and forced manufacturers to export more television sets, automobiles and machines. In September, the Japanese shipped more automobiles and electronic goods to the United States.
Economists say that the surplus with the United States will continue to rise as long as the American economy stays healthy.

HEADLINE: Soros to Donate Millions More to Help Russia

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
George Soros, the Hungarian-born American financier and philanthropist, said yesterday that he would donate as much as $500 million in the next three years in Russia trying to improve health care, expand educational opportunities and help retrain the military for civilian jobs.
In a telephone interview from Moscow, Mr. Soros said he would announce the initiative in eight fields today. This latest gift would make him the leading philanthropist in Russia, as well as a donor whose presence exceeds that of the United States, which gave Russia $95 million in foreign aid last year. 
 In the last decade, Mr. Soros, 67, has committed close to $1.5 billion promoting what he calls "open societies" -- the expansion of civil liberties, a free press, and political pluralism -- at home and abroad. Since 1994, he has donated more than $350 million a year to his foundations in more than 30 countries, spending more than $259 million in Russia alone. This new gift would make his foundation in Moscow, the Open Society Institute -- Russia, his largest presence in any country, including the United States.
Mr. Soros's latest gift comes less than a month after Ted Turner, the billionaire founder of Cable News Network, announced that he would donate up to $1 billion, or up to $100 million a year for 10 years, to benefit United Nations programs. When he made his gift, Mr. Turner identified Mr. Soros as the philanthropist he most admired, and his role model returned the compliment.
In a telephone interview from Hong Kong at the time, Mr. Soros called Mr. Turner's gift "wonderful" and urged other wealthy people to emulate the example.
Mr. Soros said that he had spent the last two weeks touring Russia and that the new program reflected the needs he identified during his trip as well as an evaluation of what his foundation has already accomplished. He said that while his tour was "rather strenuous and in some ways frustrating," he believed that the Russian Government led by President Boris N. Yeltsin both needs and deserves Western confidence and assistance.
"I think this Government will be there for at least three years," Mr. Soros said, brushing aside reports that the Government could face a no-confidence vote in the Russian Parliament as early as Wednesday.
While acknowledging that rampant corruption and mismanagement have created a "precarious situation" for the Government, he said he doubted that it would collapse any time soon.
"But during the next three years, the Government must deliver if it wants reform to continue," he added.
In addition to his philanthropy, his Soros Fund Management, the principal investment adviser to the Quantum Group of Funds, based in Curacao, has invested more than $2.5 billion in Russian business, making him the leading Western investor in that country. Mr. Soros said yesterday that he intended to continue investing in Russia as a sign of confidence in the country's leadership, despite controversy among rival investors stemming from his decision to mix philanthropy and investment there.
Mr. Soros has emotional ties to Russia, where his father was imprisoned during World War I. As a child in Hungary, he said in a speech this month in Moscow, he came to know Russian culture and greatly respected its literary traditions and the determination of its people to survive all kinds of oppression. He began his philanthropy in Russia in 1987, before the collapse of the Soviet Union.
He is an American citizen who escaped the Nazis as a Jewish adolescent in Budapest and emigrated to the United States in 1956, after graduating from the London School of Economics.
Mr. Soros's international investments have come under fire, particularly from Mahathir Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia. He has repeatedly accused Mr. Soros of mounting politically motivated attacks on his region's currencies, which Mr. Soros has denied.
During the summer, Mr. Soros shut down his foundation in Belarus after Aleksandr Lukashenko, the popular but autocratic Belarusian President, fined a Soros foundation $3 million for alleged tax violations and seized its bank account.
In the United States, Mr. Soros has been harshly criticized for programs that challenge the nation's antidrug laws and other controversial government programs.
But the growing pressure on Mr. Soros's philanthropic empire -- which stretches from South Africa to Haiti, employs more than 1,300 people and has regional offices in New York and Budapest -- appears only to have stiffened his resolve to promote political pluralism and economic reform.
This year alone, he opened five new offices in Central Asia and another in Guatemala and announced plans for nine new foundations in southern Africa, which would expand the number of countries with Soros foundations to 40.
Given his growing personal fortune, which friends estimate at $5 billion although he has not commented on his wealth, he says his efforts are likely to continue at current levels for at least a decade, and perhaps for two.
Mr. Soros said that the details of the new programs for Russia were still being worked out, but that all of the money, which will total a minimum of $300 million and as much as $500 million in the next three years, would be channeled through his Open Society Institute -- Russia. He was forced to restructure the foundation and to replace its leaders last year after discovering that employees were diverting foundation funds into Swiss bank accounts and using them to buy luxury cars.
"The foundation is now operating very efficiently," Mr. Soros said.
Donna Shalala, President Clinton's Secretary of Health and Human Services, said she was informed of Mr. Soros's prospective gift several weeks ago. She said the Russian Health Ministry was among the more "efficient" Government agencies and predicted that the Yeltsin Government would use the money well. "It's the right gift at the right time," Ms. Shalala said.
Mr. Soros said some of the health care money would be used to set up three to five demonstration sites offering cost-efficient programs to detect and treat tuberculosis, both in prisons and in the general population. Another new project will diagnose and treat drug-resistant bacteria, a leading cause of death in Russian hospitals and what he called "a major health threat not only in Russia but throughout the world."
Health problems in Russia rival those of the poorest African countries. Tuberculosis, for instance, is rampant, affecting an estimated 10 percent of the more than one million people in prisons and labor camps. Only one child in five is born healthy, according to official data, which many experts say understate the problem.
Since 1992, the average life expectancy for men has fallen from 62 years to 59 and is still falling -- as it is for women, though more slowly. No country that reports to the World Health Organization has a life expectancy as low. The death rate has risen by 20 percent, an increase without modern precedent, doctors say.

HEADLINE: France vs. U.S.: Warring Versions of Capitalism

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Anti-Americanism is an old theme here, almost a ritual, one that Prime Minister Lionel Jospin rehearsed recently when he declared that America could not impose its laws on the world and that "ultra-capitalism" was unacceptable.
What was surprising, though, was to find the new American Ambassador to Paris, Felix Rohatyn, agreeing with him. Not, of course, on the question of new French investments in Iran -- the subject that gave Mr. Jospin the occasion for his gibes -- but on the broader issue of American economic domination. 
 "We have no monopoly on ideas," Mr. Rohatyn said here the other day. "We do not believe that what works for us is automatically the best approach for anyone else." And as if to quash forever galloping French fears of an American "ultra-capitalist" system engulfing the globe, Mr. Rohatyn declared roundly: "There is no such thing as the American economic model."
These self-deprecatory remarks, made at the French Institute of International Relations, had a quite different ring from what was said just three months ago, at the Denver summit of major industrial powers. There, it was precisely America's unabashed vaunting of its economic successes and its exhortation to its European allies to follow its free-market recipes that led the French President, Jacques Chirac, to talk huffily about defending "our model."
The clash at Denver underscored the fact that the old sparring that strained but never undid an old alliance has gained a new edge, and a different scope, as France has set itself up as perhaps the nearest thing the United States has to a serious ideological rival in the last decade of the 20th century.
There used to be, of course, a shared enemy: the Soviet Union. Measured against that totalitarian power, the systems in America and France clearly had more in common than set them apart. France may identify the universal message of its Revolution with equality where Americans embrace liberty, but not even the French wanted to be equal on Soviet terms.
The situation has changed. Now that nobody wants to abolish capitalism, and its different forms lie at the heart of the global ideological debate, France and America offer two models whose different merits may be argued. The countries have been freed to explore their differences.
And differences there are: France has vastly better public medicine than America, safer cities, higher minimum wages, less crime and more job security, particularly in its huge state sector.
But it also has a 12.6 percent unemployment rate that is more than double the American, much higher taxes, a long-stagnant economy, crippling social security charges that discourage hiring, scant venture capital and a debilitating anxiety about change that has held back its investment in new technologies.
Which sort of society do you prefer? That is the essence of the debate that has raged here throughout this year and whose core question is: How much, if any, of French solidarity and social protection should be given up to achieve the faster growth and job-creation of the United States?
Unfortunately, the debate has tended to be argued in terms of caricature, increasing resentments between the countries that have then compounded real, if manageable, differences over their roles in Africa, Iran and elsewhere.
Here in France, the image of America generally presented is in some ways an echo of what the Soviets once drew: one of growing urban ghettos, overcrowded prisons, 19th-century wages and galloping capitalist cruelty. It is not uncommon to hear economists declare simply that the American system has failed.
In the United States, the French are almost uniformly presented as clinging stubbornly to archaic socialist ideals even as their unemployment rate climbs close to 13 percent and a wired world passes them by. It is not the merits of French public medicine that gain attention but the silliness of French strikers.
"The old Franco-American antagonism, the almost genetic rivalry, has been aggravated," said Jean Baudrillard, a sociologist. "The idea of a French exception, a French difference, is absurd, but a certain American triumphalism and our own relative decline has turned the idea into an obsession."
The new tone of Mr. Rohatyn, a former partner of the Lazard Freres investment firm in New York who took up his new post last month, was clearly intended to get beyond these obsessions and the accompanying caricatures.
If France was troubled by Medicare cuts, and if it does not want globalization to mean the relentless erosion of workers' rights, well, Mr. Rohatyn intimated, these were themes with which the Clinton Administration could sympathize.
He spoke of the need for fairness in the distribution of wealth, the need to promote "social values," the problems of big cities and crime, and the quest to insure "adequate retirement for our aging populations." In short, he seemed to make a limited defense of the very welfare state France is so determined to safeguard.
"The American in me is very pleased with our economic performance," said Mr. Rohatyn, who was born in Vienna. "The European in me understands your ambivalence about some of the choices that have been necessary to return to economic health."
The day after he spoke, Hubert Vedrine, the French Foreign Minister, made remarks that were perhaps even more surprising. To a group of foreign correspondents, he declared, with disarming frankness: "We are a country that has trouble facing up to the reality of the world."
It was no good, Mr. Vedrine said, to have excessive pretensions -- to wallow in the old, rankling talk about the universality of French civilization and its values; the notion of occupying a position close to the center of the world; the harkening after past glory. "There is," he said, "something unhealthy in all that."
What was needed instead was a new realism, he said. And realism led France inexorably to the fact that there was only one superpower: the United States. To imagine otherwise was only to invite the terrible fits of melancholy that have periodically overcome France in the last year.
France, Mr. Vedrine continued, was still very important, one of a group of perhaps seven countries -- including Russia, China, Japan, Britain and Germany -- with the power to have an influence throughout the world. It was firmly allied with the United States, but that did not mean it would always agree with America.
"France is not at the center of the world," he said, "but that is not a reason to despair. Let us try to have relations with the United States that are normal, calm, dispassionate and useful."
This new tone on both sides appears closer to the nuanced reality behind the caricatures. For it is not in fact so much America that is forcing France to reconsider its welfare state but the pressures of a European integration of which France is a chief architect.
France has freed capital movements, sold off swathes of state industry, embraced budget austerity and made a strong franc a pillar of its policies because the opening of European borders and the push for a single European currency, the euro, have required such changes. But it is much easier to market these changes -- and Mr. Jospin continues to push them -- behind a veneer of anti-American statements than to dwell on what the euro means for France.
Similarly, the talk of the defense of "a French model of civilization" against the American masks the fact that the French private sector shows every sign of embracing a rugged American capitalism complete with storming corporate raiders.
In recent weeks, multibillion-dollar hostile takeover bids have been the talk of the bourse, as one giant supermarket chain tried to swallow two others and the rags-to-riches financier Francois Pinault bid $5 billion for the heart of the financial establishment, Worms & Cie. The fact that American pension funds are among the biggest investors in French companies suggests that the France-as-basket-case image is more than a little simplistic.
Moreover, French popular culture has embraced the American in a way not paralleled in Britain or Germany. The reversed baseball cap, basketball shoes, American movies and music -- these are the frame of reference of a majority of French kids. The anti-Americanism glibly wheeled out by intellectuals and politicians finds little echo among ordinary French people.
But this remains a people that wants to dream -- "to aim for the ideal and understand the real," as the socialist Jean Jaures once said. It is the legacy of the Revolution of 1789: the idea of a perfectible society, of equality and freedom reconciled, of what the historian Francois Furet called "a universal promise of earthly well-being."
In the same remarks that poured scorn on America's attempt to legislate for the world, Mr. Jospin outlined his own notions of "earthly well-being." He talked of his plans to institute a 35-hour work week in France in place of the current 39-hour week without a loss of salary. Thus, he suggested, more jobs would be created as the cake would be divided among more people.
Such ideas naturally make many Americans smile, laugh out loud or despair. They seem to confirm notions of the French basket-case.
But Mr. Jospin has proved a shrewd politician. He is as pragmatic as his Foreign Minister. He knows that without ideals and enemies, the French cannot function, and that a small dose of anti-Americanism is a useful camouflage for the changes that are inexorably bringing French society closer to the American.
Mr. Rohatyn -- and the Clinton Administration -- now seem equally aware of the need for camouflage: by questioning American economic failings, and implicitly flattering the French, they may actually encourage change faster than through confrontation.

HEADLINE: Immigration Law's Fine Print Emerges, Setting Off a Debate About Welfare Provisions

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
On Dec. 19, the Government will begin enforcing a new law that will make it more difficult for poor and working-class immigrants living legally in the United States to have members of their families immigrate to join them.
The law will require an income test for the half a million legal immigrants and citizens who annually seek to bring relatives to the United States. Research sponsored by the Government found that 30 percent of the sponsors of immigrants would not have passed the new income test. 
 Under the new law, the sponsoring relatives will generally be required to prove that they earn 125 percent of the poverty level, or $20,062 this year for a family of four.
Forty pages of rules spelling out how the law will be applied and when it takes effect will be published today in The Federal Register.
The new law also requires the sponsoring families to sign contracts to support the newcomers and to reimburse the Government if their relatives receive welfare benefits.
But the new rules limit the definition of such public aid to the major anti-poverty programs -- food stamps, Medicaid and income supports for low-income families and for poor people who are elderly or disabled.
The new reimbursement requirement will have little impact for at least a few years because the welfare law adopted last year made most legal immigrants who enter the country after August 1996 ineligible for the major Federal anti-poverty programs for at least five years.
The rules exempt the sponsoring families from reimbursing the Government if their relatives use a range of smaller programs, including school lunches, Head Start, foster care, student loans and emergency medical care.
Before the new law was passed, there was no income requirement for families sponsoring their relatives, nor had the courts found sponsors' general promises to support relatives to be legally enforceable.
Typically, able-bodied immigrants who showed proof that they had a job waiting for them in the United States were not required to have sponsors who promised to support them indefinitely.
The new rules drew sharp criticism on Friday from an author of the law, Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, who said the Clinton Administration had defined the liability of sponsoring families too narrowly and should have defined welfare benefits more broadly.
"The effect of the Administration's groundless interpretation will be to relieve immigrants' sponsors of all responsibility to repay the taxpayers for a vast set of welfare benefits," Mr. Smith said.
But Federal officials said their interpretation of which welfare benefits were covered was consistent with both the law and Congressional intent. They included programs in which benefits are based on recipients' incomes and spending is mandated by Congress. Programs like Head Start, whose financing is discretionary, were not included.
The Clinton Administration opposed the new income test for sponsors, but it supported the requirement that sponsors sign contracts to support their relatives.
Despite their disagreement over the definition of welfare benefits, both the Congressional authors of the provision and Clinton Administration officials say the law, part of the immigration bill adopted in September 1996, sends an important signal to immigrants that their sponsoring families are responsible for supporting them.
Under the guidelines, sponsors will have to commit to supporting immigrant relatives until the new arrivals have become citizens, worked for 10 years in this country, left the United States permanently or died. If the immigrants receive welfare benefits, state and local government agencies will be able to sue their sponsors for reimbursement.
Advocates for immigrants and some scholars say the income test will have unnecessarily harsh consequences and is likely to backfire. It will prevent many poor and working-class immigrants and citizens who do not meet the new test from legally bringing in relatives even though those relatives would be unlikely to wind up on welfare under the new welfare law, they said. And it will encourage wives, children and others who want to be reunited with their families in this country to come illegally, the critics of the income test say.
"It's another example of the law of unintended consequences," said Thomas Espenshade, a sociology professor at Princeton University. "It's particularly perverse because Congress has long set as its objective to preserve legal immigration and reduce the number of immigrants coming illegally."
The new income test will make it extremely difficult for immigrants who work in the underground economy and do not pay taxes to bring in relatives, even if the relative has a job offer here.
For example, some farm workers, day laborers and sweatshop workers may have trouble qualifying as sponsors. The new guidelines state that sponsors must provide income tax returns for the past three years to establish their income.
The new law is also likely to hit Mexicans and Salvadorans hard because their incomes are generally lower than those of other groups, according to research sponsored by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that has not yet been released. The analysis of a random survey of 2,160 statements signed by sponsors of family immigrants in 1994 found that roughly half of Mexicans and Salvadorans would not have met the new requirement.
A third of Dominicans and Koreans, a fourth of Chinese and Jamaicans and a fifth of Filipinos, Indians and Vietnamese would not have met the requirement, say several people familiar with the survey, including both critics and supporters of the new law. Over all, the survey found that 3 immigrants in 10 had incomes below the new standard.
Similarly, a study of 1993 Census Bureau data by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group in Washington, found that 40 percent of immigrant families and a quarter of Americans born in the United States would not make enough to sponsor an immigrant.
But it is impossible to predict how many prospective immigrants will be excluded because the guidelines provide two ways that poor families can bring in their relatives, even if the head of household alone does not earn enough to qualify.
Family members who have lived in the sponsoring household for at least six months can pool their earnings to reach the income standard, though each person must then sign a contract promising to help support the newcomer.
The family is also allowed to find an employer, friend or relative who is not part of the household to co-sponsor the immigrant. Again, the co-sponsor has to sign a contract to support the immigrant in hard times.
Advocates for immigrants say that families who are considering sponsoring relatives fear that the new rules can spell financial ruin in extreme circumstances and play havoc with relations within families.
What if a relative develops a catastrophically expensive illness after arriving? What if a husband brings in his wife, and she leaves him for another man? Under the guidelines, divorce does not release a sponsor from the responsibility to support a former spouse. In fact, immigrants can sue their sponsors for financial support under the new rules.
The immigration service says it will keep computer records on the estimated 565,000 immigrants who will be sponsored annually by family members and will make this information available to state and Federal agencies that provide welfare benefits.
Sponsoring relatives will be required to notify the immigration service if they move. Sponsors who fail to send in a change of address form can be fined $250 to $2,000, or up to $5,000 if they know that a relative they sponsored has received welfare benefits.

HEADLINE: Once AT&T Names New Leader, Climb Back to Top Will Be Tough

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
When the AT&T Corporation names a new leader, it will be a long-awaited move in the company's effort to regain unquestioned leadership of one of America's fastest-growing industries.
The company, which hired a presumed heir apparent for the top job last year only to reject him nine months later, is now widely expected to appoint C. Michael Armstrong, the head of Hughes Electronics, as AT&T's new chairman and chief executive. That announcement could come as soon as today. 
 With its management in turmoil and its financial results eroding along with its share of the telecommunications market, AT&T is under increasing pressure to bring in a new leader as many smaller competitors are moving quickly to steal its customers. Indeed, when the company reports its latest quarterly financial results today, profits are expected to be significantly lower than those of the comparable period last year.
"The industry is at a crossroads and every day there seems to be an industry-changing deal," said Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst for Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street investment house. "And nobody, no matter how big, is immune to seeing their competitive position threatened by the changing of the landscape."
Mr. Armstrong, who is 59, would instantly become one of the nation's most closely watched corporate executives. Analysts and colleagues described Mr. Armstrong's tenure at Hughes as one marked by extraordinary intensity and brilliant salemanship. Page D1.
Even though AT&T has been split up twice since the early 1980's -- the first time under Government pressure, the second on its own initiative -- the company's shares remain the most widely owned in the country, the quintessential "widows and orphans" stock counted on by millions of Americans to deliver a reliable dividend and steady growth.
And while the dividend checks have not stopped coming, AT&T's financial path has been anything but steady of late. That is why, in the minds of telecommunications experts, the next year or two will be crucial in setting the company's long-term course.
"With AT&T, they still have vestiges of a great franchise and brand name," Mr. Grubman said. "But if I'm Michael Armstrong or anybody else coming into this job I have to answer four questions. One, what is my local strategy? Two, what is my international strategy? Three, how do I get my data capabilities up to snuff? And four, what do I do when the Bells come into my market and threaten my profitability?
"Those are four questions that frankly should have been addressed already and they haven't," Mr. Grubman said. "How the new team answers those four questions will determine the future of the company."
Word of a new leader for AT&T comes as the MCI Communications Corporation, the No. 2 long-distance telephone company behind AT&T and one of its most important rivals, has been at the center of a recent torrent of takeover efforts in the telecommunications industry.
By contrast, AT&T, despite tentative discussions in the last year with the GTE Corporation and abortive merger talks last summer with SBC Communications, a regional Bell company, has remained primarily on the sidelines as other companies scramble for partners to offer more, better and different kinds of communications services.
From plain old telephone service, to the Internet, to new sorts of advanced wireless systems, telecommunications services have become one of the main engines of the American economy. But AT&T's is no longer the main hand on the throttle.
AT&T has been looking for a new head since July, when John R. Walter, who had been brought in as the designated successor to AT&T's long-time chairman, Robert E. Allen, resigned after barely nine months with the company. As he departed, an AT&T board member publicly stated that Mr. Walter, who had previously been chief executive of the commercial printing giant, R. R. Donnelley & Sons, lacked the "intellectual leadership" to ascend to the top job at AT&T.
Even before Mr. Walter's appointment last October, Mr. Armstrong, the head of the Hughes unit of General Motors and a highly regarded executive, was known to be a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Allen. But he reportedly balked at Mr. Allen's plan to remain as chairman and chief executive for a transitional period -- a condition Mr. Walter accepted. This time, AT&T is expected to give the titles to Mr. Allen's designated successor immediately.
AT&T would not comment yesterday and telephone calls to Mr. Armstrong over the weekend were not returned. But reports of his impending appointment have circulated since Friday, and an executive familiar with Mr. Armstrong's plans said he understood that Mr. Armstrong had agreed to take the AT&T job.
The industry's mad scramble is a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The law was meant to unleash the biggest changes in the communications industry since the court-enforced divestiture in 1984 that left AT&T as the long-distance telephone company still bearing the company's name while it spun off its local phone monopolies into seven regional Bell companies.
After some consolidation there are now five regional Bells -- Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, SBC Communications and U S West -- and the Telecommunications Act allows them to offer long-distance service within their regions for the first time, provided they meet a regulatory checklist. AT&T, meanwhile, is free to return to the local phone business -- though few antitrust experts believe that the Government would allow the company to do so by, say, acquiring a Bell company.
Still, telecommunications analysts are almost unanimous in the belief that AT&T's long-term future could hinge on its ability to exploit its local-market opportunities.
The $100 billion local telephone business offers much higher profit margins than those in long distance. And in any case, whether AT&T succeeds or falters as a local service provider, the regional Bells are expected to grab from 10 percent to 40 percent of the $80 billion long-distance market in the next few years -- much of that at AT&T's expense.
"The perversity, the irony, of AT&T's current situation can be traced back to the fact that it doesn't have any local franchise," said Bryan Van Dussen, an analyst for the Yankee Group, a high-technology research company in Boston.
"The root causes of AT&T's challenges are its fragmented, disjointed and inefficient local-market capability," he said. "As 'location, location, location' is to real estate, 'local access, local access, local access' is the key to the future of telecom."
But AT&T has yet to make an aggressive move into local markets. Part of the reason is that a Federal court rejected the Federal Communications Commission's highly technical rules giving competitors access to the existing local telephone networks. The F.C.C. has taken its appeal to the Supreme Court.
But at least as important as the regulatory uncertainty, analysts say, has been the apparent inability of AT&T's management to decide whether they want to lease local access, build the company's own local links or employ some combination of those two approaches.
"They have not been quick enough, they have not been agile enough to take advantage of the opportunities," said Eric Strumingher, an analyst for Paine Webber. "You can fault lack of leadership, an overly bureaucratic organization, a lack of people who are willing to take a risk and have a sense of urgency to get something done."
Mr. Armstrong is mostly an unknown quantity among Wall Street's telephone fraternity, but he brings a reputation as a manager who can reorient companies quickly to take advantage of small windows of opportunity. "Given Michael Armstrong's track record, they may be able to pull together very quickly," said Linda Meltzer, an analyst for UBS Securities.
Many analysts suggest that AT&T's best option to enter local markets may be to acquire a small competitive local phone company, like Teleport Communications Group, that has been taking on the Bells and winning a fair number of big-spending business accounts.
Mr. Armstrong's ability to move fast could also prove especially important as AT&T tries to assert itself in the market for Internet service and other kinds of high-speed data communications.
AT&T has not had as high a profile on the Internet as MCI or the Sprint Corporation, the No. 3 long-distance company, both of which are major providers of high-capacity Internet "backbone" networks used by private corporations and on-line service operators. And if Worldcom Inc. succeeds in fending off GTE and winning the battle to acquire MCI, Worldcom -- already a big Internet player itself -- will control a majority of Internet traffic.
"If there was one market that was about to happen that AT&T should have been leading, it should have been the Internet," Mr. Van Dussen said. "And AT&T has been fairly slow to get into the corporate data communications market as well.
"AT&T is still the old AT&T, despite its efforts to be the new one," he said. "And management has to take much of the responsibility for that. If there's going to be a change, maybe it will help."

Since 1994, AT&T's in-house telephone directory has continually changed as members of top management defected, often to head nimble smaller companies with big ambitions. The constant changes have created uncertainty at AT&T at a time when competition, both nationally and internationally, has become intense and mergers and takeovers are realigning the industry.

HEADLINE: McGreevey Is Running on Record as Mayor

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE TOWNSHIP, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The day after James E. McGreevey took over as Mayor of this sprawling suburban town on Jan. 1, 1992, two Federal agents arrived at his office unannounced to investigate the disappearance of $650,000 in health insurance funds during the previous administration.
It was far from being the only problem that Mr. McGreevey says he discovered in his first days on the job. Four town employees were also accused of taking kickbacks from a contractor. About $400,000 in uncashed checks made out to the township was found in a desk drawer. And his advisers estimated that there was a $24.5 million gap in the town's $60 million budget for the coming year. 
 "It was an utter disaster," Mr. McGreevey recalled in a recent interview. "The good news was that you could only go up from there."
Now, as Mr. McGreevey, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, wages his campaign against Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, he frequently points to his six years as mayor as evidence that he has the experience to govern the state.
He says he cleaned up a mismanaged and corrupt government and brought in a more businesslike approach. His campaign aides say he kept property taxes under control while maintaining the same level of services. If elected, he said, he would run the state the way he ran the township.
By most accounts, Mayor McGreevey did restore confidence and fiscal stability. A review of state and town records, along with interviews with dozens of residents, business leaders, and government officials, supports much of what he says.
"There was a time when you didn't want to pick up the newspaper," said Frank G. Pelzman, a Democrat who has served on the township council for 10 years. "Every time you picked it up there was bad news in it for Woodbridge. Jim McGreevey has turned this town around."
Mr. McGreevey said his biggest achievement was putting the township back on firm financial footing. It came at a cost to taxpayers, not from significantly higher property taxes or deep cuts in services, but from $34.6 million in borrowing during his first year in office.
The borrowing, which was intended to cover what Mr. McGreevey said was a $24.5 million budget gap, and a shift in the start of the town's fiscal year from January to July will cost taxpayers $55 million to $60 million over 19 years. The township's outstanding debt has risen to $111 million, from $65 million when Mr. McGreevey took office.
The increased debt prompted Robert F. Gawroniak, 66, a former Democratic Councilman who served two years on the council after Mr. McGreevey took office, to switch to the Republicans and volunteer for the Whitman campaign.
"He sold us on the idea by exaggerating the problem," Mr. Gawroniak said. "There was no $24.5 million deficit. They told us that taxpayers would have to make up the difference, and if I didn't vote for it, some would lose their homes. Now our town is carrying all of this debt."
Mr. McGreevey defended his handling of the town's fiscal woes by saying the previous administration had emptied surplus accounts, overestimated state aid and failed to budget enough money for a costly labor agreement and pending tax appeals.
The problem was aggravated, he said, because the previous Democratic mayor, Joseph DeMarino, had cut the municipal tax rate in 1991 by 20 percent as an election-year ploy, making it difficult for the new administration to balance the books.
It had been a bitter mayoral campaign between Mr. McGreevey and Mr. DeMarino, Just months before the primary, Mr. DeMarino was indicted on charges of bribing two council members in a nearby town. He lost the primary, but stayed in the race as an independent. Even though Mr. DeMarino was acquitted before Election Day, Mr. McGreevey, then a 33-year-old lawyer and one-term Assemblyman, defeated him and a Republican opponent in the general election.
As Mayor, Mr. McGreevey has also angered some residents by imposing fees on some municipal services that had been free for years, like picking up old refrigerators. But Mr. McGreevey and his top aides point out that the $30 fee was an example of smart management that the state government should emulate.
"When we had special garbage pickups, we had people from outside the town, from all over the area, dropping off their trash for free pickup here," said John E. McCormac, the town's chief financial officer. "After we instituted the fee, we cut special pickups by 80 percent. We raised $30,000 in fees and saved $160,000 in tipping fees. All with one minimal fee."
In some ways, Mr. McGreevey and Mrs. Whitman share the same approach to running government. He sounds almost like a Republican when he talks about the fiscal controls and cost reductions his administration has imposed in the last six years to hold the property tax rate to a few cents above what it was in 1990.
Most services have been maintained, but changes have been made to cut costs. The town now pays Middlesex County to operate its transit program for the elderly. One township pool was closed after repairs were deemed too costly. Another pool was turned over to the local Young Men's Christian Association to run. Three branch libraries were closed, but two are now being operated as reading rooms by community and church groups.
Mr. McGreevey said his record as Mayor showed that he could do more than fill potholes. He created an economic development corporation that he said had brought 1,800 jobs and $800,000 in tax revenue. Both violent crime and property crime have decreased since Mr. McGreevey took office, in line with state and national trends.
A mix of residential neighborhoods, shopping malls and industrial sites, Woodbridge is the fifth-largest town in New Jersey. There are 10 distinctive communities, each with its own ZIP code and fire house. Because the Garden State Parkway and New Jersey Turnpike intersect in the township, local officials call it "the crossroads of New Jersey." The Chamber of Commerce, though, calls it "the crossroads of the world."
According to the 1990 census, 82 percent of Woodbridge Township's 93,000 residents are white, 20 percent have at least a college education and two of three are homeowners. The median household income was $45,516 in 1990, slightly higher than the statewide average of $40,927. Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 2 to 1, but most voters are unaffiliated. In the 1993 race for governor, Gov. Jim Florio outdrew Mrs. Whitman here by only 39 votes.
Throughout this community, there is visible evidence of improvements since Mr. McGreevey took office. Main Street, like many others in New Jersey, had fallen on hard times. The pavement was broken. Trees had not been pruned. There were vacant storefronts. Now Main Street is dotted with old-fashioned lamp posts, new red-brick sidewalks, vendor kiosks and park benches. A microbrewery and a coffee house recently opened.
"Mr. McGreevey and City Hall are really trying hard to get a good mix of business in the downtown," said Lee J. Neves, 51, owner of Neves Jewelers and president of the Woodbridge Downtown Merchants and Property Owners Association. "They somehow get the job done."
More than $1 million was spent to restore the Woodbridge train station. A pedestrian promenade has been built in Sewaren, along the waterfront at the Arthur Kill. And the old Town Hall was torn down and replaced with a $15 million municipal complex that opened last year.
But Mr. DeMarino, the former mayor, said Mr. McGreevey could not take all the credit for the improvements. He said the plans had been under way before Mr. McGreevey arrived. Mr. McGreevey said, however, that he was the one who saw the plans through to completion.
While Mr. McGreevey may win high marks from many residents and business leaders for cleaning up town government and hiring competent officials, it is striking how many of those officials have close ties to the Democratic Party. The town's law director since 1992 is Paul R. Weiner, a law partner of State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak of Elizabeth, who is the former chairman of the State Democratic Committee and now a top fund-raiser for Mr. McGreevey's gubernatorial campaign.
Labor matters are handled by a law firm headed by Angelo J. Genova, a lawyer for the State Democratic Committee. One of two financial advisers for the township's $34.6 million borrowing was Consolidated Financial Management, the company founded by Joseph C. Salema, who was chief of staff to Mr. Florio when he was Governor.
But what some residents say most bothers them about Mr. McGreevey is that he broke a campaign promise in 1991 to serve as a full-time mayor. A year after he was sworn in, Mr. McGreevey won election to the State Senate.
"I often wonder who is running the town," said Barbara A. Wyatt, a lifelong Republican who is vice president of the township's library board. "Two years after he first ran for mayor, he ran for the Senate, and now is campaigning for the governorship. I don't know if we have gotten our money's worth in terms of a full-time mayor. He tells you that he works 72 hours a week, but I think that is to cultivate a constituency for his next step."
Mr. McGreevey's decision to hold two elective offices has apparently not angered everybody. He captured 70 percent of the vote when he ran for re-election as mayor in 1995. And as he makes his fifth run for office in eight years, he can depend on local voters to be firmly in his column.
Mr. McGreevey says town residents support him because they are treated like customers. He describes himself as a disciple of Stephen Covey, the management consultant who wrote "7 Habits of Highly Effective People." Mr. McGreevey said that he abided by Covey's principles emphasizing hard work, integrity and measureable goals.
"It is a credo," said Mr. McGreevey, who arranged Covey management seminars for his staff after attending several himself. "I am result oriented and result driven. You need to understand where we want to be and how we are going to get there. You need to create a mission-driven organization with specific goals and a plan to implement them."
The township government has its own mission statement, and the directors of various departments must report weekly on their progress toward goals outlined earlier in the year. Mr. McGreevey's staff keeps computer records of taxpayers' complaints to help insure that their concerns are met by multiple city departments if necessary, and to help detect patterns that might suggest recurring or developing problems.
But the Mayor said that some complaints got his special attention even during the campaign. Last Friday, he opened a letter that began "Dear Jimmy." It was from an elderly resident who explained that she had waited in line to pick up free biodegradable bags from the township for its mandatory leaf collection program, only to be told that there were no bags left. It was a cost-saving measure that did not generate as many protests as had been expected. It saves about $250,000 annually in overtime costs and landfill fees.
To address what he called his "customer's concern," Mr. McGreevey said that he asked the public works department to deliver the free bags to the woman's home. "We went the extra mile because, frankly, we ought to have been there," Mr. McGreevey said. "I did not want her to have to come back. That's what makes the difference."

HEADLINE: Goals Clash in Shielding Privacy

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Senator Dianne Feinstein was dismayed last year when it took only three minutes to get her confidential Social Security number, like millions of others, from an on-line look-up service available to Internet users around the world.
"People are losing control over their own identities," Ms. Feinstein, a California Democrat, told Congress in April as she introduced the Personal Information Privacy Act, a bill to limit the circulation and sale of Social Security numbers without the individual's written consent. 
 That measure is now one of at least 40 privacy bills pending in Congress, a flotilla launched by legislators on a rising tide of public concern about the loss of privacy in an electronic age. Some are modest, like a postal code amendment that would let people stop the post office from selling their change of address to direct marketers. Some are ambitious, like legislation to govern how the health care industry handles personal medical information.
But with few exceptions, the proposals seem to be going nowhere. Beneath the surface of their popular appeal, most are mired in unresolved conflicts over contradictory goals: on the one hand, preserving personal privacy, and on the other, the advantages of quick, computerized access to personal information for fighting crime, fraud and waste, or promoting growth in the information economy.
Ms. Feinstein herself illustrates the deep ambivalence behind the stalemate. To combat illegal immigration, for example, she proposed requiring all employers to telephone a high-tech national database and punch in the Social Security number of every job applicant. The plan has been denounced by privacy advocates as "1-800-Big-Brother."
To curb the use of counterfeit identity documents, Ms. Feinstein urged adoption of a "biometric" ID card and database with the digital fingerprints, retinal eye scans or voice patterns of all eligible workers and benefit recipients in the United States. And to fight voter fraud, she favored a bill that would require anyone registering to vote in a Federal election to provide their Social Security number.
Such a requirement would make the numbers part of the public record and, critics say, more accessible than ever.
"Everybody wants to have it both ways," said Robert Gellman, a lawyer and privacy expert in Washington. "Nobody is willing to pay the price for privacy."
Until a scandal erupts, many people remain unaware of the growing amounts of computer-gathered information that could jeopardize their privacy. But legislation drafted in response to such scandals is often watered down by opposition from business or law enforcement, weakened by exemptions, and finally shelved with general ambivalence about its broader consequences.
Earlier this year, for instance, Mr. Gellman headed advisory hearings for the Clinton Administration on the disclosure of health care records without the patients' consent. Under current practice, the intimate details of almost anyone's treatment are available to hundreds of thousands of billing and insurance clerks at computer terminals across the country.
Everyone who testified, from industry officials to consumers, agreed that Federal restrictions were needed, Mr. Gellman said. Everyone agreed that individual consent for release of information was important to protect privacy. "And everyone," he added, "wanted to be exempt," citing such needs as cost containment, peer review and public health research.
In the end, a sweeping exemption giving access to law enforcement and intelligence agencies was written into the recommendations. It brought a storm of criticism from privacy advocates in Congress as well as powerful players in the health care industry.
"The members of Congress are ambivalent about privacy, as are all Americans," said Robert Ellis Smith, a privacy watchdog and publisher of The Privacy Journal.
The White House is no less ambivalent, said Alan Westin, a Columbia University law professor and consultant to Equifax, the credit-checking and medical records giant.
"The Clinton Administration now views privacy as a wonderful quality-of-life issue," Mr. Westin said. "But the Administration has come out in favor of self-regulation when it comes to the on-line world," partly out of fear of stifling commercial development of the Internet.
What Mr. Westin calls the classic tension between privacy and surveillance is illustrated by a law that was passed last year to establish a "new hires" database to help the Federal authorities find parents who fail to pay court-ordered child support.
The privacy consequences got little notice in the rush to embrace the plan, said David Banisar, a lawyer and policy analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, because it sounded like a way to cut welfare.
"People want privacy for themselves," Mr. Banisar said, "and of course they're not welfare recipients, so they don't care about that."
What many failed to grasp, he said, is that the database would include not only deadbeats but eventually also every working parent in the United States.
Mr. Gellman, the lawyer and privacy expert, sees a pattern.
"Set up a database for some hard-to-defeat purpose," he said, "add another use, and then everybody is selling records to private detectives."
Many private investigators increasingly rely not only on electronic databases but personal information bought in an underground market that includes telephone records, bills, even medical histories.
Already the purpose of the new-hires database shows signs of expansion: under a bill sponsored by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of Manhattan, the Treasury Department could use the database to collect delinquent Federal debts, like student loans.
Yet Ms. Maloney is also the sponsor of one of the 40 pending privacy bills, a proposal to insure that when Federal Bureau of Investigation records containing sensitive personal information are provided to the White House, they are properly protected for privacy and security.
Like some other privacy bills, it was drafted after a scandal, in this case the revelation that low-level aides in the Clinton White House had improperly obtained confidential F.B.I. files on more than 800 officials from previous Administrations.
A single horror story that attracts a burst of media attention has often prompted privacy legislation, though the affected industry usually scrambles to defuse the issue. Last year, for example, Lexis-Nexis, one of the nation's largest information brokers, began offering individual Social Security numbers, the key to vast amounts of personal and financial information. The company abandoned the service after a public outcry, but the publicity helped lead to Ms. Feinstein's information privacy bill, among others.
Another incident might help win passage of some version of pending bills on children's privacy. Several were introduced after a California television reporter, using the name of a notorious child killer, bought a list of households with young children from the Metromail Corporation, a leading supplier of direct mail information.
Few privacy advocates were satisfied with any of the resulting proposals, including one introduced by Ms. Feinstein, which would bar the collection and sale of children's personal information without written parental consent. Yet the children's privacy bill met strong and well-financed opposition from business interests like the Direct Marketing Association, the leading trade group.
The association, whose lobbyists include Tommy Boggs, one of the most influential in Washington, contends that market forces and industry self-policing are preferable to laws regulating commerce in personal information. After pressure from industry lobbyists, the Feinstein bill, for instance, was scaled back, so it would forbid selling lists of children only when the seller knows the data would be used for harm.
A bill to protect the privacy of genetic information seems to have the best chance of passage. Sponsored by Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, and Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, the bill has a vocal, well-organized constituency: women, already galvanized by the issue of breast cancer, who fear discrimination from insurers and others if their genetic information predicts a greater likelihood of the disease.
Bills on data encryption, on the other hand, are locked in the kind of impasse that characterizes many Federal battles over privacy. The subject -- technology that scrambles private communications by telephone and computer -- makes most people's eyes glaze over. Yet on both sides of the issue, those close to the battle describe the stakes in apocalyptic terms.
The American Civil Liberties Union is trying to overcome both the lack of a broad-based privacy constituency and the traditionally patchwork, reactive approach to legislation. The effort is an ambitious campaign, called "Take Back Your Data," that seeks an omnibus privacy rights bill, said Don Haines, legislative counsel for the A.C.L.U.
The privacy effort has involved unusual political alliances. The coalition opposing the so-called 1-800-Big-Brother plan, for example, included the Christian Coalition, the National Rifle Association and the A.C.L.U. Because of strong opposition, the plan was scaled back but survived in the form of six pilot projects to be established later this year in California, New York, Illinois, Texas, Florida and Iowa.
Part of the frustration for privacy advocates, said Mr. Banisar of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, is that they find themselves spending much of their energy fending off the unintended consequences of other bills.
Some states have been quicker to pass tough privacy laws than Congress, but in every area, this fuels conflict over whether weaker Federal bills should pre-empt them.
"They've made us fight a lot of little privacy battles, and we've so far lost the war," said Edmund Mierzwinski, program director for the United States Public Interest Research Group, a consumer organization. "We have not been able to create the notion that privacy is a right. It's always an afterthought."

HEADLINE: Israelis and Palestinians Nearer to Accord on Gaza Strip Airport

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said today that they were closer to agreement on the operation of a Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip.
Israeli leaders also hinted at flexibility on Jewish settlements, suggesting they were willing to shelve new construction projects for a few months. They were the first signs of progress in negotiations after months of setbacks. 
 The United States envoy Dennis Ross returned to the Middle East on Sunday to supervise the work of the committees, and has been shuttling back and forth between the two sides. Mr. Ross met early today with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, but there was no statement after the closed session.
Emerging from talks later in the day with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, Mr. Ross said the sessions involving American, Israeli and Palestinian officials were proving productive. "We are giving this a push," Mr. Ross said.
The status of the airport is being discussed by one of nine committees working on outstanding issues from accords that have already been signed. Opening the airport, which Palestinians envision will bring in a half-million passengers a year, is of enormous symbolic as well as practical importance to the Palestinians. Most of Gaza has been autonomous since May 1994, but Israel has maintained strict control over the airspace.
There were indications today that Israel might be softening its stance on settlement construction after a demand from the United States for a "time out" in new building. Foreign Minister David Levy told the Israeli radio that Israel would limit construction in Jewish settlements to a "necessary minimum."
"We want to move forward and not create a situation that would make all our efforts to advance the process irrelevant," he said.
Despite friction over the settlement issue, Israel said progress by the working committees was heartening.
"Chances are that we will continue to work in an intensified fashion and reach results fairly soon," said Eitan Ben-Tsur, the director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry.
Other issues being discussed include the establishment of a Palestinian seaport in Gaza and the creation of "safe passage" routes for Palestinians across Israeli territory between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Security has been a major sticking point in airport talks. Israel fears militants could use the airport to smuggle in weapons or to flee. It has insisted that only nations that have flight agreements with Israel itself, such as Jordan and Morocco, be allowed to use the airport.

Peace Center Opens in Tel Aviv
 TEL AVIV, Oct.20 (Reuters) -- Scores of foreign statesmen and business leaders showed support for Middle East peace moves today at the inauguration of a new peace institute founded by the Israeli Nobel peace laureate Shimon Peres.
"Apparently we struck the right chord," said Mr. Peres, who is the architect of Israel's historic Oslo accords with the Palestinians.
 Mr. Peres, a former Labor Party Prime Minister, was defeated by Mr. Netanyahu in 1996.
The Peres Center for Peace is a private institute set up to promote peace through projects that foster economic opportunity.
Mr. Peres said: "If we wait, the cost of peace will not go down but if we wait the price of not having peace will go up. None of us want a sixth Middle East war."

HEADLINE: Pope's Trip to Cuba Pulls at Exiles

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct.19

 BODY:
Elisa Flanigan-Chovel says she initially hesitated after hearing that the Archdiocese of Miami planned to take a cruise ship with American Catholics to Cuba for the Pope's visit in January. What would people say if she went? Would she be ostracized?
But the 49-year-old real estate agent decided that "the one that I ultimately have to answer to is God." She is going. 
 Bishop Agustin A. Roman, 69, an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Miami, is just as sure of his decision. Expelled from Cuba in 1961 with 129 other priests and a bishop, Bishop Roman says he supports the trip as a show of solidarity with Cuba's Catholic church and its people. But he is not going.
"I never wanted to leave Cuba," he said. "It's good that I remind the Government of Cuba that I'll never return until he who expelled me is gone himself."
The Pope's visit to Cuba, his first to that nation of 11 million people that was once predominantly Catholic, will likely draw the largest group of Cuban exiles to return at one time to the island since Fidel Castro assumed power in 1959. But the trip has posed a moral dilemma to many Catholic Cubans who are struggling to reconcile their political stance against Mr. Castro with a religious calling to follow their Pope's lead.
The church is for the first time prompting many to think about what once was unthinkable, returning to Cuba, however briefly, while the Government that caused their exile is still in charge.
The cruise ship sponsored by the Archdiocese of Miami, with capacity for 1,200 passengers, is expected to travel to Havana Jan. 23 to 26 to join Catholics there in welcoming Pope John Paul II. The travel agency handling the trip, Vision Travel in Coral Gables, said it had fielded calls from all over the country and Canada and had already booked 260 passengers in 145 of the ship's 528 cabins.
Several cities, including New York, are planning their own pilgrimages, by airplane.
Ticket sales for the cruise have been slower than predicted by Vision Travel when it began taking reservations on Oct. 7, partly because the cost of the trip, ranging from $599 to $1,399, depending on the accommodations, is nonrefundable.
Most of the interest on the trip, and opposition to it, has come from South Florida, where plans are under way for a protest flotilla to head for Cuba without permission during the Pope's visit and where conservative Cuban-American political leaders and Spanish-language radio have urged Cuban Catholics to stay home.
The hardliners, while not necessarily opposed to the Pope's visit, have been critical of the Archdiocese's sponsorship of the cruise ship because they regard it as setting a precedent for increased travel to Cuba and a weakening of the United States economic embargo. The cruise ship, however, would travel to Cuba under existing embargo rules that allow visits for "clearly defined educational or religious activities," a senior official with the Department of the Treasury said.
The debate ignores the close economic ties, both legal and illegal, that already exist between Cubans on the island and those here, notwithstanding the embargo. Cuban-Americans, for instance, are legally allowed to send up to $200 worth of food, medicine and other such items once a month. They are also permitted to visit relatives in Cuba once a year in cases of "extreme humanitarian need" like a medical emergency, but they must fly there from a country other than the United States. Sending cash is prohibited.
But a whole industry has grown around the illegal shipping of both cash and goods. Economic experts have estimated that Cubans receive as much as $800 million a year in contributions from individuals in the United States.
Some experts on Cuban affairs say that at the heart of the opposition to the trip is the basic conflict between how the Catholic church and much of the Cuban exile leadership view Cuba: The Vatican has long been for reconciliation between Cuban exiles and Cubans in the island and against the embargo; exile leaders are generally pro-embargo and in a state of war with Cuba.
"It poses a real contradiction" for Cuban-American Catholics, said Max Castro, a sociologist with the University of Miami's North-South Center, "if you take these values seriously and you believe in the church and the Pope."
But those going on the trip say the trip is not about politics but about supporting Cubans, who have suffered years of religious repression under socialist rule, in a renewal of their faith. For those like Mrs. Flanigan-Chovel, the cruise ship visit would mark her first return to Cuba since her family left the island in 1962 and cut all ties.
For others, like Eric Campillo, 29, a hospital case manager who left Cuba only two years ago, the trip is a chance to exercise his religion openly for the first time. He also hopes for political change.
"If this trip would make Fidel open up things a little more," Mr. Campillo said, "it would be worth it."
In interviews at several Catholic parishes, those who are refusing to go cited safety concerns in Cuba, grievances against the Cuban Government, like the confiscation of family property, and a general distaste for visiting an undemocratic country. Some were troubled by the Archdiocese's involvement in the trip.
"Let them just travel to Cuba as people do now but let's not have the church directly involved in an activity that inevitably has political overtones," said Antonio Jorge, an economics professor at Florida International University.
The Archdiocese of Miami is doing a delicate balancing act to avoid violating the embargo and straining already frayed emotions. Passengers on the chartered Norwegian Cruise Line ship must sign an affidavit stating the trip is solely for religious purposes and to abide by the embargo's regulations, which, for example, allow a visitor to spend no more than $100 a day.
Passengers will eat and sleep on the ship. The ship's casinos and discos will be closed and a number of vigils and liturgical ceremonies are planned during the four-day voyage, which is barely long enough to get to Cuba, attend the papal Mass in Havana and come back.
The trip is cast as a pilgrimage, not a tour, whose main purpose is to accompany the island's Catholics in a "spiritual journey."
"We join our voices in prayer," the Archbishop of Miami, John C. Favalora, wrote in a letter included in the application packet for those booking space on the ship, "that the Holy Father's visit to Cuba will touch the minds and hearts of all Cubans, wherever they may be, and help bring about that true peace built on justice that all Cubans of good will long for."
Cuban-American Catholics like Mrs. Flanigan-Chovel believe it will, and she wants to be a part of "one of the most important moments in the history of Cuba."
"I want my great-grandchildren to know that their great-grandmother was on that ship," she said.

A BISHOP'S RESISTANCE -- While he supports the Catholic Church's planned cruise to Cuba in January to welcome the Pope, Bishop Agustin A. Roman, an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Miami, decided not to go because, he says, he will not visit his country as long as Fidel Castro, remains in power.

HEADLINE: In a Step Toward a Better Electric Car, Company Uses Fuel Cell to Get Energy From Gasoline

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The Energy Department and an engineering company plan to announce on Tuesday that they have produced electricity from gasoline through a new method that yields twice as much useful energy per gallon as a car engine does, and with pollution 90 percent lower.
The development raises the prospect of an electric car, still quiet, swift and clean, but without the problem of heavy batteries that must be recharged often. Instead, such a car would be refilled with energy in minutes from the pump at the corner gasoline station and get twice the gas mileage of a comparable car with an internal combustion engine. 
 "We have a terrific breakthrough here," said Federico F. Pena, the Secretary of Energy, in an interview. He said, however, that the technology was not about to go into immediate use. Such cars could be on the road by 2010, Mr. Pena said.
Other experts not directly involved with the new system praised it as an important technical achievement, although several pointed out that important steps remained before the method could be commercialized.
The method uses a fuel cell, a device first used by NASA for the Apollo moon program, that makes electric current by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water. Oxygen can be pulled out of air, but hydrogen has always been a problem, because it is expensive to produce and store.
The new method, developed by Arthur D. Little Inc., with $15 million from the Energy Department and technical aid from a nuclear bomb laboratory, is the first practical way to extract hydrogen efficiently and cleanly from gasoline, which is made of hydrocarbon molecules.
Mr. Pena said that because gasoline is available worldwide, auto makers could produce a new generation of ultra-clean vehicles that would achieve twice the fuel economy, without having to develop a new network of refineries, pipelines, trucks and service stations for a new fuel. That barrier has largely defeated efforts to wean America's 180 million cars from gasoline to methanol, ethanol or compressed natural gas.
The Chrysler Corporation has already announced that it wants to build a fuel-cell car that runs on gasoline. "A lot of people thought this was a crazy idea," said Christopher E. Borroni-Bird, a fuel-cell expert at Chrysler. "This shows it is technologically feasible." The Exxon Corporation and ARCO are also involved in fuel-cell research.
Making hydrogen from another chemical is called reforming. Some companies have reformers that process methanol, an easier task from a chemist's point of view because methanol is a simpler fuel than gasoline, but the reformer is too big for cars, and very few filling stations sell methanol. Fuel cells in fixed locations can use natural gas, but that is hard to load on vehicles, too.
Eugene Smotkin, a professor of chemical engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology and an expert on fuel cells, said "reforming gasoline is quite a feat."
"We already have gasoline everywhere," he said. "If you can actually reform gasoline, to give you hydrogen, that would be ideal. The infrastructure is already there."
There are other ways to achieve high efficiency with reduced pollution, and the new technology will have to compete with them. Sheila A. Lynch, the executive director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, which backs electric and hybrid cars, pointed out that Toyota announced last week that it would soon sell a hybrid -- an electric car with a small gasoline engine to recharge the batteries -- and that it, too, doubled gasoline mileage. And, she said, a demonstration electric vehicle is scheduled to drive on Thursday from City Hall Plaza in Boston to the New York Academy of Sciences, more than 250 miles, on a single charge.
The vehicle, the Sunrise, which was built with grants from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Institute for Standards and Technology, is ready for mass manufacturing, according to the builder, the Solectria Corporation of Arlington, Mass.
The A. D. Little system would be a step forward if it achieveed the efficiencies it claims, Ms. Lynch said, "but it does not mean we should wait around for many years to see if this technology is commercially viable."
A key question for a fuel-cell car is the cost of the fuel cell itself. Auto industry experts say they need a cell that costs $100 to $150 per kilowatt of capacity for such cars to be marketable, but existing models cost about $1,500. In contrast, conventional gasoline engines cost about $35 per horsepower, which works out to $50 a kilowatt. But engineers are confident that mass production will bring down prices.
The A. D. Little innovation, which was tested earlier this month, mixes oxygen with the gasoline fumes, breaking up the complex hydrocarbon molecules into H2 and carbon monoxide, which is a pollutant.
If carbon monoxide exceeds about 40 parts per million, it will poison the fuel cell. To prevent such damage the new system includes a device built at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a nuclear weapons laboratory, that accepts the gas and adds a second oxygen atom to the carbon monoxide, producing carbon dioxide. Engineers were able to accomplish that difficult step without adding oxygen to the H2 , a step that would rob the fuel cell of its fuel.
Then the gas, almost pure H2 , goes to a fuel cell, an older technology that has been gradually improved in the last few years. The hydrogen atoms, which consist of one proton and one electron, flow down one side of a permeable membrane. On the other side is oxygen from air. The hydrogen's proton wants to join with the oxygen, to create H2 O, or water, and is drawn through the membrane, but the electron is left behind. With the positively charged proton on one side and the negatively charged electron on the other, the membrane creates an electrical difference that becomes a current.
As is often the case in science, the membrane was initially developed for an unrelated purpose. Du Pont first manufactured it for making insecticides.
The testers used one cell from Ballard Power Systems Inc., the Vancouver company that sells buses powered by fuel cells, and another cell from Plug Power of Latham, N.Y., which plans to offer them for home use within two years.
In 16 hours of tests earlier this month at a Little laboratory in Cambridge, Mass., a processor ran smoothly on gasoline and ethanol, officials said. It produced enough hydrogen for 50 kilowatts, big enough to run a medium-size car. Ethanol can be produced from corn, and the Energy Department hopes it will eventually be the main fuel for such cells. Gasoline might therefore be a transitional step to ethanol, which is completely renewable.
The system delivers 84 percent of the energy in a gallon of gasoline to the fuel cell, said Jeffrey M. Bently, a vice president of Little, and the fuel cell turns most of that energy into electricity. In contrast, an internal combustion engine loses more than 80 percent of the energy in a gallon, either as heat out the tail pipe or friction in the drive train.
One use for a fuel-cell system, which Chrysler has been pursuing even in advance of the new development, is to perfect an electric car without a breakthrough in battery design. Such a car might still carry a few batteries, for quick starts and for recapturing energy when a driver brakes the car, but existing battery designs could handle that easily.
"This blows the doors off any battery-powered electric vehicle," Mr. Bently said in a telephone interview. Batteries take hours to charge, he said, but this car could be re-fueled "with a five minute fill-up anywhere in the free world."
A major jump in efficiency could be a big step in fighting global warming, Mr. Pena said. He predicted that third-world countries that hope to add cars by the hundreds of millions in coming decades could move directly to cars powered by fuel cells. "They can leapfrog us like they did with cell phones," he said, referring to countries that skipped the older technology of phones tied to copper wires.
Even before cars, though, the new system could be used to make electricity for houses, according to the Energy Department and companies involved in the research. Such a system could run on propane or natural gas, two hydrocarbons that are widely available in homes. Plug Power, a joint venture between DTE Edison, which is the parent company of Detroit Edison, and Mechanical Technologies Inc., a 36-year-old technology company in Albany, N.Y., says it will have demonstration units available within a year and units for commercial use in two years. Plug Power says it will install the units in homeowners' basements and sell the electricity at a price below what is paid by about 25 million households.
The package would be "roughly the size of a small dishwasher," said Gary Mittleman, president and chief executive of Plug Power. "You won't have to pay a penny for the device," he said, but it will have an electric meter on it, charging for power at 8 to 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, depending on the price of hydrocarbon fuel.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Its Greenhouse Gas Emissions Are at Highest Rate in Years

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
As negotiations resume in Bonn on a new treaty to save the planet from global warming, the United States said today that its emissions of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere grew last year at the highest rate since the nation pledged to cut them back.
Emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases grew 3.4 percent in 1996, the latest year for which comprehensive estimates are available, the Energy Department said in a report. The department attributed the increase to strong economic growth, unusually severe weather and increased use of coal by electric utilities. 
 Emissions from energy use in residential and commercial buildings grew 6.3 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, despite programs intended to increase energy efficiency.
At the same time, the report said, growing consumption of fuel by less efficient cars and light trucks suggests that motor vehicles may soon overtake industry as the largest source of gases suspected of causing global warming by effectively creating a greenhouse around Earth.
"The economy is booming, energy prices are relatively low, and a lot of people are paying a lot less attention to energy efficiency," said Steven Nadel, deputy director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization.
"If you have unfettered energy use and big economic growth," Mr. Nadel said, "it is not surprising that carbon emissions are going to increase. We need more active and aggressive policies. Laissez-faire does not work."
The report is acutely embarrassing to American negotiators at the climate talks, because the United State, with less than a 20th of the world's population, gives off almost a fourth of the gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, threatening widespread climate change.
In a treaty on climate change signed by 160 nations in 1992, the United States and other industrial countries pledged to reduce their emissions of such gases to 1990's level by 2000.
But American emissions in 1996 were 7.4 percent above 1990 levels, the report said. For some time the Clinton Administration has forecast that by the end of the decade, emissions of the gases in the United States will be 13 percent higher than in 1990. With the economy still growing and people driving farther in cars that use more gasoline per mile, the upward trend is widely expected to continue.
The parties to the treaty are meeting in Bonn this week to try to negotiate a new, binding agreement that cuts emissions beyond 2000. The talks are supposed to conclude in December in Kyoto, Japan.
European nations, saying they are well on their way to achieving the target for 2000, are pressing for deeper cuts in emissions by 2010.
Emissions of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas, increased to record levels in all five sectors that the Government report tracked: residential buildings, commercial buildings, industrial sites, transportation, and electricity generation.

HEADLINE: QUANDARY FOR U.S.: ADVISER ON TIBET

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
With only a week to go before the visit of China's President to the United States, the Clinton Administration finds itself in a diplomatic predicament of its own making over its pledge to appoint a "special coordinator" to oversee American policy toward Tibet.
The appointment is bringing protests from Beijing, which regards the planned office as interference with its internal affairs, while members of Congress are accusing the State Department of dithering. The Administration, caught in the middle, is scrambling to avoid a confrontation just as President Jiang Zemin arrives for a weeklong tour of America, starting on Sunday. 
 "The question is: Is there a way to deal with this appointment without poisoning the overall atmosphere of the summit?" asked Jonathan D. Pollack, a senior adviser at the Rand Corporation.
Under pressure from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced three months ago that she would create the office to raise the profile of Tibet in the making of foreign policy. The problem, diplomatically, is that she pledged to do so by Nov. 1, the final day of Mr. Jiang's visit, which both sides intend to be a culmination of months of efforts to improve relations.
With the visit and deadline approaching, the State Department has yet to announce an appointment, though Ms. Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said she would make it as promised. But other officials in the department and at the White House have strongly suggested -- in interviews and in discussions with members of Congress -- that the appointment will be put off until after Mr. Jiang's visit or at least after the Washington part of it ends on Oct. 30.
While the Administration has sought to engage China's Communist Government on a variety of fronts, a vocal faction in Congress has accused it of putting pragmatic concerns like trade over issues of principle involving human rights and religious freedom.
Tibet, which has sought a greater degree of autonomy from China since Chinese troops violently established Communist rule over the region beginning in 1950, has long been a sensitive subject for the Chinese. The debate over creation of the position comes as awareness of Tibet's cause has mushroomed here, in part through popular depictions in Hollywood.
An appointment on the eve of the visit, the Administration officials said, would almost certainly be seen by the Chinese as an affront to Mr. Jiang. And that could upset the progress the Administration hopes to make on a variety of matters, including a pledge by China to stop selling missiles and nuclear technology to countries like Iran.
"It definitely is not very good for the atmosphere," an Administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Chinese have objected to the creation of the coordinator's office. Senior officials from Beijing have repeatedly raised the matter in the flurry of preparatory meetings leading up to Mr. Jiang's visit -- most recently during one between Ms. Albright and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in New York City late last month.
"Our position is very clear," said Yu Shu Ning, a counselor at China's Embassy in Washington. "We are opposed to any interference in China's internal affairs."
The Administration's failure to fill the job by now is already drawing criticism from Tibet's supporters in Congress, who say Beijing is brutally repressing Tibet's unique culture, language and religion. Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, sent a letter to Ms. Albright two weeks ago pointedly, if politely, recalling the deadline and urging the appointment of "someone of stature who will command respect." Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, sent his own letter last Friday.
Representative Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California who is one of the most outspoken critics of China in Congress, said the Administration risked losing a perfect opportunity to highlight Tibetan issues in a way the Chinese could not ignore.
"I think if the Administration is serious about the Tibet coordinator," she said, "that person would be appointed before the Jiang Zemin visit so that he or she could be present at the table."
The United States does not regard Tibet as an independent country, nor does it support its independence from China. But it has long been supportive of Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for peacefully advocating more autonomy for his homeland.
In addition to coordinating policy toward Tibet, which now falls between the separate bureaus in the State Department that oversee China and human rights, the new office is supposed to promote talks between the Dalai Lama's representatives and the Government in Beijing. Ms. Albright promised that the coordinator, while not an Ambassador with diplomatic credentials, would travel to the region.
Mr. Rubin, Ms. Albright's spokesman, said today that there were "intensive discussions" under way to select the coordinator by Nov. 1. And he played down any connection between the appointment and the visit.
"The purpose of the special coordinator is to promote our interest in the human rights of the people of Tibet and a dialogue with the authorities in Beijing," he said.
Mr. Jiang is likely to be dogged by protests throughout his trip, which includes stops in Williamsburg, Va., Philadelphia, New York City and Los Angeles, as well as a speech at Harvard and the official visit in Washington on Oct. 29. On the night of Mr. Jiang's state dinner, for instance, the International Campaign for Tibet plans to have a protest dinner.
The campaign's director, John Ackerly, said President Clinton and Ms. Albright should not simply paper over differences with China. "They will leave themselves vulnerable," he said, "if they try to push aside too many of the controversial issues."

HEADLINE: Kravis-Led Fund Is Backing Internet Lab

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
An investment fund established by Henry R. Kravis is collaborating with Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications company, to open a high-technology business center in lower Manhattan to help Internet entrepreneurs tinker with new ideas.
Called Cyber Lab East, the center plans to open early next year and will cost $2 million a year to operate, said representatives of Ericsson and the New York City Investment Fund, who are scheduled to announce the details of the venture today. 
 "The Investment Fund views Cyber Lab as a critical part of the infrastructure that will help New York capture the jobs and business opportunities that will be generated from the Internet industries in the years ahead," said Mr. Kravis, the financier who is chairman of the fund.
Ericsson will provide $1.5 million, and the fund, which aims to create jobs and generate economic development, will lend Ericsson $750,000 to support the project, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the fund.
Ms. Wylde said the goal was to create a nurturing and intellectually charged atmosphere in which Ericsson engineers and programmers will offer tips.
The laboratory will be stocked with computer equipment, and companies will rent the space for as little as $5,000 a week.
Companies seeking space have to submit proposals to Ericsson for approval, with the criterion being that the plans complement Ericsson's strategy of integrating the Internet and telecommunications, said Joseph L. Hagan, chief financial officer of Ericsson Inc., whose American headquarters are in Richardson, Tex.
The plan is for a permanent staff of up to five Ericsson employees, helping up to 15 projects at a time.
"It's a bit like a ski lodge, where we provide the ski lifts and teachers and some equipment, but you use the slopes to test new skis, snowboards and other equipment," Mr. Hagan said.
The 5,000-square-foot center will be on the 16th floor of the New York Information Technology Center at 55 Broad Street, said William C. Rudin, president of the Rudin Management Company, owner of the building. The 400,000-square-foot building, billed as "wired" because of its abundance of high-speed computer connections and preference for new-media companies, is fully occupied.
The center is not the first such collaborative effort. In 1993, New York University established the Center for Digital Multimedia Production, Publishing and Education, which works with new-media companies to develop products. Last year, Ericsson founded the Cyber Lab in Menlo Park, Calif., a model for the New York center.
The Investment Fund, which was established last year with a pool of $60 million from some of the best-known investors and corporations in the city, had mainly focused on retail development and job-creation projects, investing $4.75 million. That strategy has broadened, Ms. Wilde said, to include supporting the Internet industry.
In addition to the Ericsson deal, the fund this month pledged to allocate 10 percent of its capitalization, or $6 million, to help finance small high-tech companies.

HEADLINE: For Hoffa, Nearly Everything Is in a Name

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: MAYWOOD, Ill.

 BODY:
Up in the grandstands, his back to a 30-foot-tall window overlooking the racetrack, James P. Hoffa was whipping up a crowd of 1,000 truckers and their wives the way his legendary father did, telling them that last year's election for the teamsters' presidency was stolen from him.
At this harness track outside Chicago, the air was far more electric than at many political rallies as the varied group of muscle-bound truckers and scraggly, long-haired drivers, of teamster newcomers and union potentates wearing pinky rings, hailed Mr. Hoffa's every word as much as his famous last name. 
 For many, this stocky 56-year-old labor lawyer from Detroit is the second coming of their favorite labor leader. "If it weren't for Hoffa Sr.," one trucker said, "I wouldn't have my house or be able to support my family."
Shouting so his frenzied supporters could hear, Mr. Hoffa asked the teamsters at the $20-a-person fund-raiser and macaroni dinner, "Does everyone know why they have ordered a rerun? It's because the Ron Carey campaign stole $1.5 million of your dues money."
In one of those surprising twists of history, the son of James Riddle Hoffa, the longtime teamster leader who was repeatedly linked to organized crime, is on the political offensive attacking corruption under Mr. Carey, a darling of labor reformers who was first elected teamsters' president in 1991 on a platform of cleansing the union of mob influence.
But even as Mr. Hoffa portrays himself as a corruption buster, the Carey camp repeatedly points to lingering questions about his past and about his sponsors and mentors, among them union leaders who have been convicted of embezzlement and ousted for nepotism.
In August, Federal officials found that Carey aides had illegally diverted union money to help his re-election campaign, annulled his narrow victory over Mr. Hoffa and ordered a new election.
The stakes are high in the rerun this winter because the teamsters, one of the United States' most powerful unions, was long its most mob-infested one -- until the Federal Government and Mr. Carey began cleaning it up. Some government officials and labor leaders are wary of having someone else named Hoffa running this truckers union, which reaches into every nook of the economy and is prized by mobsters as a vehicle to ship contraband.
Despite the many questions about him, Mr. Hoffa depicted himself as an aggrieved white knight throughout the evening-long fund-raiser, which included 10 boxing matches and a $100-a-person party for teamster bigwigs in the track's Windy City Club Room.
"Is there anyone here who doesn't believe we won the last election?" Mr. Hoffa asked the crowd.
"No," they thundered in unison, all but ignoring the horse race going on behind and below Mr. Hoffa, a gregarious man who was wearing an un-teamsterish plaid sports jacket over a white polo shirt.
With Mr. Carey tarred by the scandal, Mr. Hoffa is widely viewed as the front-runner in the race to head the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, whose 1.4 million members include long-haul truckers, parcel deliverers, warehouse employees and sanitation workers.
Mr. Hoffa vows to clean up the union and transform it into the powerhouse it was under his father, who was easily the best-known labor leader of the last 50 years.
This anti-corruption pledge comes from a man whose mentors have included George Vitale, who went to jail in the 1970's for embezzlement and who was ousted from the presidency of a Detroit local in 1991 when Federal officials found that he stole $10,761 in union money and tried to embezzle a Lincoln Town Car. Another mentor, Michael Bane, president of a Detroit local, also went to jail for embezzlement in the 1970's and was caught in a famous photo stomping a teamster dissident.
Last year, soon after Mr. Hoffa chose William Hogan Jr., head of an 11,000-member Chicago local, to be No. 2 on his ticket, Federal officials kicked Mr. Hogan out of office because of nepotism. Mr. Hogan's brother was the local's No. 2 person, his son was recording secretary and together the three Hogans earned $477,000 a year. (At the Maywood fund-raiser, Mr. Hogan defended himself by saying that nepotism was commonplace in unions and in Chicago, and that Federal officials ousted him because they wanted to help Mr. Carey's campaign.)
In the late 1960's Mr. Hoffa was an investor in a partnership with Allen Dorfman, a friend of his father and a leading organized crime figure. Federal officials say Mr. Dorfman, who was murdered in 1983, siphoned more than $100 million from teamster pension funds to the Mafia.
Mr. Hoffa denies knowing that Mr. Dorfman was tied to organized crime and said he sold his investment as soon as he found out.
Ken Paff, national coordinator of Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a pro-Carey group that long fought corruption in the union, said Mr. Hoffa's most prominent mentor, Larry Brennan, head of the teamsters in Michigan, organized a group in the 1980's that beat up dissidents pushing for democracy in the union, an assertion Mr. Brennan's spokesman denied. Mr. Hoffa now works as Mr. Brennan's executive assistant.
In addition, Federal judges in New York and Michigan have lambasted Mr. Hoffa as wasting dues money in the legal defense of union officials who were found to have blatantly violated the law. In one case, Mr. Hoffa defended a Detroit local's president who refused to open the unit's books and records to some members.
"I always believe that if you sleep with dogs, you're going to get fleas," said Don Stone, a former Detroit trucker who successfully sued the president of that unit, Local 283. "I believe Hoffa's right in there with that whole Detroit bunch, who have been convicted of embezzling and other crimes. If he's elected, isn't he going to be very beholden to these old guard officials?"
Despite such attacks, many people in Detroit vouch for Mr. Hoffa, including some former prosecutors. Martin Crandall, who worked for the Federal Organized Crime Strike Force in Detroit, said he often opposed or negotiated with Mr. Hoffa, a graduate of Michigan State University and the University of Michigan Law School, when he represented unions and labor officials.
"I've never seen anything but honesty and integrity in his work," said Mr. Crandall, now a lawyer in private practice.
In a heated campaign where the two sides do not hide their dislike for each other, the Carey forces have sought to demonize Mr. Hoffa.
For example, they have published a pamphlet citing a book by Frank Ragano, a lawyer for mob bosses, which states that two well-known Mafia figures, Carlos Marcello and Santo Traficante -- in a gesture of friendship to the elder Hoffa -- each gave the younger Hoffa $5,000 as a wedding present. Mr. Hoffa attacks this story as untrue.
With stories like these, the Carey camp is pushing the notion that if Mr. Hoffa wins, he will let organized crime influence the union the way it did under his father. The elder Hoffa was president from 1957 to 1971 and disappeared in 1975 in what F.B.I. officials say was a mob slaying.
In an interview, Mr. Hoffa grew angry with assertions that he would let the Mafia back in.
"The most important thing," he said sternly, is that "my father was, I believe, murdered by the mob."
"The mob will never come back into the teamsters union," he said. "I will see to that."
Then, talking about the Carey camp, he added, "Why are these people who are accused of carrying out the biggest scandal in teamsters' history repeating things like that?"
Arthur Sloane, a University of Delaware professor who wrote a biography of the elder Hoffa, said the Carey forces were portraying the younger Hoffa unfairly.
"It can always be argued that he was friendly with some mobsters in his early years because they were friends of his father," Professor Sloane said. "But I think that these predictions by Carey people that if Hoffa wins, he's likely to bring back the old guard and some unsavory characters are simply wrong."
Knowing that the union is not peopled by choirboys, Professor Sloane seemed to pardon Mr. Hoffa's contacts with disreputable types. "You don't grow up a teamster, you don't come up to be a teamster leader in the 60's, 70's and 80's without meeting these people and associating with them in a pragmatic way," he said.
In an interview, Mr. Hoffa said, "I don't remember meeting any mobsters as a young man."
Mr. Hoffa said that to the best of his knowledge, his father did not associate with mobsters. "That's my belief," he said solemnly. He added: "He's not running. He's been gone for 22 years."
On the campaign trail, Mr. Hoffa often says he had the ideal upbringing to lead the union.
"As a child I stood by the fire barrel with my father during Detroit winters, standing with teamsters who were on strike," he said. "I attended union meetings my whole life. On weekends, my father took me down to the union hall. I had a great love affair with the members of this union."
Not surprisingly, Jimmy Hoffa's son decided to become a labor lawyer, and some Detroit locals close to the elder Hoffa were happy to hire him as counsel. He has sued companies, argued before the National Labor Relations Board and won reinstatement for dismissed workers.
"There isn't any aspect of teamster union life that I have not done," he said, "and that is what has prepared me for this union's presidency."
For many teamsters, the biggest question about Mr. Hoffa is who will run the union with him if he wins. Carey supporters assert that it will be Mr. Hoffa's pals from Detroit and Chicago, whom they brand an "old guard" more concerned about reaching into the union cookie jar than about raising wages.
"If Hoffa's elected, these are the people who are going to run the union with him," said Mr. Paff of Teamsters for a Democratic Union. "Has the guy ever had a client who wasn't unsavory? Does he work for any clean locals? He surrounds himself with Bane, Brennan, grifters and bums."
But Mr. Hoffa insists that as president he would turn not to the Detroit crowd but to the officials on his slate, including Chuck Mack, the respected teamsters head in San Francisco, and John Murphy, a left-leaning local president from Boston.
In many ways, Mr. Hoffa's coalition resembles the diverse one surrounding his father: it includes tough, pragmatic teamsters concerned about their members' well-being, long-time leftists who see the teamsters as a vehicle to increase workers' clout and pay, officials concerned about lining their own pockets, and members who detest the many outsiders from the mine workers' union whom Mr. Carey brought in to run the teamsters.
To be sure, his coalition also includes many rank-and-file teamsters in awe of the Hoffa name, like those who lined up at the Maywood fund-raiser to buy scores of $10 T-shirts saying, "Hoffa Now!"
One of those supporters, Tony Viren, a truck driver from Rockford, voiced confidence that Mr. Hoffa would be a good, honest leader.
"He came from a hell of a bloodline," Mr. Viren said. "He'll be in a fishbowl if he's elected president. He won't be able to do anything wrong because everyone will be double and triple checking him."

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Most Voters Have No Opinion About Messinger

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Two weeks before Election Day, Ruth W. Messinger remains an essentially unknown figure to a vast segment of New Yorkers, suggesting that the Democratic challenger to Rudolph W. Giuliani -- and indeed the mayoral race itself -- has not captured the attention of the city, according to the latest New York Times poll.
After a year of speeches, forums, handshaking and television advertisements, 60 percent of those questioned said they had no opinion, good or bad, about the woman who is seeking to become the next Mayor of New York, the Times poll found. 
 By contrast, the poll found that by almost every measure, New Yorkers feel good about their city and its Mayor. Many New Yorkers, though not necessarily a majority, say the city is safer, cleaner, less racially polarized and more prosperous than it was when he began his term.
Mr. Giuliani enjoys as strong a job approval rating now as he has at any point since he became Mayor. When the Times poll asked how they would vote if the election were held today, 49 percent favored Mr. Giuliani and 36 percent supported Ms. Messinger, with 14 percent undecided.
And Mr. Giuliani's numbers could be even greater if the lack of excitement about Ms. Messinger's candidacy produced a low turnout among her potential supporters. That is particularly true for black voters, who overwhelmingly support Ms. Messinger but who have yet to show deep enthusiasm for her campaign.
And the Mayor's support among blacks is one telling indication of his improved standing. In 1993, Mr. Giuliani won just 5 percent of the black vote against David N. Dinkins. Now, black voters indicated in the poll, he would win 25 percent.
There are a few rays of hope for Ms. Messinger on an otherwise dark political horizon. New Yorkers now rank education alongside crime as the most pressing problem facing the next mayor; Ms. Messinger has made her criticism of the Mayor's handling of the public schools a central issue of her campaign. One group of voters with whom Ms. Messinger enjoys a strong advantage is parents of children in public schools.
And despite the overall good tidings for Mr. Giuliani, the Republican Mayor has not won the support of more than 50 percent of New Yorkers in his match-up with Ms. Messinger, suggesting both an ambivalence many New Yorkers may feel toward their quarrelsome Mayor, as well as the 5-to-1 Democratic edge in the city. All of that could mean that Mr. Giuliani, should he win, may not achieve the overwhelming victory his aides have said they are looking for this November to position him for higher political office.
Still, it appears that it would take a fairly dramatic event to break the mold of this election. Ms. Messinger has less campaign money than Mr. Giuliani, and thus is limited in what she can do in the final two weeks. Also, two-thirds of the likely voters who were polled said that their minds were now made up, as is typical this late in an election.
The Times poll surveyed 1,538 adults throughout the city, including 1,022 who said they were registered to vote. It was conducted by telephone from Oct. 13 to Oct. 18 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Ms. Messinger's aides said they were heartened by the Times poll, particularly because it came on a day when a poll in The New York Post found Ms. Messinger losing by a considerably larger margin, 29 percent. The New York Post-Fox 5 poll found 56 percent for Mr. Giuliani, 27 percent for Ms. Messinger and 17 percent undecided.
Jim Andrews, Ms. Messinger's senior campaign adviser, said he was struck by the fact that in the Times poll, Mr. Giuliani had not scored above 50 percent, which in most races would be taken as a sign of trouble for an incumbent.
"Elections involving incumbents are about incumbents," Mr. Andrews said. "Nobody ever said this was going to be easy."
And there are a few factors that could theoretically swing things toward Ms. Messinger. As Mr. Andrews noted, undecided voters traditionally favor the challenger. But the way the poll stands now, virtually all the respondents who said they had not made a decision would have to go to Ms. Messinger. And when pressed about how they were leaning, the undecided voters split evenly between Ms. Messinger and Mr. Giuliani.
Ms. Messinger would also be helped if Democrats who are now supporting Mr. Giuliani had a change of heart. The two candidates now enjoy roughly equal support among Democrats, reflecting Mr. Giuliani's strategy of distancing himself from his party while aligning himself at every opportunity with some of the most prominent Democrats in the city.
Ms. Messinger could also be helped if her voters turned out on Election Day while Mr. Giuliani's did not, particularly in a contest which this poll suggests will produce a low turnout.
Still, it is an uphill battle. Mr. Giuliani is leading in the polls among members of every age group. He is leading among Jews, once a solidly Democratic base of support. He is even tied with Ms. Messinger in Manhattan, her home borough. He is statistically even with Ms. Messinger among Hispanic voters, an increasingly influential segment of the city's electorate.
Indeed, although Ms. Messinger would be the city's first female mayor, Mr. Giuliani is ahead among women, by 44 percent to 36 percent.
This poll again showed sharp differences in the way black, white and Hispanic New Yorkers view the city, but that does not appear to be helping Ms. Messinger. And a low turnout among blacks could inflate Mr. Giuliani's final standing.
Mr. Giuliani's position today reflects what have from the start been three central dynamics of this race. Voters are generally satisfied with the state of the city. They view Mr. Giuliani as an effective leader. And if they have considered Ms. Messinger at all, they are likely to see her as unsuited to be mayor.
A revealing difference in perceptions came in response to two questions. In the first, 78 percent said Mr. Giuliani had "strong qualities of leadership," compared with just 38 for Ms. Messinger. In the second, 80 percent said they thought Mr. Giuliani was "tough enough to deal with the crime problem," while only 30 percent said that about Ms. Messinger.
Most of all, though, the poll underscored the impression that the election has not made much of an impression on New Yorkers. As a result, when voters were asked the routine question of whether they had a favorable opinion of Ms. Messinger, 60 percent said they had no opinion or did not know enough about her to have an opinion. And of those remaining, 20 percent said they had a favorable opinion of her, compared with 20 percent who did not.
By contrast, 29 percent said they were undecided or had not heard enough about Mr. Giuliani to have an opinion of him. Among those who did, 46 percent were favorable, compared with 26 percent who were not.
The other indication of the invisible nature of the Democratic candidate is the difficulties both candidates have had in affecting public discussion on the race. Ms. Messinger clearly had some role in raising public worries about schools -- it went from being listed as a priority for the next mayor by 19 percent of respondents in March to 31 percent now -- but the shift also coincided with the opening of schools.
But Ms. Messinger has hardly dented the city's political consciousness with her other major issue: the city's high unemployment rate. Similarly, Mr. Giuliani's attempt to raise concern about the use of drugs shows little sign of registering with voters.
Most of all, though, the lack of interest in the race appears to reflect Ms. Messinger's apparent failure to crack through the general satisfaction with Mr. Giuliani and the city.
Follow-up telephone conversations yesterday with respondents in the poll underscored the difficulties this has created for Ms. Messinger.
"I haven't heard that much in terms of commercials and advertisements," said Seymour Fiedler, 75, a retired salesman from Queens who said he was leaning toward Mr. Giuliani. "It seems you only get bits and pieces about the candidates. It seems like a low-key campaign compared to the last election, which was more intense. There seemed to be more ads then. Maybe it's because Messinger is not that popular and doesn't have a lot of money."
Ira Bernstein, 51, a business consultant who said he was a Liberal planning to vote for Mr. Giuliani, said: "This isn't a contest. There is no candidate running on the Democratic ticket who can tarnish Giuliani. Messinger is a noncandidate, running by default."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 13 to 18 in all parts of New York City with 1,538 adults. Of these, 1,022 said they were registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey, to gain equal access to all adults in the households.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex and age.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Yorkers.
For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger. For example, among registered voters it is plus or minus four percentage points for whites, six points for blacks and seven points for Hispanic New Yorkers.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk;
In Bordeaux Rating, Economist Considers Price First

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
FOR the first time in almost a decade, Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton University economist and an implacable foe of wine orthodoxy, has produced a new ranking of the chateaus of Bordeaux. No matter how big your pocketbook -- whether you buy in quantity at wine auctions or by the bottle at your local store -- his method could help you ferret out bargains.
Mr. Ashenfelter, the Joseph Douglas Green Professor of Economics at Princeton, ignores wine competitions and awards -- the so-called sniff-and-taste school of judging wine -- and bases his rankings on the price of mature wines at auction. 
 His methodology does not exactly break new ground. The best-known classification of Bordeaux's finest wines was done in 1855 by a syndicate of wine brokers who were trying to decide which wines should represent the region at an exposition in Paris. Businessmen rather than wine makers, they based their choices on the prices paid for the wines over the previous decade.
Mr. Ashenfelter promotes this point of view in his newsletter, Liquid Assets. "Instead of a subjective ranking by a small group of experts," he writes, "why not base a new ranking on the consensus of informed consumers who pay for the wines they drink with cold hard cash?"
Mr. Ashenfelter based his findings on more than 10,000 sales at London wine auctions from May 1994 to December 1996. As a benchmark, he chose Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, as he did in 1988, arbitrarily giving its price level a value of 100. Lafite was chosen because of its long history as an important Bordeaux property. Prices of the other wines from 200 chateaus were expressed as a percentage of the price of Lafite.
The list is valuable because auction prices are not directly reflected in prices at the store, so it gives the wine buyer hard figures on what the best buys are in any price category. For example, according to the Ashenfelter list, a bottle of Lynch-Bages should sell for about half the price of Lafite. If it's listed at less than that at the store, you've got yourself a bargain.
Vintages included in the survey were from 1957 through 1986. "It was critical for the sake of objectivity that the wines be at least 10 years old," he writes, explaining that younger wines do not have enough of a track record to say how good they eventually will be. The prices of these wines "are far too easily influenced by the opinions of wine writers or public relations experts."
In the new Liquid Assets classification, the top-ranked wine is Chateau le Pin, a small property in the commune of Pomerol, 30 miles east of the city of Bordeaux and the vineyards of the Medoc. Its price as a percentage of Lafite-Rothschild: 708, or seven times as expensive as the Lafite. Chateau Petrus, long considered the most expensive of all Bordeaux wines and first in the 1988 Ashenfelter survey, ranked second with a relative price of 369.
Le Pin is to Bordeaux wine what the Florida Marlins are to baseball: no other Bordeaux property has risen to the top so fast. It came into existence in 1979 and its first commercial vintage was 1981. Production in 1996 was a mere 15 barrels. In the second edition of his book "Bordeaux" (Faber & Faber, 1991), Edmund Penning-Rowsell called Le Pin a "pocket-handkerchief of a vineyard," describing its wines as "undeniably attractive and flattering, in a rather Californian and simplistic way."
Following Le Pin and Petrus in the Ashenfelter top 10 are Chateau Lafleur, another Pomerol, at 160; Mouton-Rothschild from Pauillac at 129; Cheval Blanc from St.-Emilion at 121; Latour in Pauillac at 113; Margaux in Margaux at 105; Lafite-Rothschild from Pauillac at 100; La Mission-Haut-Brion in Pessac-Leognan, part of the Graves region at 85, and Haut-Brion, from the same commune, 78.
Another new entry on the list is Chateau le Tertre-Roteboeuf, from St.-Emilion, which placed 24th with a price at 44 percent of that of Lafite-Rothschild's. Le Terte-Roteboeuf is generally made from 80 percent merlot grapes and helps to highlight another feature of the new ranking: the major presence of the merlot grape in contemporary Bordeaux winemaking.
The top three wines in the classification, le Pin, Petrus and Lafleur, are all from Pomerol and are made almost entirely from the merlot grape. Indeed, 9 of the top 25 wines are from Pomerol and 4 are from neighboring St.-Emilion, both communes heavily reliant on the merlot grape.
"The apparent commercial success of merlot-based wines displayed in our ranking helps to explain why some Bordeaux proprietors are moving toward increased planting of merlot vines," Mr. Ashenfelter writes. "It remains to be seen what long-term effects this change has on the reputation of wines from Bordeaux."
He acknowledges that his figures might be difficult to put to practical use in auction rooms, where prices change rapidly. But he insists that they can be helpful in buying wine in shops and restaurants. "Decide what price category of wine you are prepared to buy," he said, "then select the wine with the highest ranking in that category."
Liquid Assets is $20; its address is 32 Nassau Street, Princeton, N.J. 08542.

MANY Burgundy producers trace their ancestry in the vineyards back two or three centuries and have been estate-bottling their wines for 50 years. Jacques Seysses, to the contrary, arrived from Paris in the late 1960's, having worked there and in New York as a banker. Bored with banking, he opted for his first love, wine. After apprenticing at the Domaine de la Pousse d'Or in Volnay for two harvests, he created the Domaine Dujac in Morey-St. Denis and quickly became one of Burgundy's premier winemakers. Mr. Seysses owns about 5 acres of the 42-acre Clos de la Roche, one of five Grand Cru vineyards in Morey-St. Denis. From it he produces one of his most distinguished and long-lived wines. The 1994 is medium-bodied, with a magnificent bouquet and an exceptionally long finish. It is a structured wine that should improve considerably over the next five years and then last well into the next century. Like all Domaine Dujac Grand Cru wines, it was aged in 100 percent new oak.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Intense, Artistic, All the Rage? Must Be Disgusting

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein

 BODY:
It is almost impossible to write about disgust without being disgusting. Words like squishy, sticky, squirmy and slimy can hardly be used without hints of a grimace. Others, like pus and phlegm, bring on anticipations of full-scale offense.
So reader, be forewarned. The disgusting is our subject: items that cause us to feel repulsed, even contaminated, by their very thought; behaviors that inspire intense revulsion and horror, experiences that even in memory inspire a shudder. 
 Which should make us feel right at home. For the disgusting has become commonplace in culture. It has become the subject of scholarly examination in at least two new books. Sometimes it even seems a welcome companion. Adventure and horror films seduce with rotting corpses, slithering layers of snakes, cannibalistic criminals, rank swamps and even (in "Men in Black") juicy, exploding cockroaches. Lollipops encasing worm larvae are a favorite candy for children. Body piercing and puncturing have become mainstream fashion. The daytime talk shows and best-seller lists are filled with chatty tales meant to inspire shock and, yes, disgust.
Disgust is even courted on the artistic scene. The avant-garde often deliberately tests the boundaries of the disgusting. (What, after all, was the scandal about that crucifix dipped in urine a few years ago but its deliberate invocation of disgust?) In politics, disgust may be more potent than legal niceties. (Which is likely to cause a more immediate emotional reaction: a pubic hair on a Coke can or political fund-raising on Federal property?)
We cultivate disgust as a moral reaction, to be invoked as an extreme weapon, proclaiming a particular disagreement to be beyond argument. Indeed, the disgusting may have even become so commonplace that it no longer seems outrageous: one of the remarkable aspects of the literary reputation of the Marquis de Sade, as Roger Shattuck argues in "Forbidden Knowledge" (St. Martin's Press), is that his writings have ceased to disgust us.
This preoccupation with disgust, though, does not seem accompanied by an increase in the quantity of disgust we are exposed to. The disgusting, with its implications of decay, disease and death, was far more prevalent in the days before plumbing and modern medicine; a stroll down some of 18th-century London's less savory streets would probably turn the modern stomach. Middle-class America is more protected from common sources of disgust than any society in history. But that makes our preoccupation with disgust still more remarkable. Disgust is less forced upon us than courted, toyed with, invoked, used and abused. Disgust is cultivated.
Two new books are also attracted to its powers. In "The Anatomy of Disgust" (Harvard University Press), William Ian Miller, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, meticulously dissects the notion of disgust with the rigor of a legal brief, trying to determine its boundaries and powers. And in "Nightmare on Main Street" (forthcoming from Harvard), Mark Edmundson, a professor of English at the University of Virginia, argues that contemporary taste is dominated by a vulgar version of the Gothic -- that genre of horror that came into its own in the 19th century with its tales of menacing crypts and ancient evils, endangered innocents and horrific mutilations. Mr. Edmundson doesn't discuss disgust, but it is clear that in the Gothic, evil is the repulsive, the threatening and the alluring forces hidden behind an ordered facade.
What, then, is disgust? The psychologist Paul Rozin associated the feeling of disgust with the desire to avoid reminders of animal origins. The disgusting is related to the animal aspects of our lives, particularly our bodies, which, as Mr. Miller reminds us, "suppurate, die and rot." The anthropologist Mary Douglas associated contamination and disgust with a violation of cultural categories; something disgusts if it is out of place, anomalous. A hair on a head is innocuous; a hair in a bowl of soup is disgusting. The animal aspects of life -- so often seemingly disgusting in themselves -- are not contaminating if they stay in their place, regulated by socially approved sexual activity, dietary laws, social manners or hygienic habits.
Mr. Miller goes further. The disgusting, he argues, is more ambiguous and complicated. It can attract and yet overwhelm. It can be inspired by an overgrowth of life (as in a jungle or swamp) or by signs of imminent death (in decay and dissolution). Many things we find disgusting inhabit a nether world. They tend to be neither solid nor liquid, neither cold nor hot, neither alive nor dead, neither cooked nor raw, neither belonging in our bodies nor belonging outside them, perhaps even seeming neither human nor inhuman.
If culture orders the world and gives its objects value, the disgusting is what lies beyond culture's reach. We are repelled by it, but also drawn to it, the way a tongue probes a painful tooth. Mr. Miller says that "disgust is central to moral discourse and to the construction of our moral sensibility." In short, disgust helps create our culture.
Why, then, is disgust pursued in contemporary life? In his provocative book about the Gothic, Mr. Edmundson notes that the genre flourished in the years after the French Revolution. Those drafty castles with their dark secrets, the vampirish counts and the leering clergymen were all embodiments of the ancient regime, the old feudal order haunting the unsteady world of the new. Modern innocents are lured into that realm and nearly overwhelmed by it, until they exorcise its demonic control. The past is finally passed. The disgusting is contained, controlled, overcome.
But today, Mr. Edmundson argues, there is no clear resolution to our Gothic tales. Their haunting addictions and demonic figures keep reappearing in rock videos, computer games, television talk shows and horror films. But the villainy is ambiguous. No sooner do we start to hate the wife abuser on a talk show than we learn that he too is a haunted victim of abuse or a recovering addict. We are all villains and all victims, all disgusting and all agents of disgust. The result, Mr. Edmundson continues, is a culture suffused with sadomasochism.
In contemporary life, in fact, those categories that have traditionally defined culture have become porous and ambiguous; multiculturalism, relativism, gender bending -- these are some of the signposts of modern culture. There is no clear frame of reference, no guiding standard. But ambiguities and dislocation provide a nourishing home for disgust. In art and film, in fashion spreads and tabloid journalism, shocks multiply the way they do among a group of adolescents who are demonstrating their mastery over disgust with a series of ever-inflationary dares.
And so we live with our cultivated disgust. Disgust, for all its inchoate repulsiveness, even ends up becoming the only frame of reference. In our universe of cultural play where everything seems arbitrary and unclear, disgust often ends up the sole surviving force of natural law.
Disgust, Mr. Miller reminds us, has always helped give birth to culture; it has helped inspire notions of ethics and beauty that have tried to control or even banish disgust. So perhaps the disgusting, in the midst of its renaissance, may be ripe enough to inspire a cultural response. The disgusting tosses out a challenge: you want to make something of it -- or what?

To Repay G.I.'s and Rebuild America

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The millions of men and women who returned to civilian life at the end of World War II have sometime since gone to gray, but memories of their reception remain green. Instead of being shrugged off like veterans of earlier wars, they were given generous unemployment checks, low-interest loans for houses and businesses and, most significantly, free education at colleges and trade schools.
"The G.I. Bill: The Law That Changed America" tells that heartening story mainly through the experiences of its beneficiaries, young Americans who grew up in the Depression, with no prospects beyond dead-end jobs, much less dreams of college diplomas, and suddenly found a world of opportunity opened to them. They took eager advantage of the Government largess, worked hard to catch up on the lost war years and succeeded not only in building careers and families but also in making the United States a middle-class country. 
 Tonight's historians remind us that Washington's openhandedness was prompted in part by unease lest the return of so many battle-toughened veterans without futures be accompanied by political volatility; memories of the fascist and Communist movements that came out of World War I were still disturbingly fresh. But there was also simple gratitude to those who had won a popular war, and the American Legion's all-out lobbying for what became known as the G.I. Bill of Rights didn't hurt.
This hourlong documentary plays a bit heavily on show-business personalities like Tony Curtis, Harry Belafonte, Walter Matthau and Rod Steiger, all of whom credit the chance to go to the dramatic workshop of New York's New School for Social Research with turning them into stars. But there are others who made it big in science, business and education. What they have in common is an appreciation, tinged with wonder, that their lives were changed utterly by a law.
The attention given to Mr. Belafonte and to Andrew Brimmer, a sharecropper's son who became the first black member of the Federal Reserve Board, diverts attention from the fact that black veterans had a much harder time than whites getting into an increasingly affluent mainstream. But the nation as a whole was transformed. By 1949, most Americans were homeowners; the suburban culture was created.
And with more than two million veterans going to college, barriers were broken at institutions like Harvard University, which had been wary of an influx of the unwashed. Even Ivy League bastions could not resist the tuition payments subsidized by Washington or deny that the veterans were serious students. Higher education was opened up, and so was much of American society.
Someone says tonight, "It was the most successful good program ever." As one of the many who went through college on the G.I. Bill, let me say amen.

Another mighty experiment in American social engineering, the highway building that took monumental shape in the 1950's, though far more criticized than the G.I. Bill, also opened the pleasures of suburbia to veterans and their young families and linked the nation as never before. Its less salutary effects, notably the destruction of neighborhoods, are not ignored in this colorful on-the-road history.

Endorsements Raise Money and Questions

BYLINE: By Marian Burros

 BODY:
SINCE the American Heart Association changed its charter in 1988 to permit product endorsements, an arrangement it had prohibited from its founding in 1924, it has raised millions of dollars from such sources as the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Kellogg Company and Conagra.
The heart association, a nonprofit group, says the money supports research and education programs and helps spread its message promoting heart health. But critics are asking whether such arrangements confuse the public into thinking that a food endorsed by the group is better than one that is not. They also ask whether in the long run these arrangements are detrimental to charitable organizations by undermining their stance of objectivity. 
 Brigid McHugh Sanner, the heart association's senior vice president for communications and advocacy, said she had no comment on specific criticisms because she had not seen the data. She noted, however, that she objects to the word endorsement.
"We don't endorse products," she said. "We call those food-certification programs or corporate relationships. None of this constitutes an endorsement."
The American Heart Association is not the only nonprofit group to face concerns over corporate links. In August the American Medical Association withdrew its plan to endorse health-care products like blood-pressure monitors made by the Sunbeam Corporation after an avalanche of bad publicity. Even some of the group's members feared that the endorsement, the first in its history, could cause conflicts of interest.
The heart association charges varying fees for the use of its name. For $2,500, a company like Kellogg can put the association's heart-check symbol on, for example, a package of Fruity Marshmallow Krispies. The yearly renewal charge is $650.
That fee is modest compared with the $450,000 it cost the Florida Department of Citrus for an exclusive promotion and advertising contract with the association that lasted from 1994 until early this year. The exclusive agreement precluded any similar citrus trade association from using the heart association's endorsement.
The cattlemen's association paid $25,000 for its arrangement with the heart association, which promoted lean cuts of beef. Conagra's ads for its Healthy Choice products in The Wall Street Journal offer a nutrition tip and promote the association. In return for the use of its name, the nonprofit group agreed not to disclose how much it received from Conagra. For an earlier agreement with Conagra in 1992-93, it received $3,500,000 for a TV program on nutrition.
An association brochure says the heart-check certification program, established in 1992, is "designed to help consumers easily select foods in the grocery store that can be part of a balanced, heart-healthy diet." The association has so far certified 636 products. To be designated "heart healthy," a product must meet nutrient requirements established by the Food and Drug Administration or U.S. Department of Agriculture: it must be low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. The heart association also requires written assurance from the company that its nutritional labeling is correct.
ALL foods are eligible except those manufactured by a tobacco company or its subsidiaries. This excludes all products from Nabisco (a unit of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation) and Kraft, Post and Jell-O (all owned by Philip Morris). So Post's Raisin Bran cannot carry the heart-check symbol, while Kellogg's Raisin Bran can. And does.
Dr. James T. Bennett of George Mason University asks whether the heart association's arrangement with the Florida citrus group means that "California citrus won't help you with heart disease -- only Florida can." Dr. Bennett, a political economist, called such endorsements "ludicrous."
Dr. Bennett's sentiment was echoed by Dr. Michael Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington advocacy group. An endorsement "deceives people into thinking one product is better than another," he said.
For companies that want an exclusive agreement with the American Heart Association like that of the Florida citrus growers, the cost is $55,000 a quarter or $200,000 a year. Without exclusivity, the cost is $25,000 a quarter or $90,000 a year.
No matter the form of the endorsement, Dr. Jacobson said, "this is dangerous territory for nonprofits."
"The risk is if they get money from the dairy industry, will they be able to criticize the industry if the occasion arises?" he continued. "I think it's virtually impossible for a charity to bite the hands that feed it."
Dr. Bennett was particularly critical of the relationship between the cattlemen's association and the heart association, and pointed to their promotion of lean beef. The heart association also presented a "Champion of Heart" award to the group for its "contributions that have allowed A.H.A. to further its fight against heart disease and stroke." In exchange for "a very nice healthy grant," Dr. Bennett said, the cattlemen have a plaque to display from the heart association.
"They are compromising themselves, particularly when word gets out that they are getting big bucks," he said of the association. "Over time they will lose their credibility. They become a shill for corporate interests and there is no way you can dress that up as charitable activity. It is unethical." As soon as nonprofit groups are seen as an arm of industry, "it's going to hurt their fund raising, their stature," he added.
Ms. Sanner said research done by the association indicated the opposite. "We've done a number of marketing studies specifically about the certification program and we find the public is not confused about what the certification mark means," she said. But she added that the association has not done any surveys to gauge the public's reaction to the other promotional partnerships that have been forged with the food industry.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Renoir Portraits Show an Artist In Two Lights

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
"Great painters paint in order to learn to paint." The words of the French pedagogue and painter Andre Lohte apply with particular accuracy to the career of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The great Impressionist spent his life moving restlessly from style to style, working under the spell of various contemporaries or masters from the past, loosening, then tightening his famously fluttery brushwork.
In "Renoir's Portraits: Impressions of an Age" at the Art Institute of Chicago," Renoir often comes across as the eternal student, an artist of many ups and downs, by turns dazzling, brittle or maudlin. Sometimes it even seems that he never quite hit his stride -- or rarely found it again after the 1870's. This is a startling reaction to have to such a historic figure, even one whose posthumous reputation has fluctuated as much as his has, and it's not clear whether it is his fault or the exhibition's. 
 Organized by Colin B. Bailey, chief curator at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, where it originated last summer, "Renoir Portraits" benefits from the current popularity, bordering on frenzy, of Impressionist painting. The style may have hit Paris like a shock wave in 1874, when, led by Monet, a handful of renegades from the official government Salon defiantly organized their own exhibition. But by now Impressionism is so thoroughly adored that any exhibition focusing on any slice of its central players' careers is guaranteed success, regardless of quality. (The exhibition of Monet's Mediterranean paintings, now at the Brooklyn Museum, is a case in point.)
This show is not insubstantial. Renoir painted more portraits than any other Impressionist, and 62 of them, ranging through six decades, are gathered here. But many additional portraits are reproduced with Mr. Bailey's exceptionally detailed catalogue essay, and they suggest that the exhibition could have been stronger. Absent are key pictures, especially from the late 1860's, when Renoir was under the influence of Manet and Degas and made some of his most psychologically convincing portraits, and from the 1870's. (The show will lose several works when it goes to the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth in February.)
As seen in Chicago (through Jan. 4), the show's main purpose seems to be to please Renoir fans while reducing the chance that a larger, more definitive treatment of his portraits will be tried soon. Still, there's much to be learned from this selection of increasingly frothy, spun-sugar paintings with their high-key colors and unsettled brushwork, their oddly impersonal depictions of breathtakingly innocent children, young beauties and robust, matronly older women -- even if the lessons don't always flatter Renoir.
The son of a tailor, Renoir was the only Impressionist from a working class background. To the end of his long life, when he was considered one of the greatest living painters, he retained his plain speech, slightly rough manners and preference for models from his own social stratum (as opposed to what he called "those overbred females they call society women").
Because of his beginnings, Renoir was also the only Impressionist who was trained and then worked as an artisan before taking up fine art. During most of the 1850's, he worked in factories, painting china and later ladies' fans with felicitous portraits and pastoral scenes reminiscent of Watteau and Fragonard. (It was here as much as at the Louvre that he acquired his lifelong passion for 18th-century French painting.)
This background may have instilled practicality. When Impressionism failed to gain an art-buying public in the decade after its debut, Renoir began to paint for others to have money to paint for himself. He turned to commissioned portraits, soliciting clients and even submitting pictures to the Salon to establish his reputation.
To some extent, this may not have been such a leap. The exhibition begins with the artist's own words: "For me a picture . . . should be something likable, joyous and pretty -- yes pretty." The sentiment contradicts the haunted, Romantic look of Renoir's early self-portraits. It also echoes Matisse's thoughts on luxe, calm and comfortable armchairs, although Renoir's idea of pretty tended to be softer, without Matisse's hard-won formal rigor.
In the first three galleries, which contain the best, we see Renoir finding himself through the work of his elders -- Courbet, Manet and Degas -- sometimes with dramatic growth spurts. For example, a portrait of his brother from 1866 is all academic stiffness and small, affected flourishes; it suggests a gussied-up Thomas Eakins. Next to it, a portrait of the artist's father from 1867, is altogether different: a solid, engaging work, forthright in its physical handling of paint, subtle in its plays of pinks and white against grays and blacks, and complex in its emotional characterization. Manet's influence is everywhere evident. An 1867 portrait of Renoir's close friend, the painter Frederic Bazille, hunched over his easel has a similar directness of both feeling and paint.
 
The Impression: Tiny Heart of Gold
 Next, the brief span of high Impressionism is represented by several paintings that form the exhibition's tiny heart of gold. A standout is a brilliant little portrait of Camille Monet stretched out on a mountainous chintz sofa, reading. She is seen slightly from above, as if we are standing over her, about to interrupt her concentration. The informal pose, intimate space, soft suffused light and staccato brushwork are hallmarks of Impressionism, while the beguiling interplay of the flowered chintz and Camille's embroidered housecoat increases the work's unity. It has been brought off with an amazing economy of paint; up close one can often see the bare weave of the canvas.
Monet himself is shown in an even more active mode, painting, in two portraits. In one he stands at his easel in his overgrown garden, a floating, carefully controlled riot of reds and greens. The other, somewhat larger, places him indoors at the easel, catching him between brush strokes as he appraises an unseen subject.
From here on the exhibition becomes very uneven as it veers between commissioned works and more personal statements. Little stops you in your tracks, feels profound or looks inevitable. The large group portrait, "Luncheon of the Boating Party," Renoir's stagey, cloying masterpiece from 1881, is here from the Phillips Collection in Washington. Adjacent and playing David to this Goliath is the small, expertly tossed-off "Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise," an image of two men and a woman lingering over wine, which is exquisitely subtle in its shadings of both light and human interaction.
Sometimes Renoir has the bravura of a slick society painter, as in the diaphanous portrait of the actress Henriette Honriot. Sometimes the sheer slipping, sliding clumsiness of the surface is startling, as in an 1882 portrait of the two daughters of the Impressionist's main dealer, Durand-Ruel. In a painting of two sisters as acrobats at the circus, he looks like a lesser Degas. In a late self-portrait and a pleasant, uncharacteristically thick-surfaced rendering of his wife, he looks toward Cezanne. The commanding portrait of Marguerite Charpentier sitting in her Japanese salon with her two cherubic children (now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art) isolates luxurious passages of loose paint-handling within a conventionally realistic framework -- Impressionist technique in a proper Victorian straitjacket.
Renoir's idealizing, beautifying impulses often worked best in his paintings of children, especially the grave, dignified portraits from the late 1870's. Perhaps this was because their characters were relatively simple to begin with, their outlook genuinely untroubled, their faces more revealing.
But even this gift can pall from overuse. "Children's Afternoon at Wargemont," the final commissioned portrait in the exhibition, shows the three daughters of Paul Berard in their sitting room. Sharp edged, tightly rendered, the painting has the stiff almost primitive charm of a children's book illustration, and Mr. Bailey perceptively likens it to Balthus. But beneath its glossy surfaces is something that smacks of the artist's humiliation.
Mr. Bailey and other historians have argued that Renoir did not compromise himself in his commissioned portraits, and indeed their weaknesses may to some extent parallel similar dips in the rest of his work. (The Wargemont portrait, for example, was done in 1884, when Renoir, disillusioned with Impressionism, was flailing.)
 
How Security Affected the Art
 Nonetheless, things perk up in the exhibition's last two galleries, which feature the paintings of family and friends made after the late 1880's, when Renoir was financially able to forgo portrait commissions and was relying more and more on the Old Masters, especially Rubens, for inspiration.
Finally, the strokes stop sliding and curl gently around their inflated, almost cartoonish subjects. Colors are rich, odd and matte of surface, pointing toward Bonnard's drifting hues (and maybe even Color Field Painting). The best work is a portrait of the art dealer Ambroise Vollard from 1908. Shown in profile against a deep rose background, he sits with his elbows on a table, intently studying a little Maillol sculpture of a nude that he cradles in his hands. As with the earlier portraits of Monet and his wife, it is an image of attentive concentration, and it offers a comforting conclusion to Renoir's erratic journey through portraiture.

HEADLINE: Despite the Bad News, The Fishing Is Good

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
MAYBE there will always be plenty of fish in the sea.
Even as the country's beloved cod and flounder, bluefin tuna and native swordfish have become scarce, tons of fresh, mild-tasting white-fleshed fish from far-flung seas are softening the pain of the dwindling supplies. 
 Wild sea bass from Chile, yellowtail and greentail snapper from South America, red mullet or "rouget" from North Africa have turned airports into fish ports. And they may turn the hard times of American fisheries into a boon for food lovers in this country, while giving local fish stocks at least a chance to recover.
Today the best-priced and highest-quality fish around are more likely to hail from Icelandic waters or the Indian Ocean than from Cape May or Cape Cod. And many of the immigrant species are richer, more interesting fish. The flake -- the overlapping layers of flesh in the fillet -- tends to be larger in these fish, making them harder to overcook, and therefore capable of reaching gastronomic heights unmatched by the more delicate domestic varieties of white fish.
Ports from Chile to Thailand are now equipped with modern processing plants and staffed by experienced low-cost laborers. The fish are packed in customized foam-plastic containers and rushed to airports, reaching New York almost as quickly as from Cape Cod or Florida and usually less expensively. When they arrive at the Fulton Fish Market, the whole yellowtail and greentail snappers are glistening and quivering in their white insulated boxes. The eyes of the rouget -- even after so long a journey -- are clear and unclouded, and the startling fresh char smells like cucumber. This is perfect, pristine fish, the cream of the imported crop.
Last year, $6.7 billion worth of edible fish was imported, compared with the $3.6 billion of fish harvested in waters off the United States.
"Our fish imports are almost double what they were 20 years ago," said Dr. James Anderson, a professor of natural resource economics at the University of Rhode Island and the publisher of Seafood Market Analyst/ Seafood Report, a monthly newsletter in Narragansett, R.I.
"The Atlantic ground fish are scarce, with the exception of the Alaskan canning fisheries," he said. "The Pacific coast is in trouble and, thanks to the craze for blackened redfish, the Gulf fisheries are extinct as a commercial enterprise, though they are coming back as a recreational fishing area.
"We tend to import fresh, high-value seafood and export processed fish, lesser-quality fish, as well as good fish like mackerel, herring and fish roe that America has never developed a taste for."
In addition to formerly unfamiliar species, fish markets across the country are offering tuna and mahi-mahi from Ecuador, a glut of farm-raised shrimp from Mexico and Thailand, swordfish from Brazil and the Azores, cod from Iceland and farmed salmon from the Bay of Fundy in Canada.
David Samuels, the third-generation owner of Blue Ribbon Fish, a wholesale business at the Fulton Fish Market, said his grandfather would be shocked at the way he buys fish. Instead of dealing with individual boat captains, Mr. Samuels works the fax and telephone lines, worries about the price of international air freight and would be out of business without a reliable customs broker and shipper.
But his grandfather would be even more startled, Mr. Samuels said, at his prices. "I'm selling this gorgeous Atlantic salmon from Canada for the same price he sold domestic salmon 50 years ago," he said. "If I had to rely on domestic sources for salmon, tuna or sword, I'd be out of business."
If he were dependent on domestic sources for shrimp, salmon and tuna, he added, "the prices could triple."
Tuna taken in North American waters can fetch as much as $15 a pound, according to Steven Cohen, manager of the fish department at Balducci's in Manhattan, while tuna imported from Chile can bring as little as $5.
Mr. Samuels understands that the new global fish business offers opportunities for unscrupulousness among distant suppliers. He said there is "plenty of old scrubby fish around, fish that was improperly handled at sea or packed, fish that missed its airline connection, old, inferior fish." Mr. Samuels puts his trust in his own eyes and a handshake. Instead of driving to local ports, as his grandfather did, he flies to Brazil and Chile, to Iceland, China and Thailand.
The best wholesale importers deliver exquisite white-fleshed fish like Chilean sea bass and Arctic char that are mild-mannered and infinitely adaptable, fish that seem custom made for American taste -- they can slide nearly unnoticed into traditional recipes. The change from a local to an international fishery poses no trauma for cooks or diners.
At the same time there are some welcome culinary challenges. The imported fish tend to be richer than domestic white fish and have a larger and more forgiving flake; such character is irresistible to chefs, because it lets them invent more complex recipes for fish that can endure long, slow cooking. The rich, large-flaked fish allowed Eric Ripert to create a dish of Arctic char with fava beans and peas, for instance, delighting his customers at Le Bernardin in Manhattan.
But even with all the raves about foreign fish, a few Americans aren't buying.
Mike Foley, the third-generation owner of M. F. Foley in New Bedford, Mass., is one of the rare East Coast fish purveyors who have remained unwaveringly faithful to fish caught off New England -- what there is of it. (The harvest from New England's fisheries has dropped to 641 million pounds in 1996 from 780 million in 1980, but the most telling loss is among favored fish like cod: the catch fell to 31 million pounds from 118 million in the same period.)
Mr. Foley acknowledged that imported fish, because it is so plentiful, can be less expensive, but he said the foreign is not always top quality. For instance, he said, swordfish from Chile and tuna from Ecuador are harvested during their spawning season, and are therefore mushier and inferior. Recent reports of contaminated fish from South America also concern him.
But most fishmongers -- and American seafood aficionados -- are too grateful for a steady supply of relatively inexpensive fish to quibble over character and nuance.
"I love red snapper from the gulf more than anything in the world," said Mr. Cohen of Balducci's. "But there isn't any real snapper left in the gulf, so I'm learning to love the yellowtail snapper from South America. It's not red snapper, but it's good fish."
Such concessions may have already led to some recovery in the native fish stocks off North America. After years of concern over the depletion of the oceans, some environmental scientists believe -- perhaps hope is a better word -- that the lessons of the past have been learned. They even see new evidence that American fisheries are on the way back.
Preliminary statistics recently published by the National Marine Fisheries Service show the first hint that the free fall in Atlantic fishing stocks is stabilizing, according to Dr. Steven Murawski, the chief biologist at the Northeast Fisheries Center in Woods Hole, Mass.
"There's been a modest upturn," he said. "But there are still far too many vessels that are far too efficient for harvesting the stocks that will be available soon."
Marion Kaiser, the president of Aquanor Marketing in Boston, which imports fish from Iceland and Norway, said that stringent regulations in those countries have brought "a stunning recovery to their fisheries."
Congress is currently considering a one-year moratorium along some parts of the Atlantic coast on the use of super-trawlers, which are more than 350 feet long and can net as much as 250 metric tons of fish in a day.
But like many seafood lovers, Dr. Murawski said that a complete comeback of the native fisheries depends on a shift in public taste. Spiny dogfish, also called sand shark (the fish of fish and chips in England), is cheap, delicious and abundant, he said. So are mackerel, herring and whiting.
But the American taste in fish grew out of generations of eating only mild-tasting, white-fleshed varieties, so changing public taste is really a matter of changing habits. And habits die hard.
 
The Cautionary Tale of the Roughy
 AS the fishing industry searches the world for new fish, it is one thing to hope for a better environmental result this time and another to really believe in one. The history of the fishing industry gives one reason to pause.
"We need the imports to take the stress off the local fisheries," said Jasper White, the executive chef of Legal Seafoods in Boston. "But every solution to the fish riddle has a down side. The imports hurt the local fisherman and also run the risk of extinguishing entire species in other parts of the world. Look what happened to orange roughy."
In 1979, when domestic flounder was becoming more difficult to find, a treasure trove of roughy was discovered near the Challenger Plateau off New Zealand. Roughy, a firm, white-fleshed fish that can weigh as much as 20 pounds, is almost interchangeable with large flounder in the kitchen.
Before roughy started being filleted and frozen at sea and groomed for the American market, the fish was known as slimhead. Repackaged as orange roughy at about $2 a pound frozen or $8 a pound fresh, it became the American fish of the 1980's.
So quickly was roughy sucked out of the sea that as much as 80 percent of the population was wiped out before scientists realized that the fish, which lives up to 100 years, takes more than a quarter of a century to reach sexual maturity.
New Zealand took immediate action and strictly limited how much roughy could be caught. Scientists say that they now believe that the population has been restored to 60 percent of what it was before the boom, and that they expect it to be completely restored in a few years. New Zealand's fisheries are now considered among the best managed in the world.
"The right fish and the right marketing campaign can create a voracious appetite in America," said Marion Kaiser, the president of Aquanor Marketing in Boston, which imports farmed salmon, Arctic char and Icelandic cod. "We don't have to work to sell high-quality imported fish to Americans," she said. "We have to work to buy and sell responsibly."
 
ROUGET ESCABECHE
Adapted from "Fish and Shellfish" (James Peterson, Morrow, 1996)
Total time: 15 minutes, plus marination
 
 6 8-ounce fillets of rouget (red mullet)
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
 1/2 cup flour
 7 tablespoons olive oil
 1 red onion, thinly sliced
 2 cloves garlic, peeled
 2/3 cup sherry vinegar
 2 bay leaves
 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
 6 baby artichokes, trimmed and quartered
 1 fennel bulb, sliced
 1/2 cup green olives, pitted.
 
 1. Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper, and dust lightly with flour. Warm two tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet and saute 3 fillets over high heat 2 minutes on each side. Carefully remove the fish, transfer to a nonreactive dish and pat dry. Repeat with the 3 remaining fillets.
 2. Wipe out the saute pan, add 1 more tablespoon olive oil and cook the red onion and garlic over medium-low heat about 7 minutes. Add the vinegar, bay leaves and thyme and simmer 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the parsley and cook 1 minute. Pour this mixture over the fish and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.
 3. Before serving, steam artichokes until soft, about 10 minutes. Put 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saute pan and cook sliced fennel over medium-low heat until soft, about 7 minutes. Toss artichokes and fennel with the olives and serve alongside the marinated fish.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Against the Mark, But It Falters in Yen Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned in a mixed performance yesterday, helped by a rebounding United States stock market and hurt by a sharp widening in the American trade deficit.
The announcement of an economic recovery plan for Japan and a reduced outlook for higher interest rates in Germany also created cross-currents for currency traders. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7896 German marks, up from 1.7725 on Monday. But the dollar slipped to 120.82 Japanese yen from 121.16. The British pound also rose against the dollar, climbing to $1.6353 from $1.6340.
The Government reported that the United States trade deficit widened to $10.4 billion in August, a bigger gap than expected. But while the flow of dollars out of the United States to buy foreign goods held down the dollar, rising stocks made dollars attractive to international investors. The Dow Jones industrial average, up 74 points on Monday, added 139 yesterday to regain the ground lost at the end of last week.
The dollar was also helped by a slowdown of the growth in Germany's money supply in September. The currency markets took this to mean that the German central bank, under an anti-inflation policy of holding down growth of the money supply, would be less inclined to raise its interest rates again.
The dollar rose after the release of these data despite another report, from Germany's Ifo economic institute, that business confidence rose by more than expected in September. That report would appear to bolster the view that further increases in rates, which could support the mark against the dollar, might be needed.
The dollar fell against the yen after Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party presented proposals aimed at lifting Japan's flagging economy. Though the plan did not lay out any specific measures for fiscal stimulus, it did emphasize deregulating the economy and reforming taxes. A bigger factor in the yen's gain may have been the rise in the United States trade deficit, however.
Claude LaMedica, foreign exchange trader at Republic National Bank in New York, said that he expected the dollar to rise against the yen over time in reaction to severe economic problems across the developing economies of the Far East.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Retreat Sharply On Fears Supplies Will Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures fell sharply yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, reversing days of gains amid perceptions that increased production and slack Asian demand would lead to a glut.
On other markets, grain and soybean futures rose sharply on concern that world demand would cause the fall harvest to dwindle rapidly. Natural gas futures jumped to nine-month highs as forecasts for colder weather in parts of the Northern United States increased demand. 
 Copper futures prices have tumbled in recent months as the Asian buying that buoyed the market early this year abruptly slowed to a trickle while the region grapples with a currency crisis. The financial problems have slowed construction; copper is used for wiring and plumbing.
Market participants have been encouraged by falling inventories in the last week on the London Metal Exchange, but supplies remain far above levels of a year ago and the Asian crisis could depress prices for the next six months, said William O'Neill, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Copper also retreated after Chile reported that a state-owned copper refinery, Chuquicamata No. 3, had returned to 100 percent production several days earlier than expected. A weekend fire had cut production to 85 percent of capacity at the refinery, which produces 690,000 tons of copper cathode annually.
Copper for December delivery fell 2.05 cents, to 94.90 cents a pound.
Grain and soybean futures prices rose sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations that export demand soon would begin to cut into ample American inventories.
"They know demand is already starting to build, and people are afraid they're going to be left at the gate when the market takes off like they know it will," said Doug Hjort, an analyst at the farm marketing advisory firm Hjort & Associates.
December wheat rose 5 1/2 cents, to $3.76 a bushel; December corn rose 4 1/2 cents, to $2.87 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 3 3/4 cents, to $6.94 3/4 a bushel.
Natural gas futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange as forecasts for below-normal temperatures in the Northeast and the Midwest lifted demand. November natural gas settled up 1.4 cents at $3.404 for each 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Labor Department Focuses on 401(k)'s

BYLINE: Dow Jones

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The Labor Department wants to know what employers are doing to keep down the costs to their workers of 401(k) plans, Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said today.
Fees for 401(k) plans are a front-burner issue for the department, Ms. Herman said at a meeting of the Erisa Industry Committee, which represents large employers with benefit plans. 
 The Labor Department will hold a daylong hearing on the topic next month, Ms. Herman said. In addition to considering what employers are doing to keep fees down, the hearing will look at whether employees realize how much they are paying.
Ms. Herman acknowledged that employees who invested their 401(k) savings in stock funds had not done badly in recent years. But stock market gains and a strong economy have not helped all Americans, she said. Wage increases have been modest and pension benefits remain out of reach for many, she said, and with widespread layoffs, job security is too low for many workers' comfort.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
30-Year Bond Extends Gain; Others Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday as comments from four Federal Reserve officials did little to ease investor uncertainty over whether the central bank would raise interest rates at its November policy-making meeting.
The 30-year bond rose 5/32, to a price of 99 18/32, extending its rebound from losses last week. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, eased to 6.41 percent, from 6.42 percent on Monday. But some shorter-term maturities fell in price.
dr 
 Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., said the market seesawed within a narrow range, influenced mostly by Fed comments that pushed prices one way or another.
He said many participants were awaiting the release next week of the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index for the third quarter as well as Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. Both events could provide some insight into whether inflationary pressures are rising.
Comments from Mr. Greenspan's subordinates did little to resolve uncertainty over the Fed's intentions.
Alice M. Rivlin, the Fed vice chairwoman, said the central bank must be on guard to prevent the economy from overheating, the Market News Service reported. Jack Guynn, president of the Atlanta Fed, said at the University of Tennessee that the central bank was determined "not to let ourselves lose the gains we've made on inflation." The San Francisco Fed's president, Robert T. Parry, said in Twin Falls, Idaho, that the economy was slowing to a moderate pace. And the Richmond Fed's president, J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., said in Rocky Mount, N.C., that the economy was doing well and suggested strong growth would push prices higher.
Early in the session the bond market weakened slightly after the Government reported that the August trade deficit widened to an eight-month high because of record imports, suggesting continued solid domestic demand.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, said she expected further volatility in the market ahead of the Employment Cost Index report next Tuesday and Mr. Greenspan's testimony next Wednesday.
Scott F. Grannis, a director and chief economist at Western Asset Management in Pasadena, Calif., noted that the long-bond yield was still bumping along at levels roughly 20 basis points higher than the lows achieved earlier this month. He attributed the increase to renewed investor anxiety about inflation.
Mr. Grannis also said the absence of any clear inflation evidence suggested that the Fed might not raise rates, laying the basis for a possible rally. "Today's lower bond prices represent an attractive buying opportunity in our view," he said.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Rose as China Swelled Gap During August

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit widened in August to $10.4 billion, driven substantially by a record imbalance with China, the Commerce Department reported today.
The release of the report, which shows the United States deficit with China at $5.2 billion, the most of any nation, comes a week before President Jiang Zemin of China arrives in Washington on his first state visit. The strong American economy and a higher dollar have swelled imports, including a tide of Chinese toys and Christmas decorations. 
 "There is no question," William M. Daley, the Secretary of Commerce, told reporters today, referring specifically to China, "that the mounting trade deficit remains a major concern for this Administration."
Imports rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to $88.32 billion, a record. Exports also rose to a record, but at $77.96 billion, up two-tenths of 1 percent, expanding the deficit by $400 million, to the widest since January.
Most analysts expect the gap for the full year to surpass the eight-year high of $111 billion set in 1996.
While the August deficit was wider than expected, economists said the report did little to change their view of business activity, other than trim estimates of total output for the third quarter.
But the trade figures may aggravate political problems for the Clinton Administration.
The White House is struggling to find enough Congressional support to win enhanced authority, or a fast track, for negotiating trade agreements. And President Clinton is to meet here with the Chinese President at a time when trade is a prominent sticking point between the two countries.
Insisting that "our exports have got to grow," Mr. Daley, the Commerce Secretary, said he expected that a Chinese buying mission that had just arrived in the United States would place orders for telecommunications equipment, environmental technology, energy equipment and an expected $4 billion worth of Boeing Company airplanes. Such purchases would make a huge, if temporary, dent in the trade deficit with China.
The United States deficit with China jumped 10.6 percent in August, today's report showed, with the category that includes toys and holiday decorations accounting for about half the increase.
But since figures for trade flows between two countries are not adjusted for recurring seasonal variation, analysts said China did not necessarily account for half the $10.4 billion overall American deficit.
By contrast, the American deficit with Japan -- often the biggest of any country -- narrowed to $4.5 billion from $5.2 billion, the first shrinkage since May. This occurred despite a slight rise in imports of Japanese motor vehicles and parts.
But on an annual basis the Japanese imbalance was still running 17 percent higher than the comparable 1996 pace, a situation that also drew the Administration's attention. Mr. Daley, noting a 1997 decline in American exports to Japan, said that while this was not surprising in light of the economic doldrums there, "we must continue to press for further deregulation, additional market opening and full implementation of our trade agreements with Japan."
Analysts tend to see the deficit with Japan as the more worrisome, partly because China's overall trade position is in relative balance while Japan ran an $8.8 billion merchandise surplus in September. Moreover, relatively little of Chinese imports to this country displaces American production.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, said today that the overall trade deficit "continues at a high and modestly increasing level" and predicted this trend would extend into next year.
"We're beginning to see the full effects of the stronger dollar," he said.
Exports, today's report showed, were paced by the first increase of the year in sales of American farm products and by a lesser rise in exports of industrial supplies and materials.
The biggest portion of the higher imports consisted of computer accessories and other capital goods followed by industrial supplies and materials. Analysts commented favorably on the fact that this appeared to reflect a process of expanding the supply of goods rather than of consumption.
The deficit with Canada widened by $300 million, to $1.6 billion, while exports to Mexico and imports from Mexico both hit records while leaving the deficit unchanged at $1 billion.

HEADLINE: Bull Market's Glitter May Be Blinding Investors

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
It was less than a week ago that stock investors fretted about the possibility of a huge decline as the 10th anniversary of the Oct. 19, 1987, crash approached. But the real concern may be whether investors have become too giddy.
A recent survey of mutual fund investors would suggest so, raising the possibility they may be laying the basis for a major disappointment. 
 The survey by Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco found investors expected an average annual return of 34 percent over the next 10 years, a figure that shocked many financial advisers because it is so far above historical averages.
"People have become completely enamored of the stock market; there's a love affair with it," said Raymond DeVoe, a market strategist at Legg Mason. "There is this total blind belief that the market can do no wrong."
That kind of bullish sentiment was clearly at work yesterday, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose sharply for the second consecutive session, up 139 points, or 1.75 percent, to close at 8,060.44.
Strong earnings reports from I.B.M. and Microsoft -- technology bellwethers that represent the old breed and the new -- helped touch off a rally that also sent broader measures higher.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surged 16.67 points, or 1.74 percent, to 972.28, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 27.09 points, or 1.61 percent, to 1,712.54.
For the Dow, the gains of yesterday and Monday erased the nearly 200 points lost last week when the market tumbled just as it was nearing the anniversary of the crash a decade ago. Rebounds like that inspire confidence, analysts said.
But what few investors know is that despite the outsized gains of recent years, the last 30 years have actually produced below-average returns, when adjusted for inflation. In other words, the great bull market that began in 1982 has not yet been powerful enough to undo the damage done in the previous 15 years, which included the bear market of 1973-74.
For some Wall Street analysts who lived through less exalted times, therein lies a lesson: beware first-time investors. Although these may be extraordinary times, history suggests that long-term stock market returns are much tamer, and so it is unlikely that stocks will continue to rise at this torrid pace.
In fact, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered just such a warning two weeks ago, when he cautioned investors that it would be "unrealistic" to expect stock returns to keep rising at the current rate.
For the last three years, the market has done little wrong. Few investors have suffered since the sharp increase in prices that helped send the Dow to gains of 33 percent in 1995, 26 percent in 1996 and 25 percent so far this year.
Never before has the Dow had three consecutive years with gains of 20 percent or more. Logical Information Machines, a research concern in Chicago, said that the current three-year run was one of the greatest of all time.
Those kinds of returns bolster optimism. Earlier this year, the Montgomery survey showed investors expected annual returns of about 22 percent over the next 10 years, compared with 34 percent in the most recent tally.
At a 34 percent pace, the Dow average would exceed 120,000 in the year 2007. That is assuming a dividend yield of about 3 percent, which is well above current prices.
Is such a gain likely? Theodore Aronson at Aronson & Partners, a money management firm based in Philadelphia, said the best 10-year run for the Dow average was 17.1 percent, in the period ending in June 1959. What does Mr. Aronson think of those who are expecting a 34 percent return? "They must have polled the loony bin," he said.
Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, is gentler. He cautioned investors not to get too excited.
His studies show that after inflation, stocks achieve an average annual return of about 7 percent, going all the way back to 1802. In spite of wars, social upheavals and and other bumps on the road of history, stock returns tend to settle at that level.
"The long-run return is always the same, about 7 percent," Mr. Siegel said. "I've found this remarkable stability over time."
In the last 30 years, however, stock returns have trailed slightly, he said. The average stock return from 1966 to 1997 was about 6.03 percent compounded annually, nearly a percentage point below the historical average of 6.99 percent, after inflation.
In mid-1967, for instance, the Dow stood at 860.25. And 15 years later, in mid-1982, it stood at 811.94 -- a loss of nearly 6 percent, but much more when inflation is factored in.
Why take note of such figures? Because many investors are too optimistic, analysts say, and the higher the expectation, the greater the possibility that some will be scared out of the market during a sudden downturn.
"We have a stock market that's full of virgins," said Ron Chernow, a financial historian and author of "The Death of the Banker."
"They've had a very atypical experience in the market; it's had this very pleasant attitude of going up all the time," he said. "So we don't know how they'll behave during downturns."
Because so many of the nation's financial assets are locked up in the stock market, almost automatically, through 401(k) retirement plans, Mr. Chernow said he believed the market might be secure from a huge collapse.
But like other analysts and historians, he worries that the kind of crowd psychology that has driven prices ever higher could reverse course and depress a whole generation of first-time investors.

Experts caution that the market's long bull run, which began in 1982, may be inspiring undue optimism on the part of investors. But, taking a longer view, the market may just be making up lost ground, as over the last 30 years it has lagged its historical performance.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
The American Airlines pact with Asiana is part of a strategy to increase a Pacific Rim presence.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere

 BODY:
AMERICAN AIRLINES' new code-sharing and frequent-flier partnership with Asiana Airlines -- which is based in Seoul, South Korea -- is part of a long-range strategy by the Dallas-based carrier to heighten its presence in the Pacific Rim.
American, a unit of AMR and a powerhouse in the United States and Latin America, has been seeking -- so far unsuccessfully -- to join forces in Europe with British Airways since June 1996. It has historically been a minor player in Asia, especially compared with Northwest Airlines and UAL's United Airlines. Both Northwest and United have major hubs at Narita Airport in Tokyo that allow them to serve multiple points in the region; Northwest has been flying extensively to Asia since 1947, while United bought Pan Am's trans-Pacific operation in 1985. 
 American has no comparable hub capability in Tokyo and currently only flies there from Seattle, Dallas, and San Jose, Calif. It has resisted setting up its own point-to-point operation from cities in the United States to other cities in Asia, said James Beer, managing director of international planning, because it "hasn't made economic sense with the equipment that was available."
The best way for American to offer trans-Pacific service to the highly lucrative business travel market has been to strike cooperative code-sharing and frequent-flier agreements with Asian airlines, which in turn find the feed traffic from American highly desirable.
In addition to Asiana, American has struck code-sharing and frequent flier-pacts with China Airlines of Taiwan, Singapore Airlines and Qantas; it also has frequent-flier agreements with Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Code-sharing agreements are also pending with Philippine Airlines and China Eastern Airlines.
"We want to build a network in Asia with some of our own flights and with alliances with others, to build a competitive passenger services network," Robert L. Crandall, chairman of American, said last week.
In the longer term, Mr. Beer said American might well deploy some of the 12 Boeing 777's it will receive between 1999 and 2000 on routes to Asia. The carrier is also seeking authority to fly the Chicago-Tokyo route in the United States' current bilateral negotiations with Japan, and it is conducting discussions about further cooperation with other Asian airlines to fill the gap in service in Southeast Asia, Mr. Beer said.
 
Travel Deal in Asia
One way to travel inexpensively through Asia today is to purchase Cathay Pacific's All Asia Pass, available only to individuals who have registered on the carrier's Web site (www.cathay-usa.com). Priced at $999, including all taxes, the pass is good for round-trip economy-class travel from either Los Angeles or New York to Hong Kong, plus unlimited economy-class travel to 17 other cities in Asia. There are seven-day minimum- and 30-day maximum-stay requirements, and all travel must be completed by Dec. 15.
Cathay Pacific officials said the promotion was created to stimulate traffic, which has dropped substantially since the July 1 handover of the Hong Kong Government to China.
 
Hotel Update
Hyatt Hotels and Resorts has consolidated details of all current promotional offers at its 107 hotels and resorts in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean into a program called Hyatt Extras, and is offering these data through a special telephone number (888-584-1234) and on its Web site (www.hyatt.com).
The ITT Sheraton Corporation has expanded its program that allows guests to check in at 9 A.M. and out at 5 P.M. to all guests who pay eligible rates and sign up at registration for its frequent-guest plan. Previously, the program was offered only to those who had previously been members of the plan.
Orient Express, a unit of Sea Containers Ltd., has opened a new, 120-room, Mediterranean-style luxury hotel near the zoo in Johannesburg, South Africa. The hotel, which features a spa, gym, five pools and two restaurants, is offering introductory rates, through Nov. 30 and from Feb. 1 to April 30, 1998, of $160 for a single and $200 for a double.

Worldthink Inc.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Why should professional opinion-mongers be the last to cash in on globalization?
Here we see the once-Big Eight accounting firms amalgamating into the Big Two. Gone are the worries about conflicting client interests; the new giant will handle Coke and Pepsi and profess not to tip their secrets to Dr. Brown's Diet Cel-Ray. 
 As that trend continues, the walls between advertisers will collapse, as the new hyperagency of Burnett, Thompson, Grey & Rubicam find no headache in simultaneously selling Tylenol, Excedrin and Advil and pretending to compete.
For competition means stress, and stress is seen to be evil. To avoid creating gastric acids among investment bankers, superbanker Goldman Salomon Barney will manipulate a merger among the Seven Sisters of oil with Russia's Gazprom monopoly.
Law firms will surely follow the trend set by single-bean accountancy and the superbankers going into the supertank. Where is it written, except in archaic ethics rules, that one huge agglomeration of attorneys (Jones, Baker, Skadden, Cravath & Case) cannot handle both sides in a civil dispute? Consider the efficiencies in having big-name criminal defense lawyers become "of counsel" to the local U.S. attorney.
This surge of corporate centripetalism is bottomed on the supposed need to compete on a global basis. Thus is competition squelched in the name of competition.
It's time that pundits got with the program. Hence my proposal for the creation of Worldthink Inc., the opinion superstore chain.
Surely if all the carriers of telecommunication can jack up stock prices to gobble up each other, we content-providers (formerly writers) can join forces, assemble our intellectual power, pool our marketable celebrity and earn the decent respect of the opinion of mankind while becoming multibillionaires.
Skeptics will ask: Wouldn't Worldthink Inc. reduce competition in the marketplace of ideas?
Just the opposite; the conglomeration of columnists will stimulate intercontinental argument, which, as is well known, is in danger of domination from group-thinking New Europeans and econo-cultural combines of bright-burning Asian tigers.
Isn't it time America marshaled the Sunday forces of Cokie Roberts, Tim Russert, Bob Schieffer and Sam Donaldson to combat the challenge from Rupert Murdoch's skyviews and the lockstep mind-bending of Russia's media oligarchy?
Can't the multicultural multinationals making obsequious deals with China's thought-controllers be countered by our food-fighting McLaughlinites, our fair-minded Lehrerites, our Capital Gangsters?
If the entire punditry dodge owned stock in the same company, we would be forever locked in immortal combat. Ownership of inflatable Worldthink stock would stimulate us to differ fiercely and entertainingly.
Controversy sells; or, as the younger pundits say in their vivid vernacular, objectivity sucks. On a dull day, David Broder and I can rail at each other about the media-government revolving door, or Mary McGrory can wake up the page with a pop at Nixon's ghost. Nobody dares take on profoundly commonsensical Meg Greenfield, but Maureen Dowd and The New Yorker's Tina Brown have developed a deliciously adversarial relationship.
As shareholders in Worldthink Inc., minds as contrary as Charles Krauthammer and Richard Cohen, or Al Hunt and Robert Novak, would have the same vested interest in sustaining interest. Intellectual jousting is thereby guaranteed, and consistency of Weltanschauung enforced; one could not be pro-Nafta- enlargement and anti-NATO-enlargement, or anti-Clinton and pro-Gore, without derision from cognitively consonant peers.
But what happens, investors may ask, when the worm turns? In a few years, the cry from overseas will be "Break up the Yankees!" The pendulum will swing, as it did against mindless conglomeration in the 80's, and "multi" will become a dirty prefix. The rush will be on to hire "niche" professionals who don't represent competitors.
Then we content-providers will spin ourselves off, as Worldthink splits into smithereens and Individualism Inc. becomes the hot stock. Make another fortune.

HEADLINE: Russia and France Balk at U.S. Plan to Punish Iraq Even More

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Despite the personal intervention of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the United States is meeting sustained resistance in the Security Council to its plan for imposing new sanctions on Iraq, diplomats on the Council said today.
With a vote on the issue likely to take place in the next few days, the United States is trying to negotiate a compromise that would leave the threat intact but postpone the date the additional sanctions would be applied. 
 The Clinton Administration, unable to win approval for new sanctions now, is arguing for an automatic start for the new measures in six months unless the Iraqi Government significantly improves its accounting of prohibited weapons systems and cooperates fully with United Nations arms inspectors.
The United States, supported by Britain and more than half a dozen other Council members, would like to restrict the international travel of high Iraqi officials because of President Saddam Hussein's continuing failure to tell the truth about chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles. There are also some outstanding questions about Iraq's nuclear program. Furthermore, Iraqi officials have been interfering with the work of the United Nations inspectors.
Iraq has threatened to stop all cooperation with the weapons inspections if new sanctions are imposed.
Opposition to the new sanctions on Iraq, which has been under a near-total economic embargo since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, comes primarily from Russia and France, which have hopes of large future business deals with Baghdad, a leading oil exporter before its attempt to seize Kuwait.
Bill Richardson, the United States representative at the United Nations, met today with the Russian representative, Sergei Lavrov. Mr. Lavrov said after the meeting that there had been no change in the Russian position.
But Calvin Mitchell, spokesman for Mr. Richardson, said this evening that there had been "some progress on the language of the text," and that technical aides to the American and Russian envoys continued their talks into the evening.
French officials say that they are not suggesting that the new measures may not have to be applied at some point, and that they are not trying to reduce sanctions in any way. What they object to, they say, is placing the burden of deciding whether or not to impose the travel ban on the leader of the monitoring operation in Iraq, Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission.
Mr. Butler is due to make his next report to the Council in April. The French would like the Security Council to review it and act if necessary, not to sit back and watch sanctions go into effect automatically if Iraq is reported not to be in full compliance, as the Americans are demanding.
Today, Egypt joined the Russians and French in opposing the additional sanctions. Egypt, along with other Arab and African nations, also opposes continued sanctions on Libya, which the United States and Britain accuse of fostering international terrorism, in particular the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland in 1988.
Egypt, a Security Council member, cannot veto the sanctions, however, because it does not hold a permanent seat.
In Paris and New York, French and American diplomats said that discussions between Ms. Albright and the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, were still going on. Secretary of State Albright has also been in contact with the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny Primakov. Her entreaties appear not to have changed any minds, however.
The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said on Monday that a lot of give and take was to be expected, a lesson he and Ms. Albright had learned when she was the American representative at the United Nations.
"The negotiating process in the Security Council is designed to achieve an objective," he said at the daily State Department briefing. "The objective is the strongest possible result. Sometimes that means starting out stronger than you know you can get with the maximum number of votes. So you may be watching the diplomatic effort unfold, but we are not walking back from our original objective, which is to get the strongest possible Council action to achieve Iraqi compliance."

HEADLINE: Needed: Planet Insurance

BYLINE: By Alan S. Blinder; Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton, was a vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
An American team in Bonn is deep in negotiations that, it is hoped, will lead to the signing of an international treaty on global warming in Kyoto, Japan, in December. Such a treaty would define the responsibilities of roughly 170 nations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. President Clinton, who is scheduled to outline his policy on global warming today, must walk a fine line, balancing the concerns of environmentalists who worry about the fate of the earth and those of business and labor constituencies who worry about the fate of their companies and jobs.
But on what basis should the President strike that balance? The typical economic approach to such problems is cost-benefit analysis. But there is a big problem with applying that tool here. While we have some ability to quantify the costs of policies intended to retard global warming, we have little basis for estimating the benefits. The scientific consensus takes us only so far. Yes, global warming is for real. Yes, burning fossil fuels seems to be a significant cause. And yes, most potential climatic consequences are worrisome -- and some are truly horrifying. But scientists cannot tell us how the earth's climate will change if nothing is done. 
 So I suggest a different approach: Instead of weighing costs against benefits, it makes more sense to look at action against global warming as taking out an insurance policy. This is what homeowners do, spending hundreds of dollars every year to insure their families against the unknown, though presumably small probability that their house will burn down. Shouldn't the family of man do the same for its home?
As we shop for this global insurance policy, we should seek the most economical one. We can drastically reduce its cost by applying four basic economic principles:
* Market-based approaches work more efficiently than clumsy command-and-control techniques. The leading candidate in this case seems to be distributing or auctioning permits to emit, say, carbon dioxide, and then allowing free-market trading to establish their price. By now we have enough experience with emissions trading to predict that it will reduce pollution at a fraction of the cost of regulation. The President is expected to emphasize these kinds of incentives to reach his goals. It is time that the rest of the world got on board.
* Global problems require global perspectives and responses. It makes sense to reduce carbon emissions where that can be done most cheaply. We should therefore explore innovations like global emissions trading and allowing American companies to "buy" emissions reduction in other countries, although both are fraught with practical difficulties. It is important that all countries get involved. We cannot hold developing nations to the same standards as developed ones, but their eventual participation is essential.
* Haste makes waste. It's cheaper to engineer new products for energy efficiency than it is to retrofit old ones. That means we can greatly lower the costs of reducing carbon emissions if we allow our existing transportation fleet, factories, home heating systems and especially power-generating plants to wear out rather than scrapping them. We can afford such patience because it is the accumulated concentration of greenhouse gases that affects global temperatures, not the annual output of emissions. For these reasons, the much-debated target of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, as enunciated at the 1992 summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, is too demanding. It would be more prudent to start slowly, then gradually grow more strict. We need to emulate the tortoise, not the hare.
* Reducing reliance on fossil fuels is not an anti-growth policy. It is an insurance policy against climatic disruptions that could severely damage the world's economies. We do not want people to turn off the heat and turn in their cars. We do need to make fossil fuels more expensive. But any revenues raised from, say, auctioning emissions permits should be promptly returned to the economy via tax cuts, research and development spending, and compensating victims (for example, coal miners).
These four principles do not constitute an instruction manual for American negotiators in Bonn. Nonetheless, accepting them would represent a giant step toward banishing both Chicken Little and Dr. Pangloss from the debate. Then we can get down to issues like how to design and enforce a global emissions trading system in the absence of any meaningful global government, and how to persuade developing nations to participate.
No, the sky is not falling; it is just filling up with greenhouse gases a bit too fast for comfort. But blithely assuming that nature and laissez-faire will take care of everything amounts to betting the earth's climate on a roll of the dice. If we lose the bet, our grandchildren will not likely forgive us. Nor should they.

HEADLINE: Citicorp Plans To Cut Payroll By 7,500 Jobs

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Citicorp said yesterday that it would eliminate a total of 7,500 jobs as it moves to cut costs and streamline operations in nearly 100 countries.
Citicorp, the second-largest bank in the United States, said it would actually shed 9,000 jobs, mainly in computer processing and operations. But it expected 1,500 of the affected employees to take new jobs elsewhere with the company, moving from local offices to facilities in South Dakota, Ireland, Texas, Singapore and other locations. 
 The result is to be an 8.3 percent reduction in Citicorp's overall work force. The cuts are not expected to have a major impact on the New York area because Citicorp has already moved most of its processing jobs out of the region.
"The most important reason we are doing this is competitive pressure is increasing," said Thomas E. Jones, the bank's principal financial officer. "Standardization of our back office not only lowers our costs, it brings us better control and likely better quality."
To cover the cost of severance payments and disposing of unneeded equipment and real estate, Citicorp said it would take a third-quarter pretax charge of $889 million.
As a result, Citicorp said that its third-quarter earnings fell by 45.3 percent, to $511 million. Excluding the charge, the bank's profits rose by 14 percent, to $1.07 billion. The bank's per-share earnings of $2.19, excluding the charge, exceeded analyst expectations by 5 cents. With the charge, Citicorp's per-share earnings for the quarter were $1.01.
Citicorp has been telling investors for months that it was developing a restructuring program. Still, the bank's shares jumped $5.3025, to $144.1875, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange after the program's scope was detailed.
Analysts praised the bank's effort, but noted that it was hoping to do a lot very quickly. "The crucial issue is execution," said Diane B. Glossman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. "The company has never done a comprehensive, enterprise-wide streamlining effort like this before."
In the last several years, Citicorp has consolidated many operating functions for its activities in the United States. For example, telephone calls from branch customers in New York and elsewhere are answered in Austin, Tex.
Now Citicorp, which operates in far more countries than any other bank in the world, wants to centralize operations in a handful of centers globally. For example, it hopes that its vast credit card processing center in Sioux Falls, S.D., will be able to keep track of charges for card accounts in 44 countries, from Spain to Singapore.
"The fact we have been so highly decentralized in the past has been a source of strength," Mr. Jones said. "The world is going more global and we cannot afford that luxury any more."
Savings from all these changes are expected to cover their cost within two years and ultimately save $750 million a year.
Citicorp, which had long prided itself on doing things its own way, said that it would also increasingly look to contract operating functions to other companies. For example, it will now buy automated teller machines from NCR, rather than build them itself.
About two-thirds of the restructuring charge applies to the bank's business with consumers -- credit cards, branch banking and private banking for the affluent. The rest applies to the trading and corporate banking areas.
These moves are being coordinated by Mary Alice Taylor, a former top official of the Federal Express Corporation who joined Citicorp in January to oversee all technology and operations.
The restructuring is part of a series of moves by Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, to build on a strategy that emphasizes the bank's worldwide reach. Eschewing acquisitions of either banks or brokers in the United States, Mr. Reed is focusing instead on building a global consumer brand, as well as international money transfers and local business lending in emerging markets.
Mr. Jones said that some of the savings from the layoffs would be used to expand such areas as banking on the Internet and business lending in emerging markets.
In the third quarter, Citicorp continued to be highly profitable, with a return on equity of 20.8 percent. Moreover, it is growing faster than many big banks, with revenue up 11 percent in the quarter from the corresponding period a year earlier. The rise of the dollar did knock nearly $90 million off its pretax income, Mr. Jones said.
Earnings for consumer banking were up only 4 percent, to $481 million, dragged down by rising credit card losses.
While credit card losses were higher than a year ago, the loss rate of 5.58 percent of loan balances declined from 6.13 percent in the second quarter of this year, the first decrease since 1994. The bank said that the number of credit card accounts in the United States declined by 3 percent.
Mr. Jones said it was too soon to predict whether losses on credit cards would continue to decline, and he said that Citicorp had chosen to remain cautious in this market.
Earnings for corporate banking increased 34 percent, to $689 million.
The turmoil in Southeastern Asian currencies during the quarter mainly benefited the bank, by raising trading volume, though it had some loan losses in Thailand.
More than a year ago, Citicorp began to worry about the economy in the region and began to slow its lending there. It also transferred to Hong Kong and Singapore some top executives who had previously run operations through the economic roller coaster in Latin America.
"There is criticism of Citicorp's exposure in emerging markets," Mr. Jones said. "We should get some credit for getting something right."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
ABB Will Cut 10,000 Jobs And Switch Focus to Asia

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 21

 BODY:
In one of the most striking examples yet of shifting global allegiances in business, the Swiss-Swedish engineering company ABB Asea Brown Boveri announced today that it would cut 10,000 jobs in Western Europe and the United States and invest in Asia instead.
The revamping will cost ABB $850 million and the impact is likely to be heaviest in Europe, where the company employs 102,000 workers and where this is likely to rank among the biggest single corporate retrenchments. Its American subsidiary, based in Norwalk, Conn., has businesses in many states and employs 23,000 people. 
 Company executives were exceptionally blunt today in saying that they would shift thousands of jobs from countries like Germany and Sweden to faster-growing markets in Southeast Asia and China.
The move provided a grim reminder that Europe's enduring problems with joblessness are far from over, even though economic data indicate that countries like Germany and France are poised for a significant recovery. As European companies increasingly embrace the hard-edged opportunism of American companies, they are coolly shifting capital to whichever part of the world offers the best prospects.
Many economists here believe that European unemployment will likely remain high even after recovery has taken hold. That is because the recovery largely results from a decline in the value of currencies like the German mark, which has made exports cheaper. The problem is that many countries still have high labor costs, high taxes and rigid workplace regulations.
"Our structural problems remain completely unsolved, and that means that structural unemployment is going to increase," said Hans Joachim Hass, chief economist at the German Association of Industry in Bonn.
ABB's cutback is far smaller than those imposed by many American companies. In 1995, for example, AT&T announced cuts of 40,000 people from its work force of 300,000.
But by European standards, the ABB cut is one of the biggest. Last year, the French automobile company Renault ignited huge protests when it said that a Belgian factory with 3,100 workers would close. Earlier this year, the Swedish household appliance manufacturer Electrolux announced plans to cut 12,000 workers. The recently merged steel mills in Germany of Krupp-Hoesch and Thyssen are expected to eliminate 7,000 jobs, through early retirement and other voluntary programs.
Unlike many steel mills and automobile companies that have endured big cutbacks in recent years, moreover, ABB's businesses in construction services, engineering and the manufacture of power generation equipment have not been that badly ravaged by global competition. But the company said that profits had been hurt by weak European demand and rising costs and that it would take an accounting charge of $850 million against earnings to cover future reorganization costs.
"Some of these actions will be difficult in the short term, but the issue is not going away on its own," said ABB's chief executive, Goran Lindahl, as he disclosed the company's latest earnings today in Zurich.
ABB said its nine-month profit slipped from $809 million last year to $774 million this year, and that sales had fallen from $23.5 billion to $22.6 billion. Much of that decline resulted from the rising value of the American dollar, because ABB reports results in dollars and its sales in local currencies translated to fewer dollars this year. But the company has said demand for its products in Europe remains sluggish.
ABB's announcements surprised many investors and the company's stock dropped sharply. ABB American depository receipts fell $7, to $126.50, in Nasdaq trading.
Beyond the 10,000 jobs to be cut, ABB will eliminate about 3,600 jobs at Adtranz, a manufacturer of railroad equipment co-owned by ABB and Daimler-Benz. Those cuts were announced on Monday.
This is not the first time ABB has undertaken such a strategic shift. In 1989, it bought more than 40 American companies for more than $3 billion, including the power distribution businesses of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Combustion Engineering Group. But in the last seven years, the company has steadily reduced its work force in the United States and Western Europe and increased its presence in Asia and the formerly Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: Chicago's Scandal Resume Lengthens

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Sometimes regarded as a finishing school for the penitentiary, the City Council recently passed a strict ethics code, a man-bites-dog case for Chicago politicians better known for sneering at good-government reformers, who are known here as "goo-goos."
But with the United States Attorney shooting fish in the barrel at City Hall -- eight current or former aldermen, along with the Cook County Treasurer, have been variously charged with taking bribes, influence-peddling and extortion over the past three years -- something needed to be done. 
 Alderman Patrick Huels, the floor leader on the council for Mayor Richard M. Daley, was a sponsor of the ethics bill, a measure that vowed to clean up Dodge. Days passed, even weeks, without any new outbreaks of corruption at City Hall.
Now another big scandal has broken. It centers on Mr. Huels, the man behind the ethics legislation, who resigned today from the City Council after being accused of taking a $1.2 million loan from a company he helped win a city subsidy.
On top of that, council committees run by Mr. Huels and Alderman Edward Burke were said to have paid more than $600,000 in consulting fees to an executive of Mr. Huels's business. Alderman Burke, incidentally, had been a secretary of that business for five years.
"Although I am certain that I broke no laws," Mr. Huels said in his statement of resignation today, "I am equally certain that I exercised poor judgment in these matters."
 Traditionally, Chicagoans have tended to shrug off corruption, just as Alaskans shrug off the cold. But lately, it has seemed to be reaching a point of parody.
"Stop this shameful parade," declared the headline on a front-page editorial on Monday in The Chicago Sun-Times, the newspaper that broke the Huels story after its own investigation.
"Chicago cannot afford to be the City of Sleaze," the editorial said. It added: "There is more than pride at stake. Chicago cannot carry a venal reputation into the new century without losing national and world esteem, meaning fewer visitors, fewer conventions, lost contracts and lost jobs."
Over the past three years, it has become difficult to keep pace with the sting operations that have been directed at politicians at City Hall. One of them, Operation Silver Shovel, is targeted at those who took money for an illegal garbage dumping scheme. Another investigation, Haunted Hall, is centered on "ghost payrolling," in which politically connected people draw salaries for jobs that do not exist.
Despite the robust economy here, some civic leaders say such an image of corruption could tarnish Chicago's reputation as a good place to work or visit.
But then, it seems doubtful that people have ever been attracted to Chicago for its moral rectitude. Even a Roman Catholic Archbishop in Chicago, John Cardinal Cody, was the target of a Government investigation in the 80's that centered on the use of church money. (There was no prosecution, but the controversy plagued the Cardinal's final days.)
This is a city, after all, that not long ago named a tourist restaurant after Al Capone, a local boy who had a few scrapes with the law.
Before Mr. Huels's resignation, pressure had been building on Mayor Daley, who said he was "upset and mad and disappointed" with his floor leader, to force Mr. Huels from his committee chairmanship.
In recent cases of corruption at City Hall, many of those charged have been black. If Mayor Daley had not brought pressure on Mr. Huels, who is white, the appearance of unfairness could have hurt the Mayor with black voters, a group he has assiduously courted, with significant success. Mr. Daley, who has never been touched by any scandal, is expected to seek re-election in 1999.
There has been no comment on the case from the United States Attorney's Office.
Mr. Huels, who was a tight-lipped Alderman, grew up in the politically connected Irish neighborhood of Bridgeport, the same as Mayor Daley, and worked for the city as a tree-trimmer during summers while in college. He was a loyal soldier for the Democratic Regular Organization, known simply as The Machine, the powerful political system led by Mayor Richard J. Daley, the late father of the current Mayor.
At 26, Mr. Huels was appointed to the City Council, filling the spot vacated by Michael Bilandic, who became Mayor upon Mr. Daley's death in 1976. Mr. Huels was so closely guarded that even when he ran for alderman the first time, he did not hold a single news conference.
During Mr. Huels's high school days at De La Salle Institute, the Roman Catholic school attended by both Mayor Daleys, the yearbook printed his ambition: "To make a million before I'm 30 and to retire before I get a chance to work."
The trucking company for which Mr. Huels helped get the subsidy, and from which he took the $1.2 million loan, is owned by another Bridgeport boy, Michael Tadin.
Though some Chicagoans, and certainly the goo-goos, are aghast at the allegations being made against Alderman Huels and other politicians here, not everyone on the City Council sees anything wrong.
Alderman William Beavers, who usually opposes the Daley Administration, said he did not think that Mr. Huels had done anything untoward.
He added, "I wish I could find somebody who would give me a million-dollar loan."

 BODY:

European Engineering Giant Is Cutting 10,000 Jobs
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering company, is eliminating 10,000 jobs in Western Europe and the United States as part of an effort to focus more on the fast-growing economies of Asia. ABB said the revamping would cost $850 million.
Executives were blunt about the strategy shift, which will most heavily affect countries like Germany and Sweden, where labor costs are high. It was a sobering reminder that Europe's chronically high unemployment is unlikely to fall soon, despite evidence that much of the Continent is emerging from a prolonged economic slump. Page D2. 

No Higher ITT Bid, Hilton Says
Stephen F. Bollenbach, chief executive of Hilton Hotels, appeared to admit defeat in the 10-month struggle to take over ITT, saying he would not raise Hilton's bid in an effort to match a $9.8 billion offer by Starwood Lodging Trust. Still, Hilton's lower offer was left on the table. D5.

HEADLINE: Clinton Alters His Approach Over Warming

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Stung by complaints that it is moving too slowly against global warming, the Clinton Administration has devised a set of rewards for companies that cut emissions of heat-trapping gases faster than the Government would require under a pending international treaty.
The approach, to be outlined in a speech by President Clinton on Wednesday, is meant to mollify environmental groups and European nations that have been demanding deep, early cuts in emissions. The Administration has resisted those calls out of fear that aggressive action might cause too much economic pain. 
 Even as the White House wrestled with the details of its latest plan today, aides were testing its appeal among business and environmental groups whose support could be crucial to its success. Administration officials and people who had been briefed described the plan's outlines, but cautioned that important elements had still not been decided by Mr. Clinton.
The United States is under pressure to explain its approach this week, as negotiations resume in Bonn on a treaty to reduce the world's emissions of pollutants that are building up in the atmosphere and threatening to disrupt the planet's climate during the coming century.
Carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas, comes primarily from the burning of fossil fuels. With the economy booming and energy cheap, United States emissions have been accelerating.
The Administration's new approach has several elements, which include these:
*Energy producers and consumers that reduce emissions quickly would get credits, so that those moving fastest would benefit the most when, as the Administration envisions, the Government issues pollution permits that companies can buy and sell. This trading of pollution permits is the Administration's favored approach for letting the marketplace choose how to reduce emissions.
*Instead of a fixed deadline for reducing emissions, the United States would try to achieve its target within a few years on either side of a deadline. That would help to encourage companies to comply earlier.
*Tax incentives and subsidies, requiring Congressional approval, would also prompt companies to move more quickly.
The new approach would not substantially change the Administration's basic goal: to require in the new treaty that industrial nations emit no more of the gases in 2010 than they did in 1990.
The Administration is expected to propose at the talks in Bonn that industrial nations meet that target, as an average, during a multiyear period falling around 2010, probably during the period from 2008 to 2012. The Administration will also suggest that deeper reductions occur in later periods, perhaps a 5 percent cut below 1990's levels as 2020 approaches.
A White House official cautioned tonight that although President Clinton was attracted to the multiyear-average approach, he was concerned that the plan was too complicated and might have to be simplified.
By giving extra credit to those companies that lowered emissions fastest, the new approach would seek to put the United States, whose steadily growing emissions currently account for nearly a quarter of the world's output of greenhouse gases, on a downward slope as early in the 21st century as possible.
The initial reductions would be modest, but they would come soon. To meet the targets envisioned by the Administration, the United States would, as a practical matter, have to cut emissions by about 1 percent a year on average beginning in 1998.
To help reverse the current trend of growing emissions, the Administration would seek from Congress a package of about $5 billion in research spending, tax credits and other incentives for companies. This package would be in addition to the plan for pollution permit credits.
The Administration also wants to make sure that the deregulation of the electric utility industry does not lead to growing emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants that burn coal and other dirty fuels. Mr. Clinton is expected to address this issue as well in his new plan.
In drafting the speech that he is to deliver on Wednesday, at the National Geographic Society here, the President drew upon a set of options presented by senior economic and environmental aides last week. He basically took the most aggressive approach offered -- one that environmental groups had criticized as too weak -- and tried to strengthen it by providing more incentives for early action.
With the details still incomplete tonight, business and environmental groups that were told of the plan were reluctant to pledge their support.
"It could be viewed as a good minimum ante to put on the table in the negotiations" at Bonn, said Howard Ris, executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which favors deep cuts in emissions. "The President has clearly rejected the do-nothing approach."

HEADLINE: A New Kind of Veto Brings a New Way of Doing Business

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Heaven knows how many dams have been built, research grants awarded and Federal office buildings constructed over the years because lobbyists and Congressional staff managed to stick them into giant spending bills and because the projects were not so expensive that the President felt obliged to veto the entire legislation.
Now the rules have changed. For the first time in the nation's history, Congress has given President Clinton the authority this year to issue line item vetoes -- to veto specific spending and tax items without vetoing the bill as a whole. For lobbyists and lawmakers, this means that their pet projects may stand no chance if they are not cleared by the White House and its Office of Management and Budget. 
 "Government agencies and private entities are used to being able to lobby the two houses of Congress and get something into law," said Charles Black, who was a political adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush and is now a prominent lobbyist here.
"Now there's a third house, the Administration," Mr. Black continued. "O.M.B. will have to be contacted, and you'll have to get their approval for a special project. And depending on how conspicuous your project is, you may have to get approval at the White House too. We're counseling our clients this is what they'll have to do."
Mr. Black's view is widely shared on K Street, where many lobbyists have their offices. Last month more than 75 lobbyists paid $245 or $325 each (depending on how early they signed up) to attend a half-day seminar offered by Burson-Marsteller, the public relations and lobbying firm, called "The Line Item Veto: What You Need to Know, When You Need to Know It."
In an interview, Franklin D. Raines, the President's budget director, explained the new procedures this way: "The line item veto has elevated things to where projects that once got little scrutiny are subject to being analyzed by heads of departments, chairmen of committees, the White House and the press."
So far, President Clinton has been quite selective in how he has wielded his new authority. He has used the line item veto on six bills to reduce Federal spending by a total of $2 billion, only a tiny fraction of the overall cost of the measures.
In the $248 billion Defense Department appropriations bill, for instance, the President cut items worth only $144 million. In the $20 billion energy and water bill, one of the main vehicles for public works projects, he canceled eight projects worth only $19 million.
But already "the word is out," said a Senate staff member who insisted on not being identified, "that you can do things the old way and lose, or you can bring the White House in or the O.M.B. and maybe you'll get what you want."
One Senator who followed the latter course this month was Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. He learned on Oct. 8 that an $18 million research grant he favored was on a list of items President Clinton was considering striking from the Defense Department bill. The grant would promote development of a process called X-ray lithography that could enable computer chips to be made smaller. Eventually, suppliers in Connecticut could expect to benefit from this technology.
Over a day and a half, Mr. Lieberman wrote to Mr. Raines about the matter and called Jacob Lew, the deputy budget director. Members of Mr. Lieberman's staff called John H. Gibbons, the President's science director; Deputy Defense Secretary John J. Hamre, and officials on the President's National Economic Council. The project survived and is now law.
In a similar vein, Representative Scotty Baesler, Democrat of Kentucky, rolled into action when he learned from a lobbyist, Stephen Evered, that a $25 million appropriation to buy a particular kind of lock for safes containing classified documents was in jeopardy of being vetoed.
The only company that makes this kind of lock, Mas-Hamilton, is in Lexington, Ky., in Mr. Baesler's district. It has about 150 employees, and the special lock is a good part of its business.
Mr. Baesler telephoned Rahm Emanuel, the President's senior policy adviser, and the project was removed from the veto list.
But not all lawmakers who intervened at the White House succeeded in preventing a line item veto. For instance, two military projects in New Mexico -- construction of an air combat simulator at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, and repairs on the launching complex at the White Sands missile range -- were canceled despite the efforts of the state's two Senators, Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat, and Pete V. Domenici, a Republican.
The potential for the President to use his line-item-veto power for political purposes is enormous. For example, Mr. Clinton could agree not to veto pet projects of lawmakers whose votes he will need on legislation giving him expedited authority to enter into trade agreements.
Almost everyone who has studied the issue believes that if the line item veto survives a constitutional challenge, which could be resolved by the Supreme Court this term, Presidents will eventually use it for political leverage.
But so far, even Senator John McCain of Arizona, the most outspoken Republican critic of the way Mr. Clinton has used the line item veto, does not accuse the President of politicizing the process in this way. Mr. McCain's main complaint is that the President does not state in advance clear criteria for deciding which items to veto.
In at least one case, the line item veto seems to have backfired. In the budget for the new fiscal year that he sent Congress in February, Mr. Clinton asked for $46 million for a project to study a new fuel cell technology to convert oil and gas into electricity. The money was expected to be in the appropriations bill for the Interior Department.
Through a bit of Congressional prestidigitation, $1 million for a Vietnam veterans museum in Representative Sidney R. Yates's district in Chicago was shifted from the Defense Department bill to the Interior Department measure. In return, $6 million for Army research on the fuel cell technology program was shifted from the Interior Department appropriation to the Defense bill.
But the Clinton Administration apparently did not get wind of what was going on, and the President vetoed the $6 million item. Unless something unexpected happens, this means that the President will not get all the money he originally requested for the research.
In another case, Mr. Clinton himself rejected his staff's unanimous recommendation that he veto a $13 million appropriation for the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, moored in the Hudson River at West 46th Street in Manhattan.
As best as could be learned, no one in Congress mentioned the matter to the President. Zachary Fisher, the chief promoter of the museum and chairman of its board of trustees, is a generous campaign contributor, giving to Democrats and Republicans alike, but he gave no money to the President in last year's campaign.
Still, Mr. Clinton gave a campaign speech at the museum in May 1996 and apparently was impressed by it.
"We thought it was not sufficiently high priority to justify the expense," said Mr. Raines. But the President disagreed.
"He knew more about it than I did," Mr. Raines continued. "So who was I to argue?"

HEADLINE: Citizen Soros

 BODY:
In a season of grand philanthropic gestures, George Soros has now joined Ted Turner in announcing a munificent international gift. Mr. Soros will increase his Open Society Institute's activities in Russia by $300 million to $500 million over the next three years. That will more than double his current programs in Russia and easily exceed Washington's $95 million annual donation to Russia's civilian sector. The contribution adds to the $1.5 billion Mr. Soros has already given away overseas, the bulk of it to build civil society and independent media in formerly Communist countries.
Some Americans may quarrel with Mr. Soros and Mr. Turner for spending so lavishly on foreign causes when problems in America go untended. Mr. Turner pledged $1 billion to United Nations humanitarian programs. Mr. Soros's Open Society Institute finances innovative programs in the United States. The works that he and Mr. Turner support abroad may help prevent political upheavals in Russia and other countries that could cost Americans dearly in the years ahead. 
 Other examples of American political largess abroad are not so commendable. Often they support ethnic extremism. Irish-Americans have formed the economic base of the Irish Republican Army. A retired Florida doctor, Irving Moskowitz, has bought properties in Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and turned them over to right-wing groups eager to secure a Jewish presence there.
Mr. Soros's new donation will go to improving Russia's health care and education, and retraining Russian soldiers and officers for civilian jobs. The latter program could remove a major source of potentially destabilizing unrest in Russia's military.
There is a caution worth raising. Mr. Soros is not only Russia's biggest aid donor. He has also bought a nearly $1 billion stake in Svyazinvest, the privatized state telecommunications company. Mr. Soros has said that people might be confused by his dual role. He has not had to worry about possible conflict of interest in most of the countries where he gives money, in part because his support of civil society tends to infuriate autocratic governments. But in Russia, where he is both working with the Government and bidding on its companies, he must clearly separate his two roles.
It is always unsettling when a single private citizen wields so much influence in a strategically important country. Washington is fortunate that George Soros's foreign activities reflect American values.

RUTH W. MESSINGER
At a news conference with Robert B. Reich, the former Secretary of labor, Ms. Messinger criticized the job-creation record of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 "Over the last four years, New York City has ranked dead last among major cities in creating jobs. The unemployment rate in New York, which as the Secretary said is just pushing up toward double digits -- 9.5 percent -- is just about twice the unemployment rate in the nation. The gap between unemployment here, the percent of unemployment in New York and the percent of unemployment nationally, is the largest it has been since then Labor Department Secretary Reich started keeping statistics. Just yesterday, Forbes magazine announced its rankings of the best cities in the nation for small business. We came in No. 17 out of 22 cities ranked. I say that enough is enough. That we need to put New Yorkers back to work again, that we need an economic development policy that actually creates jobs for New Yorkers."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE ECONOMY;
Candidates Clash on Issue Of Job Loss and Creation

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended his job creation record yesterday as Ruth W. Messinger, joined by the former United States Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich, said the Mayor's administration had awarded tax breaks to corporations that have failed to keep jobs in the city.
Mr. Giuliani said his administration had fostered a climate that was friendly to business and had led to the creation of thousands of new jobs in four years. And his advisers said that while certain companies that had been given tax breaks had cut their payrolls, the administration's economic policies had led to an overall growth of jobs in the city. 
 "We haven't made up for all the things we have to make up for: the devastating damage of the Dinkins administration to our job base," Mr. Giuliani said. "But we've made up 170,000 of the 320,000 private-sector jobs they lost. There's 150,000 jobs to go just to catch up with the damage they did to us in 1990, '91 and '92 when we were losing jobs."
Standing in front of the News America Publishing building on Avenue of the Americas near 52d Street, the American headquarters of Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate, Ms. Messinger, the Democratic candidate in next month's mayoral election, returned to one of the main themes of her campaign. Under Mr. Giuliani's economic policies, she said, big corporations had benefited but the public "too often gets nothing or very little in return."
"Rather than invest in our future," she said, "rather than use the power of city government to create jobs and opportunity for all New Yorkers, Rudolph Giuliani squanders New York City's taxpayers' tax dollars on corporate welfare for his corporate friends, like this one, News America."
Ms. Messinger, who was joined by Hillary Rodham Clinton the night before, received the endorsement yesterday of Mr. Reich, Labor Secretary in President Clinton's first term. Mr. Reich, now a professor at Brandeis University, said that New York's economic recovery had been lopsided and that the "rich are far richer in New York than almost every other place in America."
"The question is what can New York do to make sure that this success is shared by all," Mr. Reich said. "It isn't good enough, folks. And Ruth Messinger is concerned about the people who may not be getting all of the benefits of this recovery."
Shortly after Ms. Messinger's comments, Randy L. Levine, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, flanked by Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, and several other business leaders in front of City Hall, defended the Giuliani administration's economic policies. He pointed to figures released yesterday by the State Labor Department showing 10,600 jobs created during September.
"Everything is working," he said. "The economy is in good hands. It's very clear now that we want to continue the job growth that Mayor Giuliani has created, where tourism is at record levels, Wall Street is going well."
The addition of the new jobs, all originating in the private sector, helped push down the city's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for September to 9.3 percent, from 9.5 percent in August, according to a report by Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi. Despite the figures, the city continued to suffer from one of the highest unemployment and lowest job growth rates of any metropolitan region in the country. Nationally, the unemployment rate for September remained unchanged at 4.9 percent.
At the heart of yesterday's disagreement over jobs is whether the tax breaks given to more than 30 big corporations have been good for the city. The Mayor's economic advisers said the companies contributed $1.3 billion in direct and indirect tax revenue annually; Ms. Messinger said nine of the companies, including News America, Viacom and Republic National Bank, had announced layoffs since receiving tax breaks.
In a study of the 13 largest companies that had received tax breaks totaling $258.1 million in exchange for keeping jobs in the city, Mr. Hevesi's office said last month that they had maintained or increased New York employment. But Mr. Hevesi added that if the companies failed to honor their commitments, the city might not know, because the Economic Development Corporation, which is charged with negotiating the tax breaks, has not followed up by monitoring the recipients' employment practices.
Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani also tried to improve his administration's relations with gay voters by issuing a letter stating that he will urge the City Council to pass legislation to extend to same-sex partners the same health and other benefits granted to spouses of city workers. Later in the day, the Empire State Pride Agenda, a lobbying group for gay causes that received the Mayor's letter, released a fax saying that it will not endorse a candidate in the mayoral election.
The Mayor began the day by greeting morning commuters getting off the Staten Island Ferry -- whose 50 cent-fare he eliminated in July. For most of the day, the Mayor worked on consolidating his support in Staten Island, where polls show him leading Ms. Messinger by a wider margin than in any other borough, as he paid visits to Guy Molinari, the Borough President, and to two senior centers.
At the Mount Loretto Senior Center in Tottenville, Mr. Giuliani threw himself into a throng of seniors, who greeted him warmly. Next to a table laden with biscotti, he improvised a dance with Helen Trapasso, 71, as Mr. Molinari sang, "It's amore."
Marion Gennusa, 74, said, "He's done so much for Staten Island. The next thing he needs to do is cut the toll on the Verrazano."
After her appearance with Mr. Reich, Ms. Messinger visited a soup kitchen and attended a town hall meeting in Jackson Heights, Queens.

Clinton to Propose New Emissions Standards
The Clinton Administration, stung by complaints that it is moving too slowly to fight global warming, has devised a set of rewards for those who cut emissions of greenhouse gases faster than required.

Fall in Jobless Rate For New York City

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York City fell last month to 9.3 percent from 9.5 percent in August, the State Department of Labor said yesterday.
The city's jobless rate -- which is still nearly twice the national rate of 4.9 percent -- has now declined by seven-tenths of a percentage point from the 10 percent peak that was reached earlier this year, the state said, as relatively strong job growth in the city has continued. 
 The statewide unemployment rate remained unchanged for the month at 6.4 percent. The statewide job numbers for September included about 12,000 people who were listed as not working in August because of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters strike at United Parcel Service. But even after that one-time increase in employment was factored out, state officials said that September was still a better than average month for new jobs.
The number of nonfarm jobs statewide rose by 23,300, or about 0.3 percent, during September, when adjusted for seasonal fluctuations. That was a faster rate of increase than the nation as a whole, which had an 0.2 percent increase in jobs in September. KIRK JOHNSON

HEADLINE: At High Point, Revivals and the 'Pottery Barn Look'

BYLINE: By LIZ SEYMOUR

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C.

 BODY:
IN a tailored chalk-stripe suit, Bill Blass looked out of place in the brightly lighted Pennsylvania House showroom. He was at the opening day of the International Home Furnishings Market to introduce a line of furnishings -- tables, chairs and beds, most under $3,000 -- that bear his name. Almost all were inspired by pieces from his own much-photographed home.
"I've collected for years," he said. "I saw other people coming out with furniture collections, and I finally thought, Why don't I do furniture?" 
 It makes a kind of sense. A fashion designer can earn double-digit royalties on a furniture group. The two most successful marriages of fashion and furniture -- Alexander Julian with Universal and Ralph Lauren with Henredon -- have been financial bright spots in the bleak $53.9 billion-a-year furniture industry. "There's a disconnect between consumers' life styles and what they see in furniture stores," said Ken Fonville, the president of Pennsylvania House. "There are people who are getting double-digit increases, and it's not full-line furniture stores."
But fashion names are not always the silver bullet -- note the quick exit of J. G. Hook and Laura Ashley from the furniture business. And the Bill Blass collection, with its sprayed finishes and machine carving, shows the inherent difficulty of translating haute couture antiques into ready-to-sell furniture.
But that doesn't keep companies from trying. Both Lane and Lexington introduced collections tied not to designers but to brands. The 150-piece Nautica collection at Lexington was a pastiche of English colonial styles in dark cherry and maple. Lane offered an outdoorsy 80-piece Eddie Bauer collection in pine with cherry veneer, including not only an armoire but also a "clocktail" table with a blown-up Eddie Bauer logo as the face of a giant clock under glass.
The skin-deep appeal of a recognizable name does not address the deeper desires of furniture buyers conditioned to nearly instant gratification. The success of Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel and Pier 1 was invoked constantly at the show by manufacturers whose growth has stalled as people simply stopped buying furniture at traditional stores. Of the 10 fastest-growing furniture retailers last year, only 2 were conventional full-line stores.
"You drive past a big new house at night, and you can see right through it because there isn't any furniture," said Jeff Young, the president of Lexington Furniture.
When there is furniture, it is likely to look "relaxed," the catchword of the show, which started on Oct. 16 and runs through Oct. 24. The influence of the "Pottery Barn look" was evident at almost every price and style level, from a reproduction of a Colonial Williamsburg sofa in nubby cotton at Baker Furniture to a barely there finish offered as an alternative to the high polish on Mark Hampton's very traditional pieces at Hickory Chair.
The clean lines of midcentury modern -- American and French -- were another powerful influence. Larry Laslo continued his Deco-inspired look for Directional with several new streamlined pieces, including a high-back chair upholstered in brown zebra stripes.
Bernhardt introduced a Paris collection, a 45-piece group inspired by French moderne designs. Jacques Grange was back with some 40's French-style additions to his line for John Widdicomb. Bexley Heath, John Widdicomb's sister company, offered reissues of elegant 1950's furniture designed by T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings, including a sculptural glass-top coffee table, while across the street Baker reintroduced classics from the Danish modern designer Finn Juhl, showcasing the Chieftain chair.
There was a hint of retro 80's in Mitchell Gold's low-slung sofa with skinny arms and little black legs. "Five years ago, you couldn't sell a straight-arm sofa," Mr. Gold said. "Now people are ready for a cleaner look."
The return of even retro modern could be taken as a hopeful sign. "When the economy is better, you see more contemporary, because people are willing to take a risk," said Michelle Lamb, a trend forecaster. Likewise, the return of color was hailed as a sign of optimism; after years of a largely oatmeal-on-oatmeal palette, melony oranges, pale green, aqua and lemon-custard yellow are slipping back.
But the most upbeat news is coming out of a handful of innovative companies that are busy and are speeding up delivery schedules. Leathertech, a six-year-old company that makes leather furniture designed by Vladimir Kagan, Jena Hall and John Mascheroni, among others, uses computers to cut deliveries to two weeks. Mitchell Gold, reporting a sales increase of nearly 80 percent over last year, has a quick-ship program for smaller dealers that gets them the goods in five days.
Ivan Lacroix, vice president of Baronet, a supplier for Crate and Barrel and Bloomingdale's, said that, far from fighting a recession, "we've been at full capacity so long that we've had to ask new stores to wait until we upgrade our factory."
"How's business? Very, very good."

Co-op Boards Twist The Screws

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
IN mid-September, a Wall Street trader and his stockbroker fiancee plunked down a hefty deposit to buy a co-op apartment on West End Avenue. In early October, the two were married, six months before they had planned, because their real estate broker said it would help them pass the building's co-op board -- for financial, not moral, reasons. The agent even suggested the minister: the Episcopal priest who was selling the apartment.
"She said boards typically have far fewer questions for people who are married," said the man, who asked to remain anonymous because the deal is technically still pending. The couple received a verbal O.K. from the board two days after the wedding. 
 Confronted with the hottest real estate market in years, and aware of what happened after the stock market crashed 10 years ago and the recession hit, the city's co-op boards have become tougher than they were even a year ago, according to brokers and managing agents, and the agents have become tougher right along with them.
In a report due for release next week, Charles H. Greenthal & Company, a real estate sales and management firm, tracked co-op board rejections in a sample of 70 Manhattan buildings. The rejections, up more than 50 percent from last year, from 4.2 to 6.6 percent -- affected apartments costing from $100,000 to more than $1 million. Greenthal also found that the greatest percentage of turn-downs now occur for one-bedroom apartments, and the majority occur in postwar, not the traditionally exclusive prewar, buildings.
In response to the tougher boards, made possible by a tight real estate market, a new breed of broker has arrived, stern taskmasters who scrutinize their clients' financial forms, raise the bar on the amount of cash and the depth of assets needed to pass the board, command rewritten reference letters and, in more than this one case, act as marriage brokers.
Within the last year, various brokerage firms have:
* Told prospective high-risk purchasers that to pass certain boards, they would have to place anywhere from one to five years of maintenance payments in escrow -- a lump sum that can easily total $100,000. One building management firm has even printed a new form for the payment.
* Become stricter on parental guarantees of maintenance fees, no longer accepting a letter taking responsibility as in the past. Cash, or a legally binding document, is now the only readily acceptable guarantee.
* Sent back financial statements from prospective buyers with as little as a dollar unaccounted for. Tossed back reference letters -- no matter from whom -- if they sound dull or, even worse, all alike.
* Required independent audits or accountants' statements for buyers who own their own companies. Claims of especially large earnings have even been toned down on the agent's advice, so as not to draw the board's scrutiny.
* Increasingly required proof -- usually in written form from an impartial appraiser -- for the values of real estate, artwork and jewelry listed as assets.
These pre-emptive strikes by brokers are used far more often than ever before, according to most of the agents interviewed. "More and more, we attempt to do some gentle steering, so people don't find themselves in embarrassing situations," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates and also a co-chairman of the board of the residential division at the Real Estate Board of New York. "Most of us are pretty open about it. If there's an apartment at X that a customer wants to see, we'll say, 'But they're looking for a bigger net worth.' "
If the broker is representing the seller, Mr. Peters said, he will probably refuse even to take a customer who will not meet the board's unwritten but well-known standards. "Why waste everybody's time?" he asked.
Only a year ago, agents were wasting time, presenting seemingly acceptable clients to boards that were turning them down. Some of the largest Manhattan brokerage firms confessed that they had been confused by the rejections in buildings across the financial and social spectrum, from little side-street buildings in Greenwich Village to some postwar-era white brick buildings on the Upper East Side -- "wannabe" buildings, brokers said, that sought to emulate the exclusivity of the grand prewar palazzos along Park and Fifth Avenues.
Spoiled by the ease of getting clients through the board during the recession, the brokers had to adjust to a new reality. "In the nadir of the market, in the early 90's, if the board turned down a shareholder's applicant, it knew he might have to wait a year for another," said Dolly I. Lenz, Sotheby's top-selling broker. "Now, you know there's somebody right behind, who's usually willing to pay even more."
So the agents have wised up. "We've become hypercritical of the board packages," the documentation prospective buyers prepare for the co-op boards, Mr. Peters said. "If they say their place in the Hamptons is worth a million, or whatever, we want an appraisal from a broker."
The broker's tougher attitude often makes applicants mad, and Mr. Peters said he understands why. "I'm totally sympathetic," he said, "but we still have to do it." If an applicant is turned down, the broker emerges bloody, bowed -- and without a dime. And several agents say that often, a client who has been rejected won't work with the agent again.
Within the real estate community, some brokers have found that the number of clients rejected went down when they instituted the newer screening standards. Barbara Corcoran, the president of the Corcoran Group, said statistics from her company show a marked decrease from last year: a 2.4 percent rejection rate in the first nine months of 1997, down from 4.37 percent for the same period of 1996. Ms. Corcoran credited the decrease to the tougher approach by her brokers. Several other large firms -- including the Halstead Property Company and the William B. May Company -- said they did not keep statistics on rejections.
The brokers and their sales agents say that tough boards are seen across the city. And they stress that the boards' toughness does not necessarily correspond to the prices of the apartments. Buyers on Fifth and Park Avenues still need to show a net worth of three to five times the price of the apartment; off that Gold Coast, some buildings have increased the amount of cash down payment needed, from 25 percent to 50 percent, or increased the amount of net worth required.
Although apartment values on Riverside Drive below 96th Street have skyrocketed, Mr. Peters said those buildings continue to look for "nice families that can afford the apartments." But, he said, in some of the buildings in Carnegie Hill, an Upper East Side neighborhood in the 80's and 90's, "they suddenly want nice families that can afford twice the price of the apartment."
In its survey, Greenthal found that "purchase price appeared to have little bearing on the approval decision." Of the 16 turn-downs recorded in the first half of 1997, 5 of the apartments involved cost less than $249,000; 3 cost between $250,000 and $499,000; 6 were between $500,000 and $999,000, and 2 were more than $1 million.
High-income, low-asset buyers like stock traders -- with their half-million-dollar annual bonuses that can turn to sand the next year -- are finding the going particularly tough now, even when looking at apartments in the range of $1 million to $4 million.
"We've been talking to the boards," said Ronni Arougheti, the president of Heron Ltd., a sales and building-management firm. "They are particularly worried now about what's happening on Wall Street and comparing it to the 1980's," when, she said, boards approved stockbrokers and financial whizzes, some of whom landed themselves -- and their buildings -- in trouble. These fears have only intensified in the last year, she said.
Ms. Arougheti, herself a real estate lawyer, said she had seen at least two dozen high-risk applicants who had to put up escrow payments of a year's or more maintenance. Her company has printed a form expressly for calculating these payments.
"In previous years, the boards would have asked for parents to guarantee the maintenance payments, but these parents are often out of state; now, the boards want to see cash," she said.
The Wall Street trader buying the West End Avenue apartment, a prewar three-bedroom in the 90's that is selling for more than $900,000, said the board's toughness was "a function of the demand" in today's real estate market.
"There's a whole half a generation that's accumulated wealth since the last hot market in the 80's," he said. "There's a finite amount of places you'd want to live in."
The couple's agent, Maggie Ocampo of Heron, said she knew the board would be worried about their not being married because if they split up, the woman would not be able to afford the apartment on her own. The man said his wife, who was a stockbroker in Chicago, is in the process of moving to New York and deciding whether to switch careers. Her name is going on the deed along with her husband's, Ms. Ocampo said. Their being married made the board feel more secure.
"With today's boards," Ms. Ocampo said, "agents do not want to raise any red flags -- not even little ones."

A Crude Story

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: KUWAIT

 BODY:
Follow the oil.
Just north of here, Iraqi refineries near Basra are producing tons of gas-oil used to fire power plants. Almost every day, small pirate vessels hugging the Iranian coast shoot up into the Shatt al-Arab waterway near Basra and load up on this Iraqi gas-oil, which the Iraqis sell the pirates at bargain prices. These small vessels -- always staying just inside the shallow Iraqi or Iranian waters, where the larger U.S. Navy ships maintaining the U.N. blockade on Iraq can't get at them -- then sail back down the Persian Gulf. Along the way the pirate captains, carrying wads of cash, pay off various Iranian admirals and Revolutionary Guard naval units to gain free passage through Iranian coastal waters. When the pirate boats reach the southern end of the gulf, they wait for when the U.S. Navy isn't around and then shoot across from Iranian waters into the United Arab Emirates or out into the Indian Ocean. In either place, they load their gas-oil onto larger tankers that take it to market. Iraq makes money, Iran makes money, the pirates make money. 
 Ain't capitalism wonderful?
This pirate trade is only one small way in which the geo-economics of oil is working against the U.S. sanctions on Iran and the U.N. blockade on Iraq. The even bigger story is this: There are today five great lakes of oil in this part of the world -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran and the Caspian Sea in Central Asia. The way international oil companies make their big money is by entering into production-sharing agreements with oil states. That is, the oil company assumes the risk of exploring and developing a country's oilfields, and then shares in its production until the field is dry. This way the oil company has a steady flow of crude for years to pump, refine, ship and market, profiting at each stage.
But such deals are rare these days. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia booted the companies out in the 1970's in order to develop their own oil. They use foreign oil companies purely as technical advisers. Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, along the Caspian Sea, have been ready to sign production-sharing agreements to get that oil out, but because they are fighting over who will get what share and where the pipelines will run, the Caspian remains locked shut.
That leaves Iran and Iraq. Both these countries understand what the oil companies want, and they are ready to give it to them. The deal just signed between Iran and the French, Russian and Malaysian oil companies is a production-sharing agreement for them to search for gas in Iran's huge South Pars offshore gasfield. You can see the allure: the oil companies get the kind of deal they've not seen in the Middle East since the 1970's, and Iran, whose oilfields are rundown, gets technical help from the best oil companies and a thumb in the eye to U.S. sanctions to boot. For now, Iran is limiting these production-sharing deals to offshore fields. But if Iran were to offer on-shore deals, and it's only a matter of time, every oil company in the world would be salivating.
Not to be outdone, Saddam Hussein has signed production-sharing agreements with French, Russian and Italian oil companies that give them the right to develop certain Iraqi fields the minute U.N. sanctions on Iraq are lifted -- thus turning the oil companies into an international lobby on his behalf. "The Iraqis are offering us incredible splits -- 60, 70 percent for the oil companies," one executive told me. That explains why France and Russia are resisting U.S. efforts to tighten U.N. sanctions on Saddam.
You need to spend only a few days in Kuwait -- hearing from some of the 600 Kuwaiti families who had loved ones abducted by Iraq during the invasion and never accounted for by Baghdad, or visiting the newly rebuilt Kuwaiti oil fields that Iraq gratuitously set ablaze, creating a mammoth ecological disaster -- to be reminded why Saddam is such a menace and why the sanctions on Iraq need to be maintained.
Unfortunately, the geo-economics is pulling the other way. Powerful, oil-driven forces are building against the U.S. sanctions on Iran. And Saddam is clearly hoping that if and when the Iran sanctions collapse, those on Iraq will fall next. No wonder Kuwaitis like to tell American visitors: "There is no cosmic justice. You got Mexico and Canada as neighbors, and we got Iran and Iraq."

HEADLINE: In America;
A Revolution Subsides

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It's not more than a stirring at the moment, like a soft breeze that heralds a change of seasons. But it's there. It's happening.
The conservative hold on the national electorate is loosening. 
 The so-called conservative revolution has more or less exhausted itself. It has left its mark, but it has also left a majority of Americans to face the 21st century with the unsettling sense that they are on their own when it comes to such potentially overwhelming matters as earning a living, raising a family, sending their children through college, caring for aging parents, securing adequate health care and providing for their own retirement in an increasingly insensitive and unforgiving global economy.
The conservative philosophy tells these working Americans to forget about turning to their government for help. There is nothing to be done. We are in a new era in which giant corporations rule the economic world according to the merciless dictates of a free market. The best the government can do is get out of the way.
Not surprisingly, this cynical, self-serving and ultimately inhumane approach is increasingly being seen as unsatisfactory. The conservative revolution has not raised the standard of living of most Americans, has threatened such cherished and hard-won supports as Social Security and Medicare, and has not come up with a game plan for addressing the economic and cultural challenges ahead.
Ever so subtly, ever so warily, the American gaze is drifting to the left. Let's not get crazy. We're not talking about a paradigm shift. And God forbid we should use the term liberal. That's out. But "progressive" is O.K.
Whatever the terminology, the evidence seems to be there. We found that there was a great deal of sympathy for the workers striking against United Parcel Service, and overwhelming public support for an increase in the minimum wage. Last fall we saw Republican Congressional candidates sprinting away from Newt Gingrich and the harshest elements of the conservative ideology. And in the past two Presidential elections we have seen the so-called Reagan Democrats, as worried as anyone about the economic uncertainties, returning to the fold to vote for Bill Clinton.
A recently published book, "The New Majority: Toward a Popular Progressive Politics," argues that an opportunity exists for the Democratic Party to regain the support of a solid majority of the electorate by re-establishing its traditional identification with the struggles and aspirations of working Americans -- the middle class, the working class and the working poor.
The book was edited by Stanley B. Greenberg, a pollster and former adviser to President Clinton, and Theda Skocpol, a professor of government at Harvard. It's a compilation of essays by progressive (get used to that word) thinkers, including the historian Alan Brinkley; the president of the Economic Policy Institute, Jeff Faux, and the sociologist William Julius Wilson.
The book points out that while we have been in an economic recovery for several years now, the gains are not being properly shared. Most working Americans -- despite a booming economy and a recent modest uptick in wages -- are either treading water economically or slowly sinking.
A poll taken not too long ago showed that 60 percent of whites, 58 percent of blacks and 55 percent of Latinos say that, "compared to 10 years ago, they are now farther away from attaining the American dream."
Very few of those respondents see their interests being well served by the Republican Party, the conservative ideology or the corporate juggernaut. The question is whether the Democratic Party can get its act together and seize the opportunity to fashion this new majority. It can do so only by addressing in a compelling way the real-world concerns of working families.
Right now both parties are stumbling around Washington in a dance of mutual incoherence. The Republican leadership is feuding and the top Democrats are ducking subpoenas and hiding from special prosecutors. If there are any good ideas around, they are being carefully concealed.
Which is a shame. Because there is a new majority that is just waiting for responsible, progressive leadership.

Stocks Soar in Seoul on Kia Takeover Plan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The South Korean Government's decision to take over the Kia Motors Corporation, the nation's third-largest auto manufacturer after Hyundai and Daewoo, sent stock prices to a record gain today and halted a decline in the nation's currency.
Investors often bail out of financial markets when governments take over private companies because they fear the intervention will hinder the free flow of capital. But until the Seoul Government announced its decision this morning, the markets here had been weighed down by the problems of Kia Motors, whose parent, the Kia Group, owes financial institutions more than $10 billion. 
 Kia Motors, in which the Ford Motor Company has a 16.9 percent stake, was struck today by workers protesting the Government takeover. Earlier, uncertainty surrounding the auto maker caused defaults at other companies as banks called in loans to offset their exposure to Kia. Stocks tumbled in recent weeks as foreign investors dumped assets denominated in the local currency, the won, and the benchmark index fell 27 percent in the last three months.
The Government's bailout plan, valued at 700 billion won, or $760 million, is the nation's biggest ever, exceeding the size of the rescue effort for the Daewoo Group's shipbuilding business in 1984. The Government will also provide financial aid to Kia's parts suppliers.
Today's announcement caused share prices to rally, and the benchmark composite index recorded its largest single-session gain ever. The index jumped 6.1 percent, led by Kia Group affiliates and their creditor banks.
"An early solution to the Kia problem is urgent to stabilize the financial market and improve our economy's overseas credibility," Kang Kyong Shik, the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance and Economy Minister, said in announcing the takeover.
Still, the stock market is not likely to rebound fully until the nation's economic problems lessen. Economic growth is at a four-year low, six of the 30 biggest conglomerates have become insolvent or are facing bankruptcy, and even profitable companies have been caught in the financial squeeze.
"It's a temporary reaction," Ok Kyung Moon, senior analyst at Asset Korea Ltd., a fund-management company, said of today's rally by stocks. "Fundamentally, the economy still has a long way to go."
The won rose 1 percent against the dollar today, ending three days of declines. On Tuesday, the won had closed at its lowest point against the American currency since South Korea established its current trading system in 1990.
Lee Young Il, a currency dealer at Seoul Bank, said: "It may be premature to say local investors' dollar enthusiasm soothed. But investors reduced the value of their dollar buying, expecting the settlement of the Kia crisis."
Under the Government plan, the state-owned Korea Development Bank will convert about 300 billion won of its loans to Kia into an equity stake. The bank will then apply for court receivership for Kia on behalf of its creditors.
After the conversion of its loans, the bank is expected to be Kia's biggest shareholder, with about 30 percent. The largest shareholder now is Ford Motor, which owns 9.4 percent itself and a further 7.5 percent through its Japanese affiliate, Mazda Motors.
The Government plans to sell Kia's commercial-vehicle business, the Asia Motors Company.
The Korea Development Bank's president, Kim Young Tae, said Kia Motors needed about 400 billion won in emergency loans. He said the Government would push Kia's management to step down and hand over the company to a third party once its finances improved.
Some 20,000 workers at Kia Motors' went on strike today, and unions at rival manufacturers threatened to follow suit, saying the Government wanted to give away Kia to a third party. "It's a Government plot to pave the way for a hostile takeover," said Lee Seung Woo, a union leader at Kia Motors.
The Kia Group said it would take legal action "to stop this malicious move."

HEADLINE: The President Bets on Technology

 BODY:
The most important thing to understand about President Clinton's speech on global warming yesterday is that he has asked the United States, a hungry producer and consumer of energy, to reverse course. He has publicly committed the country to a plan to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas mainly responsible for what could be a calamitous increase in atmospheric temperatures. He has agreed to binding targets and a timetable -- the stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. He has proposed a system for doing so, relying largely on market mechanisms, energy efficiency and technology.
His package is less than what many environmentalists had hoped for and not nearly as aggressive as the goals that some foreign countries will put on the table when the industrialized nations convene in Kyoto, Japan, in December to try to negotiate a global climate treaty. The Europeans, for example, are seeking net reductions from 1990 levels by a much earlier date, 2005. But the plan also asks American industry to make greater investments in cleaner fuels and new technologies than they have been asked to make in the past. The threat is clear. If industry does not make these investments, Mr. Clinton's successors may have to resort to far more expensive remedies to achieve the targets he has set. 
 Indeed, there are many who argue that even Mr. Clinton's relatively modest goals cannot be met without carbon taxes that would encourage switches to cleaner fuels, or stiff new gasoline taxes that would encourage energy conservation. Mr. Clinton has rejected that course, in part because he knows it would be difficult to sell to the present Congress and in part because he believes that innovation, incentives and the free market can get the job done without serious economic turmoil.
To that end, he proposes to give industries that achieve early reductions in emissions "credits" against the day when firm industry-by-industry emissions caps take effect. By giving extra credit to companies that lower emissions quickly, Mr. Clinton hopes to spur innovation and efficiencies and put the United States on a downward slope as early in the next century as possible. That is exactly the slope the country must be on if it is to scale back its emissions to 1990 levels.
Mr. Clinton has also embraced another innovative idea that could help solve one of the most vexing problems facing the negotiators in Kyoto -- how to bring developing countries like China and India into a global system. The developing countries will not be legally bound by whatever plan is hatched in Kyoto. Mr. Clinton's idea is to entice them into the system with an international emissions trading program under which rich nations can win further credits against their targets by helping poorer nations develop advanced, and presumably cleaner, methods of producing energy.
The environmentalists and the Europeans will surely press Mr. Clinton for a more accelerated timetable before his negotiators arrive in Kyoto. But that cannot obscure the fact that for the first time, a President has committed this country to changing the ways it produces and uses energy.

HEADLINE: Hebron Journal;
On This Street, It's All Painted Over but the Hatred

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG

DATELINE: HEBRON, West Bank, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Perched high on a ladder on a recent afternoon, a workman dusted off a Spanish street light gracing the new brick sidewalks of Shuhada Street, a bitterly contested road here where Palestinians and Jewish settlers are uneasy neighbors.
Palm trees and flower beds now line the once-shabby stretch of asphalt through the old heart of Hebron -- a street that has received a facelift in recent months with the help of the American Government. 
 The Shuhada Street project, which is getting its finishing touches this week, was paid for and supervised by the United States Agency for International Development -- part of the American-brokered agreement in January that led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of Hebron.
But the work is ending three months behind schedule and about $1 million over its budget, hampered by the same sort of troubles that delayed the withdrawal and that have bedeviled Hebron since the pullout left it divided into areas of Palestinian and Israeli control.
Clashes between Palestinian youths throwing rocks and Israeli soldiers along the dividing line, vandalism by Jewish settlers opposed to reopening the street to Arab traffic, and confrontations between soldiers and construction workers have shown that this was no ordinary project.
"We had to deal with Israelis and Palestinians, and it was a constant continuation of the negotiating process," said Christopher Crowley, director of the American aid agency's program for the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
As envisioned in the agreement, the renovation and reopening of Shuhada, or Martyrs, Street to Arab motorists is supposed to be a step toward the "normalization of life" in Hebron after the Israeli pullout.
The road, a main traffic artery that runs by the Jewish settlement enclaves in Hebron, has been closed to Palestinian motorists since February 1994, when a Jewish settler killed 29 Muslims at prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs shrine nearby.
Fearing a revenge attack on the settlers living on Shuhada Street, the Israeli Army barred Arab traffic and set up checkpoints at both ends of the road. The measures deterred Arab shoppers, ruined local businesses and forced Arab motorists to make long detours to get from one side of Hebron to the other.
The 450 Jews living in Hebron among 120,000 Arabs assert that the reopening of Shuhada Street to Arab traffic will expose them to drive-by shootings and possible car-bombings by Palestinian militants.
"The Arabs could cut us off by blocking the road with their cars, go into our homes and carry out a pogrom, and no one will be able to reach us," said Anat Cohen, a militant settler who lives on the street and has had several run-ins with construction workers.
The Hebron agreement stipulated that traffic on Shuhada Street would be restored within four months of the signing of the accord on Jan. 15, and it included a minutely detailed American plan to renovate the street. But work began only in March, and repeated delays have pushed off the planned reopening and increased the cost of the project to about $2.5 million.
Now that the work is done, Shuhada Street has the look of a neatly ordered avenue, a contrast to Hebron's worn, traffic-choked roads, which have sometimes turned into rubble-strewn battlegrounds where Palestinian youths have fought Israeli soldiers.
The color turquoise dominates the renovated street, splashed on freshly painted shop shutters and their spanking new metal signs and awnings. Ornamented street lights from Spain line red-brick sidewalks that run by sandblasted stone facades of old Arab buildings. Cast-iron fencing and litter baskets flank the the newly paved and painted road, under which water and sewage lines have been upgraded.
But the improvements did not come easily.
During the first weeks of the project when the road was dug up, Arab youths protesting construction of a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem fought Israeli soldiers daily in the mud, hurling chunks of asphalt from behind piles of sand and building equipment.
When the roadwork reached the Jewish enclaves, militant settlers shattered windows of bulldozers with air guns, injuring a driver, smashed curbstones and stoned Arab laborers, said the American construction manager, who wore a bulletproof vest on the job.
Shop awnings were slashed, a new street light was smashed, and Hebrew graffiti were sprayed on freshly painted Arab storefronts. The sign announcing the project was defaced with a Jewish star and the slogan "The Nation of Israel Lives!"
Israeli soldiers have beaten Arab workers in altercations at checkpoints and stolen sidewalk bricks, the construction crew said. An Arab storefront was spray-painted with the slogan "Here comes Golani," the name of the Israeli brigade stationed on Shuhada Street, and soldiers slapped black paint on other shop shutters to blot out anti-Arab slogans sprayed by settlers.
Noam Arnon, the Hebron settlers' spokesman, lives on Shuhada Street, which the settlers call King David Street. "Opening the road will put the Jewish homes under siege, and we will be surrounded on all sides," he said. "A concentration of Arab cars will provide ideal conditions for terrorists. They could jump out of cars with knives and by the time the soldiers realize what's going on, they'll be inside the homes.
"Most of Hebron is a closed area to the Jews, we're shut up here in a ghetto, and they want to funnel Arabs into our area. This will strangle the Jewish community."
The date for reopening Shuhada Street has still not been set, nor have road signs been put up yet to direct traffic. The traffic arrangements are a delicate issue, because they will determine whether Palestinians will be able to drive normally on both sides of the street, or only one way, on the side farther from the Jewish homes.
Arab shopkeepers on the street say that life there cannot go back to normal and that there will be no economic revival as long as the Jewish settlers remain nearby, with the accompanying Israeli Army checkpoints.
"People are afraid to come here because of the checkpoints," Yaaqub Abu Laban said as he stood near his spruced-up store. "We don't want renovations, we want people."

HEADLINE: New-Media Industry Becoming Juggernaut

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
With breathtaking speed, Manhattan's new-media industry has become one of the biggest players in the city's media business, doubling in jobs and companies in just the last 18 months to become a $2.8 billion-a-year juggernaut, according to a study to be released today.
The survey's findings are all the more stunning considering that the new-media business, consisting mostly of Internet and other high-tech companies, barely existed just a few years ago and even now is sometimes dismissed as a hobby run by the young and the indigent. But the survey portrays a business that is maturing, outperforming other businesses and becoming increasingly vital to the metropolitan region's economy. 
 "This makes it clear to anyone who didn't understand it yet that Silicon Alley is a very real phenomenon," said Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, using the nickname given to Manhattan's new-media industry.
The study was conducted by the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand and the New York New Media Association, and sponsored by the Empire State Development Corporation, the New York City Economic Development Corporation and Chase Manhattan Bank. The study, the second such survey conducted by Coopers & Lybrand, measures such economic indicators as demographics, compensation patterns, freelance employment and sources of financing.
The survey gauged the new-media business in Manhattan, in New York City and in the metropolitan area. The number of new-media companies in Manhattan almost doubled, to 2,128, compared with the 1,175 found in the first survey in early 1996. And annual revenues climbed 56 percent to $2.8 billion.
In Manhattan, the number of jobs -- full time, part time and freelancers -- jumped 105 percent to 55,973. This means that the new-media business (with 27,488 full-time jobs at the end of 1996 and 32,013 in mid-1997) is among the biggest in the media business, right up there with advertising (27,528 full-time jobs at the end of 1996) and periodicals (26,543 at the end of 1996).
In the metropolitan region, the number of new-media jobs jumped 48 percent to 105,771, including an increase of 162 percent in part-timers. The number of companies climbed 16 percent to 4,991, and revenues were up 50 percent to $5.7 billion.
To be sure, despite its rapid growth, the new-media industry is still dwarfed by other industries in New York City. The securities industry, for example, employs 155,000 people and the private health care industry has 315,000, said Jim Brown, an analyst at the New York State Department of Labor.
In addition, the new-media industry is different from other traditional businesses in that it is volatile and dominated by young entrepreneurs. Nearly a third of the companies have been established in the last 18 months; more than a sixth, meanwhile, have folded in the same period. Nearly three-quarters of the employees are under 40 years old. And a whopping 83 percent of the metropolitan area's new-media businesses generate less than $1 million in annual revenues.
At the same time, though, there are signs of maturation, said Brian Horey, a venture capitalist and a founding member of the New York New Media Association. The survey found that the biggest category of job creation was sales and marketing, suggesting that companies have gone beyond the product development stage and into the business world.
"Five years ago, this industry was immature," said Andy Zimmerman, a partner in charge of telecommunications and media consulting practice at Coopers & Lybrand. "Now, this industry is getting mature like Silicon Valley mature: more and more companies are employing people versus hiring freelancers, paying people more and obtaining traditional venture capital financing."
The survey said that companies are most concerned about the high costs of doing business in New York and the lack of technical talent, something that puts places like Boston and Silicon Valley, with M.I.T. and Stanford acting as laboratories, at an advantage. But the survey concludes by saying that the New York area's abundance of artists, designers and writers places it in a good position to capitalize on the growing importance of developing Internet "content" -- the stuff that appears on a Web site. And there are no signs that the the growth in jobs will let up.
"We expected rapid growth, but I have to admit that these numbers exceed even our expectations," said Gov. George E. Pataki, whose administration has cut taxes and supported economic development projects designed to encourage new-media businesses. "Ain't it great?"

HEADLINE: Stock Rally Stalls on Corporate Earnings

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING

 BODY:
A two-day rally in stocks was stalled yesterday as investors chose to focus on the latest spate of corporate earnings disappointments to drive their investment strategies.
Boeing and Allied Signal led a 25.79-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing said it would report an unexpected loss for its third quarter, while Allied Signal reported earnings that fell short of expectations. Boeing fell 4 1/8, to 49 7/8, while Allied Signal fell 3 1/4, to 40 1/4. 
 But after gaining more than 200 points in just two trading days earlier this week, the Dow may have been poised for a fall as investors became wary of moving prices higher after the quick gain, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross in New York.
"I'm pleasantly surprised that the market didn't fall further," Mr. Rice said, but added, "that doesn't mean we don't need another correction" before moving higher.
"Any time you get in front of 8,000, you're dealing with prices that are 21 times earnings and the risk versus the reward doesn't justify committing money at these levels," Mr. Rice said.
The Dow closed at 8,034.65, about 23 points lower than its level one week ago, while Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.79 points, to 968.49. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 4.46 points, to 1,708.08. And the Russell 2000, a leading small- company stock gauge, lost 0.68 point to close at 458.25.
Despite yesterday's declines, Mr. Rice and other analysts remain optimistic that stocks still have room to rise, largely because the majority of third-quarter earnings reports have been positive. In addition, the economic fundamentals of benign inflation and moderate growth that have fueled this year's rally are still intact.
"The fact that earnings are coming in strong is one of a few favorable facts that should keep the market trending higher," said Scott Reed, United States strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover. "It helps cushion the downside when volatility arises."
Although higher stock prices are anticipated, investors will have to come to grips with slower earnings growth in future quarters, analysts said.
"In the last few days, we've had some high-profile companies that really haven't missed in a while," Kevin Parke, director of equity research at Massachusetts Financial Services, said of the recent earnings disappointments. "And you've had some companies like Boston Scientific that missed again. Investors tend to be less skeptical that they're single-quarter issues."
As a result, investors are becoming more selective and will reward companies that can produce revenue growth, much of which will come from new product introductions and expansion into new markets, Mr. Parke said.
Some of yesterday's declines showed that investors are taking a stern view of earnings disappointments.
After guiding analysts to lower 1998 earnings estimates, Boston Scientific, fell 6 7/16, to 51. The latest disappointment came a little more than one month after the medical device manufacturer cautioned that third-quarter earnings, which were reported on Oct. 8, would grow less than expected.
Although investor demand was initially expected to be strong for China Telecom's initial public offering Tuesday, its American depository receipts fell 2 1/2, or 8.3 percent, from the offering price, to 28, on their first day of trading yesterday. Analysts said the issue was plagued by weakness in the Hong Kong market.

HEADLINE: 3M Profit Rises 8% As Sales Are Strong

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said today that earnings grew in line with estimates during the third quarter, lifted by strong sales and cost controls.
The company's profit, before a gain, rose 8.5 percent, to $432 million, or $1.05 a share, from $398 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 A gain in the latest quarter of $495 million, or $1.20 a share, from the sale of 3M's billboard business in August resulted in net income of $927 million, or $2.25 a share. In the period a year earlier, operating earnings and net income were the same.
Analysts had expected 3M to report operating earnings of $1.04 a share. The company's shares rose $5.75, to $100.375 Revenue for 3M, whose products include Post-It notes and Scotch brand tape, increased 5.6 percent, to $3.83 billion from $3.62 billion.
The company said sales growth exceeded the economic growth rates of the countries in which it operates, aided by the introduction of products. Still, the stronger dollar, which reduces foreign profits when they are converted into the American currency for reporting purposes, lowered per-share earnings by 7 cents, in line with expectations.
Analysts said 3M was able to improve its margins by keeping expenses under control.

HEADLINE: U.S. Fails to Get U.N. Backing To Widen Sanctions on Iraq

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The United States lost its battle to impose new sanctions on Iraq today and settled for a Security Council resolution that would keep only a strong threat of added restrictions.
Opposed by France, Russia, China, Egypt and Kenya, the United States and Britain had to draw back both from a plan to impose an immediate international travel ban on senior Iraqi military and intelligence officials and from an alternative proposal to put the ban into effect automatically in six months if Iraq continued to obstruct efforts to destroy its major weapons systems. 
 Instead, a day of negotiating among Security Council members produced a resolution, which may be adopted on Thursday, that expresses the Security Council's "firm intention" to order the travel ban in April if Iraq does not meet its obligations. The resolution also condemns Iraq for barring access to weapons sites, endangering the lives of inspectors and removing or destroying documents.
The resolution calls for a list of Iraqi officials who would be subject to a travel ban to be drawn up in the interim.
Bill Richardson, the United States representative, said he was satisfied with the resolution because it had broad support. Nine council members sponsored the measure.
More than six years after the Persian Gulf war, United Nations inspectors have yet to certify that Iraq has no more weapons of mass destruction or the factories and laboratories to build them.
The delay has been caused by Iraq's lack of cooperation. Inspectors have been told so many conflicting and false stories over the years that Iraq's credibility is now very low.
Iraq has been under a crippling economic embargo since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
The United States and Britain, which have held the line against all efforts to weaken those sanctions, decided to try to impose the additional measures after Iraqi officials blocked arms inspections earlier this year and interfered with aircraft, putting inspectors at risk.
The Security Council decided in June to agree to the travel ban but to postpone putting it into effect until the fall. In September the Iraqis again interfered with inspections, while submitting a report declaring that all prohibited weapons had been destroyed. Richard Butler, the chief monitor of the Iraqi arms program, concluded that the report was not credible.
Failing to have sanctions imposed now, the Clinton Administration hoped to have them applied automatically in April, when Mr. Butler's next major report is due, unless Iraq had made substantial progress in accounting for its arms. France and Russia said that this put too much responsibility on Mr. Butler and left too little room for the Security Council to debate the issue.

HEADLINE: Million Women March Is Set With High Hopes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Two years after hundreds of thousands of men came to Washington for a day of speeches and prayers at the Million Man March, a large group of women is expected here on Saturday for an event called the Million Woman March.
While organizers predict that as many as 1.5 million women from around the United States and beyond will participate, the city's chief planner said today that local officials were preparing for 500,000 women, most black, about the same number of people who usually attend the city's Fourth of July celebration. 
 But numbers are not the issue, march organizers insisted today, discounting comparisons with the various crowd estimates of two years ago -- 800,000, according to the men's march organizers, or 400,000, according to the National Park Service.
Nor are leaders of the women's event eager for their efforts merely to replicate the men's march.
"We are in no way trying to compare ourselves to the men or to compete against them," Phile Chionesu, a founder and co-chairwoman of the women's event, said in an interview. "Our brothers took the first step and opened the door. This is another step as we walk through the door."
Like the men's event, the women's march was planned to reflect and build upon experiences of black people, particularly those affected by crime, disintegration of families, homelessness and economic disadvantage.
But while the Million Man March was organized by a religious group, the Nation of Islam, and featured prominent religious and political speakers, like Louis Farrakhan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the mayors of major cities, the women's march has been organized by local community leaders without the support of any mainstream organization or even leading civil rights groups, like the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The daylong program includes only a few speakers known beyond the region.
Even so, Ms. Chionesu, the mother of a 9-year-old daughter, said the the march was designed to convince women of African origin that they should recognize their own economic, social and political might to overcome the ills of their communities. Often, she said, women feel overwhelmed and do not realize they have such powers or the support of others to initiate change.
In that context, organizers have chosen as keynote speakers Representative Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who has pushed for an investigation into accusations that the Central Intelligence Agency introduced crack cocaine into inner-cities, and Winnie Mandela, the former wife of Nelson Mandela, the President of South Africa.
Both Ms. Waters and Ms. Mandela are immersed in controversies. No evidence has emerged to link the Government with crack distribution, and Ms. Mandela, a leader of the anti-apartheid movement while her husband was in prison, has been accused of involvement in the subsequent kidnaping, torture and murder of eight people in South Africa.
Ms. Chionesu defended both woman, calling Ms. Waters "extremely courageous" for continuing to ask questions about crack and praising Ms. Mandela as a "persecuted" human rights leader who should be considered innocent until proven otherwise.
The program also includes dozens of other speakers whose messages, Ms. Chionesu said, reflect the 12-point program developed by march organizers.
While some of the aims are clear, like support for black public schools that would teach African languages and history, an end to homelessness and creation of programs that help women who have left prison, other points are nebulous. One advocates "the development of programming that will bring about a sincere and respectful environment that will foster the necessary interaction with our youth."
Sonia Jones, a 45-year-old mother of three grown boys and national coordinator of the march, said one of the organizers' objectives was to empower women to help themselves, rather than rely on community leaders or politicians.
"People feel like they have nowhere to turn anymore," Ms. Jones said, using the proliferation of drugs as an example. "Politicians say they are going to deal with it, but then they do nothing. I know the problem exists; I see it every day. But if we all come together, we can start to do something about it ourselves."
Ms. Chionesu said the ultimate beneficiaries of the march would be generations of black women that follow, in keeping with an aphorism that march organizers have emblazoned on posters, T-shirts and sweatshirts: "Great-grandmother taught grandmother. Grandmother taught mother. Mother taught me. I will teach you."
Interviews around the nation indicate varying degrees of enthusiasm for an event that has not created anything close to the publicity preceding some other major marches. An earlier effort at a Million Woman March, in Los Angeles in June 1996, brought out just a thousand women.
Organizers from the Chicago area say they are expecting 65,000 women from Illinois, about two-thirds of them from Chicago.
"This march is long overdue," said Carolyn Burt, a state employee in Chicago. "This is going to bring about so much unity, not just among women, but among men and women, that I'm ecstatic."
But organizers in Atlanta say it is unlikely that the turnout will rival the 10,000 men from Atlanta who attended the Million Man March.
"Women have more responsibilities than men," said Wanda Cunningham, executive director of the march's Southern region. "Men could just pick up and drive. They don't have to worry about the distance, the car breaking down or who's going to look after the kids."
Still, city officials in Philadelphia are preparing for a major event. Joe Certaine, the city planner, said the expectation of 500,000 was based on an estimate by organizers last month when they paid the $10,000 fee to stage the march, which will begin near Independence Hall and end in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
"We're preparing as if it will be like one of our larger Fourth of July events," Mr. Certaine said. "I expect to have a maximum of 500,000, maybe 700,000. If it's more, we're prepared. If it's less, so be it."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Clinton may soon tackle the devilish Social Security issue.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WITH trade liberalization and global warming already on the menu, one might expect President Clinton to take a break before heaping another difficult-to-digest economic issue on his plate. In fact, the White House is close to making a decision on whether to add Social Security to his agenda. There is reason for the haste: while the President has three years left in office, the political window of opportunity for tackling this most sensitive of issues is narrow.
Creating the bipartisan will to cut benefits or force workers to set aside more of their incomes for retirement is only the first step. Actually designing the plan to eliminate $8 trillion in unfunded pension liabilities could prove far more difficult. For while there is wide agreement that the problem is technically manageable, the experts on whom Washington is depending for answers are deeply -- perhaps fatally -- divided on how to get from here to there. 
 After this summer's budget accord, a triumphant President Clinton allowed that the respite from fiscal crisis "gives us a rare opportunity to take steps for the long-term well-being of our country." If that is to include major changes in Social Security before the millennium, the White House is convinced the campaign must begin soon.
The most likely scenario goes like this. Over the next few months the President will sound out Congressional Republicans -- in particular the Senate leadership, which is more inclined to pragmatism -- on whether they are prepared to take on Social Security. If the response is positive, Mr. Clinton will probably propose an advisory commission in his State of the Union address in January.
The group, modeled after the Greenspan commission that provided the nonpartisan cover to put Social Security back on track in 1983, would be top-heavy with senior Congressional leaders. The idea is to draft legislation early in 1999, after the 1998 elections. That would give Congress a chance to vote before the Presidential campaign overwhelms bipartisanship.
Administration sources emphasize that the commission would have to be buttressed by a campaign to build public support. That may not be easy since, unlike 1983 when Congress could argue that the cupboard was bare, failure to act would have no immediately visible consequences. Payroll taxes will more than cover promised pensions for at least 15 more years, when the vanguard of the baby boomers heads for Sun City.
It may be even more difficult to cobble together a consensus plan than to convince taxpayers of the need for one. For while pension experts generally agree that changes are needed, they are all over the place on substance.
At one end of the spectrum are remnants of the New Deal coalition, led by former Social Security Commissioner Robert Ball, who want to limit reforms to tucks and trims that would delay the day of reckoning for perhaps an extra decade. At the other, conservative intellectuals ranging from a former Reagan adviser, Martin Feldstein, to the staff at the Cato Institute want full privatization of the system, perhaps along the lines of Chile's celebrated makeover.
In fact, the White House and the Republican leadership are both prepared to discount these extremes.
The serious players agree that the safety net, Social Security's minimum pension benefit combined with means-tested welfare for the elderly and disabled, must remain intact. They are in accord that reforms cannot be built around permanent increases in the payroll tax. But the divisions are still fundamental.
The center-right, notably the economists Carolyn Weaver of the American Enterprise Institute, Lawrence Kotlikoff of Boston University and Sylvester Schieber at Watson Wyatt Worldwide pension consultants, want to redirect a big chunk of the existing payroll tax into I.R.A.-style instruments. They want to finance the transition costs -- money needed to cover current retirees' pensions -- from temporary taxes or from substantial cuts in future benefits to those not yet retired.
The center-left, including Edward Gramlich of the University of Michigan and Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, may be willing to create personally owned retirement accounts on top of the existing Social Security structure. But their goal is to make additional compulsory retirement savings palatable to a younger generation unwilling to pay more taxes for what has already been promised them. If the center-left had its way, individuals would have little discretion over where the money was invested, or when earnings from personal accounts could be converted to spendable cash.
Social Security reform is not impossible. Hardly anyone, after all, predicted that Congress would pass radical tax reform in 1986. But, for the moment, optimism depends on faith in the wisdom of policy makers and the virtue of politicians.

HEADLINE: 3 Big Oil Companies Register Increases in Operating Profits

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Three big American oil companies -- Mobil, Chevron, and Phillips Petroleum -- reported increases in their operating results for the third quarter yesterday that exceeded analysts' expectations, following solid reports by other energy giants earlier this week.
And Conoco, a unit of DuPont, also reported a solid gain, though the Shell Oil Company, the American subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, registered a drop in its earnings. 
 Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., said net income rose to $892 million, or $1.12 a share, from $769 million, or 96 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. It cited strong profits in refining and chemicals, higher American natural gas prices and increased worldwide production of oil and gas.
The net income included onetime items in each quarter. Without those gains and charges, operating income rose to $907 million, or $1.14 a share, from $668 million, or 83 cents a share. That exceeded the $1.03 average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by First Call.
Mobil's stock, however, fell 6.25 cents a share, to $73.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Like most other major oil companies, Mobil is benefiting from more profitable refining operations as a strong economy fed a robust summer driving season that pushed up gasoline prices. At the same time, the price of crude oil, the raw material used to make gasoline, fell. Mobil, the second-largest American oil company after Exxon, also reported higher production of oil and gas overseas.
Revenue, however, dropped 19.1 percent, to $16.4 billion from $20.3 billion, mainly because sales from businesses the company contributed to two joint ventures -- with Shell Oil and British Petroleum -- are no longer included in Mobil's revenue.
Chevron, the third-largest American oil company, reported net income of $727 million, or $1.11 a share, up from $655 million, or $1 a share. Without onetime items, operating earnings came to $732 million, or $1.12 a share, up from $650 million, or $1 a share, as profit margins in refining grew.
The company, which is based in San Francisco, beat analysts' expectations that it would earn $1.04 a share, according to a survey by I.B.E.S. International. Nonetheless, its shares dropped $1.375 a share, to $86.4375, on the Big Board.
Revenue fell 6.5 percent, to $10.3 billion from $11 billion.
Phillips Petroleum, which is based in Bartlesville, Okla., reported net income of $216 million, or 82 cents a share, up from $187 million, or 71 cents a share, after onetime items. Before those charges and gains, earnings rose 19 percent and beat analysts' expectations, as profit margins for oil refining more than doubled and chemical profits increased. But its stock fell, too, closing down 68.75 cents, to $49.0625, on the Big Board.
Shell Oil said its earnings fell 5 percent, to $479 million from $504 million, citing a decline in crude oil prices. As a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, Shell Oil does not report per-share earnings figures.
Conoco said its profit rose to $282 million from $256 million as it made more money on refining and selling gasoline, and it produced and sold more natural gas.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Nearly Flat In Dull Day

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday in a lackluster trading session.
Investors were reluctant to buy bonds before next week's report on third-quarter labor costs and Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, which could roil the Treasury market. 
 "We're thinking rates are more likely to drift higher," said Richard Litchfield, who manages about $2.1 billion in bonds at Allmerica Asset Management in Worcester, Mass.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended the day down 3/32, at a price of 99 15/32, leaving the yield unchanged at 6.41 percent.
Adding to the concern in the Treasury market yesterday were comments from Federal Reserve officials that were seen as suggesting that central bankers might be poised to raise rates.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Michael Moskow, said the economy was "surpassing everyone's expectations." Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, meanwhile, said the economy was enjoying "modest inflation," but added that economic indicators were providing mixed signals about the prospects for future inflation.
Treasury bond prices recouped early losses late in the day after the Government announced that it would sell $15 billion in new two-year notes and $11 billion in new five-year notes next week, $1 billion less than had been expected by most analysts.
"The slight reduction in the two and five years gave the market a lift," said Richard Gilhooly, a Government bond strategist with the Paribas Corporation. "Less supply is good for the market."
Still, another $38 billion or so in 3-year, 10-year and 30-year securities are expected to be sold the following week, analysts estimate.
Traders "keep looking at the calendar with supply creeping up on them and they're getting nervous because they don't see any buyers," said Vince Verterano, head Government bond trader at Nomura Securities International Inc.
Prices sank in August following the Treasury's last quarterly debt auctions as firms struggled to find buyers for the securities.
"If Greenspan's testimony next week is aggressive about inflation, the market will take a defensive posture going into all the supply," said David Duerson, head Government bond trader at BankAmerica Robertson Stephens in San Francisco.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the new two-year note was being offered a price to yield 5.91 percent, and the five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.06 percent.
In the corporate market, Fox Kids Worldwide raised $850 million in an junk-bond offering that drew strong demand. Because of the demand, the underwriters, Merrill Lynch & Company and Citicorp Securities Inc., increased the two-part issue to $850 million from $725 million initially. Fox Kids is a children's programming venture half-owned by the News Corporation.
Fox Kids priced $475 million of 10-year notes at par to yield of 9.25 percent. The second part consisted of $375 million in 10-year zero-coupon notes, priced at 60.614 to yield 10.25 percent.
China sold $500 million of global bonds yesterday, a sale that was expected to prompt debt offerings by companies from China.

HEADLINE: Vaccine for a Global Childhood Illness Passes Last Big Hurdle

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
A vaccine against the rotavirus, an infection that kills hundreds of thousands of children around the world each year, has cleared its last major hurdle, showing that it works in developing countries.
Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhea in childhood. While a major cause of illness in the United States, it strikes especially hard in poor countries. 
 The vaccine has been tested on nearly 18,000 children and has already been shown to be highly effective in the United States and other well-off places. However, some experts wondered whether it would do as good a job in poor countries, where bad nutrition and infection with other viruses might interfere with the vaccine.
Two earlier studies, conducted in Peru and Brazil, produced disappointing results. However, the latest study, done in Venezuela on 2,207 infants, used higher doses of vaccine and showed it works as well as it does in the United States.
While the vaccine does not block infection entirely, it keeps youngsters from getting deathly ill, keeping all but 12 percent in the latest study from having severe diarrhea.
"This shows that in a developing country we can protect against the most severe manifestation of diarrhea, the one that kills children, which is dehydration," said Dr. Albert Z. Kapikian of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. Dr. Kapikian is the principal creator of the rotavirus vaccine and a co-author of the latest study, which is being published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine. In another report this week, The Lancet, a British medical journal, will publish the results of a successful testing of the vaccine on 2,398 babies in Finland.
Virtually everyone catches the rotavirus in childhood, and symptoms range from mild to severe. In the United States it causes an estimated 50,000 hospitalizations and 500,000 doctor visits a year but is rarely fatal.
For a variety of reasons, including inadequate health care and failure to counteract diarrhea with fluid replacement, the virus kills many children in poor countries. The last detailed review, made a decade ago, calculated that the rotavirus caused 870,000 deaths a year worldwide among children under 5. The situation has improved somewhat since then, and officials at the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimate that it takes 600,000 lives yearly.
The new vaccine is being developed commercially by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. In December an advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to consider whether to recommend its approval for routine use.
"It's very exciting to have a vaccine that actually works," said Dr. Joseph Bresee of the disease control centers.
Wyeth-Ayerst has not disclosed how much it will charge for the vaccine, which is given in three oral doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. A spokesman, Doug Petkus, said its price would be similar to the prices of other new vaccines.
Dr. Bresee said a C.D.C. analysis suggests that if the three doses cost no more than $90, the vaccine will make economic sense.
However, many worry that the vaccine will be priced too high for poor countries, where it could have the biggest impact.
"If we are talking about those numbers" -- $90 per child -- "it will be a nonstarter in the developing world," said Dr. Gerald T. Keusch of the Harvard Institute for International Development.

HEADLINE: Child Care Talks Return First Lady to Spotlight

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton convenes a White House conference on Thursday to highlight what she and the President see as an urgent need for safe, affordable child care. But conservative Republicans say they fear that the conference will lay the groundwork for plans to increase Government spending or regulation.
Hoping to overcome such skepticism, Administration officials have been trying to enlist moderate Republicans and business executives in their campaign, arguing that improved child care would not only produce healthier, happier children, but would eventually increase the nation's economic output as well. 
 Mrs. Clinton today described the conference and the Administration's approach to child care in purposefully reassuring terms. The most successful day care programs result from "public-private partnerships," not Government mandates, she said at a briefing for reporters.
The White House conference will probably generate several new policy initiatives, she indicated, but they will not require enormous amounts of public money or a broadly expanded state regulatory role.
And Mrs. Clinton delivered a pre-emptive answer to critics who say that the focus on child care sends an implicit message to women that it is better for them to work outside the home than to stay at home caring for their own children.
"Despite our rhetoric about family values, we don't do very much to help the parents who want to stay home," Mrs. Clinton said. "We don't want one stereotypical, one-size-fits-all approach to child care."
In their handling of this issue, the Clintons are clearly drawing on lessons learned from the health care debacle of the President's first term. Their proposals to overhaul the health care system were rejected in part because critics painted them as an inflexible Government-decreed solution to major social needs.
In announcing the day care conference on July 23, President Clinton said affordable, high-quality care was "critical to the strength of our families and to healthy child development." Moreover, he said, "it is good for the economy and central to a productive American work force."
Mrs. Clinton's work on the child care conference is her most visible effort at policy making since the failure of the health care project. The conference follows months of White House planning, aides said. It centers on an issue of long interest to Mrs. Clinton and was scheduled to capitalize on favorable publicity surrounding her 50th birthday on Sunday.
Although Mrs. Clinton is the event's chief organizer, she took pains today to emphasize that any policy proposals would come from her husband, not from her. "The President will make recommendations," she said.
Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican who recently introduced a comprehensive bill to increase the supply of day care, said, "Having affordable, convenient child care is tied directly to a family's ability to produce income."
Most child care, Mr. Jeffords said, is mediocre, and some threatens the health and safety of children.
Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, said she hoped that the conference would be "a launching pad for significant new investments" in child care, by Federal and state governments and by employers across the country. "The quality of infant and toddler care is shockingly low," said Mrs. Edelman, a longtime mentor to Mrs. Clinton.
Ten million children under the age of 5 have working mothers and need child care. The Census Bureau says that 30 percent of the children are in day care centers or nursery schools, while the others receive care from relatives or neighbors.
The debate over child care is filled with paradoxes. Parents cite the cost of care as one of their biggest concerns. Families with incomes under $14,500 a year spend one-fourth of their income on child care, the Census Bureau reports.
But many child care experts are seeking higher pay for child care workers, higher quality care and stricter regulation, which -- in the absence of new investments by government or business -- could lead to increased costs for working parents.
Helen Blank, a policy analyst at the Children's Defense Fund, said that child care workers, on the average, earned less than bus drivers, garbage collectors and bartenders.
Marcy Whitebook, co-director of the National Center for the Early Childhood Work Force, in Berkeley, Calif., said nearly one-third of child care teachers earned the minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour. The low wages, Ms. Whitebook said, lead to high turnover among child care workers, who come and go so fast that they cannot develop stable relationships with the children for whom they are responsible.
Congress is considering many bills to increase Federal spending and tax breaks for child care. Democratic authors of such measures have worked closely with moderate Republicans like Mr. Jeffords, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut. A few conservatives have also endorsed the proposals.
Republican Governors in Illinois, Ohio, Rhode Island and Wisconsin have joined Democratic governors in efforts to increase spending for child care.
But the White House conference has drawn a cool reception from many conservatives, who note that Congress approved a major increase in child care spending as part of the 1996 welfare law.
Gary L. Bauer, a former Reagan Administration official who is president of the Family Research Council, said: "When I see conferences in Washington, the bottom line almost always seems to be something that makes Government grow. There are deep suspicions on the right that the purpose of this conference is to soften up the ground for proposals involving an entitlement program or new subsidies for institutional child care."
For their part, Administration officials said they wanted to raise the prominence of child care as an issue on the national political agenda, without proposing specific new legislation at this time.
The White House conference will focus on three questions: how to increase access to child care, how to make it more affordable and how to guarantee the quality of care, so children will be safe.
In a report on the nation's child care needs, prepared for the conference, the Department of Health and Human Services makes these points:
*Forty-five percent of children under the age of 1 are in child care on a regular basis.
*States with stronger licensing requirements have larger numbers of high-quality child care centers. But the quality of care varies immensely.
*"Nearly five million school-age children spend time as latchkey kids without adult supervision during a typical week." Juvenile crime is most likely to occur after school hours, when children are unsupervised.
David M. Blau, a professor of economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the availability of "family day care," in which one person typically supervises several children, had a major effect on the entire market for child care.
"Many women are willing to take care of other people's children for relatively low remuneration," said Mr. Blau, who has studied the industry. "They are able to take care of their own kids at the same time, and that provides them with nonmonetary benefits. This tends to hold down wages, so the cost of informal child care is very low. The effects spill over to larger day care centers because the two types of child care providers compete with each other."
In the 1996 welfare law, Congress created a new program of Federal grants to the states, designating $13.9 billion over six years to help finance child care. The Congressional Budget Office said this sum was an increase of more than $4 billion, or nearly 50 percent, over what would have been spent under prior law.

HEADLINE: Excerpt From Clinton Comments on Global Warming

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Following is an excerpt from remarks by President Clinton today to the National Geographic Society on the proposal for stabilizing industrialized nations' release of gases that may cause global warming, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company: 
 The vast majority of the world's climate scientists have concluded that if the countries of the world do not work together to cut the emission of greenhouse gases, then temperatures will rise and will disrupt the climate. In fact, most scientists say the process has already begun. Disruptive weather events are increasing. Disease-bearing insects are moving to areas that used to be too cold for them. Average temperatures are rising. Glacial formations are receding.
Scientists don't yet know what the precise consequences will be, but we do know enough now to know that the Industrial Age has dramatically increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, where they take a century or more to dissipate and that the process must be slowed, then stopped, then reduced if we want to continue our economic progress and preserve the quality of life in the United States and throughout our planet.
We know what we have to do. Greenhouse gas emissions are caused mostly by the inefficient burning of coal or oil for energy. Roughly a third of these emissions come from industry, a third from transportation, a third from residential and commercial buildings. In each case, the conversion of fuel to energy use is extremely inefficient and could be made much cleaner with existing technologies or those already on the horizon, in ways that will not weaken the economy but in fact will add to our strength in new businesses and new jobs. If we do this properly, we will not jeopardize our prosperity; we will increase it.
With that principle in mind, I'm announcing the instruction I am giving to our negotiators as they pursue a realistic and effective international climate change treaty. And I'm announcing a far-reaching proposal that provides flexible, market-based and cost-effective ways to achieve meaningful reductions here in America.
I want to emphasize that we cannot wait until the treaty is negotiated and ratified to act. The United States has less than 5 percent of the world's people, enjoys 22 percent of the world's wealth, but emits more than 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. We must begin now to take out our insurance policy on the future. In the international climate negotiations the United States will pursue a comprehensive framework that includes three elements, which taken together will enable us to build a strong and robust global agreement. First, the United States proposes at Kyoto that we commit to the binding and realistic target of returning to emissions of 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. And we should not stop there. We should commit to reduce emissions below 1990 levels and the five-year period thereafter, and we must work toward further reductions in the years ahead.
The industrialized nations tried to reduce emissions to 1990 levels once before with a voluntary approach, but regrettably most of us, including especially the United States, fell short. We must find new resolve to achieve these reductions. And to do that we simply must commit to binding limits.
Second, we will embrace flexible mechanisms for meeting these limits. We propose an innovative joint implementation system that allows a firm in one country to invest in a project that reduces emissions in another country and receive credit for those reductions at home. And we propose an international system of emissions trading.
These innovations will cut worldwide pollution, keep costs low and help developing countries protect their environment, too, without sacrificing their economic growth.
Third, both industrialized and developing countries must participate in meeting the challenge of climate change. The industrialized world must lead, but developing countries also must be engaged. The United States will not assume binding obligations unless key developing nations meaningfully participate in this effort. As President Carlos Menem stated forcefully last week when I visited him in Argentina, a global problem such as climate change requires a global answer.
If the entire industrialized world reduces emissions over the next several decades, but emissions from the developing world continue to grow at their current pace, concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to climb. Developing countries have an opportunity to chart a different energy future, consistent with their growth potential and their legitimate economic aspirations. What Argentina, with dramatic projected economic growth, recognizes is true for other countries as well. We can and we must work together on this problem in a way that benefits us all.
Here at home, we must move forward by unleashing the full power of free markets and technological innovations to meet the challenge of climate change. I propose a sweeping plan to provide incentives and lift roadblocks to help our companies and our citizens find new and creative ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

HEADLINE: Redevelopment Plans May Hem In Skid Row

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Every night on the edge of downtown, a couple of dozen men and women hustle cardboard boxes from the trash and arrange them, like a row of coffins, behind a red line painted on the sidewalk at the corner of Fourth and Los Angeles Streets.
Then they climb in the boxes and go to sleep. 
 It is a nightly ritual of poverty performed by black, white and Hispanic people in the city's designated "sleeping zone" in Skid Row, 50 square blocks of misery and struggle, a short walk from the business towers of Los Angeles.
In few other big cities is image -- looking like a million bucks when you have only $10 -- more important than in Los Angeles. But the "sleeping zone," which was created about a year and a half ago as a way to get the homeless to bed down in one area, is a reminder that the problems of the homeless and the redevelopment of downtown can still provide challenges that go far beyond image. The zone is also a reminder that homelessness, which has drifted far from the center of public debate, remains very much an issue here and elsewhere.
As dusk fell the other evening, a 69-year-old grandmother and a 32-year-old woman, pregnant with twins, needed a little help getting their boxes ready in the zone, which runs about 20 yards down Fourth Street and then 20 yards around the corner of Los Angeles Street.
"I'll be all right," the grandmother, Ora Lee, said. "There are a lot of folks out here to keep me company."
But in fact, despite the desire of city officials to have the zone keep the homeless from spilling out into the rest of downtown, attendance has been sparse.
"So far," said Donald R. Spivack of the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, "a lot of people haven't bought into the sleep zone."
Mr. Spivack and others want the experiment to succeed, because now, with the city beginning to shrug off the effects of California's deep recession earlier this decade, big-scale development projects, including a $300 million sports arena, once again seem possible for downtown. Even the Roman Catholic Church has plans for the area, in the form of a $50 million cathedral.
 
Redevelopment Plans Versus Needs of Poor
"The politics of Skid Row will undoubtedly heat up again," said Jennifer Wolch, a professor of geography and urban planning at the University of Southern California and a member of the city advisory committee that wrote the "strategic plan" for downtown development in Los Angeles. Professor Wolch said that Skid Row and downtown were on a "collision course."
"There will be strong political pressure to make sure that there is no expansion of facilities for the poor in Skid Row," she said. "And there will also probably be a move toward more vigorous management of the population. It's a major source of tension."
Indeed, over the years, the city has never seemed quite sure what to do with Skid Row, the place Mike Davis calls an "outdoor poorhouse" in "City of Quartz," his book about Los Angeles, and that the people on the street call "The Pit" or "The Bottom."
For a while back in the 1980's, it looked as if the neighborhood was slowly beginning to turn around. The city spent more than $100 million for shelter and social services in the row. There were fewer people sleeping on the street, Mr. Spivack said, and better places for them to live indoors.
But since the recession, almost all of that money has dried up. Corporate charitable contributions to services on the row are also down. And public assistance for single adults -- the vast majority of Skid Row's often troubled population -- has been cut, with more restrictions on the way as part of the overhaul of the nation's welfare system.
"That combination set us back, and caused a resurgence of Skid Row," Mr. Spivack said. "Yes, it's worse than it's been in a long time, but not as bad it was. People forget how bad it really was."
The neighborhood is home to 12,000 people, most of whom live in single-room-occupancy hotels and missions. No one knows exactly how many people sleep on the streets of Skid Row but people who work with the poor in the area's numerous missions, shelters and soup kitchens say the number is in the hundreds and appears to be increasing.
 
Out of Sight And Out of Mind
Experts on homelessness like Mary Ann Gleason, the director of the National Coalition for the Homeless in Washington, say there is considerable anecdotal evidence that it is growing in Los Angeles as elsewhere.
Years ago, the city decided to focus many of its social services and shelters for the poor in Skid Row -- Central City East in the nomenclature of city planners -- instead of spreading them out more across the entire city and run the risk of offending an increasingly angry electorate.
"When I got to L.A. 14 months ago, I applied for general relief and they sent me straight down here for housing," said Larry Burrel, a 35-year-old chef from Detroit with a heart so weak he cannot work. "It scared me to death. I had never seen so many people sleeping on the sidewalk. But I got used to it. Most people here are too busy trying to survive to mess with you."
But most Angelenos and tourists rarely see the row, because most do not spend much time or money downtown unless they happen to work in one of its shiny but sometimes sparsely occupied office towers.
A Los Angeles Magazine poll called "Why we love/hate L.A.," published last June, asked respondents how often they went downtown for purposes other than work. Nearly 30 percent said never and 39.9 percent said only a few times a year.
Now the city wants to turn the heart of downtown into a regional showpiece, instead of a place many of its residents avoid, by bringing in more shops, theaters, tourists and their credit cards, and hundreds of millions of dollars in public and private redevelopment money.
"The interest in downtown has never before been so intense," said Rocky Delgadillo, the deputy mayor in charge of economic development.
The advocates for the poor say that before new arenas are built, the homeless should be housed. There are tens of thousands of homeless people estimated to be living across the city and county.
"Our priorities are messed up," said Mike Neely, the founder and director of the Homeless Outreach Program in Skid Row.
"We are willing to sell out entire communities in the name of economic development, and forget the poor," Mr. Neely said.
Mr. Delgadillo said that many more people -- rich and poor -- will benefit from a redeveloped downtown.
"If you said to me, 'Let's spend $10 on the homeless,' or said, 'Invest $100 with an arena project that can give you back $500,' the arena may do more in creating jobs," Mr. Delgadillo said.
 
Volunteers Protest Proposed Cathedral
The struggle over the needs of the poor versus property development is not confined to the secular world.
Plans by the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese to build a $50 million cathedral downtown have been the subject of a protest campaign by a group of Catholics who have been feeding the poor of Skid Row for decades.
"It isn't as though we think cathedrals are bad," said Catherine Morris of the Los Angeles Catholic Worker Community. "We believe that the money being spent on this project is money that is being taken from the needs of the poor. God's money should be spent on God's poor."
A spokesman for the archdiocese, the Rev. Gregory Coiro, said the bulk of the money for the cathedral came from gifts earmarked for the cathedral.
"A cathedral church in any major city is a very important symbol," Father Coiro said. "It represents the spirit that the church has and the role that the church plays in the life of the people."
A few days after one of their protests, the Catholic workers were back at their soup kitchen, playing their usual role in the life of the people of Skid Row, serving breakfast and lunch to about 1,000 people, including Flo Hawkins, 61, an artist who has lived in the neighborhood for about 10 years.
Ms. Hawkins is the co-founder of a group called Skid Row Access, a collective of artists and crafts workers who make wooden toys and other items.
"We are an alternative to welfare," Ms. Hawkins said at the group's work space in a warehouse they share with a poultry wholesaler in Skid Row.
 
History of S.R.O. Hotels Spans Decades on Row
There are about 65 single-room-occupancy hotels on Skid Row, intermingled with fish wholesalers, toy suppliers and nearby garment factories.
The hotels have been part of the row for decades. When the city began pouring money into the neighborhood in the 1980's, much of it went to buy and restore the crumbling and dangerous hotels. Today, about half of them are in the hands of nonprofit organizations.
The improved hotels were a key to getting people off the streets. But in the last few years, the city has almost completely stopped creating single-room-occupancy apartments.
The slowdown was largely caused by cuts by Los Angeles County in public assistance for single adults. That has limited the number of people on Skid Row who can afford the going rate of $165 a month for a room, said Mr. Spivack of the redevelopment agency. "With the economy starting to stabilize, hopefully things will turn back," he said. "But they haven't yet."
The hotels cut their costs as those relief payments fell to $212 a month from $341 over the past seven years. They cannot cut back any further.
As it is now, many people can afford to stay in a hotel only three weeks out of a month, Mr. Spivack said, before they go back to the streets or a shelter. Starting on Feb. 1, people will be restricted to only five months a year of general relief.
Alice Callaghan of the Skid Row Housing Trust Corporation, one of the nonprofit groups that buy and maintain the hotels, said, "Economic development is not what we want in this neighborhood until we have secured the housing."
In the meantime, people in Skid Row do their best to survive.
By 5 A.M. at the Fourth Street sleeping zone, the police get out of their cars and begin waking people up, ordering them to stack the cardboard "condos" in a pile. Marie Desharneis is one of the sidewalk entrepreneurs who take the boxes away for recycling.
"If the police see somebody with even a little piece of cardboard, they make them put it down and give it to me," Mrs. Desharneis said the other morning, as she stacked the flattened boxes in her pickup truck, an hour before sunrise.
"It's sad. Every night the people have to search for new cardboard to make their houses."
Mrs. Desharneis gives a couple of dollars to some of the homeless men who help her collect the boxes.
As Mrs. Desharneis loaded her truck, Mrs. Lee sat on the sidewalk, her back against the wall of the Midnight Mission. Her cardboard home was already on the truck. She was wrapped in what she called a blanket -- a pink shower curtain a passerby had given her.
Then, all she needed to do was find another box for another night in the sleeping zone.

Defending tax breaks intended to keep jobs in the city, on a visit to the Interstate Bakery Corporation in Jamaica, Queens, which received such a break. 

"They keep jobs in the city and helped us turn around the real crisis we had, where we were losing 320,000 jobs. We've now replaced it with private sector job growth of 173,500, as of yesterday. So I believe we're moving on the right track. When the labor statistics came out yesterday, it showed unemployment is down, continues to go down, and has been going down for the last several months. And it also showed, which I think is even more hopeful, that the growth of jobs last month was the largest we've had in 13, 14 years. That happens because of a lot of reasons, but it really happens in large part because of the work of the people in the administration and businesses that have confidence in the City of New York."

HEADLINE: Dangerous Sparks in Kosovo

 BODY:
Events in Kosovo are proving the adage that those who make peaceful revolutions impossible make violent ones inevitable. Kosovo is a region of Serbia where a tiny Serbian minority has governed the Albanian majority in brutal apartheid style since Slobodan Milosevic revoked the region's autonomy in 1989. Recently some Albanians, frustrated that politics is getting them nowhere, have turned to attacks on police stations and other symbols of Serbian power. Serbian authorities respond with indiscriminate repression. To keep the peace in Kosovo, the United States and its European allies must do more to help restore the rights of the Albanians there. A peaceful Kosovo is crucial because violence could spread to neighboring areas.
Belgrade politics is one reason for the new violence. The extremist Vojislav Seselj, a Milosevic creation who would now be president of Serbia if low turnout had not annulled recent elections, said a few divisions of Serbian fighters would take care of Kosovo, which Serbs hold as the cradle of their history. His nationalism has pushed even moderate Serbian politicians into inflammatory statements. 
 The leader of Kosovo's Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova, has called for Kosovo's independence but has been a tame, ineffective opponent of Mr. Milosevic. Mr. Rugova's moderation pleases Washington, which favors only restoration of Kosovo's autonomy inside what is left of Yugoslavia. But his inability to improve life in Kosovo has inadvertently encouraged Albanians to try violence.
Washington, which has promised to keep economic sanctions on Serbia until Kosovo's rights are restored, has done the most to help, but it is no longer enough. A year ago Mr. Milosevic agreed to education reforms that would allow teaching in Albanian. Nothing has happened. Washington must increase its pressure on Belgrade to carry out this and other reforms, especially ending arbitrary jailings and beatings. There is virtually no foreign presence in Kosovo. Monitors are needed, and an American special envoy to Kosovo.
There is some hope. In a rare instance of dialogue, Kosovo and Belgrade students met for the first time last week. Politicians have also held talks, but Mr. Milosevic's party boycotted them. Kosovo's misery will end only when real democracy, free of Mr. Milosevic's control, comes to Serbia.

HEADLINE: President Plans Energy Savings In a Moderate Step on Warming

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton today outlined a moderate program to fight global warming, saying that it would be painless and even economically beneficial but that it must be carried out quickly to be effective.
The plan would rely on tax credits and research subsidies to encourage the conservation of energy in the next few years. It would also give American companies extra credit for moving more quickly than required to cut their emissions of atmospheric pollutants that trap the sun's heat and threaten to alter the planet's climate. But it would not reduce emissions to the 1990 benchmark until some time between 2008 and 2012. Further, unspecified reductions would follow. 
 "We have a clear responsibility and a golden opportunity to conquer one of the most important challenges of the 21st century, the challenge of climate change, with an environmentally sound and economically strong strategy," Mr. Clinton said in a speech at the National Geographic Society here. "If we do not change our course now, the consequences, sooner or later, will be destructive for America and for the world."
But the plan was quickly denounced by many of the other nations that are trying to negotiate a new climate treaty. At a negotiating session in Bonn, they said that as the largest single emitter of heat-trapping, or greenhouse, gases, the United States should be doing more and doing it sooner. Page A20 .
In the negotiations, parties to the 1992 treaty on climate change that was signed by 160 nations in Rio de Janeiro are seeking to strengthen its terms. The treaty called on industrial nations to cut their emissions to 1990's levels by the year 2000. Most industrial nations, including the United States, are falling short of that target, and Mr. Clinton's plan defers it for many years.
Under the Clinton Administration's plan for meeting the new targets of a binding treaty, the United States Government would wait until 2008 before fully establishing fixed caps on industrial sources of greenhouse gases, mainly the carbon dioxide that comes from burning fossil fuels. And only then, consequently, would energy prices have to increase to reflect the costs of mandatory emission reductions.
The Administration, in effect, is laying a heavy bet that innovation and the free market, driven by a few billion dollars of tax incentives and subsidies, will drive down fuel use in the next few years without causing any serious economic disruption. This approach would therefore demonstrate the feasibility of deeper reductions that would come later.
Mr. Clinton, who since his first campaign for the Presidency has pledged aggressive action to fight global warming and who criticized President George Bush for not supporting the 1992 Rio treaty on climate change, found himself the target of the same kind of criticism today, but from other countries.
"It seems to me that the United States proposal is even less" than what was originally in the treaty, said Dr. Mark Mwandosya of Tanzania, the chairman of the developing-countries' caucus in the talks.
But Mr. Clinton described his strategy as "realistic and effective."
"This plan is sensible and sound," he said, acknowledging the criticisms that erupted even before he began to speak. "Since it's a long-term problem requiring a long-term solution, it will be phased in over time. But we want to get moving now."
The President emphasized his optimism about technology as he stood framed by the National Geographic Society's logo, as an explorer might be pictured on the cover of the National Geographic magazine, and not a President defending a position attacked by environmental groups.
His plan, he promised, would "create a wealth of new opportunities for entrepreneurs at home, uphold our leadership abroad, and harness the power of free markets to free our planet from an unacceptable risk."
He said that even before a new treaty was negotiated and ratified, the United States would take new steps to put itself on an energy diet with a prescription that in the next few years would emphasize incentives, subsidies, Federal procurement policies and rewards for those who move the fastest to adopt promising new technologies.
The proposal is less ambitious than the approaches sought by Japan, Europe or many developing countries to control the buildup of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They all want the industrial nations to agree to deeper and earlier cuts in a new treaty that is supposed to be concluded in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
Mr. Clinton also declared that the United States would not accept binding commitments negotiated in Kyoto unless important developing countries also agreed to join the worldwide effort to reduce emissions.
Most environmental organizations denounced the Clinton plan as too weak, although some praised the President's call for early actions. Most big industry groups rejected the plan as too costly, although some said they liked the incentives it promoted.
"The United States is the only country dragging its feet," said Phil Clapp, the executive director of the Environmental Information Center, an advocacy group. "Unless he is willing to take a stronger position in Kyoto, the Clinton-Gore Administration will be responsible for the collapse of the talks."
But Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said: "For the first time there is a good chance for a constructive outcome at Kyoto. One of the major defects in the plan is that it is not aggressive enough in the longer term. But the early reductions are extremely important, because they could get U.S. emissions under control. Emissions are basically exploding at this point."
Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said his business federation would oppose the proposed emission-trading scheme that is at the heart of the Administration's plan.
"Capping emissions amounts to energy rationing, which drives up consumer costs as effectively as higher energy taxes," Mr. Donohue said.
But Michael Marvin, the executive director of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, said, "It is what we have advocated from the beginning: clear, modest steps to get us back to 1990."
"Mr. Marvin, whose group represents companies including appliance manufacturers and purveyors of clean fuels, renewable energy, and conservation technologies, added: "It is an important step. In an ideal world, we would have argued for an earlier timetable earlier. But this puts the U.S. in the ball park and is a defensible, negotiable position."
Like the targets and timetables that Mr. Clinton proposed, the package of incentives is relatively modest. The $5 billion in tax cuts and research subsidies over five years would amount to a bit more than a penny per hundred dollars of economic activity -- $1 billion annually in a $7 trillion economy. Looked at another way, it would be enough to give every citizen an annual rebate covering one-fourth of the cost of a high-efficiency light bulb.
Any treaty would require approval from two-thirds of the Senate, and some elements of Mr. Clinton's plan would have to be written into law by Congress, where there is considerable resistance to his approach.

HEADLINE: Battle Stage Is Set

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

DATELINE: BONN, Oct. 22

 BODY:
After two years of struggle over what to do about global warming, the Clinton Administration and the developing countries in the global game of greenhouse politics have put their cards on the table, and negotiations have at last begun in earnest.
The talks "have come alight, and not a moment too soon," said Michael Zammit Cutajar of Malta, the executive secretary of the United Nations body that administers the 1992 treaty on climate change. 
 Delegates from 150 countries are gathered here to discuss possible revisions to the treaty, in the last of eight negotiating sessions leading up to a final session in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
The American plan, announced today by President Clinton in Washington, represents the low-ball bid. Mr. Clinton called for stabilizing industrialized countries' emissions of heat-trapping gases at 1990 levels by about 2010, with a modest reduction below 1990 levels by about 2020.
A sharply contrasting proposal, presented formally today by the developing countries and China, calls for the rich countries to cut their emissions by 7.5 percent below 1990 levels by 2005, 15 percent by 2010 and 35 percent by 2020.
An agreement in Kyoto, should one be reached, apparently lies somewhere between the two boundaries set by the United States and the Group of 77 Plus China, as the developing countries call themselves.
With today's announcements, the negotiating "universe" has been firmly delineated for the first time.
Under the 1992 treaty, the developing countries are explicitly exempted from undertaking any specific commitments, and they have steadfastly maintained that they will not agree to do so unless the rich nations demonstrate convincingly that they are serious about taking the lead. The rationale is that since the industrialized countries are the biggest emitters of the gases and got rich by emitting them, they should take the first steps toward reduction.
While agreeing that the developed countries should take the lead, President Clinton reasserted today the United States position that the poorer countries must be part of any negotiated solution.
The poorer countries' emissions are expected to exceed those of the developed world within two or three decades. Two of the largest of them, China and India, have abundant reserves of coal, the most troublesome fossil fuel in terms of emitting heat-trapping, or greenhouse, gases. Global warming occurs when such gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, accumulate in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, the energy underpinnings of the global economy.
But the United States is the world's major producer of greenhouse gases, and the American proposal has been deemed critical for the success of the talks. For two days, the delegates gathering at the Beethoven Halle opera house on the Rhine have been anxiously awaiting the American proposal.
As details began filtering out of Washington, some reactions were predictable. An important delegate from the European Union, which favors a 15 percent reduction in emissions by 2010, said he "looked at the figures, and. . . ." He made a dismissive gesture.
But some industry representatives considered the proposal quite ambitious. "This will be a tremendous cut," said Gail McDonald, president of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group in Washington. "It's a very aggressive target."
To Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the chairman of the Bonn talks, the Clinton proposal was "really modest; we were waiting for a bigger effort." But, he said tonight after watching Mr. Clinton's speech outlining the proposals, "it's encouraging that the President of the United States takes the issue so seriously."
To some delegates, the American proposal looked puny because the 1992 treaty already obligates rich countries to aim at capping emissions at 1990 levels in 2000. Instead, United States emissions in 2000 are expected to be 13 percent higher than they were in 1990. Some European Union officials say the Europeans as a group will meet the goal.
"It seems to me that the United States proposal is even less" than what was originally contained in the treaty, since it would delay the 1990 stabilization goal by 10 years, said Dr. Mark Mwandosya of Tanzania, the chairman of the developing country caucus in the talks.
But there is another way of looking at what the American proposal would mean. Even before its features were known, Mr. Zammit Cutajar had pointed out that 1990 was not a magic number. The way to measure a proposal, he said, is by gauging what it would actually mean in emissions terms. By that standard, the United States would reduce its emissions about 25 percent from where it would otherwise be around 2010, the Administration said.
"It would be, admittedly," said Dr. Mwandosya, especially since the United States is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world. "But is it enough to pull the rest of the world toward stabilization of concentrations? I don't think it is." Others noted that the United States target and timetable would require countries already below or approaching 1990 levels to do little or nothing.
Everyone agrees that it will eventually be necessary to reduce emissions well below 1990 levels if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are to be stabilized. This is because 1990 levels were already too high; the overall concentration of gases in the atmosphere keeps going up at that level of emissions.

HEADLINE: In Boise, Manhattan Kvetching Is Familiar as a Bagel

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho

 BODY:
It's probably safe to say that in Murphy, population 65, a dusty remote town in Owyhee County, in the desert about 40 miles south of here, there isn't a great deal to do at night. Still, Dick Freund, the Chief Deputy Sheriff, finds time for only a few hours of television a week. He's discerning; everything he watches takes place a world away, in New York City.
" 'Seinfeld,' 'Mad About You,' 'Law and Order,' 'N.Y.P.D. Blue' -- those are the only shows I watch," said Mr. Freund, who, at 49, has never been to New York and doesn't want to go. 
 "I guess what I see on TV, I take as valid," he said, adding that the shows only confirmed his feeling that the city was full of cold, uncaring people and not a few nuts. So what's the appeal? He likes the main characters, he said; they're like guides. Through them, "you can relate to the city," he said. "But you don't have to be there to experience it."
Mr. Freund's television habits are not unusual in this region, where The Boise Weekly, an alternative newspaper, recently posited the question to people on the street: What does the H. stand for in the name of Boise's Mayor, H. Brent Coles? One citizen responded, "The Not Really Happening Brent Coles," adding, 'Maybe he should watch 'Seinfeld.' "
Indeed, "Seinfeld," the NBC comedy about the unadorned, not to say existential, vicissitudes of passing time in New York City, which is frequently the most popular show on television, is particularly happening in Boise, where its ratings almost always top the national average.
It seems almost comically counterintuitive that the residents of this highly conservative, uncluttered, outdoors-oriented city of 165,000, which is as remote as any similarly sized place in the country, would feel a closeness to the likes of Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer. But by the evidence of two days' worth of random conversations here, everyone, it seems, knows them well enough to have an opinion.
"If they let a guy like Kramer walk around the streets without shooting him, they're nuts," said Jim Rigdon, an unemployed builder who on a recent afternoon was drinking orange juice in front of the Buckin' Bagel, a restaurant on Main Street that offers "New York style" breakfast. It was hard to tell if he was being hyperbolic; Mr. Rigdon is a dry fellow. He doesn't even like the show -- "I think it stinks" -- though apparently he watches it.
Like many people interviewed, Mr. Rigdon, who has never seen New York, spoke of the world of "Seinfeld" as a somewhat alien one. Granted, Kramer is a bit unusual no matter where you live. But it appears that New York itself is part of the appeal.
Similarly high ratings, relative to the rest of the nation, hold true here for NBC's other New York-based comedies, "Mad About You" and "Friends," and its crime drama "Law and Order." And those shows rank unusually high in several other small-market cities, including Columbia, Mo., Des Moines; Portland, Me., and Minot, S.D. In Boise, the other networks' New York shows -- like "Spin City" and "N.Y.P.D. Blue" on ABC and the new CBS police drama "Brooklyn South" -- have made an impression, too. People speak of them knowledgeably and, more often than not, fondly.
 
Reveling in Realism, Even a Shooting
"I like 'N.Y.P.D. Blue', and that new one, 'Brooklyn South' -- I don't know if it will last, but I liked that first episode I saw, when the cop was shot," said Jim Warren, 73, who owns the Circle DJ Ranch where he farms sugar beets in Eagle, just north of here. Mr. Warren, who was last in New York City in 1949, said it was the persuasive realism of the shows that appealed to him. "I've always thought a lot of New York," he said. "I remember 42d Street used to be kind of trashy. They ever clean that up?"
New York, of course, has always had an island-off-the-coast-of-America relationship with the rest of the country. But never have so many images of it been pumped forth into the nation on television. At the same time, with the onset of the information age, America itself has grown to be much more like New York -- more cosmopolitan and sophisticated, that is -- than it ever has been.
Boise, for example, with its wide-open spaces, the Sawtooth Mountains and the Payette River nearby, affording spectacular opportunities for backpacking, mountain biking, rafting and kayaking, is a place where the rugged outdoors dominates life. But it is also the county seat and the state capital, and it is a high-tech city, where Micron Computers and Hewlett Packard together employ 15,000 people. The headquarters of several large corporations are here, including Albertson's, the grocery chain.
Downtown, though not exactly mobbed, is nonetheless busy at night, with contemporary bars, coffee houses and outdoor cafes crowded together on Idaho and Eighth Streets. On a recent Friday evening, the Boise State University homecoming parade, almost impossibly wholesome, didn't hold up much traffic on Main Street. But later on, the same stretch was much busier, becoming something of a drunken carnival. Police lights twirled on every corner. There is a strained youthful vigor to the area, a palpable sense that the cow town has evolved into regional capital.
The transition to New West has left Boise with a bit of a split personality, a family-values town that turns up its nose at out-of-the-closet "Ellen" but finds hilarity in the "Seinfeld" episodes about masturbation and flatulence. It's the kind of place that has begun to breed young adults who aspire to hip and complain of boredom.
"I don't have any friends like the characters on 'Friends,' " said Janell Tillotson, 29, a cashier in a coffee shop. "But it's not that I wouldn't like to."
Perhaps not surprisingly, a question many Boiseans could not answer was whether they were attracted to the New York shows because the life depicted felt familiar or because it felt strange.
"The apartment living aspect of it is something I just can't relate to," said Scott Montgomery, 44, a software engineer at Hewlett Packard. "I need wide open spaces. But all that goofy stuff about dating, what do you do on a first date, all that stuff with Jerry and Elaine, who used to be intimate and now they're not, but they talk about what it was like when they were intimate. I've been single so long, I can really relate to that aspect of it."
 
No Longer Another World
Boise has also been visited by the kinds of urban problems it never had before. During the last 20 months, there have been several violent incidents involving the police, resulting in seven deaths, including the first fatal shooting of a police officer in Boise in a century. Several Boiseans interviewed said the incidents made shows like "N.Y.P.D. Blue" and "Law and Order" feel closer to home. One of those was Mayor Coles.
"Until we had these shootings, I just thought that was another world," he said. Mr. Coles said he was surprised to hear of Boise's love affair with New York television.
"We're also the cracker eating capital of the world," he said. "Did you know that? I guess we're just chomping on Ritz and watching these shows."
More seriously, he theorized that Boiseans, who are overwhelmingly white, might be attracted to the melting pot they see on television. "We have a large Basque community here," he said. But asked for the racial breakdown of the city, he smiled ruefully.
"You're looking at it," he said. "But you watch these shows, and there's diversity of thought, of life style, of race."
The Mayor does, incidentally, watch "Seinfeld" on occasion, but on this night he was in his office with three of his five children, watching Michael J. Fox as the Deputy Mayor of New York in "Spin City," a show he prefers. When the bubbleheaded Mayor, played by Barry Bostwick, grants a favor he knows he should not have granted and says to himself, "I've got to learn how to say no," Mayor Coles hooted.
"Now that's realistic," he said. "That's exactly what a mayor does."
Still, most of the show concerned the sex life of Mr. Fox's character, and the constant innuendo wasn't lost on Mr. Coles's 10-year-old son, C. J.
"There are some things in it I wish weren't," the Mayor said with a shrug. Which begs the question of what is in these shows that makes them worthwhile, that makes it possible to accept a world that appears to be at cross purposes with local predilections.
One answer to that comes from Deputy Sheriff Freund, in Murphy. The police shows, he said, depict human tragedy and how people deal with it. In them, he said, "people still take time to help one another."
And the comedies? "Well, what I get from 'Seinfeld,' " he said, "is people who are friends, and who stay friends no matter what. It's that bonding thing, and you don't see that too much."
These shows, he concluded, "have some redeeming social value."

HEADLINE: At Toyota, 10% Share Is Viewed As a Start

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
HIROSHI OKUDA is talking "Global 10" again, which means trouble for the world's auto manufacturers. Global 10 was the 1980's battle cry of the Toyota Motor Corporation, which aimed for a 10 percent share of the global market. But in the early 90's, as trade tensions with the United States flared and Toyota floundered, the slogan was quietly abandoned.
Now, however, Japan's largest and most powerful auto company is out to gain market share again. And spearheading the drive is Mr. Okuda, the blunt-talking judo black belt who became president two years ago. 
 The first leader in nearly three decades who is not a member of the founding Toyoda family, Mr. Okuda is shaking up the conservative company, where many managers go to work in regulation blue blazers with red company insignia on the lapels. "He's asking us to move the company at a faster pace," said Toshiaki Taguchi, a director.
In the United States, Toyota's market share rose to 5.7 percent for the 1997 model year, from 5.3 in 1996. The Camry, whose redesign last year was polished off with a price cut of nearly $1,000, became the best-selling car of 1997, surpassing the Ford Taurus and Honda Accord.
Not bad for a plain vanilla car. But then dependability, not pizazz, has always been Toyota's trademark, though there are exceptions. The stubby but cute RAV4, for example, helped to define the new category of small sport utility vehicles.
The luxury Lexus doesn't scream "look at me" either. But its sophisticated, trouble-free technology and its quiet, floating-on-air ride have attracted attention. Not surprisingly, it is the car of choice among Microsoft's newly minted millionaires.
Toyota, the world's third-largest auto maker, already has, by its own count, nearly 9.5 percent of the world market, behind 17 percent for General Motors and 13 percent for Ford. So, while Mr. Okuda said in a recent interview that he hoped to achieve Global 10 in little time, he made it clear he does not want to stop at 10 percent.
"In the near future, we want to be parallel with the Big Three, especially G.M. and Ford," he said.
It might seem surprising that Toyota, the company whose manufacturing concepts like just-in-time parts delivery are emulated by the industry, would need a makeover at all. But starting around 1992, the company ran into trouble when Tatsuro Toyoda, the founder's younger son, took over the presidency from his older brother, Shoichiro. Tatsuro proved to be a weak leader when the company faced tough challenges. The Japanese economy fell into a deep slump and the yen rose sharply against other currencies, making it much more difficult to export cars made in Japan. Japanese consumers began shunning conservative Toyota sedans in favor of mini-vans and sport utilities made by Honda and others.
In 1995, Tatsuro Toyoda collapsed from high blood pressure, the company said. He was replaced by Mr. Okuda, an executive vice president who had joined Toyota 30 years before as an accountant.
Six feet tall with sideburns and black-rimmed glasses, Mr. Okuda stands out in Japan. And in a country where people hem and haw to avoid confrontations, he speaks his mind, even in English, which is passable but not perfect. He has not hesitated, for instance, to deride Detroit for failing to produce cars suited to the Japanese market.
Toyota is growing around the world. In the United States, it has enlarged its Kentucky plant, which has begun producing a new mini-van, the Sienna. It is building a pickup plant in Indiana and an engine plant in West Virginia. Combined with a Canadian factory, Toyota will be able to make 1.1 million vehicles a year in North America within two years, compared with 870,000 cars now. Yet another new plant is being considered.
The company has become more aggressive with alternative vehicles. It has developed the first hybrid car for mass production, combining a battery-powered electric motor with a small gasoline engine for extremely low emissions and fuel economy of up to 66 m.p.g. Called the Prius, the $18,000 car goes on sale in Japan in December.
Nor has Mr. Okuda relented on intensive cost-cutting that began when the yen soared in 1993. At first, Toyota stumbled a bit by "decontenting," or saving money by taking items and options out of cars. A new Corolla introduced in Japan in 1995 failed because it looked cheap. But Toyota has learned to economize in ways consumers rarely notice, as in not painting places that are not visible.
In Japan, Mr. Okuda is crusading to recapture the 40 percent market share it lost a few years ago. It has engaged in such aggressive sales tactics -- including increasing sales figures by pressuring dealers to buy their own cars -- that smaller competitors are crying foul.
Despite his gung-ho approach to cars, Mr. Okuda is accelerating Toyota's diversification into telecommunications, pleasure boats, aviation and other businesses. And so far, profits are soaring under Mr. Okuda. But that is largely a result of the yen's decline in the last two years. It remains to be seen whether his goals will be achieved.
Toyota is still shy of a 40 percent share in Japan. Mr. Okuda conceded that there are staff criticisms that Toyota is stretched too thin by rapid product introductions. In the United States, analysts expect the best-selling Camry to be dethroned next year by the all-new Honda Accord.
And trade tensions with the United States are rising again. Despite his penchant for blunt talk, Mr. Okuda is not blind to diplomacy and politics. Toyota's exports from Japan to the United States are up only modestly this year despite the weak yen that has led to an export boom for Japanese manufacturers. As the biggest Japanese maker, Mr. Okuda said Toyota was trying to keep those tensions in check. While he makes no bones about his desire to take share from Ford and G.M., he said, charitably, "In so many fields we have to learn from them."
 
How Runners-Up Are Faring
 WHILE Toyota and its plain-speaking president, Hiroshi Okuda, are making the most noise now, Japan's other leading auto makers are also in the midst of transformations. Here is a look at their prospects:
 
NISSAN -- In its last fiscal year, Japan's No. 2 auto maker finally became profitable after five years in the red. But that has been largely through cost-cutting and favorable gains from currency exchanges. It still has to prove it can consistently design vehicles that consumers want. "Long term, we've seen a slide in Nissan's share," said Edward Brogan, an automobile analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, who added that there was "no firm evidence" the company was reversing the trend. Nissan's amiable president, Yoshikazu Hanawa, who once headed the company's American manufacturing operations in Smyrna, Tenn., vows to introduce new vehicles more rapidly.
 
HONDA -- This company has been the standout among Japan's auto makers in the last few years. Long more successful in the United States than at home, Honda has seen its sales grow sharply in Japan after introducing successful mini-vans and sport utility vehicles. In the United States, the hot-selling CR-V sport utility and the new, roomier Accord are expected to contribute to the success. Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the president and a former race-car engine designer, gets the credit. He emphasized market needs at a company that had long given free rein to engineers. To do this, he had to change the system established by the company's founder, Soichiro Honda. Now Mr. Kawamoto's challenge is to keep the momentum.
 
MAZDA -- Among Japan's car company chiefs, no one has a harder job than Henry D. G. Wallace. Not only has his company suffered from years of heavy losses and shrinking sales, he does not speak Japanese. Mr. Wallace was installed as president last year when the Ford Motor Company raised its stake in Mazda to 33.4 percent, giving it management control. Since then, Mr. Wallace and other Ford executives have cut costs and instilled more management discipline while trying not to alienate too many of Mazda's Japanese employees, suppliers and customers. Market share in Japan has grown this year, but the company is still weak in the United States and its debt is high. While Mr. Wallace vows to keep Mazda independent, the company is cooperating more with Ford on products.
 
MITSUBISHI -- This company's recent story can be summarized in three letters: G.D.I. Mitsubishi was first to commercialize a gasoline-powered direct-injection engine, which cuts fuel consumption significantly. It is introducing the engine into many of its products in Japan and in Europe, with some encouraging sales results. But because these engines have high emissions, they will probably not be used in the United States, where Mitsubishi has never been a big contender. It is still the subject of a Federal lawsuit contending that female workers at its factory in Normal, Ill., were sexually harassed. These are tough challenges for Takemune Kimura, the president, who was brought out of semiretirement in 1996 when his predecessor was ailing. ANDREW POLLACK

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
A Conversation With Milosevic

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia

 BODY:
"We Serbs have a national characteristic," Slobodan Milosevic said. "We resent being pushed."
His point, which he made repeatedly during a two-hour discussion, was that American pressure on him and on the Serbs in Bosnia was counterproductive. 
 As an example, he cited the strong showing of Vojislav Seselj in the recent Serbian presidential election, in which he led but which was voided because the turnout was too low. Mr. Seselj was involved in atrocities as a paramilitary leader in the Croatian and Bosnian wars and now campaigns for a Greater Serbia. Robert Gelbard, the special U.S. envoy to the Balkans, has called him a fascist.
"It was a great mistake to keep sanctions on us," Mr. Milosevic said. "I told Gelbard it would only build up Seselj, and it did."
As for Bosnia, Mr. Milosevic emphasized that he supported the Dayton agreement and a single Bosnian state. Asked about the idea of partitioning Bosnia, he said: "Partitions are a bad idea."
He has tried to bring the two factions of Bosnian Serbs together, he said -- one headed by Biljana Plavsic, president of the Bosnian Serb entity, and the other by the forces around Radovan Karadzic, the indicted war criminal -- "to make them more civilized. Time and elections will change things" and marginalize the opponents of Dayton, he said. "But you Americans don't understand that, with your black-and-white view of life."
He made clear that he was actively engaged in Bosnian Serb affairs. Although he has been thought to favor the Karadzic faction, he gave some examples of arm-twisting it. For one, he said he had persuaded Momcilo Krajisnik, a Karadzic ally who is the Serbian member of the collective Bosnian presidency, to cooperate with the international task force on retraining police.
"Krajisnik should go," Mr. Milosevic surprisingly added: should be replaced in the Bosnian presidency. But he said that should happen in an election, as the result of gradual changes in attitude rather than outside pressure.
He reiterated his opposition to the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. "Let us try war criminals ourselves," he said -- Serbs resented a court that they saw as aimed at them when "all sides were guilty in Bosnia."
The American view of these matters is altogether different. In Bosnia, real progress in implementing the Dayton agreement has come only with increased energy and pressure by the U.S. and its allies in recent months.
Vojislav Seselj is seen by most analysts as a product of Mr. Milosevic's policies, not of America's. Mr. Milosevic stirred up extreme nationalism among the Serbs when the political appeal of Communism waned, and started the wars that nurtured Mr. Seselj.
Mr. Milosevic's economic policies have also produced a desperation that can turn to extremism. During his 10 years in power the median income has fallen by more than half. Violence of a fascist nature is showing up in such things as brutal attacks on Gypsies.
The U.S. experience is that Mr. Milosevic cooperates, on Bosnia and other matters, only when pressure is applied. That is why the U.S. maintains what it calls the outer wall of sanctions, limiting Serbia's access to international finance.
Europeans have not ostracized Serbia economically. In June, Italian and Greek companies paid $900 million for a 49 percent share of Serbia Telecom. Mr. Milosevic used the money to pay overdue salaries and pensions before the elections.
Mr. Milosevic is in trouble now. In July he moved to the presidency of rump Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro: a ceremonial post that he planned to make powerful by constitutional change. But Montenegro has just elected an anti-Milosevic president who could block those plans -- if Mr. Milosevic lets the election result be honored.
In the former royal palace where he now has his office, he projects a calm, cherubic charm. He still has control of Serbia's army and police and most of the press. He has thrived on chaos in the past, surviving by guile and force. No one should count Slobodan Milosevic out.

Hong Kong Jitters Send Dollar To 2-Week High Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
The dollar climbed to a two-week high against the yen yesterday as currency dealers grew nervous about investing in Asia after the Hong Kong stock index plunged overnight.
"People say sell yen and buy Europe at this point," said Jeffrey Yu, a senior dealer at Sanwa Bank. "Anything related to Asia is going to be sold off at this point, and no one knows where to put their money except for the Western Hemisphere." 
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 121.87 yen, up from 120.90 late Wednesday. The dollar was also quoted at 1.7682 marks, down from 1.7868.
Hong Kong stocks dived in response to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's move to raise its overnight interest rates to as much as 300 percent to defend the Hong Kong dollar from speculative attack. Hong Kong officials have vowed to continue defending the Hong Kong dollar's 14-year-old peg to the American dollar, calling it their first priority.
The yen also continues to suffer as currency traders question whether the economic stimulus package proposed by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week will do much to revive Japan's sagging economy.
"The market skepticism about Japanese policy and the economy is leaving the yen vulnerable to the continued fireworks in Asia," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney.
The dollar slumped against the German mark, hurt by nervousness that the United States stock market would suffer after the meltdown in Hong Kong and Southeast Asian stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 186.88 points after being down more than 200 points during the day.
The American stock market's losses prevented the dollar from getting much mileage out of comments from Bundesbank officials, who suggested that German interest rates were likely to stay on hold for the time being.
Buying by Asian investors of traditionally safe European currencies like the German mark and the Swiss franc also indirectly sent the dollar lower. The dollar fell to 1.4639 Swiss francs from 1.4842.
The British pound was quoted at $1.6321, down from $1.6329.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Saddam's Triumph

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Mark the date: Saddam Hussein returned to Mideast political glory on Oct. 23, 1997, in a chamber of the United Nations Security Council.
He did it by forcing America into one of its most humiliating retreats at the U.N. Saddam's victory was particularly tasty because it was given to him by four countries that America has befriended with blood, treasure, trade or all three. He has shown the Mideast that countries the U.S. had counted on would put his interests above America's, given the right price. 
 Saddam's triumph also endangers the risk-taking U.N. inspection teams and their work -- hunting out his hidden nuclear, chemical and germ warfare capabilities.
Saddam's fine day came courtesy of France, which is supposed to be America's ally at least on alternate weekends; Russia and Egypt, which are supposed to be our grateful beneficiaries, and China, whose leader will be honored with a 21-gun salute when he arrives in the U.S. as the guest of President Clinton.
On June 11, the Council voted to apply somewhat tighter restrictions if by Oct. 11 Iraq had not stopped blocking U.N. inspectors searching for Saddam's supplies of weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq had been doing that ever since the gulf war ended in February 1991. It lied, shifted stockpiles around the country and used physical force to cripple the hunt for the weaponry the U.S. and its coalition partners were good enough to leave Saddam when he was defeated.
In a report on Oct. 6, Richard Butler of Australia, the new head of the U.N. investigation commission, spoke of progress on nuclear and chemical warfare inspections.
But he delivered a warning that set U.N. records for clarity. He said Iraq was still using every technique to prevent the inspectors from discovering the whereabouts, number and production sites of Saddam's current weapon of choice -- germ war shells that can be, or already are, loaded on planes and short-range missiles.
Aboard some inspection helicopters, Iraqi "minders" even grappled with U.N. pilots and photographers to prevent them spotting weapon sites.
The Butler report was expected to lead automatically to the threatened new sanctions. The U.S., Britain and seven other countries proposed a ban on international travel of Iraqis responsible for blocking inspections.
A mild sanction, but the four leaders of the Iraqi lobby were eager to fight it. To avoid a Russian, French or Chinese veto, the U.S. and Britain nullified the heart of the June 11 resolution. They proposed that the travel sanctions be delayed another six months, at least. The castrated resolution passed 10 to 0, with Russia, China, France, Egypt and Kenya abstaining, free to oppose sanctions on Iraq in the future.
Diplomats noted that the U.S. had been overpowered at the U.N. by its supposed allies and friends in the interest of its enemy. Not being witless, they noted too that President Clinton had failed to say that he was mad, or even peeved, or would remember the betrayal.
In this kind of crisis, without a voice heard from the White House about the double-cross, no U.S. delegate could do better after a defeat than Bill Richardson. He denounced the Iraqis, praised Mr. Butler and "regretted" the abstentions of its lobby.
But one day it may sink into the consciousness of the American public that the U.S. cannot count on France in the Mideast except to knife us -- or on Russia, Egypt or China anywhere, which should have been obvious long ago.
Why do these people do these mean things to us, daddy?
France and Russia, like some of our other dear ones, have signed oildeals with Iraq already. They work for the day that the sanctions on Iraq will be lifted or so weakened that they can be ignored. Then, contracts in hand, they can rush to the Iraqi trough, just as in good old days before Saddam started the gulf war.
China intends to be signing up Iraqi oil, too. But at the U.N. it has an immediate intent: to show that America is not all that super a power. It can be conned, betrayed and mugged without a twitch or peep from its own President in public, which is the only place it counts. Beijing was passing on a lesson about America it had learned long ago, to its profit and amusement.
Now, let's hear those 21 guns.

Luxury Assisted Living On the Upper West Side

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Hoping to capture a segment of Manhattan's growing elderly population, developers are converting an apartment hotel on the Upper West Side into luxury rental housing that will provide tenants with services and help with daily chores.
At present, 120 of the 217 units in the prewar building at 333 West 86th Street, between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive, are vacant and are being turned into assisted-living units. The studio to two-bedroom apartments, renting for $4,000 to $7,500 a month with hotel-like living arrangements, will offer residents meals, recreation and housekeeping services as well as assistance with dressing and the monitoring of medication. The remaining 97 occupied units are rent-stabilized. 
 The $63 million project is being developed by the Kapson Senior Quarters Corporation of Woodbury, N.Y., and the Philips International Holding Company of Manhattan. They are leasing the 22-story structure, which will be renamed Senior Quarters at West 86th Street, for 45 years from the owner, a group of limited investors. The building is now known as the Cambridge House.
The former lessee, Cambridge House Hotel Inc., ran the building as a residential hotel since the early 1980's. Under the conversion, which began last month and is to be completed next September, improvements like new mechanical systems and elevators and refurbished hallways are also planned. So is the renovation of 21,000 square feet of space on the lobby and lower levels into common areas for the assisted-living residences, like a dining room, beauty salon, convenience shop and activity-exercise room. The top floor will become a library.
"Given the city's demographics, there is a need for such housing, and the building's location in a residential neighborhood close to shopping and transportation supports it," said Evan A. Kaplan, Kapson's president. Despite the complexities of developing a partly occupied building, he said, "With over 100 vacant units, we can make the economics work."
Kapson owns and operates 20 similar projects in the metropolitan area and has 22 more under development, including 4 in New York City. Two of those are a 143-unit building in Kew Gardens and a 206-unit structure in Riverdale. They are being done in partnership with J. E. Levine Builders of Douglaston, Queens, which is the general contractor at the Manhattan project.
Assisted-living residences are among the newer alternatives to nursing homes for older people who need some help, but do not need constant medical care. They have been slow to come to New York City in general and Manhattan in particular because of high development costs and tight regulations.
By separating the housing operations from the health care services, companies like Kapson have found an entry. They avoid the need for state licenses or special permits to develop such projects.
The 86th Street conversion will be among the first upscale projects in Manhattan to offer such housing, though more are planned. They include projects at Battery Park City, at the former Towers Nursing Home site on Central Park West, and on Fifth Avenue between 109th and 110th Streets. One of four redevelopment plans for the old armory, set on one block from 14th to 15th Streets between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, also includes assisted-living units.
The 1990 Census found 953,317 people 65 or older in the city, of whom 102,554 were 85 or older, including 23,315l in Manhattan. That segment of the population, the fastest growing, is expected to rise to 212,000 by 2010, indicating a need for specialized housing with some health service, industry experts said.
"We welcome such housing," said Herbert W. Stupp, the commissioner of New York City's Department for the Aging, "because it provides more options for and another way to keep seniors of all income brackets in the city."
Existing tenants at the 86th Street building, while wary, are taking a wait-and-see attitude about their building's future, said Charles A. Carner, a member of the Cambridge House Tenants Association and a 23-year resident. "There's a sense of cautious optimism," Mr. Carner said. "Any physical improvements made to the building will be a benefit." He said he also hopes the new population will bring stability.
The assisted-living units at the building will range in size from 294 to 1,251 square feet. There is a charge of $1,000 a month for an additional person. Personal care assistance can be provided at extra cost by a Kapson affiliate and will be available to existing tenants.
Mr. Kaplan said he expected most of the renters at the building to be in their 80's and have annual incomes of at least $65,000. He said leasing is expected to begin by December, with occupancy next September.

HEADLINE: Plurality of Workfare Recipients Said to Vote in Favor of a Union

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Slightly less than half the 35,000 workfare participants in New York City have voted in favor of union representation, officials of an organizing group announced yesterday.
The group, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as Acorn, said 17,000 people had voted to unionize. The nays totaled about 300. The votes were cast over four days at 250 polling sites. 
 It was the nation's first informal polling of workfare workers about unionizing. The largely symbolic vote is not binding. The Giuliani administration has refused to negotiate with Acorn leaders, saying that unionizing recipients would institutionalize the permanence of welfare.
"Welfare is supposed to be temporary," the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Randy L. Levine, said. "People are supposed to move off welfare to work. The bottom line here is it's inconsistent for welfare recipients to become city employees."
The organizing director of Acorn, Jon Kest, said his group would request a meeting with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"There is nothing in the law that prevents the Mayor from recognizing the W.E.P. workers," Jack Sheinkman, president emeritus of the former Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, who is assisting the drive, said at a news conference in Greenwich Village.
Several people who work in the program called the effort an important step to better conditions. In the city, participants typically work 20 hours a week in jobs like street cleaning and mopping hospital floors in exchange for $100 in welfare benefits.
Workers complain about not receiving the proper equipment. "There are some ladies who work outdoors with no bathroom facilities," said Sheila Duncan, 48, of Harlem, who has received workfare for about a year, since being laid off as a staff analyst at a bus service.

HEADLINE: Britain Reviews Iraqi Request to Free Millions in Frozen Funds

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The British Government says it is weighing a request by Iraq to release some of the $760 million in assets frozen in 1990 so that Baghdad can pay for a legal defense against billions of dollars of claims stemming from the Persian Gulf war.
Iraq plans to use the money to hire a London law firm to combat the approximately $200 billion in claims filed by individuals, corporations and governments for losses incurred in the war. 
 A spokesman for the British Foreign Office, Carne Ross, said "the case is under review and no money has yet been released." Mr. Ross said Iraq did not specify how much of the money Britain froze in 1990 would be used to pay legal costs.
In Washington, a State Department official said the Clinton Administration had urged Britain to refuse the request, which was made earlier this year. The United States, the official said, believes the Iraqi Government has more than enough money in hand to hire lawyers.
"We've raised our concerns with the British and we hope they do the right thing," the official said.
Mr. Ross said the request was lodged earlier this year, but refused to say when. Iraq did not ask for a specific amount of money to be unfrozen, butlegal observers said lawyers defending such complex cases typically charged millions of dollars.
If Britain agrees to end the freeze, it would be the first exception by London since the moneywas frozen seven years ago, Mr. Ross said.
A United Nations commission in Geneva has been arbitrating the claims and Iraq's Ambassador to Geneva, Barzan al-Tikriti, said in a letter to The New York Times that the "harsh economic situation" meant Iraq "lacks the financial resources needed to pay for lawyers."
After the gulf war, the Iraqis agreed to pay claims approved by the United Nations Compensation Commission. A huge number of those were individual claims. As a result of the 1996 oil-for-food deal, the commission has been receiving $100 million a month to pay the hundreds of thousands of claims.
With the individual claims largely decided, the Geneva-based commission is turning its attention to the most costly claims. The Kuwait Government, for example, is hoping to recover the largest single amount, $130 billion. Corporations from around the world have entered claims for billions of dollars.
In July 1996, the Iraqi Government hired a prominent Geneva law firm, Lalive and Partners, to argue that it should share in some of the oil sale revenues to spend for legal advice.
The commission's governing body, whose membership mirrors that of the United Nations Security Council, rebuffed Iraq's bid for money, telling the country to make its case at the United Nations.
Instead, the Iraqis sought to unfreeze assets in Britain, hiring Teacher, Stern and Selby, a law firm specializing in education, medical and insurance law. Its senior partner, Jacob I. Rabinowicz, declined comment when reached by telephone in London.
In his Oct. 17 letter, Mr. Tikriti said "there is nothing in the Security Council resolutions which prevents states from releasing Iraqi assets frozen" in various countries to finance its legal representation.
An American official said that Britain was close to releasing the funds, and that the issue was being handled delicately because Britain and the United States are "good friends and allies." British officials, insisting on anonymity, expressed sympathetic views toward the Iraqi situation.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Soar as Investors Seek Safety in Stock Plunge

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasuries rose sharply yesterday, largely because of a "flight to quality" by investors seeking safety in United States Government securities after the selloff on stock markets.
The 30-year Treasury bond surged 1 14/32, to a price of 100 29/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, dropped to 6.31 percent, from 6.41 percent on Wednesday. It was the lowest yield since 6.23 percent on Oct. 7. 
 The stock plunge in Hong Kong spilled over to other markets, including American stocks, driving many investors to buy bonds.
Traders said activity among retail investors and central banks, including foreign participants, was heavier than usual yesterday in the Treasury market. Dealers said investors were paying higher prices for liquidity with international markets in flux.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the international situation would be examined when the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee meets next month.
Still, he added, "domestic considerations, particularly the outlook for inflation, will remain the central focus of discussion."
On that front, the Government reported yesterday that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose last week to a higher-than-expected level, a possible sign of easing in the labor market, which would lessen the chances of higher inflation. The report, which showed that claims rose by 8,000, to 315,000, helped support the gains in bonds.
Next week, investors will get several significant economic reports and the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, will testify before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
Also on the schedule for next week are the auctions by the Treasury of new two- and five-year notes, and its announcement of the size of its quarterly refunding of debt.
"While Chairman Greenspan's testimony will certainly take center stage," Mr. Fine said, the Employment Cost Index for September, to be reported on Tuesday morning, could shake the bond market if it is noticeably above or below expectations.
But other economic reports could also have a big influence on the Fed's decisions on interest rates. Mr. Fine said he thought that reports on sales of new and existing homes in September would continue to point to a vibrant housing sector. Data on durable-goods orders and inventories for that month will give an early hint of industrial production in the fourth quarter.
And Mr. Fine said he expected a report on consumer confidence to show that buyers were still optimistic. The Fed will also issue its report on regional economic conditions.
David Ader, director of fixed income at Technical Data in Boston, agreed that the drop in international markets might reduce the chance of a rate increase by the Fed. "For today at least," he said, "if I had been giving the Fed a 40 percent chance of raising rates over the next couple of months, I might lower those chances to 25 percent."
Still, Mr. Ader contrasted the situation in Southeast Asia with the crisis in Mexico with the devaluation of the peso in 1994. He recalled that the Fed was not hesitant to raise rates as Mexico's troubles deepened. "And Mexico is nearer and dearer to us than Hong Kong," he added.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's note auctions, securities firms were offering the new two-year notes at a price to yield 5.79 percent, and the five-year at a price to yield 5.94 percent.

HEADLINE: Trading on the Pollution Exchange;
Global Warming Plan Would Make Emissions a Commodity

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
If President Clinton has his way, rights to spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere will eventually be traded by energy producers, utilities and even investors on exchanges the way pork bellies, German marks and interest rate futures change hands today.
 While the Administration's plan for curtailing greenhouse gases -- announced Wednesday in preparation for the world climate change talks in Kyoto, Japan, in December -- demands no immediate action by businesses, it confirms that a system of tradable emissions permits will figure prominently in any long-term effort to control pollutants. Such a system, already being used under the Clean Air Act of 1990 to cut sulfur emissions, would allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused "rights" to pollute. 
 The reliance on free markets in reducing carbon emissions to 1990 levels has been greeted with enthusiasm by specialists who have long argued that managing the task with traditional regulation would be hugely wasteful.
"An approach that promises to reduce the cost of containment by 90 percent is certainly worth a try," said Richard Richels of the Electric Power Research Institute in California.
But many economists caution that emissions trading is no panacea. They emphasize the desirability of bringing developing countries into the trading systems as soon as possible and the need for care in designing the control mechanisms that will redirect billions or even trillions of dollars in pollution-control investments worldwide.
"At this point, the learning is more important than the doing," suggested Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute, a research group in Washington.
The Administration's plan has been criticized by many foreign governments that will also attend the Kyoto conference, where the participants will try to work out a global climate treaty. The critics say the American plan is not aggressive enough because it would not roll back emissions to 1990 levels until sometime between 2008 and 2012. Whatever happens in Kyoto, Mr. Clinton seems committed to emissions trading.
It is no secret why: It costs less and keeps Big Brother in the background.
To date, the most ambitious use of tradable permits has been in containing the sulfur emissions from power plants that contribute to acid rain. Under the Clean Air Act, total sulfur emissions were capped by giving electric utilities rights to emit sulfur roughly in proportion to their lower, 1980 emissions levels. Companies that reduce emissions below their allowance by closing plants, switching fuels or attaching chemical scrubbers to their smokestacks are free to sell their surplus pollution rights, while others are free to exceed their limits by buying those rights.
The market for sulfur emissions has flourished as utilities with low-cost sources of clean fuel have found it profitable to operate within the Government standards and sell part of their allotments to pollute. Last year, the market price of sulfur allowances averaged just more than $100 a ton.
"Emissions have been reduced at a cost far lower than the most optimistic forecasts," said Richard Sandor, the chief executive of Centre Financial Products and vice chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade.
Some economists are confident that similar serendipities await a trading system for carbon dioxide and perhaps other greenhouse gases. Global warming occurs when such gases accumulate in the atmosphere, trapping heat.
"Since none of the effect is localized, carbon is a perfect pollutant for emissions trading," argued Dan Dudek, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund who was instrumental in pushing through the sulfur program in 1990.
But many a slip is possible between cup and lip. For one thing, the scale would be much larger. A few hundred utilities with a few thousand power plants emit most of the sulfur regulated under the Clean Air Act. Carbon dioxide, however, comes not only from power plants but also from hundreds of millions of boilers and vehicles, which could not possibly be monitored like electric utilities.
That suggests the need for a different approach, says Robert Stavins, an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. He suggests that producers of coal, oil and natural gas be required to obtain emissions permits equal to the carbon content of their products rather than putting the burden on fuel consumers.
Limits on volumes that could be sold would raise the competitive price of all carbon fuels. But because coal emits more carbon dioxide for every unit of heat than natural gas, the price of coal would rise far more than the price of gas. That would give utilities an incentive to abandon coal.
Under the sulfur trading system, electric utilities receive roughly $1 billion (at current trading prices) worth of permits free each year -- a large but not overwhelming benefit to a $100 billion industry. And because utilities are regulated by the states, virtually all of the saving is passed on to rate payers. By contrast, if fossil-fuel producers received free carbon permits, there is no reason to think that the windfall, which could measure in the tens of billions of dollars annually, would go to consumers.
The Government would, in theory, have the option of auctioning carbon emissions permits rather than giving them away. But the political battle over limiting emissions is likely to be fierce: reducing carbon output to 1990 levels, for example, would almost certainly require phasing out coal as a boiler fuel within a few decades. Thus, while economists see merit in auctioning permits and using the proceeds to cut other taxes, coal producers and their unions would most likely work aggressively to block legislation that did not give them a big piece of the action.
The potential gains from international trading of carbon emissions permits are even greater than from domestic trading. While the industrialized world has a multitrillion-dollar investment in boilers and engines that would have to be scrapped rapidly to reach 1990 emissions levels, the third world has opportunities galore for easy carbon conservation.
Buildings have not been insulated; industrial boilers have not been retrofitted with efficient combustion systems. Most important, rapidly growing economies -- notably China -- have yet to sink huge sums in modern coal-fired boilers or fuel-hogging vehicles.
Opportunities to weaken the link between economic growth and carbon emissions are complemented by opportunities to preserve natural carbon "sinks" -- vast inventories of carbon stored in trees. Two big utilities, American Electric Power and Pacificorp, along with British Petroleum, are experimenting with a program to spare five million acres of forest in Bolivia from logging in what amounts to an act of philanthropy. The estimated cost of sequestering a ton of carbon this way is just 37 cents, less than 1 percent of the cost of many emissions-reducing industrial projects contemplated for Europe and North America.
The intuition that the greatest opportunities are in poor countries is borne out by computer simulations. William Nordhaus of Yale University estimates that the cost of meeting the developed world's commitment to getting back to 1990 emissions levels would be cut by at least 85 percent if the containment largely consisted of paying developing countries to adopt a carbon-lean growth strategy.
A strategy that used international trading to focus on containing carbon emissions in developing countries would also pay local dividends, such as reducing urban pollution. "Increasing fuel efficiency and switching to natural gas would incidentally mean lower levels of smog, which now threatens health in virtually all the big cities," notes Mr. Dudek of the Environmental Defense Fund.
Unfortunately, the difficulties in creating and enforcing a trading system that crosses borders are formidable, beginning with the problem of apportioning the initial obligations to contain carbon.
The European Community wants to start from a 1990 emissions base line, which would cost it little because Europe would receive credit for the conversion of Britain and eastern Germany from coal to natural gas in the 1990's. Meanwhile, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and most of the rest of the third world want controls to kick in only when their per capita emissions have reached parity with the West -- a formula for doing nothing until the middle of the next century.
Thomas Schelling, an economist at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, emphasizes the distinction between making promises to reduce emissions by some amount at a certain date and translating talk into action. "Global emissions trading is an elegant idea," he said, "but I cannot seriously envision national representatives sitting down to divide up rights in perpetuity worth a trillion dollars."
That explains why President Clinton, who on Wednesday reaffirmed that "developing countries must participate in meeting the challenge of climate change," seems willing to fudge the issue for a while by encouraging voluntary investment of American cash and technology in third world efforts to contain emissions.
The American Electric Power-British Petroleum forest preservation project in Bolivia fits the model well. And Mr. Clinton is apparently planning to bolster such voluntary efforts by guaranteeing participants credits against mandatory emissions limitations highly likely to be imposed after 2008.
But Mr. Stavins of Harvard argues that monitoring such deals is bound to be problematic. Apart from the practical issues of insuring compliance in countries with inadequate infrastructure, corrupt governments and courts unwilling to enforce contracts, he is concerned that in agreements between companies, "both parties will have powerful incentives to exaggerate the gains."
American policy makers thus face some difficult issues. Market-based strategies to contain global warming promise far more bang for a buck than traditional regulation. But carrying out such efforts poses new problems that engender skepticism, even among free-market advocates. "We just have not thought through the mechanics of international trading," argued Mr. Nordhaus of Yale.
That is why many economists and some environmentalists are quietly pleased with the part of the Administration's plan that would delay mandatory market-based limitations for another decade.
"If it's worth doing," argued Paul Portney, president of Resources for the Future in Washington, "surely it's worth waiting long enough to do the job right."

"Meeting the Goal on Greenhouse Gases"
A Clinton Administration plan to reduce the amount of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere to 1990 levels would allow companies several options to meet that goal. Here is how it would work.
A factory could try to reduce its emissions by upgrading its equipment or using cleaner fuel sources. If it did not succeed, it could . . .
 
OPTION 1. . . Buy the right to emit more heat-trapping gases from a company that has reduced its emissions below its target level.
OPTION 2. . . Pay to preserve forests. Because plants absorb carbon dioxide, the most prevalent heat-trapping gas, preservation of trees increases the amount of carbon dioxide the planet can handle.
OPTION 3. . . Pay to modernize a plant in a developing country and reduce its heat-trapping gas emissions.
(pg. D1)
 
"Benefit of Trading Pollution Rights"
A study by William Nordhaus, an economics professor at Yale University, suggests that allowing companies and countries to buy and sell the right to emit heat-trapping gases could significantly curtail the cost of reducing overall emissions.

The House of Representatives failed for a second day in a row to vote on a bill that is needed to release $2.3 billion that is supposed to pay for new high-speed Amtrak trains.
But whether the railroad will actually get the trains is uncertain, because provisions in the bill set limits on liability suits, which the Senate refused to discuss last year. And even if Amtrak gets the money, some officials think it may have to be spent instead on operating expenses, like raises for track workers who are threatening to strike. 
 "This is probably the last chance to save Amtrak without a bankruptcy," Representative Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Transportation Committee, said on Wednesday before Republican leaders postponed a vote on the bill because they were uncertain whether it would pass. Republicans said this morning that they thought the bill would squeak through, but then postponed a vote again.
On the strike front, Amtrak did not appear to be making progress toward a settlement with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, and the brief extension of a strike deadline lasts until Wednesday. The parties did agree today on plans to let Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit and South East Pennsylvania Transportation Authority commuter trains that use Amtrak rails keep running, at least briefly, in case of a strike. The Federal Railroad Administration must approve the plans.
The union is seeking -- and a Presidential mediating panel agrees -- to have its 2,300 members paid the same as workers doing similar tasks for freight railroads, roughly $3 more an hour for a total of about $18 an hour. But Amtrak's financial condition is bleak, and it says those raises -- applied to other unions, too -- would leave it deeper in the red.
Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, today released a letter that he sent to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, saying that he had been in contact with the track workers and hoped a disruption could be avoided. But Mr. Torricelli said in a telephone interview, "I have a lingering fear that Amtrak might intentionally allow the strike to interfere with commuter rail, to place political pressure on Congress and the President to step in."
The union, on the other hand, appears to want to disrupt only Amtrak, to avoid provoking Congress into ending a strike.
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and others have suggested that Amtrak could use the capital funds to pay for labor settlements, in effect spending the mortgage money to pay the grocery bills.
Congress has already agreed on how much the railroad should get in capital funds, in a tax bill passed this summer. But the Republicans are refusing to give final approval on the funds unless they are linked to the end of statutory protections against layoffs and outsourcing and making those the subject of labor-management negotiations.
And the provision would set limits on damages for passenger victims of railroad accidents. The Democrats complain that this would result in bigger awards to injured people who are highly paid -- and thus could show economic damage if they could not work -- than to children, the elderly and low-income people. Last year the Senate refused to take up a bill with the labor changes because it included these liability provisions.

HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: BEIJING;
China Vows Not to Overrule Hong Kong Officials

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Faced with their first major crisis since resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, where the stock market went into free fall and lost 10.4 percent of its value today, Chinese officials responded calmly with promises not to intervene or overrule Hong Kong authorities.
Displaying a sophisticated understanding of market pressure, and pointing to the "one-country, two-systems" formula that Beijing has pledged to keep in Hong Kong, China's top banker employed caution and expressed confidence that Hong Kong's financial authorities would handle the situation. 
 "The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has the competence and capability to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar," Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, told a Hong Kong newspaper in an interview to be printed Friday.
At the same time, Mr. Dai sent a signal to speculators by declaring that China was prepared to support the Hong Kong currency, if asked.
One of the main concerns in Hong Kong about Beijing's new rule has been that Chinese officials unfamiliar with modern financial markets might panic or interfere in a crisis.
Technically, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has sole say in the territory's fiscal matters. But if a serious disagreement arose between Hong Kong and Beijing during a financial crisis, it is anyone's guess who would prevail.
In a sense, today was the first test.
Acting calmly, Mr. Dai and other bank officials indicated that even before they took control of Hong Kong on July 1, they had anticipated just such a market meltdown. "We are fully prepared for this kind of situation," Mr. Dai said. "I have full confidence in the Hong Kong dollar."
Economists have been watching with growing bemusement over the last year as China's foreign exchange reserves grew ever higher, reaching $134 billion by the end of September. Mr. Dai acknowledged today that one of the reasons was to protect the Hong Kong and Chinese currencies in a crisis.
In view of the market turbulence spreading across the globe, Mr. Dai said, "The reserves are currently sufficient, not excessive."
Hong Kong's own reserves total $80 billion, and officials at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have pledged to use what is necessary to defend the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the United States dollar of 7.75 to 1.
Just prior to the handover of power to Beijing, there was wide speculation in Hong Kong about whether Chinese authorities would try to support the Hong Kong stock market if it came under heavy pressure. Now that that has happened, however, a senior economist at the Bank of China insisted that it was inconceivable Beijing would authorize such a defensive operation.
"A lot of analysts thought the market became overvalued in the last few months, especially red chips," the economist said, referring to China-based companies listed in Hong Kong. "It makes no sense to support the stock market. It will rise and fall. The currency is what needs to remain stable."
Shen Guofang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, echoed that sentiment. "No administrative agencies will interfere or intervene in the operations of the stock market," Mr. Shen told reporters. "We believe the 'one country, two systems' is being applied well in Hong Kong."
Eden Woon, director of Hong Kong's General Chamber of Commerce, said most business leaders supported the Government's policy. "This is a very political issue," Mr. Woon said. "Everyone sees it as an extremely important sign of stability and confidence in the territory. People know that a loosening of the peg would cost a great deal."

HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Russia and Brazil Caught in Selling Surge

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
What had been an Asian problem looks more and more like an emerging markets problem, as even the most buoyant of these markets, like Russia and Brazil, succumbed to a tidal wave of selling yesterday.
The biggest repercussions were in the countries perceived to have the weakest currencies, and investors were reminded that a diverse portfolio representing many regions of the world does not necessarily provide real protection against a global downdraft. 
 Mutual funds specializing in Latin American stocks have been among the best performers this year, and Russian funds have been even hotter. But yesterday the major stock market indexes fell by about 8 percent in Brazil, 4.5 percent in Mexico and 5 percent in Russia -- two to four times worse than the 2 percent decline suffered by American stocks.
"There really didn't seem to be a place to hide yesterday," said Rajeev Bhaman, co-manager of the Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund. "When the sentiment goes against a class of assets like the emerging markets, everything goes together."
The widespread fallout from the Asian currency crisis, which caused the Hong Kong market to fall 10.4 percent yesterday, started to take a toll on American mutual fund investors, who previously this year have shown some skittishness at volatility in the American stock market.
At T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, investors generally appeared to be moving money out of international funds yesterday and into either United States stock funds or money market funds, said Steven Norwitz, a spokesman. Similarly, at Fidelity Investments in Boston, investors made slight redemptions in international funds yesterday while moving money into domestic growth stock funds or money market accounts, said Teri Kilduff, a spokeswoman. And at Charles Schwab & Company in San Francisco, investors made net withdrawals of $13 million from mutual funds of all types yesterday, a spokesman said.
What happens now in emerging markets around the world could depend as much on the reactions of American mutual fund investors as on the plans of central bankers around the globe.
"If people end up withdrawing capital from these emerging markets, they could all be in trouble," Mr. Bhaman said. "People may end up saying that because things are bad in China, they don't want to lend money in Brazil."
So far, however, the problems have been contained in Asia, and nearly all of the withdrawals from emerging market mutual funds in recent weeks have been from funds that specialize in the Asian and Pacific markets, said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund cash flows.
In the week ended Wednesday, Asian funds suffered net outflows of $53 million, while emerging market funds overall took in $149 million, Mr. Adler said.
Funds investing in the Pacific region had already fallen 10 percent to 20 percent this year, before the sharp declines this week. And while most fund managers say they are attracted by the greatly depressed prices in Asian markets, they have been reluctant to plunge in and buy in the middle of the downturn.
"The question is do you want to get in the way of a falling safe, even though you know there's lots of money in it," said Robert Swift, a senior portfolio manager at Putnam Investments. "Right now, people are stepping aside."
And when they do participate, they are as likely to raise cash in order to brace themselves for possible redemptions by shareholders. "Depending on how fast we see stability returning, I think we could see investors make a high level of redemptions in emerging market funds in the next few weeks," said Angeline Ee, co-manager of the Montgomery Emerging Markets fund.
That could spread the weakness in Asia to other regions. The markets outside of Asia that most worry fund managers include Brazil, which suffers from several of the same negative economic factors that have led to currency declines in Asia.
"We have concerns about the real," the Brazilian currency unit, Ms. Ee said. "Brazil has a current account deficit, a fiscal deficit, and the real is currently overvalued. I think that is why it was hit so hard today."
Brazil is also one of the largest, most liquid Latin American markets, which means that it is one of the first emerging markets that mutual fund managers turn to when they need to sell stocks quickly.
Other, smaller South American markets, however, appear to be less vulnerable.
Certainly, Latin American stock funds still have big gains for the year, as do Russian funds. In Eastern Europe yesterday, Russian blue-chip stocks were hit the hardest, but stocks of smaller companies fell much less sharply yesterday.
Christian Strenger, chief executive of Deutsche Bank's mutual fund unit, said he believed that because much of Russia's economic growth is internally generated, rather than dependent on exports, it does not face many of the dangers that have recently afflicted Asian markets.
Whether Asia experiences the V-shaped decline and recovery that investors saw in Mexico two years ago, or a longer, drawn-out recovery like that experienced in Japan in recent years, depends on who steps forward to help the Asian countries and how willing those countries are to make often-painful economic adjustments.
Not all Asian markets fell apart yesterday, and some managers foresee that the long-lasting effect of the currency problems there will be to make products from Asian countries more competitive.
Stock prices rose in Taiwan, for example, and one big industry there -- makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment -- could find that Asian currency declines have made their products more attractively priced relative to those of American and Japanese rivals.
For investors in emerging market mutual funds, the least effective way to grapple with crisis is likely to be withdrawing money from emerging markets now, only to pour it back in when the stock markets appear on the upswing again is likely to be a fruitless pursuit.
"Emerging markets have gained 15 percent annually over the long term, but that can vary by 40 percent each year," said David Bugen, a financial adviser in Chatham, N.J. "That means you could make 65 percent in two out of three years, but on the other hand it's not unusual to lose 25 percent in a single year."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE GOVERNOR;
Whitman Plays Down the Polls That Show Her in a Tight Race

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., Oct. 23

 BODY:
Expressing cautious optimism about her re-election bid, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman today played down recent polls showing her locked in a close race with her Democratic opponent. But she acknowledged that voters were sending her a strong message to address their concerns over property taxes and auto insurance.
In an interview with reporters and editors at an office in The New York Times's printing plant here, Mrs. Whitman said voters were voicing discontent about those two problems because they did not want her to think "for a minute that you've solved every problem, because you haven't." 
 "They want to keep their politicians honest," she said. "These are the issues we want you to talk about and we're not going to tell you at the end of the day how we're going to vote unless we're satisfied with the way you're going to handle these two issues."
When asked why voters apparently were not giving her much credit for cutting taxes or for helping keep property tax rate increases down, she replied, "Beats me."
But Mrs. Whitman said she thought voters would realize in the final days leading up to the Nov. 4 election that the state's economy was humming and that she had cut taxes, lowered crime, overhauled welfare and created more jobs and new academic standards.
"I think people do appreciate elected officials who keep their promises, and I think that will be reflected on Election Day," she said.
During the one-hour interview, Mrs. Whitman firmly defended her record and summarily dismissed proposals by her challenger, State Senator James E. McGreevey, to reduce property taxes and auto insurance rates. A report on a similar McGreevey interview is to be published next week.
The Whitman interview covered a wide range of topics from the unofficial role that her husband has played in her administration to her plans to spend $215 million on a tunnel in Atlantic City. Excerpts, page B6.
Mrs. Whitman was eager to explain how she would confront the two top problems on voters' minds in a second term. She vowed that she would address them with the same determination that helped her deliver on her 1993 campaign promise to cut state income tax rates during the last four years, a move that won her national notice as a rising Republican star.
"The same focus I put on the issues they were concerned about four years ago, I will put on property taxes and auto insurance," she said, "because those things are too high and we need to get them under control."
Even though the State Legislature had rejected her plan to reduce auto insurance premiums earlier this year, she said she was confident that lawmakers would take it up before the end of the year. She is submitting the same plan to cut rates by allowing consumers the option to limit their ability to file lawsuits after a car accident. Only this time, she said, insurance companies would be required to lower rates for those consumers.
"This has been raised in the course of this campaign to a level that we haven't seen before, and they are hearing this as much as I am hearing it," she said, referring to state lawmakers.
"They know that while it's an issue Nov. 1st, 2d and 3d, it's also going to be an issue the 5th, 6th and 7th. It's not going to go away. They have to take some action or else the public really will be up in arms.
"The Assembly faces an election in two years. People are not going to forget that. And I believe that we have an ability to get it done. Certainly, I have more of an ability to get it done because it's a more comprehensive plan than anything my opponent has put forward. I mean to really provide relief for ratepayers."
Mrs. Whitman attacked Mr. McGreevey's proposal, calling his plan to order a 10 percent mandatory rollback in auto insurance rates unconstitutional.
"Well, first of all, I don't think he has a plan," she said. "He's made statements about what he would do, the first of which is unconstitutional because he's going to roll back, with executive order, a 10 percent rollback." Mrs. Whitman said such an order would be immediately greeted with lawsuits from insurance companies.
"The other part of what he's talking about doing, I can't actually comment on because sometimes he says he'll do it and sometimes he says he won't do it, which is do away with geographic territorial rating," she said, referring to a state law that allows insurance companies to determine rates based on where people live. As a result, New Jersey drivers who live in urban areas pay higher rates than those who live in suburban or rural areas.
On property taxes, Mrs. Whitman also rejected Mr. McGreevey's proposal to create a commission to consider overhauling the state's tax structure, and then to allow voters to choose whether they want higher state taxes or property taxes to cover the cost of public education.
"Send it to the people," she said, her voice indicating sarcasm. "Anything to avoid making a decision. And governors are supposed to be making decisions."
In her second term, Mrs. Whitman said she would continue to give municipalities and school districts the tools to help them keep property tax rates down. She said she was also seeking to change the way that municipal aid is distributed to reward those communities that rein in spending rather than "constantly throwing lots of money."
She firmly rejected any increase in the state income tax or the sales tax to raise revenues. A commission, as suggested by Mr. McGreevey, could recommend increasing both taxes. She said that the tax cut she championed had helped make the state more attractive to businesses and that any increase in the sales taxe would make New Jersey uncompetitive with its neighboring states.
Mrs. Whitman fended off Mr. McGreevey's criticism over her decision to spend $215 million to build a tunnel and roadway in Atlantic City that Donald J. Trump has labeled a "driveway" for his chief casino rival, Steve Wynn.
"The money that the state is spending in Atlantic City is for infrastructure improvement that is critical to Atlantic City," she said. She also said that the project would create 96,000 construction jobs and 16,000 permanent jobs. And she noted that Mr. Wynn was investing $55 million in the project.
Mrs. Whitman was also asked about comments that Ed Rollins, her campaign consultant in 1993, made in Washington at a breakfast on Tuesday. It was at a similar breakfast meeting after Mrs. Whitman's narrow victory in 1993 that Mr. Rollins erroneously asserted that black ministers were paid to keep voter turnout low.
In his most recent remarks, Mr. Rollins suggested that the Governor would not be facing such difficulties in her re-election bid if she had spent less time outside of the state building her image as a national Republican leader.
"Ed Rollins has a penchant for saying things at breakfast that he regrets later on in the day," she said. "That's the best I can say to that."
But when told that Mr. Rollins also said that he thought that she could win, Mrs. Whitman smiled. "Nobody's wrong all the time," she said.
And what about the unofficial role that her husband, John Whitman, an investment banker, has played in her administration?
"Obviously, he is my best friend and my partner, and I talk about things with him," she said. "There's no question about that. And that's normal." She said he has not played any unofficial role, such as meeting with commissioners or aides.
Governor Whitman was also asked what she would do if she lost the race. Without missing a beat, she said she would attend more of her son's lacrosse games at Boston College, where he is now a freshman.
"I did sneak away last weekend," she admitted. "I read that I was supposedly relaxing on Sunday. Well, it was relaxing. It was wonderful. I went up and saw him play lacrosse."
Mrs. Whitman also addressed questions about comments that her husband made about this campaign's being her last campaign ever. "I'm not planning on any other run for anything else," she said. "I'm not looking to this as being a stepping stone to anything else. I just want to be Governor again."

HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: THE CURRENCY BATTLE;
Defending Fixed Exchange Rate at Further Cost to Stocks

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Friday, Oct. 24

 BODY:
How much longer can the bloodletting in stock markets go on?
The damage worsened on the Hong Kong stock exchange Thursday, with the benchmark Hang Seng index plunging 1,211 points, or 10.4 percent, after a 6.17 percent fall the day before. It was the steepest one-day drop there since Chinese forces snuffed out pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in June 1989. 
 The Government pledged to defend the Hong Kong dollar against currency speculators -- a policy that has accelerated the exodus from stocks. Whether the authorities can do so indefinitely is the $80 billion question everyone is asking, from small investors to monetary authorities in Japan and the United States.
"The key issue is really the currency -- the battle between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the speculator in the Hong Kong dollar," said John M. Mulcahy, a vice presi dent of W. I. Carr, a brokerage firm in Hong Kong. "And what we have seen in the market today is a very significant increase in money market rates."
Hong Kong authorities said they had not yet touched an $80 billion foreign-exchange war chest to defend their currency. Instead, they jacked up interest rates as high as 300 percent for overnight deposits. But the consequence of preserving the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the American dollar at a rate around 7.75 to 1, most analysts and fund managers agree, will be further losses in stocks.
"If the peg remains, you'll see a sharp deflation in assets, particularly property assets," said Diahann L. Brown, a vice president at Thornton Management Asia Ltd.. "And property makes up a significant component of the market index."
Already with some of the most expensive real estate anywhere -- this summer, an old colonial home tucked onto the top of a wooded ridge on Hong Kong island sold for $100 million -- there has been rumbling about the prospect of Hong Kong's pricing itself out of competition. In the last two months, the number of tourists has plummeted, particularly from Japan, where Hong Kong was long regarded as a shopper's paradise. Now, Japanese tourists say, Hong Kong is simply too expensive.
Moreover, because of its link to United States currency, the Hong Kong dollar has appreciated 20 to 40 percent against free-falling regional currencies like the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit. This further erodes Hong Kong's competitive position by making its exports more expensive.
Since Aug. 7, when the Hang Seng stock index hit an all-time high of 16,673.27, nearly 40 percent of its value has been erased. The damage has now spread through Asia and started to take a toll in Europe, driving markets and currencies lower.
For much of this week, Hong Kong has been swept by repeated rumors that its dollar, tightly linked to the American dollar for 14 years, would be devalued. "It seems that people are trying to create a level playing field," said Miron Mushkat, chief Asian economist for Lehman Brothers there. "They've brought down the other markets in Southeast Asia, and now they're focusing on Hong Kong."
On Thursday, that seemed only to harden the authorities' line against speculators. "The first priority is to defend the exchange rate," said Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, at a news conference after the market closed. "We believe it is right to do so."
The Monetary Authority's chairman, Joseph Yam, told the news conference that his agency would charge high penalties to traders who needed to borrow Hong Kong dollars to cover their short positionstoday. It "should be a very interesting day," he added.
Ms. Brown of Thornton Management said the authority was certain to do all it could to squeeze speculators. She predicted that interest rates would remain "very, very high" for the next several days. While ordinary lending rates were nowhere near the triple-digit levels of overnight funds, three big Hong Kong banks on Thursday raised the rates they charge their best customers by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 9.5 percent.
Higher rates are bad for Hong Kong because they deter borrowing, slow the sale of property, a key sector of the economy, and drive money out of stocks and into bonds.
Some analysts saw glimmers of hope. Mr. Mushkat predicted victory for the Government over speculators. And Carlton Poon, a director at Worldsec International Ltd, said many Hong Kong stocks were looking cheap.
"There's a 50 percent sale in Hong Kong -- the Christmas sale has started early," Mr. Poon said. "I see this as a buying opportunity."
Mostly, though, the mood seemed gloomy. Throughout the day, small shareholders huddled around trading screens set up in banks. One investor was shown on Hong Kong television staring helplessly at a monitor. "There's nothing we can do," he said.
The newspaper Sing Pao reported Thursday morning that a senior British executive at a major financial institution had committed suicide over the market's collapse. The executive, who was not named in the report, was found dead in his luxury apartment on the high-rent south side of Hong Kong island.
Throughout the day, there was a mixture of anxiety, nervousness and bravado as people sought to plumb the meaning of the market crash and the prospects in coming days. Yet the prevailing attitude was to flee the market until assaults on the Hong Kong dollar eased and interest rates stabilized.
"People have cut quite a bit of Hong Kong from their portfolios," Ms. Brown said. "I'm holding more cash than I ever held. The next three days to a week will be critical."
The turmoil spilled over into world markets on Thursday, from India and Japan, to the financial capitals of Europe, to Wall Street. And China -- which re-established control of Hong Kong, as a special administrative region, less than four months ago -- was not spared.
The so-called red chips, the stocks of Chinese mainland companies that are traded in Hong Kong, have been hammered all week. Once seen as the go-go stocks of the market, in large part out of a sense they had strong backing from Beijing, they have been swept aside in the rush to sell. The newest and brightest issue, China Telecom, traded at 18 percent below its issue price. On the New York Stock Exchange, the company's American depository receipts declined 37.5 cents on Thursday, to $27.625.
Still, a Chinese spokesman, Shen Guofan, said in Beijing that the Government would not intervene in Hong Kong's financial crisis. "The central Government is responsible only on foreign and defense affairs of Hong Kong," Mr. Shen said. "Hong Kong has the strength to deal with it."

HEADLINE: Overruling Justice Dept., Judge Clears Path for Long Island Hospital Systems' Merger

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, N.Y., Oct. 23

 BODY:
Over the objections of the Justice Department, a Federal judge has cleared the way for the merger of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and North Shore Health Systems, hospital officials said tonight.
In a lawsuit filed in June, the Justice Department had charged that the merger would violate antitrust laws, lead to higher hospital rates and inhibit the development of competing hospital systems. 
 Lawyers for the two health care providers told hospital officials that Judge Arthur D. Spatt had informed them late this afternoon that he had ruled against the Justice Department.
"We are awaiting the specific details of his decision, which will be made available to us tomorrow morning," said Richard Klarberg, a spokesman for Long Island Jewish Medical Center. "Until then we can't comment on the decision except to say that our lawyers have told us that we have won."
An aide to Judge Spatt said last night that copies of the decision would be available in the clerk's office at the court house in the morning. The aide declined to comment further.
The merger between the two major Long Island hospital systems would create a health care behemoth with 4,000 beds and annual revenues of more than $2 billion.
The hospitals argued during hearings on the Justice Department's suit that without a merger, they faced a bleak financial future in the rapidly changing world of health care. They said the merger would result in major economies and save consumers $100 million or more each year. Justice Department officials sought to block the directors of the hospitals from proceeding with the merger and are expected to appeal Judge Spatt's ruling. In filing the suit, department officials had said they thought the merger would set a negative precedent. They argued that while they did not oppose the mergers of troubled hospitals, both Long Island Jewish and North Shore were thriving.
The merger had the support of the State Attorney General, Dennis C. Vacco, after he received assurances that it would provide lower costs to health care consumers. On the day the Justice Department filed its antitrust suit, Mr. Vacco said he would not stand in the way of the merger.
Mr. Vacco, whose views were made known to Judge Spatt, said the merged entity would create a health care system that would rival some of the biggest and best Manhattan hospitals and would represent a natural outgrowth of the rapid changes in the health care field.
The merger was also backed by officials of two of the region's largest health care insurers -- Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield and the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York -- whose representatives testified during the hearings.
Justice Department officials could not be reached last night for comment on the judge's ruling.
Both hospitals have signed an agreement with Mr. Vacco, agreeing to return a minimum of $50 million total to the community in the form of new outreach programs. Mr. Klarberg said the hospitals had offered to sign similar agreements with the Justice Department, but the Justice Department had declined.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CANDIDATES;
Tough Talk About the Mob and Charges About Its Money

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Seeking to promote his image as an arch-foe of organized crime, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declared yesterday that his drive to oust the mob from the garbage hauling industry and the Fulton Fish Market had saved companies hundreds of millions of dollars. He vowed that in a second term, he would deploy similar tactics in other sectors of New York City's economy, including the air cargo business at Kennedy International Airport.
Mr. Giuliani's Democratic opponent, Ruth W. Messinger, did not dispute the Mayor's record on organized crime. She tried instead to shift the spotlight to his fund-raising, contending that while he was battling the Mafia, his campaign was accepting thousands of dollars in contributions from people and businesses accused of links to the mob. 
 Both candidates spent the day largely eschewing the glad-handing and baby-kissing of their street campaigning earlier in the week, preferring to give speeches and appeal for votes before interest groups. Ms. Messinger met with clergy at a church in lower Manhattan and then talked to professors and students at New York University before holding a fund-raiser with former Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Mr. Giuliani touted the economic benefits of the New York Marathon in the morning, went to a conference for elderly Hispanic people, held a rally with labor leaders and attended a town hall meeting in Queens.
Last night, both candidates attended festive celebrations of Simhath Torah, the Jewish holiday marking the close of the year-long cycle of Bible readings and the start of a new cycle. Ms. Messinger attended services at her own synagogue, the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, on West 86th Street. Later, she and several members of her campaign staff danced to Hebrew folk music on West End Avenue with hundreds of others, many of them members of Congregation B'nai Jeshurun. Mr. Giuliani went to Forest Hills, Queens, to attend a celebration in Gerald McDonald Park.
In a speech in the early afternoon before two business groups in lower Manhattan, Mr. Giuliani portrayed his fight against organized crime as one of the shining accomplishments of his tenure, saying that before he became Mayor, there had essentially been a "mob tax" in the city -- the difference between the fair market rate and the higher price demanded by the violent cartels that controlled the garbage hauling industry and Fulton Fish Market.
Mr. Giuliani said costs had dropped markedly since his administration and law enforcement agencies like the Manhattan District Attorney's office went after organized crime. For example, he said, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center paid $1.2 million annually for garbage hauling in the early 1990's; now it pays $480,000.
"This is a different kind of city than it used to be," Mr. Giuliani said. "This is now a city in which you can come and do business and the city government will help protect you against criminals instead of sit back and say, 'There is nothing we can do about it.' And isn't that really symbolic of so many of the other changes that we have made in the City of New York?"
The Mayor, a former United States Attorney in Manhattan, also said that he had succeeded in banishing organized crime from the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy. And he pledged that if he won a second term, he would attack the mob in the construction and garment industries, as well as at Kennedy Airport. He acknowledged that to battle the mob at the airport would require the cooperation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Mr. Giuliani has long feuded with the authority and unsuccessfully demanded that it relinquish control of Kennedy and La Guardia airports to the city.
Ms. Messinger, who has repeatedly sought to use the Mayor's fund-raising to depict him as unprincipled, returned to that theme yesterday. Before Mr. Giuliani spoke on organized crime, her aides distributed to reporters a list of thousands of dollars in contributions that the Messinger campaign asserted came from companies or people suspected of mob ties.
The list said the Giuliani campaign had collected separate $1,000 donations from two companies -- Expresso Carting Corporation and Dellvena Carting -- that the Giuliani administration had cited for taking part in the crime cartel that controlled the garbage-hauling industry.
The Messinger campaign said Mr. Giuliani's current and 1993 campaigns had accepted a total of $17,900 from Pile Foundation Construction and its workers. In 1985, in a case brought by Mr. Giuliani when he was United States Attorney, the president of Pile testified that he had bribed a mobster to win a contract, the Messinger campaign said.
"Before he worries about getting mob influence out of the economy of this city," Ms. Messinger said, "he should return the campaign contributions that he has received from people who have been convicted as criminals, who are connected to organized crime."
Asked about Ms. Messinger's charges, Mr. Giuliani replied: "We have returned the money that we felt could create the wrong questions. And we didn't return the money in situations where people would be unfairly accused."
He later added: "The way in which people are playing with reputations is kind of like McCarthyite."
Besides lambasting Mr. Giuliani's fund-raising, Ms. Messinger and her aides also criticized a flier that the Giuliani campaign distributed that refers to her as "anti-police -- pro-criminal." The flier accused Ms. Messinger of helping to "incite two days of riots" in Washington Heights in 1992 by joining a march to protest the slaying of a suspect by the police. The Messinger campaign called the flier inflammatory and untrue. The Giuliani campaign stood by it.
Throughout the day, Ms. Messinger discussed the Mayor's budget cuts, comparing him to Ebenezer Scrooge and Marie Antoinette.
"The number of people looking for shelter has grown," she said, "the number of people looking for a meal for themselves and for their children has grown."
The races for the other two citywide offices, public advocate and comptroller, have been quiet in recent weeks, and it appears that they may attract even less attention in the coming days. The Campaign Finance Board had scheduled debates next week in the two contests, but it will now probably cancel at least the one for public advocate because only the Democratic incumbent, Mark Green, has qualified.
To take part, candidates have to reach at least 15 percent in one of two polls. But Mr. Green's Republican-Liberal challenger, Assemblyman Jules Polonetsky, did not hit that threshold, officials said. It is still unclear whether the Republican candidate for comptroller, Annemarie McAvoy, got enough support in the polls to qualify to debate the Democratic incumbent, Alan G. Hevesi.

HEADLINE: Seeking Glint Of Urban Gold In the Shadows;
At Self-Storage Auctions, Treasure Is a Used TV Set

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
One by one, they thrust their flashlights into the darkness of a cluttered self-storage room, angling cones of light onto a mobile IV pole near the front, a pair of mattresses propped against the right wall, an electric fan way in the back.
Or was that a television? 
 Too late to check. A few seconds later, the door slammed shut. The bidding commenced at $100.
And so began an event that was part scavenger hunt, part "Let's Make a Deal": the auction of self-storage rooms on which people have defaulted.
Each week, New York City is home to at least one of these auctions, in which crowds of 5 to 25 people gamble anywhere from $25 to thousands of dollars on rooms they cannot enter, cannot touch and have but a few seconds to view.
"It's like, 'What's behind Door No. 1? What's behind Door No. 2?' " whispered one person who identified himself only as Luciano from Queens, during a recent auction at Spectrum Mini-Storage, in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. "You could get lucky or you could get garbage."
The spectacle is, for some, a seductive confluence of mystery, hunch and nerves, the next best thing to Atlantic City. For others, it is a voyeuristic chance to examine the likes, dislikes and discards of people who, for whatever reason, could not keep a room.
"It's very archeological," said Kevin Sudeith of Long Island City, Queens, who goes to several auctions a month and sells his purchases at flea markets to subsidize his painting career. "You get to see their culture, background, ethnicity, personal habits and sometimes the series of actions that led them to lose their stuff. It's fascinating."
And a touchy subject, too. Although the auctions are public and listed every Sunday in the local classified advertisements, some participants regard the sales as a bargain-hunter's secret and a members-only event. Few are willing to talk about the practice or even to reveal their names.
Moreover, the auctions are usually guaranteed money-losers. In addition to paying several hundred dollars for an auctioneer and advertising, a storage company can apply the proceeds of an auction only to a customer's debt, according to state law. This means that in the unlikely event that someone makes a bid that is greater than the amount owed, the difference goes not to the storage company, but to the former renter.
Storage companies don't like talking about the auctions, either, because they are concerned that the auctions, officially called self-storage lien sales, suggest the exploitation of other people's misfortunes. The reality, they say, is that the contents of only 1 percent of all self-storage rooms are auctioned off because most of their customers pay on time. (On average, a room measuring 5 feet wide, 8 feet high and 10 feet deep costs about $100 a month in New York City.)
Moreover, the auctions are usually guaranteed money-losers. In addition to paying several hundred dollars for an auctioneer and advertising, a storage company can apply the proceeds of an auction only to a customer's debt, according to state law. This means that in the unlikely event that someone makes a bid that is greater than the amount owed, the difference goes not to the storage company, but to the former renter.
So storage companies mail notices, make phone calls, do everything they can to avoid going to auction, sometimes for as long as four or five months after a customer stops paying the rent. And they will wait until the locks are cut at the auctions to accept payment.
"Auctions are a matter of last resort," said Christopher C. McGrath, president of the New York Self-Service Storage Association, based in Albany. "You don't make any money with an auction. You've lost your customer, and you've lost the use of your space for a time."
Space is crucial to self-storage warehouses, which have a national occupancy rate of 90 percent, said Robert L. Brown, executive director of the national Self Storage Association, based in Cincinnati. And space is -- surprise, surprise -- especially valued in New York City, which has about one-quarter of the state's 400 self-storage warehouses.
In New York City, the warehouses are utilitarian fortresses that can measure one block long and eight stories high. They can be desolate and anonymous places, with numbered rooms standing sentry along long, tenebrous corridors.
The auctions are usually held on a weekday, late in the morning. There are no numbers or name tags; no gavels, either (unless, of course, one turns up inside a storage room).
Rooms are sold to people dressed in T-shirts and paint-splotched pants, and the same people -- flea market dealers, junkyard dealers and others in this underground economy -- tend to show up, giving the proceedings a whiff of familiarity.
There are occasional jackpots: Once, an auctiongoer found eight mink coats, said Nick Sprayregen, president of Tuck-It-Away Self-Storage, which has warehouses all over the city. But usually, there is a hodgepodge of household items such as personal papers, furniture parts and clothing.
Even if the contents have no resale value, the new owners are still obligated to remove everything, which can be a costly and labor-intensive undertaking. So most auctiongoers are happy if they come out ahead.
"You keep buying and buying, thinking you'll find something, but usually, it's really like a treasure hunt that doesn't pan out," said Sandy Kirschner, whose family owns Kershen Furniture Company in Manhattan. "I'm like a tired, wounded veteran."
The number of bidders varies, depending on the reputation of the self-storage warehouse, the weather and other factors. A recent auction for five rooms at New York Security Mini-Storage in Manhattan near the Holland Tunnel, for example, drew only five people because there were other auctions on the same day.
The first stop was Room 6237, where an employee of the storage company used bolt cutters to open a blue corrugated-steel door.
Inside were some gym bags and art canvases -- with their backs turned. "I see a couple of Picassos," intoned a hopeful Milton Levine, the wry and amiable auctioneer. "I don't know; I'm tempted myself."
After the door closed, Mr. Levine opened at $50. A nod from someone in the back. "I got 60 bid. Sixty is bid." A finger from someone else. Seventy. Eighty. And finally, sold, for $90, to a stout man who never did reveal what was on those canvases.
But that was the most action that day. Only one other room solicited a bid (also to the stout man, for $100); the others had no takers, which meant their contents would be discarded by the company, said Adam Blank, the manager of the storage warehouse.
It was a busier scene at Spectrum, one of the city's biggest self-storage companies. About a dozen people showed up to bid on 14 rooms -- and received stern instructions from Ray Brachfeld, the auctioneer, to clean out whatever they purchased, or else forfeit their $100 deposits.
The first room, on the sixth floor, was the one with the mobile IV pole. And Luciano, from Queens, decided that it was worth $100. "Just like the gangster Luciano, I hope I'm lucky," he said, laughing.
The next room was No. 6062. The lock was snapped by bolt cutters, heads bobbed, light bounced from item to item. Then, the door closed. Bidding started at $100; bidding finished at $550 with Mr. Sudeith. It took all of five minutes.
This happened 12 more times, as bidders and Spectrum employees quietly moved from floor to floor using a warehouse elevator. One room had a new couch and a big toy jeep; it went for $250. Another had a halogen lamp and a couple of bar stools, among other things; $190, to Luciano. Then came the last room, Door No. 1102 in the basement. There was but one small leather suitcase -- the ultimate tease, since no one could see if anything was inside.
It fetched $45. What was in it? The couple who bought it would not say.
After the auction, Luciano paid for his two rooms with his American Express card. (Everyone else paid with cash.) Then he took a flatbed cart up to the sixth floor and started to excavate. About that electric fan at the back of Room 6011 ...
"Ah, here we go -- a TV! It's flea market time!" he exulted. "It's kind of sad to think that you're profiting off someone else's misfortune. But that's the way it goes," he added.
As he was unloading some boxes, a card slipped out and fell to the ground. It was a Valentine's Day card, weathered by shoe tread marks and dirt. On the outside, it said, "To My Husband With Love Always." There was no addressee inside; the card was simply signed, "Love, Diane."

Optimism From Whitman

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: EDISON

 BODY:
Expressing cautious optimism about her re-election bid, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman today played down recent polls showing her locked in a close race with her Democratic opponent. But she acknowledged that voters were sending her a strong message to address their concerns over property taxes and auto insurance.
In an interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times, Mrs. Whitman said voters were voicing discontent about those two problems because they did not want her to think "for a minute that you've solved every problem, because you haven't." 
 When asked why voters apparently were not giving her much credit for cutting taxes or for helping keep property tax rate increases down, she replied, "Beats me." But she said she thought voters would realize that the state's economy was humming and that she had cut taxes, lowered crime, overhauled welfare and created more jobs and new academic standards.

Fort Dix to Process Recruits

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: FORT DIX

 BODY:
The Army's processing center for new recruits will be moving from Philadelphia to Fort Dix next spring, taking along about 40 full-time employees, officials said yesterday. The move is expected to add at least $4 million a year to Burlington County's economy, according to figures supplied by the Military Entrance Processing Command.
Once a thriving basic-training camp, Fort Dix was gradually turned over to the Army Reserves and the National Guard at the end of the cold war. 
 Much of the economic impact from the new processing center will come from the families who will visit to see off the young recruits, said Gary Gallant, a spokesman for Representative Jim Saxton, Republican of Mount Holly. TERRY PRISTIN

HEADLINE: Both Parties Were Assisted By Nonprofit Groups in 1996

BYLINE: By JILL ABRAMSON and LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Despite the mountain of documents and videotapes that the Clinton White House has surrendered to investigators looking into campaign finance abuses in the 1996 election, a touch of mystery still surrounds a dinner held in the Blue Room of the White House on July 12, 1996.
That dinner, held by President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, included 60 guests, a select list that the White House has persistently refused to release but has just now surfaced. Some of the guests were wealthy donors who wanted to give money to the Democratic Party but preferred to do so quietly, either because they had business before the Government or simply wanted to avoid having their names appear on public donor lists. 
 The solution was simple, they were told. They could make their donations to an organization called Vote Now '96, which was ostensibly created to encourage voter turnout and, unlike the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton-Gore campaign organization, would not be required to identify the donors or the amount of their gifts. Vote Now '96 ultimately received $3 million in donations in the 1996 campaign.
The Democrats were not alone in their ability to accommodate generous stealth donors. Republicans, too, had special pockets for campaign donations that would not go into publicly scrutinized accounts.
Together, nonprofit groups that received directed donations from both parties took in more than $12.5 million in 1996. And donations to at least two of the groups were tax deductible. While the referral of donors to such groups as Vote Now '96 has received some attention, the full scope of the practice is only now becoming clear as Congress investigates the activities of the groups.
Documents obtained by Democrats on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which has been holding hearings on campaign finance, show that the Republican National Committee steered more than $1 million to allied groups in the last election, including the National Right to Life Committee and a voter turnout group called the American Defense Institute.
Republicans also relied on Triad Management Services, a consulting company that used two affiliated nonprofit groups to take in $3 million in donations that have not been publicly disclosed.
For both parties, friendly nonprofit groups have become the political equivalent of Swiss bank accounts: places where donors can make contributions that are hidden from public view but still help Democratic and Republican candidates and causes. Almost as important, the donors can still receive the gratitude of the Democratic and Republican fund-raisers who steer contributors to these hideaways and keep Washington politicians aware of who their friends are.
Secret donations were a staple of politics before Watergate, when President Richard M. Nixon kept hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash from wealthy Republican donors stashed in a White House safe. Disclosure was a crucial element of the campaign finance reform law passed in 1974. The resurrection of secret political donations, although from more indirect routes, alarms some election law watchdogs.
"It's the equivalent of creating a black market in political influence," said Nicole A. Gordon, the executive director of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, who called such hidden money routes "incredibly destructive and pernicious."
"Complete and accurate disclosure," Ms. Gordon said, "is the first necessary condition for any effective campaign finance regulation."
 
Directing Donors Into the Party Fold
It is legal for the political parties to steer donors to nonprofit groups, but the parties cannot legally tell the groups how and where to spend the money they collect. Yet because the missions of many of the groups dovetail with the election efforts of the two parties -- and in some cases involved participants closely associated with the parties -- the legal distinctions have become blurred.
Nonprofit groups were not the only receptacles for quiet donations. Both parties suggested that donors give directly to state party organizations in some instances, especially when donors were hoping to obscure a large contribution to one side. Spottier disclosure requirements at the state level meant that contributors' donations would be less noticed than if they gave directly to the national political parties.
According to the depositions of two Democratic fund-raisers interviewed last month by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, the Democratic National Committee steered several big donors to Vote Now '96 and to another nonprofit group, the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation.
One such donor to Vote Now '96 was Vance Opperman, a Minneapolis businessman whose company, West Publishing, was involved in a high-stakes merger and had sensitive business dealings with the Justice Department. Mr. Opperman gave the group $100,000 in late October. The merger eventually went through and the company won a $14 million contract with the Justice Department for on-line legal research.
Vote Now '96 also received $450,000 from an international businessman, Gilbert Chagoury, who lives in Paris much of the year and has extensive agricultural business holdings in countries including some in Africa. Mr. Chagoury, who lists a Los Angeles address on records with the Federal Election Commission, made $7,500 in political contributions in 1996, all to the Republican Party. A lawyer for Vote Now '96 was unsure how Mr. Chagoury came to contribute to the organization.
Officials of Democratic National Committee guided Samir Danou, a Detroit businessman who was host for a fund-raiser for President Clinton on Oct. 21, 1996, to give $50,000 to the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation. The coalition worked closely with Vote Now '96 to promote black voter turnout.
Mr. Danou was lobbying the Clinton Administration and Congress to lift the economic embargo against Iraq to help sick Iraqi children. He gave $25,000 to the Republican committee and $20,000 to the Democratic committee in conjunction with the Clinton fund-raiser.
 
Desire for Privacy Is a Motivation
In a deposition, Mark Thomann, a former committee fund-raising official, discussed how a desire for privacy influenced some donations that he had handled. When asked about directing Mr. Opperman to Vote Now '96, for example, Mr. Thomann told Senate investigators: "Vance is a very private person, and when you give large amounts it's obviously public record. I thought it was just basically a privacy matter."
Mr. Opperman and his family took advantage of the state party route to give the Democrats an additional $300,000 in donations to state Democratic parties. When questioned about these donations, Mr. Thomann responded, "I think Vance's wish on the state committees was the privacy issue."
Mr. Opperman and his family gave generously to both the Democrats and the Republicans, although their state donations tipped the scales heavily toward the Democrats.
Privacy, too, said Mr. Thomann, was a factor in the $265,000 given by the Sault Ste. Marie tribe in Michigan to state Democratic parties, a list of which was kept by Harold M. Ickes, who as White House deputy chief of staff in the last election also steered donors to Vote Now '96 and other friendly nonprofit groups.
Mr. Thomann noted in his deposition that the tribe participated "on both the Republican and Democratic side, and by giving too much to one side may upset their friends on the other side." The tribe was worried about angering Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican who opposed some of its casino and land plans.
The tribe did not give to Vote Now '96. But according to a list of the Vote Now '96 guests at the July 1996 White House dinner obtained by The New York Times, the tribe's vice chairman, George Nolan, and Ted Gatzaros, a Michigan businessman who was involved in proposed casino projects with the tribe, were among the guests at Mr. Clinton's table.
Various Democratic National Committee officials, including Marvin S. Rosen, its finance director in the last election, sought contributors for Vote Now '96. The White House dinner was held in part to help generate donations. The mix of guests was eclectic and included major donors to the group, including representatives of the Rockefeller family (Alida Messinger, a family member, gave Vote Now '96 $300,000).
Among the guests were a number of Florida lawyers and businessmen who were close to Vote Now 96's chairman, Hugh Westbrook, a Florida health care executive and Democratic Party fund-raiser.
The dinner list also included big Democratic Party contributors like Mansoor Ijaz, a New York businessman who raised large contributions for the party and lobbied the Clinton Administration to normalize its relations with the Sudan, and Ramesh Kapur, a Massachusetts businessman who also raised large sums for the party. But neither man gave any donations to Vote Now '96.
The Republicans also steered millions of dollars to friendly nonprofit groups and state party organizations. Rupert Murdoch, for example, gave $1 million in donations to the California Republican Party, $750,000 of it in the last days of the election. Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Murdoch, said he was not seeking privacy but gave the money because he lives in California.
The Presidential campaign of Bob Dole and the Republican National Committee were also involved in orchestrating big contributions through similar nonprofit groups, according to internal campaign records. One stalwart Republican Party donor, the Philip Morris Companies, agreed to a request by the Republican National Committee to give $500,000 to the American Defense Institute, which promoted turnout among military personnel.
 
Consulting Company Was Crucial G.O.P. Ally
In all, more than $1 million in contributions from major Republican donors was steered by the Republican committee to friendly nonprofit groups. In some cases, the committee even acted as an intermediary and collected the donors' checks and handed them to the nonprofit groups. This was on top of huge contributions the committee made directly to some nonprofit groups.
The committee gave $4.6 million of its own money to Americans for Tax Reform, a nonprofit group that promoted Republican views on Medicare, and gave $600,000 to the National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion group that aided Republican candidates.
But the Republican Party's most inventive ally was Triad, or Tactical Resources in American Democracy. Founded in 1995, Triad is a profit-making company that funnels money into Congressional races through two tax-exempt groups associated with it: Citizens for Reform and Citizens for the Republic Education Fund.
Triad raised money from conservative donors and sent it to the nonprofit groups that bought so-called issue advertisements on television attacking Democrats and supporting Republican candidates and causes. None of those donations are publicly disclosed and Triad, under investigation by Democrats on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, refuses to disclose its donors.
"Most of the time, if you want to participate in the election and not appear on a disclosure report, the answer is, 'You can't,' " said Mark Braden, lawyer for Triad and the two nonprofit groups.
"For a handful of people who contributed to Reform and Republic, the motivating interest was not to have their names disclosed, and this is really pretty much how you do it. You give through a coalition or any number of other groups that are floating around."
Mr. Braden said some Triad donors had been so concerned about secrecy that they insisted on having written agreements with Triad that their names would not be disclosed unless Triad was ordered to do so by the courts. Still, Mr. Braden said, the majority of Triad's donors had been primarily attracted by the conservative candidates that Triad supported and less by a promise of anonymity.
Robert Bauer, a lawyer who represents Vote Now '96, said its donors had been motivated by a desire to promote voter turnout, not secrecy.
"For years we have relied on the support of donors whose only interest is voter registration," he said.
 
The Financing Of Attack Ads
While Vote Now '96 poured money into voter turnout efforts in heavily Democratic areas, Triad's donors were the invisible hand behind some of the most celebrated negative advertisements of 1996, attacking Democratic Congressional candidates for supporting gay rights and calling one losing candidate a wife-beater.
Neither of the two nonprofit groups associated with Triad was active before the 1996 election. One existed only on paper as of Oct. 11, 1996, when it opened a bank account.
In the next 20 days, from Oct. 11 to Oct. 31, the group, Citizens for Reform, received $1.6 million from Triad donors in 12 bank transactions. By Oct. 31, $1.4 million of this money had been spent on advertisements, documents show. A second Triad-affiliated nonprofit group received $1.7 million in late October for television attack advertisements.
Triad is now financing a $500,000 television advertising campaign opposing organized labors' use of union dues for campaign contributions. This issue has been a rallying cry of the Republican leadership, which has based its opposition to overhauling the campaign finance system on this financial link between the unions and Democratic candidates.
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee had planned to hold public hearings on the use of nonprofit groups by both political parties, including Vote Now '96, Triad and others. But with time running out and the groups' balking over requests to reveal their donors, the hearings have been stalled.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A ROSTER: Nonprofit Groups as Political Players"
The Democratic Party and the Republican Party directed donors to an array of nonprofit groups where the contributions would not be publicly disclosed. Following are some of the groups:
 
VOTE NOW '96
This group, based in Florida for the election last year, accepted money from donors for vote turnout efforts in minority areas that voted heavily Democratic. Fund-raisers for the Democratic National Committee steered donors to Vote Now '96, which raised $3 million for the election last year.
 
NATIONAL COALITION ON BLACK VOTER PARTICIPATION
The goal of this group is to increase African-American voter registration and turnout. The Democratic committee directed a $50,000 donation to the group, which also received a $90,000 grant from Vote Now '96.
 
 AMERICAN DEFENSE INSTITUTE
 This group, which promotes Republican and military issues, received $600,000 from the Republican National Committee in 1996, but returned it because of criticism in the news media. Republican fund-raisers steered $1 million in donations, including a $500,000 donation from the Philip Morris Companies, to the organization. Donations to this group are tax-deductible.
 
 NATIONAL RIGHT TO LIFE COMMITTEE
 The anti-abortion group received $650,000 directly from the Republican committee in the last two weeks of the 1996 election. In addition, Republican fund-raisers steered donors to this group.
 
 AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM
 This group received $4.6 million directly from the Republican committee in October 1996 for a direct-mail campaign supporting the Republican Party's plank on Medicare. Donations were also sent to this group by Republican fund-raisers.
 
 TRIAD MANAGEMENT SERVICES
 This profit-making consulting company supported conservative Republican Congressional candidates. It located wealthy conservative donors and sent their money to candidates, conservative political action committees and two nonprofit groups that sponsored television attack advertisements against Democrats. In the two weeks before the 1996 election, Triad directed more than $3 million to the two nonprofit groups, CITIZENS FOR REFORM and CITIZENS FOR THE REPUBLIC EDUCATION FUND, for the advertisements.

HEADLINE: ON PRO BASKETBALL;
Pay, Then Pray: The Cavs Have Bought a Whirlwind

BYLINE: By Harvey Araton 

 BODY:
Shawn Kemp was suspended this week by the National Basketball Association for leaving the bench during a recent preseason game fight, which should make make the Cleveland Cavaliers feel mighty secure about their $107 million investment in a player they have banked on leading them deep into the playoffs the next seven years.
The ink on Kemp's stunning new contract was hardly dry before he demonstrated that he couldn't even direct himself into the starting lineup on opening night. 
 One game will cost Kemp $107,000 in pay, a relative pittance for someone earning $15 million a year, but in all likelihood, it will also cost the Cavaliers a chance to win their opener in Houston. One mistake does not break a season, yet something tells me this could be the start of a long, contentious, potentially disastrous relationship.
That the future of any franchise has squarely been staked on the shoulders of Kemp tells you how entrenched in this sport is the notion that you are nowhere without a player whose jerseys move off the racks as quickly as Kemp flies off the handle.
It tells you that these teams will commit almost as much money as the franchise itself is worth to a player only they think has the many requirements and qualities of a leading man. They will pay, then pray. If it doesn't work out, the player will invariably be blamed, not management for its stupidity.
This is unstable economics, no matter how much television and merchandising money the sport is earning. It is unsound thinking worse than whatever was going on in Kemp's head when he bolted the bench after Minnesota's Clifford Rozier belted Cleveland's Vitaly Potapenko and Buck Williams wasn't around to remind everyone to sit down.
Maybe Kemp slept through the Knicks-Miami playoff series last spring, which was the excuse he routinely used after violating team rules in Seattle.
Wake up, Shawn. Does the name Patrick Ewing sound even vaguely familiar? Apparently not. What the Cavaliers and other N.B.A. teams may want to consider are taped recordings, similar to the warnings reminding you to take your belongings when exiting the rear of a taxicab.
Considering the number of off-season arrests of N.B.A. players, confining them to the bench via ball and chain might not be that radical an option either.
Kemp is obviously a highly skilled player, although one who is only mildly acquainted with the nuances of the game. In his wonderful baritone voice, he often comes off as reasonable, thoughtful, but then you pick up the newspaper to read that he has skipped a practice, missed a flight and fallen into another sulk about his contract, which has transparently affected his play.
By inflated market standards, he was underpaid last season, at $3 million plus, but then, so was Scottie Pippen, who was mature enough to realize that he couldn't do anything about it except help Michael Jordan win another championship, enhance his commercial appeal and wait for his contract to expire next summer.
Kemp began last season with a 22-day training camp holdout, followed by one act of intransigence after another. His general effort was so casual that by April he was benched by George Karl, the Sonics' coach. Reports that he was drinking heavily were vehemently denied by him and his teammates, but people who know Kemp agreed there was too much baggage from his personal life affecting his play.
"We couldn't continue with what was happening last year," Karl said when the Sonics finally traded Kemp to Cleveland in a three-way deal that brought them Milwaukee's Vin Baker.
One Seattle-area newspaper columnist gave Kemp the following sendoff: "He was irresponsible, chronically tardy, juvenile, bereft of discipline, dedication and commitment."
Oh, well. One team's disruption is another team's destiny. Kemp is bound to enliven things in Cleveland, where Gund Arena had been playing host to remakes of "Night of the Living Dead." But given that Kemp was already signed through 2003, what was the rush in opening the vault? Why wouldn't the Cavs have waited a season to see for themselves what Kemp is like? What were they afraid of -- that he wouldn't try hard for the paltry sum of $3.6 million? Why would they want to marry a player capable of quitting on his team for any amount of money in the first place?
Minnesota recently gave 21-year-old Kevin Garnett $127 million and has its fingers crossed that he will become much more than 17 points and 8 rebounds a game. At least Garnett has behaved himself and shown loyalty to the people who drafted and nurtured him.
Shawn Kemp drove everyone crazy in Seattle, forced a trade and was rewarded with the richest contract in Cleveland sports history. May Kemp and the Cavs live happily ever after -- after he sits out the first game of his Cleveland career.

HEADLINE: Blame Monetarists for Asia's Boom and Bust

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman ("Have I Got a Deal for You," column, Oct. 20) is amazed how many people think China's boom will last forever. As one of these people, let me attempt to explain the seldom-discussed secret of its success and the connection with the recent currency weaknesses of the Asian tigers.
China and Malaysia are the only countries in this part of the world that have maintained negative or insignificant real interest rates, something that is anathema to monetarists from the International Monetary Fund. Even "socialist" Vietnam has followed monetarist advice and maintains double-digit real interest rates. 
 As Mr. Friedman points out, China maintains huge reserves of $125 billion as insurance against attack on the yuan, the Chinese currency, by the international monetarists. Malaysia is naturally attracted to Beijing's model and is the primary target of the currency speculators, including George Soros.
Mr. Soros, although Keynesian in his advice to the advanced capitalist world, is monetarist is his advice to the Russians. The result of Russian dependence on the monetarists for advice was evident to this observer on a recent three-week trip to Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod and the upper Volga.
Russia has all the characteristics of an underdeveloped country with a glitzy Moscow surrounded by rural poverty.

Thai Bank Rumors

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"An 'Asian Miracle' Now Seems Like a Mirage" (front page, Oct. 22) refers to "collapsing banks" in Thailand. While a large number of Thai finance companies have suspended operations, none of the 15 Thai commercial banks have closed. Rumors of the imminent collapse of up to four of them have circulated in Bangkok for months. 
 The interest generated by these rumors testifies to the singular role of the banks in Thailand's post-1945 history, politics, economics and even society. The collapse of one or several of them may mark the end of a durable order in Thailand. But we just won't know until it happens.

HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: THE SELLOFF;
A Plunge in Hong Kong Shakes Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A plunge in the Hong Kong stock market, touched off by an attack on the local currency, shook financial markets around the world yesterday.
Stocks lost 10.4 percent of their value in Hong Kong, causing a frantic selloff first in Japan and then on Europe's stock exchanges when they opened for business. Hours later, Wall Street was engulfed as well. 
 Nerves played a part, as did renewed concerns that stocks in the United States and other markets have risen too far too fast.
Tokyo's Nikkei index dropped 3 percent, London's leading stock index plunged 3.1 percent and Germany's DAX index dropped 3.6 percent. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average finished the day down 2.3 percent, or 186.88 points, at 7,847.77, with other market gauges showing similar losses. Some smaller stock markets, including those in Brazil and Mexico, came under even more pressure, falling 5 percent or more, as confidence was shaken in many emerging markets.
The selloff spread as investors woke up to learn that what appeared in July as an isolated currency problem in Thailand has become a full-blown crisis in Southeast Asia, encompassing Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan and now Hong Kong, the region's premier economy.
Thailand was forced to devalue its currency in early July because it had borrowed heavily from abroad to finance its own growth and had allowed very low interest rates to fuel an overheated property market. One by one, other countries in the region have watched their currencies fall in value and then their stock markets succumb. When Hong Kong fell, the tremors were felt keenly in Washington. Page D1.
Hong Kong sought to buck the trend yesterday by vowing to support its currency, which is pegged to the United States dollar, and by sharply raising overnight interest rates, to 300 percent. Investors responded by selling off Hong Kong stocks on fears that higher rates would mean shriveling profits for the financial and property companies that are the market's backbone.
Early today, there were signs that Asian markets were stabilizing. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index rose as much as 2.8 percent in the morning before relinquishing most of those gains, then climbed 4.49 percent later in the session. In afternoon trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei index was up 1.15 percent. Markets in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, though, were still trading sharply lower.
If the crisis continues, it could lead to a broad regional economic slowdown that would dampen the sales and earnings not just of local companies, but of major corporations from the United States to Europe that operate there.
Some market analysts said that the selloff was not the start of a larger and longer decline and pointed to some stabilizing influences. One was an immediate drop in interest rates in the United States and Europe, which could in turn make stocks more attractive.
Indeed, as investors looked for havens yesterday, they bought bonds. Prices for the benchmark 30-year United States Treasury bond rose sharply; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, dropped to 6.31 percent, from 6.41 percent on Wednesday.
"The end of the bull market or something like the crash of 1987 is unlikely," said Robert Farrell, a senior market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "I've been a market technician for a long time, and when you have a market that has set all kinds of records -- record highs on very heavy volume -- there's much more room to go."
Other factors work in favor of United States investors, said Edward Kerschner, the chief investment strategist for Paine Webber. "We have pretty solid growth; the U.S. currency is strong; inflation is low," he said in an interview from Tokyo.
But there were signs yesterday that the crisis could continue for some time. For one, the Government of Thailand remains in turmoil following the resignation of its finance minister and the submission of undated resignations from the rest of the Cabinet; the Government is thus unable to put into effect a $17 billion rescue program backed by the International Monetary Fund. Protests against the current Government fueled discussion yesterday of new elections as well.
In Washington, there was no talk of a rescue like the one engineered for Mexico a few years ago -- largely because the problems in Southeast Asia vary greatly from country to country, thwarting a single solution. Firm leadership by the United States in organizing a bailout of $50 billion for Mexico limited the impact of its currency crisis, which began at the end of 1994 with the sudden devaluation of the peso.
Investors in the United States and Europe have reason to fear a major slowdown in Asia's economic growth. In addition to cutting into sales by American and European companies in the region, a slowdown would hurt those companies in their home markets, since sharp declines in Asian currencies against the dollar make Asian products cheaper and more competitive when sold abroad.
And investors are nervous about anything that would dampen corporate earnings. The American and European stock markets are considered expensive by many traditional measures and fell yesterday only after setting record highs earlier this month. The Mexican and Brazilian markets had also been near peaks.
"It is a warning sign to investors globally that maybe equities are overvalued," said Bob McKee, the chief economist at Independent Strategies in London, a financial consulting firm.
But many market analysts believe that American investors will continue to regard lower stock prices that result from such selloffs as a good opportunity to buy, something that has helped pull the stock market out of every big decline of the last two years. This willingness to hunt for bargains, and a decline in interest rates, could bring some stability to the American stock market.
Analysts also suggested that Federal Reserve policy makers would now be less likely to raise short-term interest rates at their November meeting. One reason is that a move by the Fed could add to the worldwide turmoil. Another, according to Kermit Schoenholtz, the London-based chief economist for Salomon Brothers, is that the same slowdown in Asia and stronger American dollar that make Asian products cheaper also reduce inflationary pressures.
The decline in the Hong Kong stock market was touched off by an assault on the Hong Kong dollar, which has been pegged at 7.75 to the United States dollar. Since the Southeast Asian financial crisis began with the devaluation of Thailand's currency, the baht, currency traders and big global investment vehicles known as hedge funds have looked for the next currency to bet against -- finding them in Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan. Now, they are testing the resolve of Hong Kong.
Until Hong Kong, the markets under fire were quite small. But Hong Kong's stock market is twice the size of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore combined. The attack on Hong Kong -- which is also more economically sound than its neighbors and serves as the gateway to China -- has raised doubts about the containment.
"Everybody thought Hong Kong was different because of China," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. "The fear now is that the Hong Kong peg to the dollar goes, then all of Asia is a less satisfactory consumer of American and European products."
For Hong Kong, the battle to protect the value of its currency -- which went into full swing on Wednesday when the benchmark Hang Seng stock index dropped 6.2 percent -- means raising interest rates. Higher rates pull capital into Hong Kong and spur buying of Hong Kong dollars. Speculators who have borrowed Hong Kong dollars also wind up paying much more for their loans, which could cause them to abandon their position.
The higher interest rates, though, spell trouble for the property and finance companies that are at the heart of the Hong Kong economy. Higher rates make it more expensive for them to do business.
And even if Hong Kong can defend its currency, higher rates could slow growth significantly if the battle lasts a long time. "There will come a point where the underlying economic situation will make it difficult to keep interest rates high," said David Webb, head of Asian equities in Hong Kong for Chase Asset Management.
A devaluation of the currency could be even worse for Hong Kong, though, damaging its credibility as an international financial center.
In the United States yesterday, the worries about slowing growth in Asia undermining the sales and earnings of American companies could be seen in the sharp fall of stocks that are sensitive to economic growth.
The Aluminum Company of America, which fell 3 1/2 a share, to 77 1/4, helped pull the Dow down. An index of major companies with extensive business overseas, the Morgan Stanley multinational index of 50 corporations, also dropped sharply, falling 2.1 percent.
And technology stocks took a beating. I.B.M. led the Dow down with a decline of 4 3/4, to 100 3/8. The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavy with technology issues, fell 36.83 points, or 2.16 percent, to 1,671.25.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article and another in Business Day yesterday, and a chart showing the performance of stock markets around the world, misstated the German DAX 30 index. It closed on Thursday at 3,977.26 points, not 3,976.38. It was down 4.66 percent for the day, not 3.60 percent, and down 9.79 percent since Aug. 1, not 8.31 percent.

GRAPHIC: Photos: From Hong Kong to Mexico City, markets around the world fell sharply, one by one, in furious waves of selling yesterday, unnerving investors and traders. In London, where the main stock index fell more than 3 percent, a trader in futures, below, found solace in a nearby pub. Later in New York, where stocks fell more than 2 percent, a worker contended with the snowdrift of paper left on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the end of the session.
