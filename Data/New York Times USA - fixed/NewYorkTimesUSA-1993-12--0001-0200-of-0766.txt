HEADLINE: An Underground Railroad From Projects to Suburbs

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCHAUMBURG, Ill.

 BODY:
Over the last two decades, a small Chicago program has reached a kind of legendary stature by helping the black residents of public housing quietly flee to a suburban world that promises more jobs, better schools and safer streets.
This modest variation on the Underground Railroad is now about to go national. The Federal Government is planning to spend $234 million in the next two years to help about 6,200 poor families move to middle-class neighborhoods. 
 The national program, though limited in size, cuts against decades of Federal housing policy that has helped isolate poor minorities in increasingly dangerous and desperate areas. And it comes as leaders from President Clinton on down are searching for solutions to the inner-city poverty and violence that he discussed recently in a Memphis speech.
Admirers of the Chicago effort say it is one of the few answers that has actually passed a field test. They point to an encouraging, though limited, body of research that suggests that families who receive rent subsidies that allow them to live in the suburbs earn more and do better in school after leaving the cities.
But with the expansion come questions about whether the program has really accomplished as much as its supporters suggest and whether its achievements can be duplicated.
 
Winning Stout Support
 Among the believers is Tachon Evans. She left a public housing unit with a bullet hole in the window on the South Side of Chicago for this suburb an hour to the northwest.
The move was not as easy as it might seem. Ms. Evans has been unable to find a doctor to accept her Medicaid card, and grocery clerks sometimes fuss about her food stamps. She has received anonymous notes of complaint from a neighbor, and her daughter has been chased home from school by classmates who call her names.
But despite bouts of loneliness and racial insult, Ms. Evans, a single mother of three, said the move was one of the best things to befall her.
"I would never move back to Chicago," said Ms. Evans, who is studying at a community college to become a nurse. "I plan, when I finish school, to buy me a house. And it'll be out here."
Henry G. Cisneros, the Housing Secretary, visited the Chicago program earlier this year and said he hoped eventually to start a similar effort in every major city. "I'm very impressed with what they're doing," he said.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is considering applications from about 10 cities, including New York, and will finance programs in Los Angeles and five other cities.
 
Some Major Differences
 The workability of a national program remains to be proven. Part of the Chicago program's success comes from the unusual devotion of the organization that runs it, the Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities. The group, founded in the wake of the 1966 open housing campaign by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Chicago, has decades of experience in fighting residential discrimination.
And the national program, called Moving to Opportunity, differs in at least one significant way: rather than help blacks move to white suburbs, it will help poor people move to middle-class neighborhoods, regardless of race.
Some critics fear that without explicit racial criteria, the program may either fail to enroll black families or simply help them move from one type of segregated neighborhood to another.
"I don't think that it addresses the major evil in American society today," said Florence Roisman, a Washington specialist in housing law. "The basic evil is racial segregation."
The Chicago program grew from a 1966 lawsuit filed on behalf of Dorothy Gautreaux, a black resident of the city's public housing. Ms. Gautreaux died before the suit was decided. But the Federal courts upheld her contention that the Chicago Housing Authority had discriminated against black tenants by confining them to projects in black neighborhoods.
 
Registration Draws Calls
 The Gautreaux program, as it is called, was part of the court-ordered solution. It seeks to desegregate subsidized housing by giving black families rental subsidies, if they move to private apartments in white areas of a six-county region.
The program has proved so popular that the leadership council now confines registration to a single day a year, when as many as 15,000 telephone calls flood the office.
Those who get through, like Ms. Evans, often travel to suburbs simply to call, since the circuits jam in parts of the city where public housing is dense. The leadership council registers the first 2,000 families who call and provides the subsidies, called Section 8 certificates, to about 400 new recipients a year. Most families can renew the certificates indefinitely.
Like many applicants, Ms. Evans sought the subsidy simply because she wanted to leave public housing, not because she wanted to live among white people. Her plan was to stay in the suburbs for only a year, as required, then transfer the subsidy to a private apartment in Chicago.
 
Relishing New Setting
 The families move one at a time as inconspicuously as possible to avoid provoking opposition. Still, when Ms. Evans moved two years ago, she heard racial insults flung from passing cars, and one neighbor in an adjoining townhouse left complaining notes, including one that said, "You people walk too loud."
Ms. Evans recalled, "When I first moved, it was a relief to see another black person."
But she came to relish suburban safety, especially after four years in Dearborn Homes, a public housing project so violent, she said, she had to watch television in the dark to avoid attracting gunfire.
"When people come out here, I always joke, 'Don't speed, because the police don't have anything better to do but give you a ticket,' " she said.
For now, Ms. Evans is living on a $414 monthly welfare check plus food stamps. The subsidy program requires her to contribute 30 percent of her income toward shelter costs. So she spends about $125 a month for part of the utility bill, while the Government sends her a $69 utilities supplement and pays the $887 rent for her three-bedroom townhouse.
 
Daughter Is Ambivalent
 Whether the move will raise her earnings remains unclear, but Ms. Evans professes confidence that she will find work after finishing her studies. In contrast to the city, she said, jobs are plentiful in Schaumburg. "For you to be out here and not have a job, it's only because you don't want one," she said.
Ms. Evans's 9-year-old daughter, Marchonda, is more ambivalent about the move. She said she had exchanged the fear she felt in the projects for the loneliness that came from being the only black student in her class.
Last year she was chased home and pushed to the ground by taunting classmates. This year she transferred to a new school, for unrelated reasons, but the name-calling has resumed. "This girl does it every day," she said. "She calls me 'bad breath,' 'stink breath' and all that stuff."
While Marchonda is convinced that the harassment is racial, her mother argues that children are picked on everywhere and probably less so in the suburbs than in the projects. "She was the new girl, and they were going to mess with her," Ms. Evans said.
 
Study Shows Strong Results
 James Rosenbaum, a sociologist at Northwestern University, argues that the moves not only bring more safety but also higher earnings and more education, especially for the children.
Mr. Rosenbaum has compared some Gautreaux program families with similar families who stayed in Chicago.
He found that 54 percent of the suburban students went to college, and 27 percent attended a four-year school. By contrast, 21 percent of the city students went to college, and 4 percent were enrolled in four-year schools.
Mr. Rosenbaum found that the suburbs provided a similar increase in employment. Of those youths not in school, 75 percent of the suburban group had jobs, while 41 percent in the city had them. In addition, 21 percent of the suburban youths were earning more than $6.50 an hour, while 5 percent in the city did so.
Typical job-training programs almost never make such a difference. "It's quite dramatic," he said.
But a research collaborator, Leonard S. Rubinowitz, a law professor at Northwestern University, took a more cautious view. He noted that the study had looked at only 52 suburban families. And it excluded those who had grown discouraged and moved back to the city, perhaps skewing the outcome.
 
'These Are Hard Moves'
 Mr. Rubinowitz also questions whether forced integration is a good thing. "These are hard moves to make," he said, arguing that poor black families might find just as much economic opportunity, and less harassment, simply by moving to better black neighborhoods.
Since 1976, the program has helped more than 2,000 poor black families move to white suburbs. Several families have been attacked, but none have suffered serious injury.
That record is partly the result of the leadership council's vigilance. It screens applicants through credit checks and home visits and scatters them to avoid a concentration in one town that might provoke opposition. And it refuses to work in towns like Cicero and Berwyn where the white opposition is thought to run especially deep.
"This is not an easy issue politically," said Paul B. Fischer, a professor at Lake Forest College who has studied several variations of the Gautreaux program, including those in Dallas and Cincinnati.
Mr. Fischer said that whites often feared that an influx of poor black families would drive down property values. And he said that black business owners and politicians have accused the programs of siphoning off the lifeblood of the inner city. Some, he said, have even accused the programs of "committing genocide."
Mr. Fischer said the economic and racial integration of America's neighborhoods could do much to solve urban problems. But, he cautions, "I don't know if there's the political will, the political resources, the political skill to make it happen."

HEADLINE: Tax Revenues Rise but Fail to Fill Budget Gaps in New York Region

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
New strength in the economies of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut has helped spur tax collections, but the increases are so slight that they fall far short of providing the states and their localities a painless way of closing their budget gaps.
The increased collections have come largely from growing profits in the financial service industry, particularly on Wall Street and among the region's banks, and from surprisingly strong retail sales. Although early holiday sales have been strong, merchants have been disappointed too often to pronounce this season a success. 
 For this year, tax collection increases of less than 4 percent are forecast in all three states and in New York City. In Connecticut and New York State, that would mean tax collections would grow more slowly this year than last. And across the region, the growth will be much slower than it was in the mid-1980's, when tax receipts leaped by 10 percent a year or more, before flattening after 1988.
 
Barely Exceeding Inflation
 Because the increases barely exceed the rate of inflation, which has run 2.6 percent a year in New York and New Jersey, the rising cost of social services, mass transit and other programs wipes out most of whatever extra money could be spent elsewhere.
In Connecticut, officials said they collected $231.4 million more in taxes than expected in the year ended June 30. But that windfall is less than a third of what they would need to pay off $706 million in bonds sold to bridge a deficit in 1991.
New York State said receipts ran higher than expected for the first six months of this fiscal year, which ends next March, prompting it to forecast $251 million in additional tax reciepts for the full year. But public assistance and school aid have also run higher than anticipated, and the state now expects to spend $213 million more than it had forecast for the full fiscal year. So all but $38 million of the greater tax yield is already absorbed.
"The increase in revenues is minimal," said Rudy F. Runko, the New York State Budget Director. If current forecasts are correct, this fiscal year the state would have a surplus of $38 million. That is minuscule compared to the shortfall of more than $1.5 billion that is projected for the fiscal year beginning next April.
Nevertheless, any increase in the taxes that ebb and flow with the economy offers welcome, if tentative, glimmers of hope for taxpayers, politicians and government agencies, after four years of budget cuts.
In New Jersey and New York City, the region's two newest political leaders, Gov.-elect Christine Todd Whitman and Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani, both face the prospect of huge budget deficits in their first year in office, but have nonetheless pledged to eliminate some taxes and reduce the rates of others.
 
Facing Shortfalls
 In New York State, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo must for the fifth year in a row find ways to prevent a budget shortfall. He has been criticized for using fiscal stopgaps, including his decision in 1991 to take the equivalent of a second mortgage on Attica State Prison. His fiscal policies are likely to become an issue if he runs for re-election in 1994.
In Connecticut, fiscal problems also seem likely to be a central issue in the race for governor next year. Although Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has said he will not seek re-election, he will pass to his successor a debt that now stands at $706 million. The debt was created by selling notes to investors in the 1991 fiscal year to eliminate a deficit.
 
Case for Slow Growth
 The slow growth contrasts sharply with the rate of growth in most of the nation's states and cities, where an accelerating recovery has begun to pump up government coffers.
"These states bring up the rear," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States, a research concern in Albany.
In a report yesterday, his group found that tax collections by states across the nation had increased 6.2 percent from July through September, the biggest quarterly increase since monitoring began in 1990.
New York fared better than the national average, with a 7.3 percent increase. Connecticut fared worse, with only 1.7 percent. New Jersey was close to the average, with 6.4 percent.
"I don't think these states will keep up with the rest of the country during the rest of the year," Mr. Gold said. Employment growth in the region "is just too weak to support a rapid increase" in tax collections, he said.
Still, analysts note that slow growth is better than none.
"Whenever you are coming out of a recession, the indicators are going to be mixed, but there are some clear indications the decline is over," Michael Johnston, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service, said of property tax collections. Moody's monitors the fiscal health and credit status of states and cities.
The biggest fiscal challenge awaits Mr. Giuliani, who has said he would cut some of New York City's taxes on business. His first targets, he has said, are the city and state taxes on hotel room occupants, which adds a little more than 20 percent to the price of rooms, and the city's 6 percent commercial occupancy tax, one of several city taxes assessed businesses that rent space.
Mr. Giuliani argues that by cutting taxes, he will stimulate business, increasing receipts from the taxes that remain in place.
 
Revised Deficit Projection
 City records show that tax collections have been rising at a painfully slow rate, meaning that business conditions would have to flourish to help Mr. Giuliani's fiscal strategy. Over all, the city's Office of Management and Budget says, collections increased 3.7 percent in the fiscal year ended in June, compared to 7.9 percent the year before.
Worse for the new Mayor are projections by the Dinkins administration of tax collections for the next four years. Property tax collections bring in $8 billion a year, or nearly half the city's overall tax receipts. They rose only 1.6 percent last year, and will decline by 3.4 percent this fiscal year, the Dinkins administration says. Collections will rise by no more than 4.1 percent a year for four years.
Perhaps the biggest setback for Mr. Giuliani came on Nov. 22 when Mayor David N. Dinkins released a revised projection of the city's deficit for the next fiscal year. He said it would be $1.73 billion, $450 million more than forecast in June.
Some officials maintain that Mr. Giuliani cannot hope to close the projected deficit without increasing taxes, and they point to property taxes as the most logical candidate. "It would give him the most bang for the buck," said an analyst on Mr. Dinkins's staff, who insisted on anonymity.
Mr. Giuliani has not commented on property taxes since his election. His spokeswoman, Cristyne Lategano, said last week that he intended to move quickly to reduce the hotel occupancy tax, but she declined to comment on the property tax rate.
Although raising taxes on commercial and residential property would be unpopular, such a move could provide the new mayor a quick way to cut the deficit. Property taxes account for the biggest portion of the city's budget, so a small increase produces a great deal of revenue.
 
Brighter State Outlook
 Mr. Dinkins announced a four-year freeze on rates last year, while assessments were being lowered. Lifting the freeze would require the approval of the City Council, but not the State Legislature, as would be the case if Mr. Giuliani wanted to raise the city's sales or income taxes.
For New York State, tax collections have accelerated more quickly in recent months and prompted a brighter fiscal outlook than for New York City.
In a report released this month, the state said its total tax collections for the first seven months of the fiscal year were $16.74 billion, a larger-than-expected 5 percent increase over the like period the previous year.
The state's taxes on bank and insurance company earnings rose more than 8 percent from the previous year and sales taxes rose 4 percent.
In New Jersey, where Mrs. Whitman has pledged to cut income taxes, she must first contend with a budget deficit next year that state officials have estimated at $800 million or more. Like Mr. Giuliani, she has based her fiscal plan on cuts in government spending. She also cannot count on recent increases in tax collections for much help.
New Jersey financial officials said overall state tax collections rose less than 1 percent, to $14.5 billion, in the fiscal year that ended in June. The state forecasts an increase of about 3 percent this fiscal year.
Current New Jersey figures show a mixed bag of improving and declining tax receipts. The state's Treasury Department said that in September, the latest month for which data are available, income taxes fell 7.8 percent from September a year ago. Sales tax receipts, unchanged in September, jumped 12.7 percent in August, the department said.
 
Surplus in Connecticut
 In Connecticut, the near-term fiscal future is complicated by sharp changes in its tax structure during the last three years.
The state said its overall tax collections for the fiscal year that ended on June 30 rose 8 percent, to $5.58 billion, with the biggest increases in personal income and corporate taxes. State officials also reported a jump in corporate tax collections, enabling it to finish the 1993 fiscal year with a $10 million surplus.
A year ago, Connecticut's tax receipts shot up by 23 percent, but only because it was the first year the state collected personal income tax. Receipts declined in some other tax categories, including sales taxes.
William J. Cibes Jr., Connecticut's Commissioner of Policy and Management, said in an interview that sales tax revenues for September 1993 jumped by 10 percent or more, reflecting a marked increase in economic activity. Figures for October have not been tabulated.
Over all, the state forecasts an increase of less than 1 percent in tax collections for the current fiscal year, ending next June.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Mexico Spar Over Limits of Intervention

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Minutes before Vice President Al Gore arrived here tonight to meet with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the man whom Mr. Salinas has chosen as his long-governing party's candidate to succeed him conveniently flew out of town.
For both Governments, the triumphant return of the candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, to his birthplace near the border with Arizona was a nice way to avoid his having to meet or not meet with Mr. Gore, and the speculation that might come either way about United States support for the governing party's candidate. 
 But the dance of jets on the airport tarmac also illustrated the onset of what foreign policy analysts describe as a complex and uncertain new phase in the political relationship between the two countries that has been ushered in by the approval this month of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 
Pact Called Catalyst for Change
 In selling the pact to skeptical congressmen, the Clinton Administration endorsed the party that has governed Mexico for 64 years as the logical vehicle for democratic political change. It also promoted the accord vigorously as the catalyst for that change.
To the complaints of many congressmen about the lack of political freedom in a country with which the United States will begin to free its trade on Jan. 1, Administration officials responded by promising, essentially, that they would be able to intervene more and with greater leverage if the agreement was passed.
"Mexico is not yet a full democracy," Mr. Gore argued in his televised debate on the accord with Ross Perot. "They do not yet have full protection for human rights. But they've been making tremendous progress, and the progress has been associated with this new relationship with the United States.
"The question," said Mr. Gore, who is to meet twice with Mr. Salinas on issues related to the trade pact, "is whether or not we will have the ability to influence what they and their Government decide."
More recently, though, Mexican officials have said that their Government, still sensitive about the many concessions it made to win American approval of the pact, will reassert tougher limits to what has long been considered intolerable interference by the United States in their country's politics.
 
Emphasis on Sovereignty
 Mr. Salinas seemed to hint at this in an interview with Newsweek magazine after the approval of the trade agreement, saying he would remind Americans who might try to use it to push for political change in Mexico: "The only thing we negotiated was free trade." Mr. Colosio, while describing himself as deeply democratic, said in accepting his party's nomination on Sunday, "The great battle of Mexico is for sovereignty."
United States officials have indicated that their belief in the trade agreement's positive impact on the democratization of Mexico is not based on any provisions of the agreement itself. Their conviction derives instead from the expectation that more economic development and United States influence under the accord will inevitably push Mexico toward political liberalization.
In Chile, they say, economic changes like those made by Mr. Salinas helped bring an end to the military dictatorship in 1989. They also cite a link between economic development and greater democracy in northern Mexican states like Chihuahua.
But those assumptions are sharply debated among experts on the Mexican political system.
 
Parallel Drawn With China
 Some analysts argue that Mexico may in some ways prove more like China, where authoritarian, one-party rule has defied the pressures that are often linked to the country's growing prosperity. And by virtually all accounts, the immediate political effect of the trade pact's approval has been to strengthen the Salinas administration as it turns to the presidential and legislative elections scheduled for Aug. 21.
"Have the people in the Clinton Administration thought this through?" asked Sidney Weintraub, an expert on Mexico at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, who supported the trade agreement. "I don't think they have. They are taking it as an article of faith."
The Administration's embrace of the Salinas Government as a force for political change is notable in part because many Mexicans had feared that the opposite might ensue after Mr. Salinas angered some Clinton aides with his scarcely veiled support for the re-election of President Bush. Some Mexican officials had also worried when the Clinton Administration promised that it would make democracy and human rights the core of policy toward Latin America.
In arguing for the trade agreement before the Senate Commerce Committee on Oct. 21, the State Department counselor, Timothy E. Wirth, said, "We can reject a closer relationship with Mexico on the grounds that Mexico has not changed enough, or we can promote even more profound changes through deeper bilateral ties."
 
Scrutiny vs. Resistance
 But neither Mr. Wirth nor other officials have been very clear about how the United States might take advantage of the trade agreement to promote that change, or how they might navigate Mexico's deep sensitivity to foreign intervention.
In part, American officials have argued that the trade agreement will bring Mexican politics under increased scrutiny from abroad.
But some analysts predict that having won passage of the agreement, Mexico will stiffen its resistance to such outside pressure. Having lost, others say, opponents of the agreement in the American Congress and labor movement may also lose much of their relatively new interest in issues like Mexican democracy and human rights.
Some experts say the Clinton Administration's more persuasive argument is the one that Mr. Salinas himself has offered throughout his five years in power: that political change will inevitably follow economic change, but only gradually, and only insofar as political stability is not threatened.
"Any political evolution has its own pace, beyond which it can't go without threatening serious instability," the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Alexander F. Watson, said of Mexico in an interview. "The real question for serious reformers is where that point lies."
 
No Answer Yet
 For the most part, though, the Salinas administration has equated the political stability of the country with its party's continued hold on power, and Mr. Watson's question is one that the Clinton Administration itself has not yet answered.
While Mr. Salinas has overseen a series of changes to the political system, many analysts believe they have been intended more to help his party to keep power rather than to put it up for grabs. And although the Government has ceded some of its traditional control over labor, business and political patronage, they have not necessarily heightened the public clamor for democracy.
Indeed, many experts say the paradox of Mexico's reform has been that while opinion polls show wide dissatisfaction with the political system and a deep desire for change, they also show strong support for the governing party. On most surveys, moreover, Mexicans rank the need for democracy well below other concerns like poverty, corruption and pollution.
In the end, whether the United States heightens its pressure for change in Mexico may have less to do with policy planning than with events.
So far, for instance, Mr. Watson said the United States had repeatedly raised its desire for Mexico to allow foreign election observers, but had been refused. But as Mr. Gore arrived, the governing party was facing new protests in the southeastern state of Yucatan, where opposition politicians were asserting fraud in elections held on Sunday.
"The Clinton Administration is accepting the orthodoxy, which is gradual change in Mexico," said John Bailey, a professor of Government at Georgetown University. "But the Administration has not yet been tested by an election in which the issues of fraud and unfair competition have come up."

HEADLINE: U.S.-French Trade Compromise Foreseen Soon

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration suggested today that it saw new room for compromise with France in a lingering standoff that has been the major obstacle to an international agreement on lowering trade barriers.
With negotiations on the accord, under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, entering a final phase, conciliatory signals from both the United States and France contributed to a new sense of optimism among delegates that a settlement might be reached by a deadline that is now two weeks away. 
 "There is an increasing belief that the round not only has to be, but will be, concluded," Peter Sutherland, the Director General of GATT, said at the organization's headquarters in Geneva today.
And in an interview published today in The Washington Post, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France said his Government was willing to relax its rigid stance in an agricultural dispute with the United States that has been the main stumbling block to the agreement. American officials quickly welcomed the statement, and both Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said the Administration would be willing, in turn, to show flexibility of its own.
Mr. Kantor expressed hope that the United States and the 12-nation European Community could now reach agreement on at least the outline of an accord in two days of discussions that resume Wednesday in Brussels.
"I'm not pessimistic," he said before flying to Europe for talks with Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's trade commissioner. There is "a lot of flexibility" in the American position, Mr. Kantor added.
The global free trade talks have foundered for most of the seven years since they began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986. But they were lent urgency this year when Congress gave President Clinton a Dec. 15 deadline, by when his officials must either conclude a treaty or he would lose his special powers to conduct expedited negotiations.
Because this deadline was set only in one country, a failure to reach agreement by then would not necessarily mean the end of the talks. But most trade experts fear that it would compound the difficulties of winning American approval of any agreement, since it would require new action in an already reluctant Congress.
If an accord is concluded by Dec. 15, Congress is not now permitted to amend it when voting on approval. If it is not completed by then, Mr. Clinton would be required to seek renewal from Congress of his "fast track" authority -- meaning that the lawmakers would be asked to vote on a secondary trade-related matter at a time when the broad issue of trade is politically awkward, given the bruising fight required to gain approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Administration has portrayed the global accord being negotiated as one whose economic benefits would dwarf those of the North American agreement. So far, however, Mr. Clinton and his aides have remained relatively circumspect in campaigning for a GATT accord, attaching none of the apocalyptic warnings about the consequences of failure they sought to impart in the Nafta battle.
In explaining this subdued approach, officials said the global accord's terms had not been resolved and this made it awkward for Mr. Clinton to support it with a vigor similar to his efforts for the North American pact. They also noted that it was still being debated in other nations, making it more delicate for the President to weigh in than on a purely domestic matter.
But on a day when he also met with Central America's leaders to underscore his pledge to expand free trade beyond North America, Mr. Clinton and his top advisers sought to leave little doubt about their commitment to winning agreement on the global accord before Dec. 15.
At a joint news conference with the Central Americans this morning, the President described the task as his "preoccupation." And while Mr. Kantor emphasized that the United States sought "a good agreement, not just any agreement," he also issued a new reminder about the stakes.
Contending than an accord could be worth as much $6 trillion worldwide in the next decade, Mr. Kantor said, "Obviously, the Uruguay Round will have far more economic impact than the Nafta will have."
The comments by Mr. Balladur were significant because they suggested that France would be willing to back off from its demand for renegotiation of a deal struck last year as part of the GATT talks that would impose strict limits on the subsidies a country can pay to its farmers. Mr. Balladur said changes to that agreement could be termed clarifications or amplifications.
The French Government has expressed bitter opposition to limiting farm subsidies, but the United States refuses to renegotiate the draft agreement. Now, with both countries moving toward flexibility, a senior Administration official predicted that Mr. Kantor would spend the next two or so "trying to hammer out a comprehensive deal with the Europeans."
Among other signs pointing toward a possible breakthrough on trade issues, officials said, were indications that Japan might agree to open its rice market to foreign suppliers, a goal of American trade policy through the years of talks.

THE TRADE TALKS
The United States is negotiating with 115 other nations on a sweeping rewrite of the free-trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which have governed most of the world's trade.. GATT was created in 1948 to expand the world economy by eliminating trade barriers. Trade ministers have successfully completed seven previous rounds of talks to broaden the original agreement. The current negotiations began seven years ago in Uruguay.
 
THE TIMETABLE
After years of delay, there is a growing sense that the trade talks may be headed for a conclusion. The talks have lagged mainly because of disputes between the United States and Europe over farm subsidies. Last summer, Congress gave special negotiating authority to President Clinton to clinch a deal by December 15. If a deal cannot be done by then, the Administration will have to ask Congress for an extension, which could prove difficult given the recent fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Since last June when GATT appointed a new director general, Peter Sutherland of Ireland, Mr. Sutherland has effectively forced the international trade community to view Dec. 15 as a final deadline.
 
WHAT'S AT STAKE
The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, a Paris-based group of 24 wealthy nations, estimates that completion of the talks would mean that the world economy would be $270 billion greater by 2002. The extra economic output would come from the more efficient use of labor, capital and other resources.
 
EFFECT ON THE U.S.
Some American economists, industry groups and labor unions say that the trade agreement would benefit other countries, at least in the short run, more than it would help the United States. Still, most economists believe that over the course of many years, free trade allows each country to specialize in products that it can make most efficiently.
 
THE OUTLOOK
There is a widespread exasperation among American, European and Japanese officials over the twisted course of the talks. But there is also a new willingness by the French to limit Government farm subsidiesand a perception that American officials are willing to cut deals leading to a less ambitious agreement.

HEADLINE: A Long-Silent Pritzker Speaks Up

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
People with a billion dollars usually have trouble keeping their mouths shut. Something about all that money must loosen their tongues. Not Robert A. Pritzker.
For years he has run the industrial half of his family's Chicago-based business empire in relative obscurity to his better-known brother Jay, whose deal-making forays resulted in their ownership of Hyatt hotels, Ticketmaster and, briefly, Braniff airlines. 
 But now, Mr. Pritzker speaks, and it is years of Washington economic policy that has brought him out. And as the intensely private Mr. Pritzker said he had discovered, after decades of silence, when he finally got the chance, he had a lot to say.
Frustrated by some of the directions the Clinton Administration has taken on business issues, the shy billionaire was recently coaxed into speaking out to help manufacturers make their case in Washington. "I don't aspire to be Donald Trump or a movie actor," Mr. Pritzker, 67, said. "It's just not my style. I'm a Midwestern engineer."
And not a bad businessman. Mr. Pritzker has squeezed a profit out of the 60 or so companies that make up his $4 billion Marmon Group every year since 1955. Like a grandfather ticking off the names of his grandchildren, he can name every one of those companies. "I can do better than name 'em," he bragged. "I can tell you what machinery they have, who runs them, who their largest customers are."
It is apparent that he loves this stuff. This is a man who has a clear passion for all things nerdy, and after listening to him talk about bearings, valves and regulators, it is easy to forget that he is one of the richest men in the world. (His family is worth more than $4.4 billion, according to Forbes magazine.)
He relishes his weekend discussions with his 9-year-old daughter, Liesel, about physics -- this week's was about gravity -- and talks like an engineer, even describing himself at one point as "dumb-squared," for missing an important point. He has been known to ask job applicants to explain how a car works as a test of their mettle.
But what he really wants to talk about these days is the country's industrial policy. Mr. Pritzker took over as the chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers on Oct. 8 -- his net worth surpasses that of many of the group's 12,500 corporate members -- and has been using the association as a bully pulpit for his fairly conservative views on Washington's role in economic matters. In an interview in Manhattan, he touched upon everything from health care to trade.
"I'm devoted to the idea that manufacturing and engineering are important to the U.S.," he said, noting that heavy industry paid better and had better benefits than other jobs.
Still, what would make a billionaire swap his much-cherished coat of privacy for the hurly-burly of Washington politics escapes his friends. "They said, 'You always squawk about these things, why don't you do something about it?' " he said. Mr. Pritzker said he was tired of watching Washington administrations strangle business with regulation. "It's not newsworthy, because it's a creeping affair," he said. "Congress sees a problem and tries to pass a law to solve it. But you've got to be careful about the downstream consequences."
He congratulated Mr. Clinton on the way he pushed through the North American Free Trade Agreement. "It took a lot of courage to stand up to the unions, one of his constituencies,"' he said.
 
Shares Concerns
 But he said he shared the concerns of many business people about the health care package. "This is either going to burden business or the Government's coffers," he said, skeptical that cost containment alone would work.
Mr. Pritzker said he was "modestly optimistic" about the economy. He said he was less optimistic about Washington's ability to curb its tendency to inject itself into the business of business.
He said the Administration should jealously safeguard free trade in all cases except those where national defense might be jeopardized. He said he had little sympathy for the recent efforts by the aluminum producers to lobby Washington for some relief against low-priced Russian metal. "Look, if you have a pebble in your shoe, what's going on in Afghanistan is of no concern," he said.
"I don't believe in industrial policy, and you can't have it both ways," Mr. Pritzker said. "As businessmen, you can't ask them to stay out of your hair and then ask for help."

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers Aid to Bosnia, but No Plan to End War

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced today that the United States would send more aid to help the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina survive the winter, but he made clear that Washington would do nothing to end the 19-month war.
In a speech to the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Mr. Christopher reflected the Clinton Administration's new hands-off approach to resolving the Bosnian crisis by portraying it as a human tragedy about which very little can be done by outsiders. 
 "This winter, the snows have come early to Bosnia and the humanitarian crisis has deepened," Mr. Christopher said. "Whatever we do to help, it will not be enough. So long as the armed conflict continues, it is not humanly possible to end the suffering of the people of Bosnia."
According to the State Department's estimate, 2.7 million people in Bosnia and Herzegovina are "at risk" this winter from fighting, disease, malnutrition and lack of shelter.
 
Relief Crisis Eases
 But even as Mr. Christopher was delivering his words, one of his senior aides told reporters that the relief crisis in Bosnia had eased since last August, when the United States led an initiative in NATO to threaten air strikes if the Serbs continued to prevent the delivery of food and other aid to Sarajevo and other cities.
"We think the situation is significantly improved in the areas in question since August," the official said.
Perhaps what was most remarkable about Mr. Christopher's speech was what it did not say. Gone was the lofty rhetoric of February when Mr. Christopher, in unveiling the Administration's Balkan policy, said that Washington's response to the war "tests our commitment to the nurturing of democracy and the support of environments in which democracy can grow and take root."
Mr. Christopher did not discuss the Administration's proposal last spring to arm the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government to make the war what he then called a "fair fight," and he did not repeat the Administration's appeal last summer to win support for NATO air strikes.
 
Urges Negotiated Settlement
 Rather, Mr. Christopher made clear that the only way to end the war is for the parties to sit down and cut a deal among themselves.
"The only answer is to bring the fighting to an end and the only means to that end is a negotiated settlement," he told the Foreign Ministers of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe on the first stop of a 13-day visit to Europe and the Middle East.
To help ease the pain of winter, Mr. Christopher said the United States would spend an additional $150 million in relief aid, much of it to defray the cost of flying Air Force planes. The United States has already contributed $400 million in aid for Bosnia.
"Our goal is to increase the food, winterization supplies, refugee assistance and medical aid reaching the people of Bosnia," he said. Mr. Christopher added that the United States would be prepared to begin airlifting supplies to the airport at the Government-held northeastern city of Tuzla.
"Thus far, the Bosnian Serbs and Croats have made it impossible to use the field for that purpose," he said. "We call upon all warring parties to stop their unconscionable conduct that blocks the delivery of critically needed supplies through this facility."
 
No Specific U.S. Plan
 Mr. Christopher did not offer any specific American assistance as a means of opening the airport.
Mr. Christopher did not criticize a European initiative that offers to gradually suspend economic sanctions against Serbia if the Serbs, Croats and Muslims sign a peace treaty and if the Serbs agree to give the Bosnian Government a bit more land.
"With respect to the lifting of sanctions, I am very concerned that there be no premature lifting of the sanctions," Mr. Christopher told reporters before his speech. "Sanctions are our only real leverage at the present time over Serbia. I think the Europeans agree with the United States on this point and so we'll be watching that issue very, very closely."
Until now, the United States has taken the lead in pressing for tighter sanctions and finding new ways to enforce them, and when Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France unveiled the plan to suspend them, in a letter on Nov. 19, the United States initially dismissed it. But without its own alternative for bringing peace to Bosnia, the Administration decided to let the Europeans try out their own plan.

HEADLINE: Consumers Now Singing a Merrier Tune

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Consumers, who had been feeling rotten about the economy earlier this year, have lately been sounding a bit more upbeat. The Conference Board, a business research organization, said yesterday that its survey of consumer confidence jumped 11 points in November to 71.2, the highest level since last January, when post-election euphoria started to fade.
November's spurt followed earlier rebounds in two other consumer surveys -- the University of Michigan's and ABC/Money magazine's -- and a host of cheery retail reports. 
 "It's heartening to get this kind of reading just before Christmas," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research, although he added, "This is a long way from euphoria."
Judging by their recent actions, consumers have actually been more sanguine than earlier surveys indicated. Their spending rose solidly this spring and summer, retail sales spurted in October, home sales are way up, consumers are borrowing more freely, and car sales have been strong recently. However, most forecasters expect consumers to pull back a bit after December.
What's making consumers see the glass as half full is no mystery. Many of the 500 households surveyed by the Conference Board think the economy is going to keep improving. The expectations index zoomed to 79.2 last month from 66.7 in October. Fewer households than in previous months thought that jobs would get scarcer or that their income would shrink.
At the same time, 15.8 percent of the households thought business conditions were good, up from 13.9 percent in October.
"Consumers are getting more optimistic for good reason," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. "Though jobs and income growth aren't all they could be, they are better.
"I'd be the last person to say that creating 170,000 jobs a month is optimal, but it's better than last year's pace."
At this point, most forecasters are warning retailers not to get too giddy and to avoid piling up too much inventory. Many, like DRI/McGraw Hill, expect spending growth to dip to a rate of 2 percent or less in the first quarter of 1994 from under 4 percent this quarter.
"Last December was a strong month for consumption," Chris Probyn, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, recalled. "But it got taken out of the first quarter."
For one thing, spending has been growing at an average rate of 3 percent, as consumers have bought new cars and furniture and spruced up their wardrobes. But income has been growing at just 1.7 percent, and spending cannot outpace paychecks for long.
For another, the saving rate fell below 4 percent this summer, a level that most economists think is too low to last. As Mr. Probyn put it, "If it's a great Christmas, retailers will pay the price in the new year."

HEADLINE: Apple Denied a Tax Break

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Nov. 30

 BODY:
Commissioners of a Texas county refused today to give a real estate tax abatement to Apple Computer Inc., citing the company's policy of granting the same health benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees that it does to heterosexual spouses.
The decision means that Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., will probably not build an $80 million complex in Williamson County, just north of Austin, that would have employed 700 people. 
 "We're going to regroup and review our operations," an Apple spokeswoman, Lisa Byrne, said. "It is unlikely we will locate in Williamson County."
Apple had sought a $750,000 tax abatement over a seven-year period for the complex, but county commissioners rejected it by a 3-to-2 vote.
Debate on the tax break for several weeks focused on Apple's domestic partner policy.
"I cannot in good conscience extend that benefit to them because of the conviction I have that same-sex partners is wrong," Commissioner Greg Boatwright had said earlier.
Advocates of gay and lesbian rights derided the commission's decision. "This is the first time that a panel of this kind has used its authority to punish a company that has independently decided to treat its gay and lesbian employees fairly," said David Smith, of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
After the vote, Charlie Culpepper, the mayor of Round Rock, the largest town in Williamson County, said he disagreed with the commissioners.
"I don't agree with the idea of same-sex marriages, but government needs to stay out of business," he said. "Families need jobs."
Mr. Culpepper said it was too early to tell if the vote would hurt economic development. The area around Austin has been a leading destination for high-technology companies because of the city's educational base and low tax, real estate and labor costs.

HEADLINE: It's Official: The Winner Is Whitman

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
As the Board of State Canvassers met today to give the weight of law to the voters' choice of Christine Todd Whitman as New Jersey's next Governor, the Governor-elect was closeted with Federal and state investigators, trying to put to rest what has come to be known as the "Rollins incident."
Moving to get her transition planning back on track, Mrs. Whitman also announced the appointment of an eight-member transition budget review committee -- a group that includes the co-authors of the controversial tax cut plan that was the heart of her economic platform during the campaign. 
 Mrs. Whitman said she met for about an hour this afternoon with the United States Attorney for New Jersey, Michael Chertoff, and with James R. Zazzali and George F. Kugler, the two former New Jersey Attorneys General who are heading the state investigation into allegations that Republicans bought off black ministers and Democratic workers to help assure her victory.
"The meeting was cordial and the discussion candid," Mrs. Whitman said, without giving details of the talk. "While I hope that the issue is resolved as rapidly as possible, I understand fully the necessity for the investigation to be as thorough as possible. I support those efforts because only a full and complete review of the allegations will answer any and all of the questions which have been raised and that is important to the State of New Jersey."
 
Economic Advisers
 In naming a team to help develop the spending plan that she must deliver to the Legislature within weeks after taking office on Jan. 18, Mrs. Whitman enlisted two economic advisers from her campaign: Lawrence A. Kudlow of Manhattan, chief economist for Bear, Stearns & Company, and Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. of Bedminister, president and chief executive of Forbes Inc.
The co-chairmen of the group will be Candace L. Straight of Bloomfield, a principal of John Head & Partners, a merchant banking firm in New York City, and Andrew Chapman of Short Hills, senior vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer of Elizabethtown Water Company
The timing of today's announcement was as important for symbolic reasons as it was for the urgency of developing her first budget.
The euphoria of Mrs. Whitman's upset victory over Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, was doused and most of her time in recent weeks has been consumed by the controversy touched off by Edward J. Rollins Jr., her chief political strategist and campaign manager.
During a Nov. 9 breakfast meeting with reporters in Washington, Mr. Rollins boasted that Republican operatives had offered money to unnamed black ministers to keep them from supporting Mr. Florio from the pulpit and that some Democratic workers had been paid to stay home on Election Day.
The allegations prompted a string of lawsuits and investigations by Federal officials, the State Attorney General's office and the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission.
Much of the pressure on Mrs. Whitman was lifted on Monday when the Democrats announced that they were abandoning a lawsuit to try to overturn the election because they had found nothing to prove that she won because of any efforts to suppress voting.
Today the Board of State Canvassers gave the weight of law to the voters' choice of Mrs. Whitman. According to the official count, Mrs. Whitman defeated Mr. Florio by 26,093 votes -- 1,236,124 to 1,210,031 -- out of nearly 2.5 million votes cast for 19 gubernatorial candidates. It was the second closest margin of victory in a governor's race in modern state history.
But no one directly involved in the controversy and its aftermath has escaped completely unscathed, including the State of New Jersey, which again finds itself linked with the stereotype of a state prone to political scandal.
For Mrs. Whitman, who has won bipartisan praise for her response to the Rollins comments, the episode will add an indelible footnote to her place in state history as the first woman to be Governor.
For Republicans, in general, the Rollins controversy -- with little regard to whether his initial comments were true or untrue -- renews an image of a party prone to dirty tricks, a reputation that goes back to the days of the Watergate scandal.
The prospects are equally troubling for the Democrats.
Their dogged pursuit of their lawsuit against the Republican State Committee and the Whitman campaign over the last two weeks has soured relations not only with the incoming Governor but with the Republicans who will still control both chambers of the Legislature.
 
Look Under the Rocks
 "The Democrats were in a difficult position," said Mr. Rabovich, "they had to file the lawsuit just to maintain their own political credibility. It was role playing and it was a morality play, but the Democrats did what they had to do."
The controversy and the Democrats' lawsuit also brought unaccustomed public attention to some of the less pristine aspects of politics, especially the use of street money -- the huge caches of cash kept on hand for Election Day operations.
The widespread use of street money had been almost the exclusive practice of the Democratic Party, which once could count on urban areas as their political redoubt. In fact, it was Mr. Rollins's boast that he had beaten the Democrats "at their own game" that led up to his initial story of Republicans amassing $500,000 in street money to finance an elaborate scheme to suppress the vote in urban, mostly black, areas.
Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, a Republican, has already proposed legislation that would ban cash payouts on Election Day and force campaigns to pay workers with checks. It is likely that the Republican legislative majority will propose even more far-reaching restrictions in a bid to erode further the Democratics' urban vote.
"One thing for sure will come out of all of this," said Larry J. Sabato, a government professor at the University of Virginia. "Consultants will come up with new names for street money. There will be a new, sophisticated, suburban name for street money."

The Nail Salon of the 90's: Massages for the Clothed

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman

 BODY:
DEAR Diary,
While walking on Third Avenue spotted new store called Great American Backrub near 57th Street. Looked in to see what was being sold. Saw people getting their backs rubbed by men and women in red and blue jackets. Appears that store is a massage parlor that actually offers massages. What will they think of next? 
 Went inside and inquired about a back rub. Woman at desk said basic offering entailed kneading of shoulder, neck, upper back, lower back, arms and hands by licensed personnel. Entire operation, she said, takes exactly eight and a half minutes and costs $7.95. Told receptionist she had a deal. She smiled and turned me over to man introduced as Paul.
Paul led the way to a special stool, a well-padded prie-dieu. He instructed me to lean forward and place my forehead on a spongy rest. Paul put on latex gloves. Tried not to take it personally. These days everybody seems to be putting on latex gloves. Thought this probably very good for the Malaysian economy.
As Paul started kneading, stopped thinking. Heard New-Age strains on store speakers. Heard Paul ask if anything hurt. Heard unconnected fragments of distant conversations. Heard joints go snap, crackle and pop at much closer range. For exactly eight and a half minutes Paul probed, pounded and twisted. He stretched sinews, chopped flesh, snapped joints, and elbowed points of accumulated tension. He hammered vertebrae as if they were notes on a glockenspiel.
He stopped. Felt well manipulated. Asked Paul if ever rubbed anyone the wrong way. He said no. Thanked him and asked about the back rub business. Said he had been working at Great American Backrub since store opened last month. Like his fellow rubbers he was a licensed massage therapist. He is 28 years old and lives in Bayside. Last year he graduated from an 18-month program at the New Center for Holistic Health in Nassau County. Said working at Great American Backrub was a trip. Said he has done as many as 30 back rubs a day. Most customers come in off the street. Many have been shopping. Paul said customers divide pretty evenly between men and women. Generally he does not talk to customers while working on them but many volunteered that they never had a massage before coming in to the store.
Asked Paul whether he thought opening of store represented a deciding moment for massage marketing. Would Great American Backrub succeed in attracting clientele more used to relieving tension in bars? Instead of hoisting a few brewskies after work, would office and construction workers of the near future run over to their local chop shop for a bit of a pounding? Paul suggested questions be put to Bill Zanker, the owner and conceptualizer of the Great American Backrub.
Mr. Zanker, who is 39, said that was exactly what he thought might happen. He said the store was the first of what he envisions as a nationwide chain of off-the-street back-rub establishments. "The 90's are about health, about taking care of yourself, about pampering yourself a little," he said. "The 80's were about nails. You remember when there were no nail salons anywhere? Now they are on every block. I think the same thing will happen with back rubs."
Mr. Zanker has guessed right before. Back in the early 80's, when education and self improvement were maybe even bigger than nails, he developed the Learning Annex, an adult-education establishment where paying customers attended lectures on anything from how to meet a woman to how to meet a man. It was after he sold his interest there that he conceived of back rubs as the next big thing.
"I always loved massages," said the dapper and trim entrepreneur. "But they were always a big deal. It was like going to a doctor. You had to go somewhere, get undressed, get dressed, and come back. It could take three hours. Then a couple of years ago, in a California park, I saw a bearded, grimy guy giving back rubs and charging $1 a minute. His hands were dirty. He wasn't very good but still people were lined up. Right then I knew this thing had possibilities."
"To get Americans to buy massages I realized you had to solve three problems," Mr. Zanker said. "You had to come up with something that was quick, inexpensive and most important, you had to find a way to do it without asking people to take their clothes off."
The questions of time and money were resolved by having an expert develop the 8 1/2-minute program, based on Swedish massage, and by the $7.95 basic fee. As for keeping clothes on, Mr. Zanker said he worked with designers to come up with the padded chair. "You keep your shirt or blouse on, you put your forehead on the guard and it won't even muss your makeup."

HEADLINE: Living, and Dying, for Love and Family in East Harlem

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Nilma Rivas's family, much of it clustered within a few blocks of her East Harlem apartment, represented her life, her work and a bulwark of comfort and support against the crowded and dangerous city they had moved to from her native Puerto Rico. But most precious of all to her was her 5-year-old grandson.
Every day she walked the little boy, Geraldo, to school, picked him up to walk him home and shuttled him back and forth in the evenings between her apartment on East 122d Street and her daughter, Janice's, on East 111th Street. "The boy was like a little companion," said Mrs. Rivas's sister, Aida Brushman. "She lived for him." 
 She also died for him. Mrs. Rivas, 52, was walking her grandson from her daughter's apartment to her own on Monday night when she was hit by a stray bullet in a shootout. She was the latest casualty among unintended victims, a phenomenon that is one of the sharpest sources of terror for New York City residents, yet numbingly common. Mrs. Rivas became the 323d bystander to be shot in the city this year, according to the police. This category sets a pace slightly ahead of the 342 bystanders shot in all of 1992, but far behind the 535 people struck by stray bullets in 1991.
 
'People Who Knew'
 Residents of the area where Mrs. Rivas was killed say that shootings are commonplace. "People who knew what to do ran," said Jose Rivera, 25, who said he witnessed the killing. "Those who didn't know what to do stood around."
Witnesses said that at 7:45 P.M., a group of men in a car sprayed gunfire for several seconds at pedestrians on the northwest corner of 118th Street and Second Avenue. The police said a bullet severed an artery in Mrs. Rivas's leg, causing her to bleed to death.
Mr. Rivera said that the gunmen appeared to be aiming at two men walking near Mrs. Rivas and Geraldo, but that the two men fled, unharmed. A woman standing nearby carried Geraldo to safety, he said.
Neighborhood residents guessed that the shooting was an attempt by drug dealers to eliminate competitors. Sgt. John Raftery, commander of the 25th Precinct detective squad, said it was "a dispute over turf," adding that the police are requesting help from the public in solving the case.
"This has got to stop," said Mrs. Brushman, Mrs. Rivas's sister. "Some people are hurt, some people are dead, and the drug dealers are walking the streets."
Sitting in her apartment in the Taino Towers complex where Mrs. Rivas lived, Mrs. Brushman and another sister, Milagros Almodovar, who lives in the Bronx, struggled yesterday to voice their emotions. Mrs. Rivas, who was unemployed and had three grown children, was a quiet woman who "devoted her life to family only," Mrs. Brushman said.
Mrs. Rivas continued to look after her children even after they were grown, her sisters said, and spent nearly every evening in the company of her daughter and grandson.
The surviving sisters said the hardest-hit is Geraldo. Despite the family's efforts to distract him with toys and playmates, he becomes hysterical each time he sees a picture of his grandmother, they said. "Geraldo is traumatized," Mrs. Brushman said. "He's in shock."
"It's a very hard area," she said. "Almost every day, you hear the gunshots, especially at night."
At the site of the shooting there was a makeshift memorial yesterday. In front of the yellow police tape marking the site, in front of a gutter littered with crack vials, two devotional candles burned next to a bunch of flowers.
A man walking by, Jose Torres, marveled at the random nature of what had occurred. He said that he, his wife and children had crossed the spot where Mrs. Rivas died not five minutes before the shooting began.

HEADLINE: Mexican Company Agrees To Acquire U.S. Bus Maker

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES

 BODY:
The largest truck and bus manufacturer in Mexico said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Motor Coach Industries International Inc., a major United States bus maker whose customers include Greyhound Lines Inc., for $336.6 million in stock.
The proposed buyout of Motor Coach by a new United States subsidiary of Consorcio G Grupo Dina S.A. of Mexico City will create the largest bus manufacturer in North America. The companies have combined annual revenues of $1.4 billion. 
 The transaction is one of the biggest deals announced between United States and Mexican companies since the North American Free Trade Agreement was approved by the House of Representatives on Nov. 17. The deal also affects the third country covered by the trade agreement: Motor Coach has a Canadian subsidiary, Motor Coach Industries Ltd.
Motor Coach, based in Phoenix, was formerly part of the Dial Corporation, which once owned Greyhound Lines. The bus maker was spun off in August as part of Dial's strategy to focus on the soap and consumer products business.
While the free trade agreement was expected to benefit the companies because it would lift many restrictions on cross-border transactions, it was not the driving force behind the decision to merge, said Craig R. Lentzsch, Motor Coach's executive vice president of finance.
"It's our view it was a good business decision if Nafta was approved and it was a good business decision even if it wasn't," Mr. Lentzsch said.
He noted that the proposed merger would give the two companies "substantial economies of scale" in purchasing raw materials and parts.
"Nafta does help the economy in Mexico, which helps the sales of Grupo Dina in Mexico," Mr. Lentzsch said. "We think they also have products that apply in our markets" in the United States and Canada.
Dina is banned from exporting trucks to the United States under an agreement with the Navistar International Corporation, a Chicago-based maker of heavy-duty trucks and diesel engines, analysts said. The acquisition of Motor Coach will give Dina a way to sell buses in the United States.
Motor Coach's customers include Greyhound and smaller regional companies. The company makes intercity coach buses at plants in Pembina, N.D., and Winnipeg, Manitoba. It also makes transit buses in Roswell, N.M., and has a transit bus remanufacturing plant near Schenectady, N.Y. The company employs about 3,300 people, 1,000 of whom are in the transit bus business, which Motor Coach plans to sell.
 The merger agreement comes a few weeks after Motor Coach began a tender offer to acquire the minority interest in its Canadian subsidiary. Motor Coach currently holds about 69 percent of the Canadian affiliate. If the tender offer is successful, the Canadian subsidiary will be included in the merger with Dina.
The agreement calls for Motor Coach shareholders to receive $16.72 worth of a new class of Dina stock for each share of Motor Coach common stock. Motor Coach had about 20.1 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30. Dina plans to apply for a listing of the new shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of Motor Coach closed yesterday at $14.75, up $1.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. Dina's American depository receipts -- the equivalent of shares for many foreign companies on American exchanges -- closed at $22, down $1.875, on the Big Board.
Mr. Lentzsch said the company hoped to execute a definite agreement in several weeks.

HEADLINE: Army Corps Starts Big Erosion-Control Project on Jersey Shore

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WEST LONG BRANCH, N.J., Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Army Corps of Engineers is set to begin a major project to control beach erosion that eventually could stretch 33 miles along the New Jersey shore from Sandy Hook to Barnegat Inlet, officials said today.
The first phase of the $1.2 billion project, which will begin next year, includes sand replenishment from Sea Bright to Monmouth Beach, two communities hit hard by severe winter storms in recent years. 
 "It's taken a long, long time, but the protection this will provide to the area is unbelievable," said Bernard Moore, administrator for the state Division of Engineering and Construction. "There will be no more closing of Highway 36 because the ocean has come over the sea wall."
He spoke at a meeting of the Jersey Shore Partnership, an alliance of coastal counties, municipalities, businesses and individuals that was formed after the "Halloween Storm" of 1991 because of concerns about shoreline erosion and its effect on the state's $9 billion shore tourism industry.
Storms in 1991 and 1992 caused more than $250 million worth of damage in New Jersey.
 
Several Small Projects
 The Corps' coastal preservation projects are financed jointly by Federal money and a $15 million annual state allocation, which was established by last year's Legislature with money from taxes on the sale of property.
The Federal Government contributes 65 percent of the cost, with the remaining 35 percent coming from the state and affected municipalities.
Some of this year's state allotment will be used for several small municipal projects, including beach replenishment at Sea Isle City, Cape May City, Harvey Cedars and Union Beach, and other work at Atlantic City and Spring Lake.
Mr. Moore said the Corps' project to replenish the 12-mile section from Sea Bright to Ocean Township with more than eight million cubic yards of sand should be completed in five years. The entire 33-mile project could be under way by 1999, he said.
Many officials attending the conference said they were pleased by the plans outlined by the Corps.
"I think we're going to see the beginning of a new era of cooperation between those of us who have strong environmental beliefs and the belief that they can be accomplished without hurting the economy of the area," said Martin Chomsky, chairman of the Monmouth Water Resources Association.
The Corps has also designated virtually the rest of the state's coastline, including the Delaware Bay region, for studies to determine if additional preservation projects are needed.

Bond Yields Rise on Latest Data

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
After four days of modest rebounds, the bond market sold off yesterday in the face of stronger-than-expected economic data. The yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.30 percent.
The selling was quick after the Conference Board reported that its November confidence survey jumped to 71.2 from a revised 60.5 in October. The November level was far above the expected level of around 60. 
 At the same time, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said that its index of manufacturing conditions for November rose to 65.3 from 57 in October, also a little stronger than anticipated.
While there have been small dips in between, the yields on Treasury securities from the 30-year bond to the two-year note have been on an upward trend since mid-October. The yield on the 30-year bond is still below its recent high but the yield on the 2-year note is now at its highest level since June.
 
 
'A Bit Oversold'
 "I can't imagine the news being worse," Jay Goldinger, a trader at Capital Insight in Los Angeles, said. But, he added, he still thinks the market sold off too much yesterday, given the current level of yields and the underlying economic fundamentals.
"I think the market got a bit oversold and I think it will take a lot of effort for the market to go down from here," he added, referring to price levels.
Two forces are driving the market right now, seeming to fight it out in each day's trading. One is that the basic economic fundamentals underlying this year's push downward of long-term interest rates to their lowest levels in 25 years are still intact. These fundamentals include low inflation, with the Consumer Price Index rising at an annual rate of less than 3 percent this year, and moderate economic growth.
Some forecasters expect this moderate growth and low inflation to continue next year despite a pickup in growth in the fourth quarter of this year.
 
 
Economic Growth
 The second force is that with the pace of economic growth picking up in the last three months of the year, many investors are now worried that it will continue into the new year. If that does happen, inflation would become a concern again and it is likely that the Federal Reserve would decide to raise its target for short-term interest rates, which has been at 3 percent for more than a year.
The selling since mid-October, when interest rates reached their recent lows, has been a hedge against the possibility of strong growth continuing into next year and the fact that many money managers have sold to lock in the huge profits they have already made this year.
The uncertainty about the outlook vying with the factors that are supportive of interest rates around their current levels makes for a volatile trading environment. "The market is getting overbought and oversold to the extremes," Mr. Goldinger said.
This week there will be more economic indicators that traders and investors are likely to react to, topped off Friday with the employment data for November. Today, the Commerce Department announces its first revision of the gross domestic product for the third quarter. The G.D.P. was initially reported to have grown at an annual rate of 2.8 percent from July through September.
 
 
Secondary Market
 In trading in the secondary market around 5 P.M., the price of the 30-year bond was down 30/32 of a point as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 6.30 percent, from 6.23 percent Monday. In volatile trading since mid-October, the yield on the 30-year bond has been as high as 6.38 percent. The yield fell to a 25-year closing low of 5.78 percent on Oct. 15.
The price of the two-year Treasury note was off 4/32 as the yield rose to 4.22 percent, from 4.15 percent Monday. The yield topped its recent high of 4.21 percent.
The performance of longer-term Treasury securities was affected by the expectations on inflation. The yield on short-term Treasury notes is rising more because of the belief that the Federal Reserve will push short-term interest rates higher to resist any spurt in economic growth that would unleash new inflationary pressures.
Treasury prices got a small boost in the early afternoon after it was reported that the Federal Reserve had made a routine purchase of Treasury notes and bonds. The Fed regularly does such buying as part of its monetary policy operations to assure that bank reserve levels are high enough so that its overall policy will not be more restrictive than the central bank intends.
In the corporate bond market, $2.2 billion of new debt was sold yesterday, according to Bloomberg Business News. The Korean Development Bank sold $200 million of 5-year notes and $200 million of 12-year notes. The 5-year notes were priced to yield 5.905 percent, 74 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the yield on the 5-year Treasury note; the 12-year notes were priced to yield 6.797 percent, 98 basis points over the yield on the 10-year Treasury note.

Dollar Advances on Signs Of an Improving Economy

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against most leading European currencies yesterday on signs that the American economy is gaining momentum.
But it slipped against the Japanese yen, which benefited from a slight recovery in the Tokyo stock market. 
 Meanwhile, gold prices rose. Gold for December delivery gained 40 cents, to $369.80 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
The dollar rallied against the German mark and other European currencies after reports suggesting sharply improved consumer confidence and expanded manufacturing activity.
The Conference Board, a private business group, said its consumer confidence index soared to 71.2 in November from a revised 60.5 in October.
 
 
Manufacturing Activity
 Separately, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its index measuring activity in the key Midwestern manufacturing region climbed to 65.3 percent in November from 57.0 percent in October.
The dollar's rise was limited, however, as participants remained cautious ahead of Friday's employment report.
"The numbers were strong, but the improvement cannot be sustained without continued jobs growth," said Ken Nixon, corporate sales officer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in New York.
The dollar climbed to 1.7155 marks in late New York trading from 1.7091 marks on Monday. But it eased to 109.10 yen from 109.20 yen.
The dollar had risen against the yen recently as Tokyo stocks plummeted to lows not seen in more than a year. But the dollar shed some gains yesterday after Tokyo stocks rebounded.
Meanwhile, the pound firmed against the mark as the market applauded the British Government's proposal for larger-than-expected spending cuts and lower increases in taxes. But the currency lost ground to the dollar. The British pound closed in New York at $1.4860, down from $1.4890 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Monday's quotes, included: 1.4985 Swiss francs, up from 1.4894; 5.9295 French francs, up from 5.9025; 1,707 Italian lire, up from 1,696, and $1.3351 (Canadian), down from $1.3357 (Canadian).

On AIDS and the Nation's Blood Supply

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
In October, "Dateline NBC" carried a report on the risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion. It was a fairly typical news magazine piece that seemed bent on raising anxiety about a danger that it conceded had been brought under control. The difference between that story and "AIDS, Blood and Politics," tonight's offering from "Frontline," is the difference between a superficial treatment and serious reporting. "Dateline NBC" did not dig into the real story, which, as tonight's narrator says, is one "of missed opportunities, vested interests and lax regulations."
The "Frontline" investigation goes back to 1981, when a mysterious disease, then known as gay cancer, appeared among homosexuals. Not only would the virus spread rapidly through sexual contact but it would also contaminate the nation's blood supply. Many homosexual men had been giving blood in an effort to help find a vaccine against another disease, hepatitis B, that seemed to attack homosexuals. Some of the blood carried the new disease, soon to be known as AIDS, and entered the ordinary supplies of blood banks and found its way into the veins of people who needed transfusions. 
 When hemophiliacs, who rely on the injections of a blood product to keep them alive, died of the new disease, doctors at the Centers for Disease Control began to suspect that AIDS was being transmitted by blood. And when reports came in that other blood recipients had been infected, calls for tests of both the blood supply and donors met a powerful resistance that would allow thousands of continuing deaths.
Tonight's report is more about the play of influence in Washington than about strictly medical matters. At first, decision makers were understandably cautious about acting on inconclusive evidence of a connection between the volunteered blood and AIDS, but the resistance continued even as the evidence grew stronger and stronger.
Pressure groups played a part. When one blood bank began asking male volunteers whether they had had a sexual relationship with another man and rejecting those that said yes, homosexual groups protested that they were being discriminated against. The American Red Cross and the American Association of Blood Banks, seemingly seeking any reason not to confront the problem, declared: "Direct or indirect questions about a donor's sexual preference are inappropriate." Critics say that an unwillingness to bear the cost was at the bottom of the resistance of most blood banks to proposals to test donors.
"AIDS, Blood and Politics" comes down particularly hard on the Food and Drug Administration for bowing to political and economic pressures and on the American Red Cross, which collects more than half the nation's blood, for refusing to take action until forced. Even after 1985, when the F.D.A. at length imposed a blood test for volunteers, blood banks were not required to test the blood already in storage. (On Sunday, at 9 P.M., CNN "Special Assignment" presents evidence that Cutter Biological, a division of Miles Pharmaceuticals, sold tainted blood products for use by hemophiliacs in Costa Rica after 1985. The company, which is being sued, denies culpability.)
Finally, in 1988, the F.D.A. and the Red Cross reached a voluntary agreement for yearly inspections of their blood supplies, but the program notes that Red Cross banks in major cities did not live up to it and enforcement was lax, at least until 1993, when the drug agency obtained an injunction against the Red Cross, which was also beset by suits from victims of contaminated blood.
No one knows how many people have received the HIV virus through blood transfusions since 1985, but there is general agreement that the nation's blood supply is now safe. That is reassuring, but there is nothing reassuring about the record of the guardians of America's health as laid out in this strong example of "Frontline" at work.

 Like No Other Store . . .
 The Bloomingdale's Legend and the Revolution in American Marketing
 By Marvin Traub and Tom Teicholz
 Illustrated. 428 pages. Times Books/ Random House. $25. 
 To mark the start of the holiday shopping season, some stores are opening their doors at 7:30 A.M., earlier than most schools do, and others are offering free massages to overstimulated patrons. One is providing callers with a "Santa's Hotline," and another is supplying non-English-speaking shoppers with translators.
This is consumer culture operating at full blast, and it is a culture made in America just a century ago: a vast network of department stores, mail order catalogues, credit services, advertising and public relations, all set in motion by a group of businessmen who saw themselves as explorers and empire builders. As one of the savviest, John Wanamaker, put it in 1906 when the store that bore his name was taking off: "Everyone who starts a new thing has to stand where Columbus did when he set sail. Few had faith that he could ever reach the Land of Desire."
Wanamaker is a pivotal figure in William Leach's history of this ruthless and dazzling new world. Wanamaker's of Philadelphia was quickly joined by Marshall Field of Chicago, May's of St. Louis, Filene's of Boston, Bullock's of Los Angeles and Macy's of New York. Like nation-states, they competed and collaborated to gain financial power, social influence and the loyalty of their public. All were beneficiaries of a post-Civil War shift that had turned a largely agrarian economy into an industrial behemoth. With this economic shift came equally potent shifts in people's habits, tastes, wants, needs and pleasures.
"Land of Desire" follows these changes with scholarly exactness and writerly elegance. Mr. Leach takes in the full range of motives and responses at work in consumer culture, from greed and manipulation to idealism and inventiveness.
These men were nothing if not inventive. They devised bargain basements for "the masses" and upper-floor salons for "the classes." They cultivated friendly relations with museums and hired designers who used painting, sculpture and theater decor to create show windows that were visions of color, fabric and light. They lobbied city governments for favorable zoning laws, easy-access mass transit stops and high-visibility signs and billboards. They mined the worlds of the exotic and the primitive to stage fashion shows with "Garden of Allah" themes and Mayan "motifs."
By World War I, these stores had all the services a town or small city could offer. A shopper could purchase clothes, furniture and housewares; mail letters at an in-house post office; lunch in a tearoom; send the nanny and the children off to a Happyland and refresh her spirit in a meditative "Silence Room" before rejoining them.
Department store founders, as Mr. Leach perceptively notes, like to speak of their business in religious terms: Wanamaker called his store the Garden of Merchandise and his goods "beautiful fields of necessities." Designers liked to invoke art: L. Frank Baum, the most influential window designer in the country (before he wrote "The Wizard of Oz" and retired), said that lamps and tin pots must be made to come alive as if they were figures on the stage.
Advertising experts preferred a political or psychological discourse. The ability to want and choose was an equal right for all citizens. Public relations was, as Mr. Leach puts it, "a nonjudgmental technique similar to psychoanalysis, to be applied to any institution, person or commodity that needed its 'image' (ego) refurbished in the public arena." Even the 1928 economic study produced by Herbert Hoover sounded Freudian when it declared that the economy had proved conclusively the theory that "wants are nearly insatiable." In "Civilization and Its Discontents," published two years later, Freud wrote that humans are ruled by the pleasure principle, and by desires that can never be met. The merchants of consumer culture set out to prove that those desires can, should and must be met -- or at least lived out fully -- at the department store.
In this light, Marvin Traub's "Like No Other Store . . .: The Bloomingdale's Legend and the Revolution in American Marketing" makes very interesting reading. Mr. Traub came to Bloomingdale's in 1950, a year out of the Harvard Business School. His goal was to give "the chic woman" a reason to shop there: at that time it was known as the store where the maids of chic women shopped.
Mr. Traub made his way from the bargain basement to the company presidency, and this book explains the merchandising techniques he used so well. When business got slow in the basement, he and a fellow employee would put on their coats and hats, rush to the bargain counter tables and pretend to be customers, "tossing through them as if there was hidden gold. Once we attracted a crowd, we would quietly slip back to our offices."
By the 70's and 80's, Mr. Traub was concentrating on boutiques that featured the ready-to-wear clothes of Yves Saint Laurent and Ralph Lauren, and mounting updated "Garden of Allah" spectacles titled "India: The Ultimate Fantasy," "Israel: The Dream" and "China: Heralding the Dawn of a New Era." A hostile takeover and a declaration of bankruptcy forced him out of Bloomingdale's in 1991. He now has a consulting firm involved, among other things, in the fast-developing cable-television shopping networks.
Mr. Traub is cheerfully and egotistically convinced that every trend, from high-visibility advertising to the hard sell of women's cosmetics, began in the 60's when he came to power. Perhaps he and Mr. Leach should exchange books for Christmas. "Land of Desire" will show Mr. Traub the history that made him. "Like No Other Store . . .," with sales advice and self-congratulation on every page, will show Mr. Leach what a very good social historian he is.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Small, but 'Dynamic' City Triumphs

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
More than its unsuccessful rivals in Baltimore, Memphis or St. Louis, Jacksonville needed yesterday's surprise anointment as the 30th team in the National Football League to make it feel like a major league city.
After all, the city in northern Florida is the second-smallest N.F.L. television market (ahead of only Green Bay, Wis.); is host to only two big college football games -- the Gator Bowl on New Year's Day and the annual matchup between the universities of Florida and Georgia -- and lost its only two professional franchises, football teams in the United States Football League and World Football League. 
 But Jacksonville, 90 miles from the University of Florida in Gainesville, is football-happy: its Bulls led the U.S.F.L. in attendance.
Jacksonville has a population of 693,546; the five-county Jacksonville market has 940,891 residents. It is the 54th-ranked television market in the country, 12 below Memphis, according to A.C. Nielsen Market research.
 
Proving the Doubters Wrong
 "Being named an N.F.L. city exposes us to the nation and gives us exposure on television and in newspapers that we couldn't possibly pay for," said Dr. Adam Herbert, chairman of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce. "This gives the nation a clear sense of how dynamic this city is."
Among Jacksonville's major employers are CSX Railroad, Winn-Dixie, A.T.&T., Merrill Lynch, the Mayo Clinic and Distakon, a disposable contact lens maker.
Herbert added: "We've been optimistic for 15 years that we'd get a team, but along the way, some people doubted our capacity to do it. We've been to the altar a number of times. Even yesterday some people were skeptical."
Although economic impact studies frequently overstate how lucrative a sports franchise will be to a city because the money spent on a team would most likely be spent on other pursuits, Jacksonville's study estimated an impact of $130.9 million, and the creation of 2,989 new jobs in the area economy.
 
At What Cost?
 "Getting a team is important," said Harry Reagan, a Democratic Council member, "but I'm concerned that the economic impact of sports is oversold. Having a pro sports team doesn't necessarily make you a major league city."
Reagan is critical of the city's proposed $121 million expenditure to renovate the Gator Bowl. "It went too far," he said of the plan for taxpayer money and a state sales tax rebate to pay for adding 10,000 club seats and 68 luxury boxes and making numerous structural renovations.
If the cost of renovation goes beyond the ceiling, the city will lend the money to the ownership group, which would repay the sum over 30 years.
Reagan said money going to the stadium renovation could be better spent, with more and better jobs created, on economic development projects such as the city's busy port, which needs expansion.
Herbert noted that $49 million of the renovations was previously earmarked for improvements, regardless of getting an N.F.L team, to keep the annual Florida-Georgia game.
 
Big Payoff for the Visitors
 As part of the winning pitch to the league, the ownership group, named Touchdown Jacksonville Ltd., guaranteed visiting teams $1 million per game, the highest guarantee of the four competing cities, Herbert said.
The lead investor in Touchdown Jacksonville is J. Wayne Weaver, chief executive of Stamford, Conn.-based Nine West, a women's shoe manufacturer and retailer, which owns 267 retail outlets around the country. He owns a home on nearby Amelia Island, and his brother, also involved in the ownership group, lives in Jacksonville.
Another investor is Jeb Bush, the son of former President George Bush, and a candidate for Governor of Florida. His brother, George W. Bush, is a part owner of baseball's Texas Rangers.
"We're pumped," said Ken Tonning, president and general manager of WTLV-TV, the NBC affiliate, which broadcasts Miami Dolphins games. "At 4:15 today, I tried to make a call crosstown but the lines were jammed."
NBC would love the N.F.L. to name Jacksonville an American Football Conference team because WTLV is a powerful VHF station, while WCNC-TV, its affiliate in Charlotte, the other expansion city, is a weak UHF outlet.
"We're a strong station and having the Jaguars would do wonders for us," Tonning said.

HEADLINE: The Plutonium Glut

 BODY:
The dismantling of nuclear warheads after the cold war will free as much as 40,000 A-bombs' worth of plutonium in the coming decade, according to a recent estimate by the Rand Corporation. An equal amount of plutonium is piling up in the spent-fuel dumps of civilian nuclear reactors around the world. This glut threatens to swamp efforts to prevent the spread of atomic arms.
Reactor-grade plutonium may not be as efficient an explosive as weapons-grade plutonium, but it still packs a mighty wallop if compacted into a critical mass -- enough to wipe out a small city. 
 The U.S. is trying to buy back as much of the nuclear material released from former Soviet warheads as it can. That is a sound investment in making the world less dangerous. But the Clinton Administration now needs to reduce the threat from civilian stockpiles as well, by discouraging other states from producing plutonium and encouraging them to put all the material they have under strict international safeguards.
Plutonium is a deadly substance. As little as five pounds of it can destroy a city in a nuclear explosion. Inhaling less than a pinch of the stuff can cause cancers. And its radiation can kill those exposed to high doses. That makes plutonium very difficult to handle and even harder to dispose of.
America's British, French and Japanese allies seem hellbent on producing plutonium for power plants. That may once have made sense as a hedge against uncertainty in energy supplies. But it no longer does when the world already has enough uranium to fuel all its nuclear power plants for at least a half-century.
The U.S. has stopped all plutonium production. And the Administration has proposed a global treaty banning production of plutonium unless it is subject to international inspections.
But that treaty would still allow plutonium to be produced. To close the loophole, the Administration could propose a protocol banning production of plutonium even under safeguards. Countries would be encouraged to sign not only the treaty but also the protocol.
The plutonium already produced for bombs and reactors would still be available for civilian use. It, along with uranium withdrawn from military use, could be registered and stored under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Only under the strictest conditions should it be allowed to be withdrawn from storage. The world will become safer if the plutonium glut is controlled.

HEADLINE: A Bigger -- and Safer -- Europe

BYLINE: By Zbigniew Brzezinski; Zbigniew Brzezinski was national security adviser in the Carter Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the wake of victory in the cold war, Western leaders seem bereft of the strategic vision and daring that led to the founding of NATO and its unique military-political integration of two continents.
There is unanimity that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be continued. But there are contentious issues, too: how NATO should relate to Europe's emerging political unity, how it should respond to the security vacuum in Central Europe previously filled by Soviet power and the kind of relationship it should develop with Russia. 
 The debate over NATO's future, to resume tomorrow when foreign ministers meet in Brussels, has been dominated largely by parochial concerns.
Germany is most sympathetic to a redefinition of the alliance's scope and mission. Conscious of the threatening instability in the East (dramatized by the bloodshed in southeastern Europe), Germany sees eastward expansion of NATO as an integral part of shaping a secure, united and larger Europe.
France, anxious about Germany's growing political and economic pre-eminence in Central Europe, emphasizes the need to further deepen Western European military and political cooperation in order to reduce what it sees as excessive dependence on America.
Britain, eager to dilute French and German leadership in the European Union, favors expanding the union's membership (more economic width, less political depth). But it is cautious about major changes lest Britain's once vaunted "special relationship" with America is further diminished.
NATO'S loudest voice, Washington, has been strangely muted on the issue, except for President Clinton's proposed "Partnership for Peace" plan, basically meant to avoid jeopardizing the emerging American-Russian connection.
President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic argues that Central Europe's new democracies have a right to be part of any European-Atlantic security system and that the West should live up to its professed convictions. President Lech Walesa of Poland echoes him.
While no longer opposing European integration and the European-Atlantic security connection, Russia wants integration to be confined to the western peripheries of the continent. NATO is progressively to be diluted into a vast and still undefined security system from Vancouver eastward to Vladivostok.
In that vague system, America would retain its close links with Western Europe, Russia would enjoy a special security role in the space of the former Soviet Union, and Central Europe would be kept out of NATO and be recognized as a zone of particular Russian interest.
These ideas are to be aired during a NATO summit meeting in mid-January and during Mr. Clinton's later visit to Moscow. Any NATO unwillingness to define new and constructive goals for America and Europe is likely to result only in empty slogans. But the eagerness of the American and Russian Presidents to make each other look good may produce formulas that could perniciously affect the prospects for European stability.
The vague "Partnership for Peace" signals American reluctance to override Russian objections to any widening of NATO. That "partnership" involves limited and mainly technical NATO collaboration with any former Communist country of Central Europe and Eurasia, whether or not it is a democracy and is vulnerable to dangerous territorial or ethnic conflicts. This is thus an indirect rejection of the Central European states that can claim to have met the criteria for NATO membership.
A further danger is that President Clinton, while in Moscow, may be tempted to endorse a formula for an American-Russian guarantee of Central European security. The formula would re-establish a privileged role for Russia over Central Europe, but with an American sanction. (Echoes of Yalta.)
Russia's newly proclaimed military doctrine establishing a preponderant security interest in the region is ominous. So was the aggressive tone of the warning last week by Yevgeny M. Primakov, the intelligence chief, that an expansion of NATO would force Moscow into "fundamental" countermeasures.
A special American-Russian deal might intensify uncertainty about Europe's future while fostering anti-American resentments. Russian imperial ambitions would be rekindled, jeopardizing the prospects for Russian democracy.
That risk makes it imperative that Western, especially American, leaders define a new and wider vision for European-Atlantic security. It should be designed to revive movement toward a secure, more self-reliant and larger Europe and to fashion with Russia a cooperative relationship that bars imperial ambitions.
A worthy goal is a Europe within its historical and cultural frontiers, a Europe that truly embraces its Central European kin, a Europe that by expanding the scope of its security arrangements reduces the potential for Bosnia-type instability.
But it is also essential to embrace the new Russia cordially, lest rejection accelerate the re-emergence of imperial ambitions.
The best course would be a far-reaching NATO proposal for a formal treaty of alliance with Russia and a simultaneous initiative to establish a NATO-linked "coalition for regional security" with the three or four Central European states qualifying for eventual NATO membership.
The treaty would reassure Russia that NATO is a partner, not a potential adversary; the initiative would begin the long process of enlarging NATO.
The alliance with Russia would be based on the recognition that Russia can contribute to world peace. But as a truly major power, sensitive about its status, Russia is not likely to subordinate its forces to NATO by becoming merely another member, despite the largely diversionary hints that it would welcome such membership.
Much more likely would be a Russian effort to dilute NATO into something similar to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, thereby undoing it.
But a treaty could provide for mutual planning of peacekeeping, peace-enforcing missions and other military cooperation while satisfying Russia's understandable quest for special recognition.
A NATO-sponsored "coalition for regional security" could involve tighter coordination and integration by stages of Central European states into NATO's command, logistics, planning and training systems.
Unlike the looser "partnership" idea, the coalition would be defined explicitly as a transition toward eventual full membership in the alliance. Members would be expected to assume some burdens of any NATO decision on collective action; in return, they would be defined as a region of defensive security interest to the alliance, though without forward deployment of NATO forces in them.
The NATO-centered system of security would thus involve a Central European coalition as a steppingstone toward membership, a wider "Partnership for Peace," and an alliance with Russia.
A program along these lines would be an important step toward assuring a more secure and larger Europe.

HEADLINE: In America;
America's Job Disaster

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The vast majority of American young people, three out of four, never get a college degree. And the schooling they do receive does not prepare them well for the world of work.
These youngsters may be experts at video games, they may have an eye for fashion and a sense of style, they may be connoisseurs of MTV -- but most of them are inept at the nearly lifelong task of finding and holding a job. 
 According to the Department of Labor: "They receive little guidance on how to move into a career that can support a family. Their reading, writing, math and communications skills are largely inadequate for the demands of today's quality employers."
New York Telephone once tested 57,000 applicants before finding 2,100 who were qualified for entry-level technical jobs.
Studies have shown that in the 1980's the real wages of men with college degrees increased modestly, while high school graduates saw their wages decline by 9 percent, and the wages of dropouts fell by a precipitous 12 percent.
In those 10 years the earnings gap between high school and college graduates doubled.
Instead of getting better, the situation is growing worse. College graduates are having a harder and harder time finding employment, and when they have to settle for less they put a downward squeeze on everybody else in the job market. Those at the bottom get squeezed out.
For black and Latino young people in the nation's biggest cities, conditions have become catastrophic. Their official rate of unemployment ranges from 25 to 40 percent. But Jack Wuest, executive director of a program in Chicago called the Alternative Schools Network, noted that: "Over 75 to 80 percent of minority youth are not ever counted in the official unemployment rate because they are not even looking for work. They often live in neighborhoods where there are no jobs to be found."
And when you can't find a job it's easy to find trouble.
Job training advocates have felt for many years that it would be helpful if the United States had a school-to-work program, a national effort to aid the passage of young people into the increasingly complex world of employment. Bill Clinton was a supporter and he has come up with a program called the "School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1993." It has passed the House and will be taken up by the Senate early next year.
It will do very little.
The original idea was to bring the school and work experiences together for young people. In addition to their academic work, they would receive some occupational training and real employment experience, thus giving them a boost toward a career. There would also be a component for dropouts.
The Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce, headed by Ira Magaziner and with Hillary Rodham Clinton as a staff person, reported in 1990 that "America may have the worst school-to-work transition system of any advanced industrial country. Students who know few adults to help them get their first job are left to sink or swim."
President Clinton's program will not change that. In introducing the legislation, Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat, said, "It is a small investment that will yield dramatic returns in productivity."
"Small" is the operative word. Minuscule would be better. Only $100 million is available for the entire program the first year. It's anybody's guess after that.
To put it in perspective, consider that the Senate, in approving its crime bill earlier this month, authorized the expenditure of $3 billion to finance the construction of 10 new regional prisons, and another $3 billion for boot camps and other programs for young offenders.
Referring to the funding levels of the school-to-work initiative, Bob Taggart, president of the Remediation and Training Institute in Alexandria, Va., said: "There's just enough water to water the topsoil of consultants and policy gurus. The money is just not going to get down there to kids in need."
There is a violent crime emergency in the United States, and there is an employment crisis. The policy makers seem unable to understand the ways in which they are linked, and the degree to which the former is driven by the latter.

HEADLINE: Haiti Premier Insists He Will Quit; Hope for a Political Accord Fades

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 1

 BODY:
In a blow to diplomatic efforts to salvage a political accord in Haiti, Prime Minister Robert Malval announced today that he would resign as planned on Dec. 15.
Speaking to the nation hours before he left for Washington, Mr. Malval said his talks this week with the country's military authorities had failed to make any progress in restoring democracy to Haiti. He denounced the military for what he said was its total lack of cooperation. 
 Aides to Mr. Malval said he would tender his resignation to the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in Washington. Father Aristide appointed Mr. Malval on Aug. 30.
 
Diplomatic Setback
 Mr. Malval's resignation could be the final blow to a 10-month effort to restore Father Aristide under an accord signed in July by both the President and the army leaders who overthrew him 26 months ago. The military commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, violated the agreement by refusing to resign.
With army-sponsored political violence widespread and the Parliament dominated by enemies of Father Aristide, there is little prospect that the President will be able to appoint a new Government soon.
Diplomats, foreign relief workers and Haitian economists say the economy is heading for collapse under the weight of an international oil embargo and two years of severe economic mismanagement. Scores of businesses have closed, hunger is spreading and some Government employees are not being paid.
Hoping to avoid further deterioration, President Clinton and senior United Nations diplomats have asked Mr. Malval to help salvage the diplomatic efforts. During meetings this week, Haitian military and business leaders also called for Mr. Malval to stay on. The 50-year-old businessman is widely seen as an independent figure.
Senior officials, however, say the Prime Minister sees his role as a political fiction. The aides said Mr. Malval had also concluded that the international community lacks the will to force the military to step down.
"The fiction of our Government comforts everyone," Frantz Voltaire, Mr. Malval's chief of staff, said in an interview today. "It allows the international community to avoid facing up to the reality here and it allows the army to avoid its responsibilities. Meanwhile, the situation in the country just rots."

HEADLINE: PENTAGON STUDIES PLANS TO BOLSTER U.S.-KOREA FORCES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
With President Clinton facing a decision on whether to seek sanctions against North Korea, the Pentagon is weighing options for strengthening United States and South Korean forces in the event that the confrontation over North Korea's nuclear program worsens.
Clinton Administration officials said that Gen. Gary E. Luck, the commander of American forces in South Korea, is worried that sanctions against North Korea for its refusal to allow international inspections of its nuclear sites could increase the risk of conflict. The officials said General Luck is preparing a list of steps -- called "flexible deterrence options" -- to strengthen American forces in South Korea.
 
Clinton Asks Review
 Reflecting his concern that diplomacy may fail to resolve the standoff with North Korea, Mr. Clinton has ordered Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to personally review with him the Pentagon's plan to defend South Korea. 
 Mr. Clinton's request comes amid conflicting Pentagon assessments about whether American and South Korean forces in the region would be able to withstand a North Korean attack.
Clinton Administration officials caution that they are still putting most of their energy into working out a diplomatic solution to North Korea's refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear installations, and they stress that Washington is not looking for a fight.
 
U.N. Agency Defers Statement
 In fact, the Administration has persuaded the International Atomic Energy Agency to postpone a formal declaration this week that it is no longer able to track nuclear material stockpiled by the Communist Government, or provide assurances that the North's plutonium supply is not being diverted to nuclear weapons projects.
The delay is intended to give the Administration a few more weeks to seek a diplomatic solution to the impasse over inspections.
When the agency's board of governors meets on Thursday in Vienna, however, its inspectors will report that virtually all of the electronic surveillance systems installed over the past 18 months at Yongbyon, the nuclear site north of the capital, Pyongyang, have now run out of film and battery power. North Korea has prevented inspectors from visiting nuclear sites in the country since August.
Diplomats in Seoul, Tokyo and Washington say that the agency's inspection regime has been virtually blinded.
 
Plays Down Angry Comment
 Today, President Clinton, played down the significance of angry comments by North Korea, which has said that it would consider the imposition of sanctions to be an "act of war."
"The one thing I've learned here over the last year in dealing with North Korea," Mr. Clinton said during a picture taking session in the Oval Office, "is it's important not to overreact either positively or negatively to something that they say, which may not mean the same thing to them that it does to us the first time we hear it."
The Administration says it is determined to prevent North Korea from developing an atomic weapon. If negotiations on the current standoff fail, Washington plans to push for economic sanctions in the United Nations in the coming months.
Administration officials said that if the talks break down, Washington is likely to seek a graduated series of sanctions in the hopes of winning political support from China, South Korea and Japan and of minimizing the chances of a military conflict.
Thousands of North Korean troops have faced American and South Korean forces across the border since the end of the Korean War. But as the Administration approaches a decision to press for sanctions, the once-abstract notion of a North Korean attack has become a more realistic worry.
"You always reassess the balance of forces as things come to a head," said a senior American general.
Many analysts think that North Korea's threat to attack is probably a bluff, but so little is known about the insular North Korean leadership that no officials want to take a chance.
 
Warning From C.I.A.
 R. James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence, said on CNN's "Larry King Live" on Tuesday that the possibility of a North Korean attack could not be excluded.
Nowhere are the North Korean statements taken more seriously than among the American high command in South Korea, which is headed by General Luck.
"General Luck feels that sanctions are a dangerous option," a Clinton Administration official said. "As the commander of 37,000 men there he will want to try to increase deterrence if we go that route."
These options range from increasing the alert status of American forces to the increased use of spy satellites to moving an aircraft carrier closer to Korea. Other options under consideration at the Pentagon include deploying Patriot air-defense missiles to counter the North Korean Scud missile threat and dispatching more Air Force squadrons and Army troops to South Korea.
"We have always been conscious of the fact that imposing sanctions runs the risk of uncertain North Korean reaction," the Pentagon said in a statement.
 
Seek to Avoid Provocation
 Administration officials also say that if sanctions are imposed and additional military steps are taken, Washington will try to strike a balance between strengthening American forces in the region and avoiding measures that might provoke the North Koreans.
North Korea is estimated to have at least a million people under arms, and at least 3,500 tanks.
Since 1990, North Korea has improved its large commando force and deployed long-range artillery in fortified sites near the demilitarized zone. It is manufacturing 10 to 15 Scuds a month, intelligence analysts say.
While the North Korean military has suffered from fuel shortages, about 70 percent of its striking power is clustered close to the border with South Korea. Seoul is about 25 miles from the border, within artillery range.
 
War Would Be Costly
 The widespread view among aides to Mr. Aspin is that the United States and South Korean forces could, with timely reinforcements, successfully repulse a North Korean attack, although some Administration officials acknowledge that Seoul would probably be destroyed in the process and that millions of refugees would stream south.
"A war between the north and south would be very costly in terms of human lives," Adm. Charles R. Larson, the commander of American forces in the Pacific, said at a news conference in Tokyo today. "But let me be very clear that the South would win. There would not be a victory option for North Korea."
But a more alarming view was put forward in a 1991 classified report prepared by head of the Pentagon's Office of Net Assessment, which is headed by Andrew W. Marshall.
That assessment challenged the conventional wisdom that the United States forces have adequate logistics. It also questioned whether air power could be a dominating force in such a battle and raised questions about the capabilities of the South Korean Army.
That study was never accepted by top aides to former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Mr. Aspin, who said it underestimated the abilities of air power and overestimated the abilities of the North Koreans.
But Robert Gaskin, a former Air Force colonel who worked on the study, defended it.
"Most people think air power will turn the tide of the North attacks, much as it did during Desert Storm," said Mr. Gaskin, who now serves as vice president of Business Executives for National Security, a private group. "I have served three tours of duty as a fighter pilot, reconnaissance pilot, and forward air controller, and I am not at all optimstic."

HEADLINE: County in Texas Snubs Apple Over Unwed-Partner Policies

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROUND ROCK, Tex., Dec. 1

 BODY:
It sounded like a bonanza for suburban Williamson County: high-tech, high-wage jobs, 1,500 or more by the turn of the century, from a Silicon Valley giant. Apple Computer wanted to build an $80 million office complex on a patch of ranch land just north of Austin.
But shortly after Apple executives and county officials announced the plans, in tandem with a $750,000 property tax abatement for the company, two of the county's five commissioners raised objections. 
 Apple, they noted, is one of a small but growing number of corporations that grant the same health benefits to the unmarried partners of their employees, whether heterosexual or homosexual, that are confered on spouses. That policy undermines traditional family values, they said, and Williamson County should not condone it.
 
Tax Break is Shelved
 Then a third commissioner, David S. Hays, who had said earlier that the county had no business meddling with the policy of a private company, announced a sudden change of heart. With nearly 70 people crowded into a small meeting room on Tuesday -- one of them shouting that the county "was not founded on same-sex lovers and live-in lovers" -- Mr. Hays joined the other two commissioners to reject granting Apple its tax abatement.
"If I had voted yes," he said, "I would have had to walk into my church with people saying, 'There is the man who brought homosexuality to Williamson County.' "
Apple officials said today that as a matter of both principle and economics the company would not build on the 128-acre site in Williamson County unless the tax break was restored.
Gov. Ann W. Richards was left pleading with the company to look at other sites in Texas. Apple officials said that while they would entertain lobbying by Texas officials for other sites, they also planned to look outside the state.
For its part, the county, which has aggressively courted other high-tech companies, appears to have punted away a project that one study estimated would have pumped $300 million into the local economy over the next several years.
But even as many people here seemed a bit bewildered at the prospect of losing all those jobs -- one resident described the commissioners' action as "insane" -- others said they wholeheartedly supported the move.
"It goes to what kinds of morals do you want to set for your community," said Sherry Roberts, the owner of Heart and Home, an antiques and curios store on Round Rock's Western-style Main Street. "What do you teach your kids? That's what this is all about.
One of her customers, Laura Yendrey, a 31-year-old mother of three, nodded in enthusiastic agreement. "I know not everyone can have a perfect family, a husband and wife, 2.5 children," she said, clutching her 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Lauren. "But this is what we strive for. This is what the great American family is all about."
 
'Depth of Anti-Gay Feeling'
 In the commissioners' vote, some people here detected the growing influence of conservative Christian groups that had recently gained a voting majority on the Round Rock school board and had ousted the school superintendent in a bitter showdown. The superintendent, whom the previous board had rewarded with salary bonuses because the district's test scores had risen, drew criticism from some new board members after he banned public prayers at high school football games.
National gay rights groups said the vote was the first by a government entity anywhere in the country seeking to punish a company for extending fringe benefits to unmarried partners. They asserted it was more a reflection of pervasive anti-gay bias in much of the country than of deep-seated religious convictions.
"It's a classic example of the depth of anti-gay feeling," said William Rubenstein, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's lesbian and gay rights project. "It's hard to believe any county in this day and age would turn down the opportunity to have Apple Computer in your community. It's remarkable that in these economically difficult times, this blatant prejudice would prevail over smart business decisions."
Actually, times are not so tough in Williamson County, and some people here said the commissioners' rejection of the tax abatement was the sort of luxury county leaders might not have indulged a few years ago, when fallout from the oil bust ravaged the state.
Round Rock, at the edge of the Central Texas Hill Country, has evolved from a predominantly agricultural area with a population of 2,400 in 1970 to a suburb of 37,000 people. Many commute 15 or 20 minutes south to Austin for work. The official county unemployment rate for October was 3.5 percent, barely half the state rate.
Still, many people here go out of their way to note that they live here because it is not Austin, which generally has a reputation as the state's most liberal city. Earlier this fall, Austin became the first Texas municipality to grant health benefits to the unmarried domestic partners of city employees.
"It's more traditional values, a family-oriented type of atmosphere," said Round Rock's Mayor, Charlie Culpepper, said of his town. "It's for people that want to live in central Texas and don't want to live in Travis County," where Austin is the county seat.
Bill Keegan, a spokesman for Apple, said in an interview today that company officials thought the Williamson County site was "an ideal location for us" and were surprised by the vote.
 
Opposition is Adamant
 With annual revenues of about $8 billion, Apple is the second-largest maker of personal computers in the world, after International Business Machines.
Mr. Keegan said state and company officials had both approached the county about reconsidering the tax abatement. But the three commissioners remain adamantly opposed.
Commissioner Hays said today that his comments about not wanting to be the man who brought homosexuality to the county were "a little strong," but he quickly added: "All I have is my integrity and my values and my strong belief in traditional values."
Another commissioner who voted against the tax break recalled a recent meeting with Apple executives.
"They said they felt like members of the gay community were very highly educated and were excellent employees, and felt like they wanted to incorporate this into their benefits to be able to attract those types of people," the commissioner, Greg Boatright, said today. "And in the community I live in, that's in direct conflict with what I believe to be the community's viewpoint."

HEADLINE: Conservative on School Board Is Chosen as a Giuliani Deputy

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

In the first appointment to his administration, Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday named as a deputy mayor Ninfa Segarra, one of the four Board of Education members who ousted Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez over his support for a curriculum that discussed homosexuality and AIDS.
Mr. Giuliani praised Ms. Segarra as a "role model and a hero" who had been "able to stand up for what she believes in," referring to her defiance of Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx, who appointed her to the board. Both Mr. Ferrer and Mayor David N. Dinkins tried to force Ms. Segarra to resign after she aligned herself with the conservative majority of the board and became a political supporter of Mr. Giuliani. 
 Ms. Segarra, a 43-year-old lawyer, was named as a search committee met again yesterday on the subject of a new police commissioner. As the deliberations continued, William J. Bratton, the Boston Police Commissioner who is still considered a leading contender for the job, apologized at home for his remark that he would consider his Boston job a good "consolation prize."
 
Aid With Voting Bloc
 With the higher-visibility posts of police commissioner, budget director and finance commissioner still unfilled, the Mayor-elect's aides stressed yesterday the symbolism of his decision to make a Hispanic woman his first appointee. Ms. Segarra, with her mother and two children at her side, said that she would be representing "not just myself and my family but all Latinos and Latinas who work and live in the city that we love so much."
 
Role May Expand
 She was one of Mr. Giuliani's earliest Hispanic supporters, helping him gain a following in a voting bloc that was to prove pivotal in the mayoral election.
As he named Ms. Segarra, Mr. Giuliani also said he would "substantially" reduce the number of deputy mayors in his administration from the current six. He said that at a minimum Ms. Segarra would oversee "education and community affairs."
"Ninfa's responsibility will rather substantially expand as we appoint the remaining deputy mayors," he said.
Mr. Giuliani did not specify which of the remaining five jobs under the current configuration -- first deputy mayor and deputies for public safety, planning and development, finance and economic development, and health and human services -- would be eliminated. The position of deputy mayor for community affairs was the last one that Mr. Dinkins created, late last year, drawing criticism from opponents that he had created an unnecessary public relations post.
Mr. Dinkins did not have a deputy mayor for education, and Mr. Giuliani said the appointment of Ms. Segarra signaled that "we want to make education and schools a major priority of my administration."
The Mayor-elect also said that some agencies would now report directly to the mayor instead of to a deputy, and advisers suggested that Mr. Giuliani, a former Federal prosecutor, would deal personally with criminal-justice matters.
Staking a position in a bitter battle over who will control the political direction of the divided seven-member Board of Education, Mr. Giuliani said Ms. Segarra would also stay on the board until her term runs out on June 30. While the City Charter prohibits a person from holding two salaried city jobs, Mr. Giuliani said Ms. Segarra would waive her board stipend of $15,000 in order to keep both posts. The deputy mayor's salary is now $112,000.
 
Board Control at Stake
 The move to keep Ms. Segarra on the Board of Education countered Mr. Dinkins's own maneuver earlier in the month in which he asked Victor Gotbaum to resign early so that Mr. Dinkins and not Mr. Giuliani could appoint someone to serve the six remaining months of his term. The board is composed of two mayoral appointees and one appointee of each of the five borough presidents.
Ms. Segarra was named to the board in 1990 by Mr. Ferrer but soon angered him, Mr. Dinkins and other liberals by joining the conservative bloc, which also includes Michael J. Petrides of Staten Island, Carol A. Gresser of Queens and Irene H. Impellizzeri of Brooklyn. Her three allies went to Mr. Giuliani's transition headquarters on Madison Avenue to see her named deputy mayor.
If Ms. Segarra had resigned, leaving Mr. Ferrer free to make a new appointment, Mr. Dinkins and his supporters would have held the majority, instead of the more conservative board members.
It was unclear yesterday whether anyone would challenge Ms. Segarra's dual appointment. Aides to Mr. Dinkins said they believed it would be legal only if Ms. Segarra resigned from the Board of Education and later was named as a mayoral appointee to the board without salary.
A spokesman for Mr. Ferrer, Clint Roswell, when asked for Mr. Ferrer's reaction to the appointment, said, "He said that his mother handed down to him an adage he's tried to follow: When you don't have anything good to say about anyone don't say anything."
The angry tenor of the city's debate over education was evident in the responses to Ms. Segarra's appointment. Ms. Gresser, the Board of Education president, said, "For the first time ever we will have someone in City Hall who has direct experience in education."
But Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said: "Ninfa Segarra certainly wouldn't have been on my list for deputy mayor for education. Her priorities on the Board of Education seem to have been determined by politics rather than improving our schools." Ms. Feldman, whose union was neutral in the mayor's race, added, "Let's hope she'll do better now."
Ms. Segarra's dual role is likely to put her in an unusual position in the annual budget battles between the mayor and the Board of Education.
She acknowledged yesterday that one potentially awkward conflict would be avoided only because her term expires at the end of June. Periodically, the Board of Education sues the city over the budget outlay for the board. But the city budget is due to be passed about the same time that her term expires, so any suit would be filed by the new board.
Mr. Giuliani yesterday seemed protective of Ms. Segarra. When she was asked at the news conference about her service on a transition screening panel that has received a job application from her fiance, Larry Allison, Mr. Giuliani stepped forward and said she would recuse herself if Mr. Allison is considered for the post as head of the Off-Track Betting Corporation.
 
Mending Fences
 Later yesterday the nine-member search committee screening candidates for police commissioner met with the Mayor-elect to discuss candidates, said its chairman, Howard Wilson. He declined to elaborate.
One name that surfaced for the first time was that of Thomas L. Sheer, the former head of the F.B.I. office in New York, and a close associate of Mr. Giuliani when he was United States Attorney. Mr. Sheer, who is a senior executive with W. R. Grace & Company in Florida, was said by associates to be in New York yesterday, though it was not clear if he had met with Mr. Giuliani or his aides.
But a senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani, who insisted on anonymity, said the front-runner for the job remained Mr. Bratton, the Commissioner in Boston. He said of the continuing search, "I think it's a question of satisfying curiosity."

HEADLINE: New York Seeks A Bigger Share In Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
In a move that could significantly complicate President Clinton's effort to overhaul the nation's health care system, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and New York's Congressional delegation are insisting that the plan be changed to give more Medicaid money to states like New York.
While generally praising the President's proposal, Governor Cuomo complained that it would preserve a formula for distributing Medicaid money that penalizes states with large numbers of poor people and generous benefits. 
 Medicaid finances health care for 33 million low-income people, including 2.9 million in New York State.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said he, too, wanted to revise the Medicaid formula, and he is in a position to do so. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, he will have a big role in shaping health care legislation.
Medicaid and the formula for distributing Medicaid money are explosive political issues. States complain that Medicaid imposes crushing fiscal burdens and severely limits their ability to pay for education and other services. But changes that would help New York would hurt other states, so there is no simple solution.
The debate over Medicaid illustrates the political complexity of changing the health care system. Already there are fights over many elements of the Clinton proposal, like cost controls and new taxes. The dispute over Medicaid suggests that the transition to a new system will be extremely difficult because state and local officials and members of Congress will try to redress grievances that seem peripheral to the Clinton plan.
Mr. Clinton's proposal tries to sidestep the debate over the Medicaid formula for several years while an advisory commission studies the question. But Mr. Cuomo said in an interview that the Medicaid formula was an urgent concern that must be considered in any health care bill.
Medicaid is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the states. The current formula for distributing money is based solely on a state's per capita income and does not take account of the number of poor people, local labor costs or residents' medical needs. A state's share of its Medicaid bill rises with its per capita income.
New York officials say the formula puts their state at a disadvantage because New York has high per capita income, large numbers of poor people and disproportionate numbers of people with AIDS and tuberculosis, diseases that are expensive to treat.
 
Institutionalized Inequity
 Governor Cuomo said there had been no hope of getting improvements in the Medicaid formula in the last 12 years because the Reagan and Bush Administrations had tried to cut Federal aid to states. "Now Governor Clinton has become President Clinton, and he says he wants a historic reform of the health care system," Mr. Cuomo added. "But if it institutionalizes this inequity in a system of universal coverage, he would be contradicting himself."
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Mayor-elect of New York City, said he fully supported the efforts of Governor Cuomo and Senator Moynihan, who are finding allies in other Northeastern states and other parts of the country.
John P. Hart, a White House official in charge of relations with state and local governments, acknowledged that there were inequities in the current Medicaid formula. "We have a health care system that needs to be fixed, but you can't solve all the problems in one fell swoop," Mr. Hart said.
He noted that the President had proposed that a Federal commission recommend steps to eliminate regional variations in health spending by the year 2002 and that Congress would vote on the recommendations.
Under the Clinton plan, low-income people as well as more affluent people would get medical insurance through large purchasing pools, or health alliances. But for health benefits guaranteed in the Clinton plan, states would have to continue spending at current levels, increased to reflect inflation.
In the interview, Mr. Cuomo criticized that aspect of the plan. "We certainly don't accept the provisions as to Medicaid, which would perpetuate intolerable and historic inequity against our state," he said.
Federal spending on Medicaid more than doubled in the last five years, to $75.8 billion in the fiscal year 1993, which ended Sept. 30, from $30.5 billion in 1988. Spending by the states rose at about the same rate, to $56 billion this year from $23.7 billion in 1988.
Under the Medicaid formula, the Federal Government pays a larger share of Medicaid costs for states with low per capita income: 79 percent in Mississippi and 74 percent in Arkansas, for example. But the Government pays 50 percent of Medicaid costs in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Illinois, Massachusetts and six other states.
In 1991, the last year for which data are available, Mississippi spent an average of $1,607 for each Medicaid recipient, while New York spent $5,577. New Jersey spent an average of $4,437, and Connecticut spent $5,994, more than any other state.
"We have needs that are unique," Mr. Cuomo said. "We are not embarrassed to stand before the people of the United States and say we have been very careful with Medicaid dollars."
Since 1983, the Government's chief auditor, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, has been saying that the Medicaid formula is inequitable because it does not adequately recognize a state's needs or its fiscal capacity.
Lawrence O'Donnell Jr., staff director of the Senate Finance Committee, said Senator Moynihan "shares Governor Cuomo's concern" about Medicaid.
 
Support in Other States
 White House officials said they were distressed last week when they read a column by Governor Cuomo in The Daily News under the headline, "Prez' Health Plan Bodes Ill for New York." The officials said Mr. Cuomo should have quietly negotiated with the Administration, rather than expressing his concerns publicly.
New York's campaign to revise the Medicaid formula has found support in states as diverse as Michigan, whose Medicaid director, Vernon K. Smith, said: "The formula seems to disadvantage states that happen to be in the upper Midwest and Northeast."
Senator Moynihan said New Deal programs in the 1930's and Medicaid in the 1960's shifted money to the South and the West, in part because Southerners were in charge of Congressional committees that supervised these programs.
Lyndon B. Johnson was President when Medicaid was created in 1965. Joseph A. Califano Jr., a White House aide at the time, says Johnson wooed Representative Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas, then chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, by telling him that Medicaid "would get funds to 'poor mamas and babies' in rural and Southern states, and limit the share going to big industrial states."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From President's Speech on AIDS Research Efforts

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's remarks at Georgetown Medical Center today concerning the Administration's efforts on AIDS research, as transcribed by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service:
Today, I think just about every American who's ever been touched by AIDS will think of people they know who have died or who have suffered family loss. I don't know if it was by accident or design, but I want to thank whoever put this part of the quilt up here with a picture of my good friend Dan Bradley, who for many years was the national leader of the Legal Services Corporation. 
 I have a friend who lost her mother and another friend who lost his wife to AIDS because of tainted blood transfusions, and many others.
But I want to say a special word of appreciation today for the people who are infected with H.I.V. and the people who are living with AIDS who are committed to living, to those who work in the White House and those who work in the Administration and those who around the country have given support to me and helped me to give some support to them. Some of them are here today, and I thank them for the power of their example and for their commitment to life.
In a funny way, this whole disease is bringing out the best and the worst in America, isn't it? I mean, it's exposing some of our prejudice in ways that are self-defeating, since every family and every child is now at risk. And yet it's also showing us the courage, the self-determination, the incredible capacity of the American people to give and to love.
We see our legendary refusal to adopt organized and disciplined solutions to big social problems, and yet we also see, as I will document in a moment, a remarkable willingness on the part of people who can make a difference to try to do more.

 	 	 		. . .	 	For nearly every American with eyes and ears open, the face of AIDS is no longer the face of a stranger. Millions and millions of us have now stood at the bedside of a dying friend and grieved. Millions and millions of us now know people who have had AIDS and who have died of it who are both gay and heterosexual -- both. Millions and millions of us are now forced to admit that this is a problem which has diminished the life of every American.

 	 	 		. . .	 	On Sunday, the cover story in The New York Times Sunday magazine was written by a journalist name Jeffrey Schmalz, who lived and, just a couple of weeks ago, died with AIDS.
He was a remarkable man who interviewed me in a very piercing way last year when I was running for President. I was impressed then with the totally frank, almost brutal, and unsentimental nature of the interview in which we engaged, and with the quality of his mind and spirit and the precision of his questions.
If you saw the article or you heard about it, you know that basically what the article said was AIDS is sort of receding in the public consciousness as a thing to be passionate about; that it was true not only in our Administration but in the community at large and even in the gay community. That was the theory of the article.
And I think he was saying that people were just frustrated dealing with what they considered to be a perpetually uphill battle. Not that it was politically unacceptable any more to talk about AIDS or deal with it, but that there just seemed to be no payoff. And so, he said -- he challenged us all with these words in the article: "I am dying. Why doesn't someone help us?"
I have to say to you that I think that is a good question and a good challenge. I do believe that all of us, each in our own way, sometimes just want to go on to other things. Even some of my friends who are infected just want to go on to other things; maybe especially them. They just get sick of talking about it and thinking about it and focusing on it. The purpose of this day is to remind us that our attitudes, behavior and passion should be revved up in the other 364 days of the year.
HECKLER: If you're so concerned about AIDS, where's the Manhattan Project on AIDS that you promised during your campaign? One year, lots of talk, no action! Thirty recommendations of the National Commission on AIDS go sitting on a shelf gathering dust in your White House, Bill, while me and my community are dying in ever-increasing numbers, and all you do is talk! Talk is cheap, and we need action! You're hiding behind the quilts! You are doing nothing! Look at your record, Bill! One year, no results. The Manhattan Project on AIDS that you promised during the campaign, where is it? Thirty recommendations of George Bush's Commission on AIDS . . . . Where are they? One year! Slick Willy! The Republicans were right! We should have never trusted you.

 	 	 		. . .	 	PRESIDENT CLINTON: Look, last night -- let me change the subject a minute, and get back to that. Last night I went to see "Schindler's List." We had a special showing of it for the Holocaust Museum, and it's not going to be a highly advertised movie and it's coming out around Christmas time, and it will be tough for people to see then. I implore every one of you to go see it. It is an astonishing thing. "Schindler's List." It's about a non-Jew who as a member of the Nazi Party saved over 1,000 Jews by his personal efforts in World War II from the Holocaust.
The reason I say that is this: Part of my job is to be a lightning rod. Part of my job is to lift the hopes and aspirations of the American people, knowing that as long as you're trying to lift hopes and lift aspirations you can never fully close the gap between what you're reaching for and what you're actually doing, and knowing for sure that there's no way I can now keep everybody alive who already has AIDS.
So the fact that he's in here expressing his frustration to me means at least that they expect me to do something, which is a step forward.
And I don't take it personally.
The reason I ask you to go see the movie is you will see portrait after portrait after portrait of the painful difference between people who have no hope and have no rage left and people who still have hope and still have rage. I'd rather that man be in here screaming at me than having given up altogether, much rather.
So let me go forward and tell you what we are trying to do, and let me then invite you to tell me what else we should do, because that's really what I came here to do today -- to say here's what we have done in a year, and to invite you to tell me what else we should do. . . .
I have directed every Federal office to provide its employees with education about AIDS prevention. We asked the three million Federal employees to take the information home to their families and to their communities. I have challenged every business to take similar action, but not every business, and certainly not every school is doing it. We can deny the reality that every family is at risk until we know someone who is, but we do so at great peril to ourselves.
We've increased the research funding for AIDS by over 20 percent, and we increased funding in the Ryan White Health Care Act for care by 66 percent. And I want to remind you that this was at a time when overall domestic spending was held absolutely flat, and when over 350 items in the Federal budget this year are smaller than they were last year. Where there was an absolute cut, we got substantial increases.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I have to tell you that one of the things that I underestimated when I became President was the actual power of the words coming from the bully pulpit of the White House to move the country. I overestimated my capacity get things done in a hurry in the Congress -- but I -- when I read the other day in The Los Angeles Times that I had the best record of any President in 40 years, I said, "Pity the others."
I'm an impatient person. I'm a victim of my own impatience. But I do think sometimes all of us underestimate the power of our words to change the attitudes and the range of behavior of other people. Not just me, but you, too. And it is clear to me that no matter how much we put into research, no matter how much we put into treatment, no matter how much we put into education, someone besides the politicians will do the research, the treatment, and the education. And it has to be a daily thing.
The next thing I'd like to say is I think the best thing we can do for people who are living with H.I.V. and living with AIDS is to pass a comprehensive health care plan so that people do not lose their benefits.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Finally, let me just say that there is a lot of talk always, and I have been part of this, talking about how each of us has to take personal responsibility for our own conduct. And I believe that. But if you want children to do that, they have to be educated as to the consequences of their conduct, which means someone else has to do it. And it is also true that, since literally every American can be affected in some way by this, all the rest of us have personal responsibilities, too.
And so again I say to you I think we have done a good job in the first year of this Administration if you measure "good job" in terms of organizing ourselves properly, funding the effort more adequately, identifying some of the major problems in the bureaucracy and going after them.
But Jeffrey Schmalz, in his last article, issued a rebuke to me. He said, "You cannot let this slide as an issue until it is over." And he was right. But he also issued a rebuke to everyone else in the country -- everyone else. This is an issue, if you just look at the sheer numbers, if you look at what is happening in some African countries, if you look at what is happening in other nations around the world, if you had no other concern in your own country but the cold-blooded one of how your own country was going to pay for its collective health care needs and deal with its economic crises, if that was your only concern, if you never had a heartbeat of compassion, you would have to be nearly obsessed with this problem.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Helps Raise Funds, But for Him? No Word Yet

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last night kicked off the 1994 version of New York's most enduring political parlor game -- "Will He Run?" -- by raising an estimated $700,000 for a campaign he has yet to say he will wage.
Mr. Cuomo, who has said he will announce by the end of the year whether he will run for a fourth four-year term, did not disclose his intentions at a $1,000-a-person fund-raising dinner for the state Democratic Committee at a Manhattan hotel. 
 But the Governor seemed to go out of his way to leave the impression that he will be a candidate.
In concluding a speech that presented his vision of a rigorous economic recovery for the state, he said: "I tell you, it's enough to make you want to be around in this wonderful place for a long time to come.
"Someone asked me tonight if I ever get tired, especially after the last few tough years. The only thing I'm tired of, frankly, is the naysaying, the divisiveness, the negativism. I want to be as good as my father was. I want to accomplish what they did in their time. I want to see this place stronger than it has ever been."
 
Mood at the Dinner
 To stimulate the economy, Mr. Cuomo said he would propose next year to cut taxes and fees, including the hotel tax, and remove regulations on businesses.
And yet, the mood at last night's dinner provided a glimpse of the challenge that might face Mr. Cuomo if he runs. Although the ballroom at The Sheraton New York Hotel was filled with Cuomo partisans, the Governor received only soft applause for a speech that some characterized as flat and predictable.
Awaiting Mr. Cuomo's decision are a half-dozen prominent Democrats -- some of whom worked the crowd last night -- who say they might run for his job if he does not, and more than a dozen Republicans who sense that New York voters have grown restless with both the style and the substance of Mr. Cuomo's leadership.
The Republican field of potential candidates seems to expand every week. On Tuesday, Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island said that she would spend coming weeks considering the race.
 
A Heavy Gamble
 A telegenic woman who favors abortion rights, Ms. Molinari quickly became a rising star in her party after arriving in Washington in 1990. But she would have to abandon her Congressional seat to run, a heavy gamble for a promising politician.
As when Mr. Cuomo considered running for President in 1988 and 1992, and when he discussed the possibility of joining the United States Supreme Court this year, the Governor has kept his own counsel about his decision. But this time, unlike those occasions, he has largely avoided discussing his reasoning in public.
Mr. Cuomo's silence has given rise to a new round of cryptography in Albany, with lawmakers and Cuomo staff members trying to decipher the Governor's every move, including his house-hunting trips to Queens and his decision to devote his fund-raising energies to the state party instead of his own campaign account.
But those closest to Mr. Cuomo say they believe he will run, and his top aides and political advisers are operating on that assumption.
 
Fresh Ideas Sought
 They have gauged Mr. Cuomo's political strengths and weaknesses with polls and focus groups, have held internal discussions about how best to run in 1994, and have started to consult with professionals who might be hired as strategists.
It is a measure of Mr. Cuomo's perceived vulnerability that his aides have decided they would benefit from fresh ideas and dispassionate advice from outsiders. They have made plans to interview a number of highly regarded media consultants, including David Axelrod of Chicago, Robert Squier of Washington, and Hank Morris of New York City, and are likely to add other names to the list before making a choice, according to one Cuomo adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The 1986 and 1990 re-election campaigns were largely insular affairs, run by gubernatorial aides, family members and longtime political supporters, and that flavor would almost certainly linger if he runs in 1994.
For example, Mr. Cuomo's 29-year-old daughter, Madeline, has taken a leave of absence from her law firm, Shea & Gould, to help coordinate the state Democratic committee's end-of-the-year fund raising. She would be expected to play a prominent role in a Cuomo campaign, following in the footsteps of her older brother, Andrew, who managed Mr. Cuomo's first gubernatorial victory in 1982.
Last night's fund-raising dinner is one of three that are expected to produce a total of $1 million for the state committee. The first was held in Buffalo last month and the last will be in Syracuse on Dec. 6.
Because the money will flow to the state committee, it can be used for generic "get out the vote" efforts that would benefit the entire Democratic ticket next year. Mr. Cuomo has about $3 million in his personal campaign account, which can be used for television advertising and other direct campaign spending in his behalf.

HEADLINE: U.S. Raises Pressure for Trade Accord

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Amid optimism that a new world trade agreement may at last be near, France and the United States engaged in a contest of diplomatic posturing today intended to nudge each other into making important concessions.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher called on officials of the European Community here to elevate the 116-nation talks to the political level, warning that failure to reach agreement in the next two weeks would mean economic disaster for Europe and other areas of the world. 
 Mr. Christopher arrived at European Community headquarters as top trade officials from the community and the United States tried again to reach agreement on some of the sensitive issues that have aligned the French against the Americans and also against some of Paris's usual European partners, creating one of the big obstacles to agreement.
The hope here is that if the differences can be smoothed over by the end of this week, a bargain struck between the United States and the European Community could pave the way for a successful conclusion of the broad negotiations being held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by a Dec. 15 deadline.
But in Paris, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur seemed to edge back from conciliatory published remarks that had evoked praise in Washington. Mr. Balladur said in a speech to the French National Assembly today that progress still had to be made on four important areas of the proposed trade agreement, including satisfying France's concerns about new limits on farm subsidies.
At the same time, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's trade commissioner, tried to address the sticking points in the long negotiations. The talks here will continue through lunchtime Thursday; still, senior State Department officials said they could not predict whether the United States and the 12-nation European Community would be able to produce something acceptable to the French.
Mr. Kantor, before leaving Washington on Tuesday, said the United States might make unspecified concessions to bring the seven-year trade talks to a successful end. And before leaving Washington for Brussels today, Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy said that a slower introduction of lower new farm subsidies was "something obviously we've got to look at."
Mr. Christopher, by sitting in on the Brussels talks today and detailing the stakes at a news conference, sought to strike a balance between toughness and conciliation, hoping to make it easier for each side to give a little.
 
Catalogue of Benefits
 Calling the stakes "absolutely immense," the Secretary of State said an agreement would spur economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic, increase business confidence, expand the world economy and create jobs.
"Failure will threaten economic recession in Europe, the United States and indeed the world as a whole," added Mr. Christopher, who, like President Clinton, repeatedly calls economic security a cornerstone of American foreign policy.
He appealed for trade-offs, acknowledging that "none will be easy," and adding that all the countries involved had a "responsibility to meet flexibility with flexibility." He praised Mr. Balladur's remarks reported in The Washington Post on Tuesday, in which the Prime Minister said that France was willing to relax its hard stance in dealing with the United States.
As part of what seemed like an intensifying American public relations campaign for a GATT accord, Mr. Christopher also gave two television interviews later that an aide said had been scripted with Mr. Kantor "to send the message to Europe."
But Prime Minister Balladur, responding to former leaders from his center-right coalition parties who had urged him to show political courage and strike a trade deal, told the French legislators that it would be false courage to accept a bad deal in fear of being isolated.
He listed four broad areas remaining in dispute: France's call for a new body to supervise world trade; its demand for specific rules to protect its audio-visual industry; the disagreement over market access, and the differences over textiles, steel, financial services and agriculture.
"We have recorded no progress on these four points," Mr. Balladur said. "We are resolutely determined, in liaison with our German partners and all our other European partners, to obtain satisfaction on all the points I listed, which will make it possible to safeguard the long-term interests of our country. If we obtain them, we can give our accord. If we don't obtain them, then of course we can't."
 
Germany Attempts Mediation
 The Prime Minister made his remarks after returning with President Francois Mitterrand from Bonn, where Chancellor Helmut Kohl had tried and failed to broker an agreement between France and the United States over the French opposition to cutting subsidies for farm exports.
Senior Clinton Administration officials sought to explain away Mr. Balladur's remarks, calling them necessary gestures to the French public and arguing that Mr. Mitterrand sounded more positive.
"We must keep on always making a real effort to reach a compromise that will allow the signing of an international accord," Mr. Mitterrand said at a news conference with Mr. Kohl after their two days of talks. "We are ready to make these efforts."
However, no country should be left feeling it was being treated unjustly, he said, adding, "France sometimes has this feeling, as we have explained to our German friends."
And Mr. Kohl said, "We should not create the impression in Europe or elsewhere that our French friends are being maneuvered into a corner in these negotiations."
Part of the American strategy to gain an agreement is to insist that Dec. 15 is a date that cannot be missed. "There will be no Dec. 16," Mr. Christopher says.
However, even though the Dec. 15 deadline is also being pressed hard by GATT's Director General, Peter Sutherland, there is nothing magic about it. The global free trade talks have sputtered along for most of the seven years since they were begun in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986. Congress compressed the negotiating time this year when it gave Mr. Clinton the Dec. 15 date by which either to conclude the agreement or lose his special powers to conduct expedited negotiations.

SEAGRAM CO. (N)

 BODY:
Orange juice was the one bright spot for the Seagram Company in the third quarter.
With several European economies in the doldrums, sales of the company's wines and spirits were flat. And a huge restructuring charge at Du Pont forced Seagram's, which owns 24.3 percent of the company, to take a $239 million charge on its third-quarter books. Seagram's, based in Montral, also lost $85 million in revenues earned abroad because of currency conversions. 
 The company said yesterday that those factors produced a loss of $100 million in the third quarter, although it had operating income of $197 million.
An increase of 14 percent in sales of Tropicana products was the "one bright spot," according to Brian T. Lomas, a consumer products analyst at Scotia McLeod in Montreal, who said the company was doing a good job of introducing Tropicana Twister fruit drinks in several countries.
He warned that there might be one more piece of bad news ahead. With oil prices falling, investors who were counting on Du Pont to quickly turn around as the American economy improved might have to be patient because of Du Pont's ownership of Conoco, the petroleum company.

A.T.& T. Likely to Cut Several Thousand Jobs

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS

 BODY:
A.T.& T., struggling to maintain its profit margins in the long-distance calling business, is drawing up a two-pronged attack that could eliminate several thousand jobs.
The cuts contemplated are in the company's consumer-communications services division, which currently employs 32,000 people, about a tenth of A.T.& T.'s payroll. 
 Company executives said yesterday that the job reductions would range across the division, involving blue- and white-collar jobs and union and nonunion workers.
They also said details of the cuts, including their number, would not be decided for at least a month. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company would cut 4,500 consumer communications jobs.
A.T.& T.'s stock closed yesterday at $54.25, down 37.5 cents, with 2.9 million shares traded.
 
Efficiencies Sought
 "We can clearly find more efficient ways of doing things," Alex J. Mandl, executive vice president of A.T.& T. and chief executive of its communications services group, said yesterday in a telephone interview from Seattle. "We have some opportunities to manage more efficiently, to use technology better, to eliminate functions not necessary in today's environment, to thin the layers of management."
But he added: "Staff reductions don't solve our cost problems. We have to go after them in many ways."
Mr. Mandl said access charges paid to local telephone companies cost A.T.& T. $14 billion a year, and purchasing costs an additional $17 billion. Both areas, he said, need a hard look. A.T.& T. is talking to both Federal regulators and the local companies about cutting the access charges, he said.
Tim Cain, an analyst with Fitch Investor Services, said he expected the Federal Communications Commission to provide relief from the charges, which he said were more significant to A.T.& T.'s costs than the size of the company's work force.
Lower costs aside, Mr. Mandl said, he was determined to find a way to push up revenues. "We want to grow our earnings at least 10 percent, both for the parent company and for our group," he said.
 
Industry Growth Tops 5%
 Revenue growth in long-distance calling is expected to be 5 percent to 6 percent a year for the industry as a whole, but the MCI Communications Corporation is enjoying growth at three times that rate.
Next month or in February, he said, A.T.& T. will announce a new marketing strategy and discount plans to replace its "i plan," which it has ended. That plan -- the "i" stands for individual -- involved discounts and incentives that A.T.& T. tailored to customers' calling patterns. But in competition with MCI's "Friends and Family" discount plan and Sprint's "the Most," the i plan came up short.
Mr. Mandl would say only, "It was not as robust, as strong as we wanted to be."
Mr. Cain of Fitch said, "It just didn't resonate with customers," because compared with the competitors' it was harder at a glance to see what discounts were being offered.
 
Little Leeway for Price Rises
 Because of pressure from MCI and Sprint, A.T.& T. has little leeway to raise prices, although Mr. Cain suggested that some selective increases in international and operator-assisted calls might be possible.
Mark Siegel, an A.T.& T. spokesman, noted that the company had recently announced increases in operator-handled and calling card calls, directory assistance and some overseas calls that are expected to produce $336 million a year.
In effect, the division is a cash cow that provides some cover for more competitive operations like personal computers, manufacturing of equipment and credit cards.
A.T.& T. previously announced plans to cut 7,500 jobs at its NCR Corporation, which makes computers, and to cut its force of 18,000 operators and supervisors about a third in the next few years.

HEADLINE: Where the Jobs Are: At the Top

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
While many Americans believe that most new jobs are going to hamburger flippers and Wal-Mart clerks, the reality is surprisingly different: more than three-fifths of the new jobs created over the last year have gone to managers and professionals.
As thousands of former middle managers at I.B.M., General Motors and other corporate giants can attest, white-collar workers were hit especially hard in the recent recession. But Government statistics now show a steady climb in the hiring of white-collar workers. 
 Even though managers and professionals like physicians and accountants make up only 27 percent of the American work force, they have landed more than 60 percent of the 2.2 million net new jobs created over the last year. At the same time, the hiring of blue-collar employees has been largely stagnant.
 
Pent-Up Demand for Managers
 The way economists and corporate executives put it, so many companies squeezed out so many managers during the recent slump that as the economy -- and corporate America -- expanded over the last year, the demand for managers rebounded.
"Because of the recession, there was pent-up demand for managers," said Patrick Pittard, managing partner of Heidrick & Struggles, one of the nation's largest executive search firms. "Many companies that did without executives for a year or two couldn't stand it any more. They had to fill that slot they left unfilled for so long."
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said this pickup in white-collar hiring pointed to profound economic changes that bode ill for unskilled workers, because such a high percentage of new jobs require college degrees, M.B.A.'s or other sophisticated training.
"The recent recession had unusually high levels of unemployment for white-collar workers," Mr. Reich said. "But white-collar jobs are coming back. Long-term demand is shifting in favor of people with greater skills."
 
Wachovia, a Case Study
 Typical of this trend is what is happening at the Wachovia Corporation, a bank-holding company in Winston-Salem, N.C. It has hired 250 management trainees over the last year and plans to hire another 250 next year, even as it lays off some tellers and data processing personnel whose work has been automated.
Kenneth Torreyson, Wachovia's director of human resources, said many trainees were being hired to work on mutual funds and information systems. He said his company was adding these trainees because "it looks like a few years out things will get a lot better."
He added, "In the last part of the decade and the first 10 years of the new century, this country should be doing pretty well."
Even though white-collar hiring is one of the few bright spots in the employment picture, it is not chugging along as fast as in previous recoveries. For example, in the 31 months since the 1990-91 recession ended, the number of white-collar jobs -- including not just professionals and managers but also some sales, technical and administrative people -- has grown by 3.8 percent. In contrast, white-collar employment jumped by 8 percent in the 31 months after the 1982 recession.
 
Blue-Collar Blues
 Blue-collar employment presents a more dismal picture, up just three-tenths of 1 percent since the recession ended, far lower than the 9.2 percent jump in blue-collar employment in the 31 months after the 1982 recession.
"I take issue with the notion that white-collar workers are an advantaged class of Americans who are enjoying open-ended prosperity in the 90's," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist with Morgan Stanley & Company. "In an absolute sense, white-collar workers are doing better than blue-collar workers. But compared to past recoveries, the white-collar job machine is in a different gear."
The unemployment rate for white-collar workers is 4.2 percent, while for blue-collar workers, it is just under 9 percent. Even so, white-collar unemployment jumped by 70 percent during the recent recession, an unusual development. In contrast, in several postwar recessions white-collar unemployment did not rise.
"The typical recession is very much blue-collar oriented," said Lawrence H. Katz, the Labor Department's chief economist. "This one was much more egalitarian. Both white collars and blue collars got hit." The overall jobless rate is 6.8 percent, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics will issue its November employment report on Friday.
 
Professional Prosperity
 Over the last year, one of the biggest jumps in employment has been the 400,000 leap, to 11.9 million, in the number of professionals at professional service industries, including lawyers, accountants, architects, registered nurses and engineers.
This jump was evident at Arthur Andersen & Company, the Chicago-based accounting and consulting firm. In the last year, it has expanded its work force by 2,000, to 29,000 workers; most of the newly hired have degrees in accounting, computer science, engineering or mathematics.
"We hire people according to what we think our workload will be," said Dennis Reigle, managing director for recruiting at Arthur Andersen. "The work is there right now."
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there has been a 150,000 jump, to 2.1 million, in the number of managers in finance, insurance and real estate over the last year. The number of managers in construction has jumped by 100,000, to just short of a million. And in manufacturing, the number of management jobs is up 110,000, to 2.4 million.
As a result, managers accounted for a greatly disproportionate share of new jobs -- they represent 13 percent of all employed Americans, but got 37 percent of the net new jobs over the last year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Widens

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Record imports fueled by an improving American economy combined with stagnant markets overseas to push the United States merchandise trade deficit to a six-year high in the third quarter.
The Commerce Department said today that the gap swelled by 5.5 percent, to $36.3 billion, from $34.4 billion in the April-June quarter. It was the largest imbalance since the deficit totaled $39.6 billion in the final three months of 1987. 
 Analysts said Americans had more purchasing power now that the United States economy was improving modestly. But analysts noted the economies of many leading United States trading partners were stagnant -- if not in recession. That inhibits foreign buying of American-made goods.
As a result, imports rose five-tenths of 1 percent, to a record $148.2 billion, in the third quarter, up from $147.5 billion in the previous three months. Exports, however, dropped 1.1 percent, to $111.9 billion from $113.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Stocks Surge in Week's Best Performance

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks advanced broadly yesterday, gaining momentum from a firm bond market and rallies on the Tokyo and London exchanges.
In its best performance this week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.13 points, to 3,697.08, trading above 3,700 for most of the session before fizzling at the close. High-technology stocks and issues sensitive to the economic recovery gained in a rally that also embraced retail, banking and airline shares. 
Gains in Tokyo and London before trading opened in New York set the tone. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index gained 4.38 percent, and in London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 index was up 2.09 percent.
But Patrick J. Moriarity, the chief investment officer for Bank Julius Baer, New York, was cautious about the overseas gains, especially those in Tokyo.
"The Japanese rally was a short-term reversal and will not be there in the immediate term because the Government is concentrating on political reform and not economic reform," he said.
 
Disney Makes Gain
 Gene J. Seagle, the director of technical research for Gruntal & Company, said he was not surprised by the market yesterday. "The best five months of the year historically starts in November," he said. "I think we may test the 3,800 range by year's end."
Shares of Walt Disney, which rose 7/8, to 40 3/4, in active trading, accounted for about 17 percent of the advance of the Dow. Traders said the gain was tied to a strong performance in Paris by shares of Euro Disney. Traders said European news reports that the entertainment company planned to inject $500 million into its financially troubled affiliate had helped Euro Disney.
The Nasdaq composite, spurred by a push in high-technology issues, rose 9.42 points, to 763.81. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 293.9 million shares, up from 290.3 million on Tuesday. Gainers outnumbering losers by 1,315 to 804.
Economic data released yesterday were mixed, with an upward revision in third-quarter gross domestic product that was weaker than expected, offset by gains in the purchasing managers' index for November and construction spending in October. The initial reaction in the bond market was muted, but prices closed higher and interest rates fell.
 
Auto Stocks Rise
 Shares of General Motors rose 1/2, to 53 1/4, as the auto maker announced that it would discontinue its 10-day sales reports to cut costs. The market expects Ford to follow; Chrysler discontinued the practice two years ago. Chrysler rose 1 1/4, to 54, and Ford rose 1 7/8, to 62 5/8.
High-technology issues were led by Intel, which rose 1 1/4, to 62 3/4. The company, with Viacom and General Instrument, will develop technologies to allow personal computers to access information services over cable television lines. Microsoft, rose 1 1/2, to 81 1/2; Hewlett-Packard gained 3/4, to 74 1/2, and Compaq Computer gained 3/4, to 73 1/8.
Some retail issues moved higher in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Sears, Roebuck & Company gained 5/8, to 55, and Woolworth added 5/8, to 23 3/4.
Snapple rose 2 3/8, to 23 3/8, after Paine Webber gave the beverage company a "buy" recommendation from "attractive."
The resumption of discussions between United Airlines and union representatives about a possible employee buyout moved the stock of UAL, the airline's parent, up 2 1/2, to 151.

G.M. to Stop 10-Day Sales Reports, Ending a Detroit Rite

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 1

 BODY:
For decades, the General Motors Corporation and other auto makers have reported vehicle sales every 10 days, prompting journalists and Wall Street to scrutinize the numbers to determine which company is up and which company is down, and what that may mean for the economy.
No longer. General Motors announced today that it would report sales only at the end of each month, in part to streamline its operations. The sales reports would begin in the new year. The Ford Motor Company said today that it would likely follow G.M.'s example. 
 Most professional analysts sighed with relief that one of the Motor City's most arcane, grueling and, most of all, dubious insider rituals was at last being laid to rest.
"About time," said Ronald A. Glantz, an auto analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco. "I'm overjoyed."
Analysts who track the sales reports said they were often unreliable in drawing trends, because of seasonal fluctuations, incomplete reporting by dealers and other factors.
 
 
Chrysler Stopped in '91
 For reasons similar to G.M.'s, the Chrysler Corporation stopped reporting sales every 10 days in January 1991. Since then, journalists and analysts have relied on estimates of Chrysler's sales that are often skewed.
Further muddying the 10-day reports, many importers also issue their sales figure only monthly, and few news reports estimate their 10-day results.
Ford said today that it would probably eliminate the sales reports because 10-day reports were not very useful, even as a management tool.
"It's part of the culture in this part of the world to go crazy every 10 days trying to figure out what's happening," said Alexander J. Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, in a meeting with reporters today.
But, he said, "My main interest in looking at the 10-day scores is to wonder what you guys are going to say about the 10-day scores and figure out how I'm going to respond to your analysis of random variation."
While Mr. Trotman said he received daily sales reports, he said he intended to stop looking at those soon.
 
 
Flawed Data Better Than None
 Not everyone was pleased by the news. "I'd rather have a somewhat inaccurate number than no number at all," said David A. Wyss, research director for DRI/McGraw-Hill. "I found them a useful gauge, particularly of consumer confidence, because people don't buy cars unless they're feeling pretty good about themselves."
In a statement, General Motors said, "A monthly report more accurately reflects sales trends within the U.S. marketplace and is less subject to the impact of localized conditions." The company also said it would save money by reporting only monthly, although it did not disclose how much.
While General Motors reported 10-day sales off and on in the 1950's, it did not begin doing so regularly until January 1966, said John Maciarz, a company spokesman.
Internally, it began gathering sales reports from dealers every 10 days in 1924. Alfred P. Sloan, the auto maker's visionary chairman, insisted on the practice after poor inventory accounting led to huge overproduction. Before the new system, inventory controls were so weak that Mr. Sloan discovered the production problem only by visiting dealers.
"It is not often that the chief executive of a large corporation himself discovers visible overproduction by a physical check of the inventory," Mr. Sloan wrote in his memoir, "My Years with General Motors." "But automobiles are big units easy to count."
Several factors make the 10-day reports misleading, analysts said. For example, they said, news reports often omit important factors like storms or strikes that depressed sales during the comparable period a year previous. As a result, a sales increase in the current year may seem enormous.

Money managers aren't rushing in yet for bargains in Japan.

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin

 BODY:
EVEN though Japanese stocks have taken a severe beating over the last month or so, few international portfolio managers say they are ready to start buying suddenly cheaper Japanese equities. "Wait and see" may be the best strategy for now, managers say.
They contend that share values have farther to fall in Japan. Perhaps more importantly, prospects in other markets, such as Europe, are more compelling. The managers can afford to be sanguine because, despite the recent plummet, most Japan funds are ahead for the year. 
 Still, in a market as broad and diverse as Japan's, some portfolio managers noted the price decline might yield opportunities in certain sectors.
William F. Wendler, a vice president at Rowe Price-Fleming in Baltimore, said, "The market is now settling in at levels where we will begin looking again." Rowe Price-Fleming manages around $12 billion in international mutual funds.
Some of Japan's big exporting companies, names like Sony and Matsushita, are beginning to look attractive, according to Mr. Wendler. So are companies tied in to the changing structure of Japanese society, companies like Sumitomo Forestry, a manufacturer of prefabricated houses, and Aoyama Trading, a discount retailer of men's suits.
But most managers are not even in the "just looking" stage of stock assessment.
"I don't think portfolio managers should be doing anything," said Barton M. Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management in New York. "At some point they should be thinking about buying, perhaps when the Nikkei index is around 14,000."
Such a level implies a fall of more than 20 percent in the world's second-largest stock market. Since the Nikkei index is currently at around 17,100, Mr. Biggs clearly thinks prices have not touched bottom. But the 14,000 level was seen only a year ago, and when it sank that far, only then did portfolio managers start to notice.
"Back in August 1992, the market was spiking down toward 14,000 on the Nikkei index, and there were some pretty positive attitudes in Japan," said John R. Hickling, who manages a Japan fund at Fidelity Investments.
Through yesterday, the seven Japan mutual funds followed by Lipper Analytical Securities were up an average of 22.9 percent since the start of the year.
Japanese stock prices have been -- and still are, in the eyes of many -- overpriced, and the economic prospects suspect. In a world of free-flowing capital, there have been more attractive places to invest.
"We have been underweighted in Japan relative to the rest of the world for probably five years," Mr. Biggs said. "The first two weren't much fun, but the last three have been."
Elizabeth Allen, who manages Scudder Stevens & Clark's $500 million Japan fund, said that to protect against the downward spiral seen in the Japanese market recently, the fund had been "fairly conservative" in what it bought.
"A full 10 percent of it is invested in convertible bonds," Ms. Allen said. "We don't have a lot of bank exposure or real estate exposure. We have been out of a lot of the very volatile sectors. I think prices have about bottomed out."
Others have less positive things to say. Concerned about high valuations and possible downward revisions in earnings, Merrill Lynch & Company started pulling its clients out of Japan at the end of August, said Douglas Johnson, a senior international-equity strategist.
"Given the opportunities we see in Europe, we would be more interested in devoting our attention there," he said.

HEADLINE: New Gains Bolstering 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Three upbeat economic reports suggested yesterday that the fourth quarter might turn out to be the strongest of the year, as many economists and executives have been predicting.
A widely followed survey of 300 manufacturers showed that the nation's factories continued to rebound in November. The Government reported that construction spending rose solidly in October. 
 And the Government's second look at third-quarter economic growth revealed a healthy rise in corporate profits and even more robust spending by consumers and business than initially estimated.
"Business is very strong," said Alan Hall, a materials purchasing manager for Playtex Apparel in Winston-Salem, N.C. "We haven't had enough capacity to make product and we've hired a lot of people."
 
Moderation Still Expected
 But while many forecasters think the economy could be growing at a 4 percent rate or better this quarter -- substantially faster than in the summer -- they also expect growth to moderate again in early 1994.
"We do see a slight decline in the new year," Mr. Hall said, "but it's not a deep trench."
The National Association of Purchasing Management, which conducts the monthly survey of industrial companies, said its index rose to 55.7 in November from 53.8 in October, suggesting that the economy was growing at its fastest pace since last winter. A reading over 45 indicates that the economy is expanding, while a reading over 50 suggests that the nation's manufacturers are growing as well.
The industries that have most to gain from low interest rates are among the peppiest: furniture, business equipment and industries like rubber and plastics that supply auto makers. New orders for all manufacturers jumped for the third month running. The backlog of unfilled orders, a key gauge of future production, is higher now than it has been all year.
What is more, inventories continued to shrink as sales kept growing faster than factory output, a sign that production should keep heading higher this month.
"There's a healthy combination of high backlogs and low inventories that means sales all through the supply chain," said Robert Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee. "All that equals likely continuing improvement, which will probably make the fourth quarter the strongest of the year."
 
Caution Is Evident
 Companies in the survey have not started adding jobs yet and, by and large, managers are displaying more caution than they did a year ago.
Back then, retail sales also took off and factories were churning out goods at a fast rate. When bad weather arrived and consumers decided to take a breather, retailers got stuck with piles of inventories, orders dried up and manufacturers spent months retrenching.
This time around, manufacturers say they are basing their plans on some slowing of sales after the current surge.
"We're cautiously optimistic about next year, but we control inventories very tight," said Troy Hoskins, materials manager at Wilson Sporting Goods in Fountain Inn, S.C. "We won't be doing anything different in the future."
Mr. Bretz, who is a purchasing manager at Pitney Bowes, added, "The improvement will carry over into the new year, but not at the same rate as this quarter."
Meanwhile, a report from the Department of Commerce underscored that lower interest rates and improved state and local finances are helping to revive the construction business. Builders of everything from single-family houses to schools to sewers increased spending 2.5 percent in October to a $414 billion annual rate. That followed a gain of 1.5 percent in September, twice as strong as originally reported.
 
Third-Quarter Revisions
 The Commerce Department also took another look at how well the economy performed in the third quarter. Growth was a shade slower than the Government first reported, advancing at a 2.7 percent rate against the original estimate of a 2.8 percent rate. But there was more good news than bad in the revised estimates.
For one thing, spending was stronger. Consumer spending rose at a hefty 4.4 percent rate against 4.2 percent. Business investment in new equipment, especially computers, also turned out to be stronger, rising at a 10 percent annual rate compared with the previously reported 9 percent.
For another, profits continued to perk up. Corporate profits, which finance everything from dividends for shareholders to new business ventures, rose a handy eight-tenths of a percent this summer, after spurting 5.2 percent in the spring.
The most positive portent for the current quarter, economists said, was the leaner look of inventories. Business stocks rose nearly $2 billion less than the Government initially estimated. Leaner inventories usually mean that new orders will translate directly into more production and more income for factory workers.

Dollar Gains on Possibility Germany Will Reduce Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most European currencies in quiet trading yesterday as investors reacted to more upbeat American economic news and the possibility of a German interest rate cut.
Traders said the dollar gained strength against European currencies on hopes that the Bundesbank's Central Bank Council would decide on an interest-rate cut at its meeting today. 
 A rate cut could help revive Germany's flagging economy, but would reduce the return investors would receive from mark-denominated deposits.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.7235 marks, from 1.7150 marks on Tuesday. But despite its strength against European currencies, the dollar slipped to 108.80 Japanese yen from 109.10 yen.
The dollar picked up some support after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported a rise in its monthly index, traders said. The index, which tracks economic growth, registered 55.7 percent last month, up from 53.8 a month earlier.
"The numbers speak for themselves," Angelo Evangelista, a vice president at the Bank of Boston, said.
Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, said some economists had expected the number to be stronger, after Chicago-area purchasing managers reported a jump in their index a day earlier. However, she said, the result fed expectations of improvement in other United States economic figures.
"The dollar itself may be supported by the view that Friday's unemployment report will be supportive," she said.
The dollar also hit a seven-year high against the Italian lira, finishing at 1,719 lire, compared with 1,703 on Tuesday.
The lira has been battered by political turmoil in Italy, where a vast corruption scandal has devastated the parties that have governed since World War II.
Meanwhile, the British pound fell to $1.4780, from $1.4860 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.5010 Swiss francs, up from 1.4980; 5.9460 French francs, up from 5.9230, and $1.3343 (Canadian), down from $1.3357 (Canadian).

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold and Silver Up Sharply On Strong Economic News

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold and silver futures prices rose sharply yesterday in reaction to reports showing stronger economic growth.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery jumped $5, to $374.80 an ounce. December silver rose 22.8 cents, to $4.648 a troy ounce. 
 Yesterday, a widely followed survey of 300 manufacturers showed that the nation's factories continued to rebound in November.
Also, the Government reported that construction spending rose solidly in October. And a second look by the Government at economic growth in the third quarter showed a healthy rise in corporate profits and consumer spending.
Many economists predict that brisk housing and retail sales and rising consumer confidence will produce further improvement during the final three months of the year.
 
Foreign Sales a Factor
 Precious metals futures were also driven up in part because of strong demand from foreign investors, said William O'Neill, senior strategist for Merrill Lynch Futures.
"Today's economic data was significant because it points to what the real focus in gold is going to be as we move into 1994," he said. "The metals are telling us that we're at the bottom of the inflationary cycle and next comes global growth."
On other commodity markets, oil prices continued to stabilize after their sharp fall in the last week in reaction to OPEC's failure to bring oil production under control.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for delivery in January settled 5 cents higher at $15.48 a barrel. January heating oil was 0.60 cent lower at 47.18 cents a gallon. January gasoline was 0.22 cent higher at 42.60 cents a gallon, and January natural gas was 4.5 cents lower at $2.198 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Grain futures prices moved marginally higher while soybeans were narrowly mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade. The markets were helped by Russia's $148 million payment on its United States debt.
"Their credit is still shaky, but at least it's alive," said Victor Lespinasse, assistant vice president at Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
Wheat was helped by news of Egypt's purchase of 599,000 metric tons of wheat from the United States.
Wheat for delivery in December rose 3 cents to settle at $3.51 1/4 a bushel. December corn was 1/4 cent higher at $2.79 3/4 a bushel. December oats rose 1 1/4 cents, to $1.28 3/4 a bushel, and January soybeans were up 1/4 cent at $6.71 3/4 a bushel.

More Cuts Announced By Boeing

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, still hurting from the continued weakness of the global airline industry, said yesterday that it would further cut production of commercial jets, resulting in the loss of 2,000 to 3,000 jobs in 1994.
Boeing said companywide employment levels for 1994 were still being assessed and would be announced early next year. The Seattle company had about 139,000 employees as of October. Earlier this year, Boeing announced plans to eliminate about 20 percent of its work force, or 28,000 jobs, by mid-1994. About 18,000 positions in Washington and Kansas were expected to be cut this year. 
 Boeing shares closed today down 75 cents, to $37.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Move Was Expected
 Analysts said that the cutbacks were expected because of the continuing malaise in the airline industry and that Boeing had hinted for some time it could not maintain 737 and 747 production at current rates. They said that production of Boeing's new 777 jetliner, scheduled to begin next year, could help offset the cuts but that revenues would likely be flat in 1994 and 1995.
"While there are some signs of improvement in the air travel market, losses or inadequate profits continue at many airlines," Ron Woodard, executive vice president of Boeing's commercial airplane group, said in a statement. "Until more customers are in a position to order new airplanes, we must reduce our production, as painful as that is for our employees, for our suppliers and for our communities."
Boeing said it would reduce production of its 737 jetliner to 8.5 a month in November 1994 from the current monthly rate of 10. Just last month, Boeing lowered its 737 production rate to 10 from 14 a month.
It said it would also cut production of its long-range 747 jet to three a month in February 1994 from the current five, and then to two planes a month, beginning in January 1995. The company said the production cut announced yesterday was not tied to any particular customer; Boeing changes production rates as overall order levels dictate.
 
More Cuts Seen as Possible
 William B. Whitlow, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Seattle, said there could be more production cuts if the worldwide airline recession continued.
"People see some recovery in the domestic airlines, but internationally, the industry is still in the tank," he said. "Until we get a worldwide recovery, there is continuing risk of production rate cuts." Predicting flat sales in 1994 and 1995, he added, "The big question is what happens in 1996?"
Boeing said last month that it had received an order from Southwest Airlines for 63 of its 737-X family of jetliners, the next generation of its best-selling Boeing 737. But delivery of those planes will not begin until 1997, so they will not offset the current production cutbacks.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Optimism grows that Clinton can nail down a world trade deal.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
REMEMBER the children's song about the bear who climbed over the mountain? It must have unfortunate resonance these days for Bill Clinton, who scaled one peak -- the North American Free Trade Agreement -- only to face another equally tough ascent: completion of the so-called Uruguay Round of world trade liberalization under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by the Dec. 15 deadline.
The President may yet be forced to ask Congress for an extension of his negotiating authority -- or settle for a stripped-down accord that fudges the tough issues. Strikingly, though, few trade analysts are advocating a face-saving deal. More striking still, many are optimistic that Mr. Clinton can nail down a deal that weeks ago seemed impossible. 
 A word of explanation for those who experience an uncontrollable urge to nap on reading the phrase "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade." Pedestrian as it may seem, agreement on new rules for international trade and investment could provide the psychological spark that reignites the recession-dimmed world economy.
At very least, according to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the "draft final agreement" would add some $270 billion annually to world income by the year 2002. That translates into lower prices on goods ranging from sweaters to rice, and higher returns on global investments in everything from computer software to life insurance.
The vague outlines for a deal have been apparent for years. Industrial countries would get global access for the export of services, as well as legal protection for such "intellectual property" as drug patents. In return, they would end the protection of goods for which cheap labor gives third world countries a cost edge, and they would phase out subsidies that artificially depress world prices for food. Everyone would also be required to bend a little to the commonweal, playing by international rules on what constitutes unfair dumping and domestic purchase preferences.
But getting from here to there has proved no small feat. The draft agreement falls short of the brave new free trade world envisioned in the 1980's. And in one of the most politicized areas, agricultural subsidies, France has rejected even the weakened provisions negotiated on its behalf by the European Community.
That led some analysts to argue that a simple agreement, one lowering tariffs but putting off all the tough stuff, made sense. As recently as last month, there were quiet calls for the principals to sign something (anything), declare victory and cut their political losses.
All that has changed, however, in part because the deadline has forced the negotiators to examine the consequences of punting. Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University and an adviser to GATT, argues that the draft agreement is "a carefully balanced thing." Stripping it down, if only with the objective of making it less offensive to muscular special interests, would thus be very difficult. Indeed, C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics fears that a hollowed-out agreement would actually encourage protectionist backsliding.
Robert Lawrence, an economist at Harvard, sharpens the point. Honoring the Blair House deal -- Europe's agreement to split the remaining differences with Washington on agricultural subsidies -- is critical, he says. To make further concessions to France now, Mr. Lawrence argues, "would undermine the credibility of the European Community to negotiate for Europe."
Much of the change in outlook, however, follows from the Administration's newly discovered skills at realpolitik. The North American Free Trade Agreement demonstrated to the world that President Clinton was willing and able to take on the liberal wing of the Democratic Party on trade issues. As important, the victory on the trade accord was followed by the tirelessly publicized Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Seattle, leaving Europeans to fret that America would abandon the dream of global free trade in favor of regional trade pacts.
Fortress America, an integrated economy stretching from the Hudson Bay to Tierra del Fuego, is hardly a credible threat to the vastly more important trade and investment ties between North America and the European Community. And while a free trade area including Japan, China and North America might indeed divert commerce from Europe, Mr. Lawrence points out that bread-and-butter issues ranging from foreign investment in Japan to fierce protection of the domestic American apparel industry will make it impossible to realize the ambition anytime soon.
Used skillfully by free traders, though, the psychological threat of a regional alternative might make the difference as the GATT negotiations approach the witching hour. Indeed leaks of France's new flexibility on agriculture are appearing right on schedule. "I am optimistic the Administration can pull it off," Mr. Bergsten concludes. "If Clinton succeeds, he'll restore American leadership in global economic policy."

HEADLINE: Pregnant Teen-Agers Are Outcasts No Longer

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
IN the "old days" of the 1960's, 50's and 40's, pregnant teen-agers were pariahs, banished from schools, ostracized by their peers or scurried out of town to give birth in secret.
Today, pregnant teen-agers are even beginning to be viewed by some of their peers as role models. No longer are they shunned or ridiculed, but supported and embraced in their decisions to give birth, keep their babies, continue their educations and participate in school activities. Some adults, however, including many who in their youth considered the treatment of pregnant girls detestable, are nevertheless shocked by these attitudes. 
 "When I was in high school, girls got pregnant and they disappeared," said Richard Schuldt of Eau Claire, Wis. "Now, my pregnant daughter goes on 'The Montel Williams Show.' " Mr. Schuldt's daughter April was elected homecoming queen at her high school last year when she was five months pregnant. "I'm glad the old days of wearing the scarlet 'P' are gone," Mr. Schuldt, the father of six, added, "but today, teen pregnancy is being treated like it's no big thing, like it's the norm."
Indeed, in interviews with dozens of teen-agers around the nation, a picture emerged of a generation with more tolerant attitudes about teen-age pregnancy. By no means is the change in thinking universal, although it is defended by youths from diverse socioeconomic, racial, regional and academic backgrounds.
The new attitude was reflected in the words of Adina Madden of Washington, who is 18 and a freshman at George Washington University. "You look at a girl who's pregnant or has a baby and think, 'She's a better person than me, someone who is strong,' " she said. "There's no reason to mistreat a girl who is pregnant, like she has some contagious disease."
In each of the last five years, a little more than one million teen-agers became pregnant, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization specializing in reproductive-health issues. In 1989, the last year for which figures were available, 49 percent of teen-age pregnancies resulted in birth, 37 percent in abortion and 14 percent in miscarriage, the institute said.
A 1972 Federal law made it illegal for schools that receive Federal funds to expel students or to prohibit them from participating in school activities because of pregnancy or parenthood. Although legal experts say some schools are ignoring the law and trying to shift pregnant students into special classes, some pregnant teen-agers are standing their ground, as in these cases:
* In Hempstead, Tex., high school officials were forced to reverse a decision last month to bar pregnant girls from the cheerleader squad after several students protested that it was punishment. The National Organization for Women threatened a lawsuit against the district.
* At Chelsea High School in Manhattan two years ago, the president and the secretary-treasurer of the student council both became pregnant and were encouraged to remain in the posts. Although some students protested, several called the girls role models and said their leadership resulted in the first prom at Chelsea.
* At Eau Claire Memorial High School in Wisconsin a year ago, the principal resigned and three assistant principals were disciplined for tampering with a student election to prevent Ms. Schuldt from becoming homecoming queen.
"If you look at the last 30 years, as a culture we have removed any form of being judgmental about out-of-wedlock pregnancy, as well as a host of other things," said Gary L. Bauer, the president of the Family Research Council, a social policy research organization in Washington. "While at first glance that may seem to be kind, the fact is that when a society has increasing rates of illegitimacy, it is headed for the rocks of decline."
Alexander Sanger, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of New York City, said he is trying to answer questions like: How much compassion and understanding should society show toward pregnant teen-agers, and when does compassion become a license to do as one pleases?
"You know, we policy makers really don't understand young people," Mr. Sanger said. "It's inevitable that one person's compassion becomes another person's incentive. We want to take care of the child and the teen mother, but that can lead to teens looking at it as an incentive, a ticket out of the home. Their apartment is paid for by the city, they receive welfare and food stamps. So how do we do one without the other? We are all wrestling with that."
The prevailing attitude among the teen-agers interviewed, boys and girls, was that girls who choose to have their babies deserve more credit and respect than those who elect to have abortions and that society should let them enjoy whatever moments of glory come their way, like being a cheerleader or homecoming queen.
They eschew age-old standards that place the responsibility for childbirth primarily on the girl and that brand girls for life for what many teen-agers view as a mistake. And they point out the inconsistency of Hollywood images that glamorize sex and celebrities who have had children out of wedlock but maintain their status as pop-culture icons.
"As society perceives it, abortion is socially correct," said Heather Haynes, a 17-year-old who works after school as a peer counselor at the Planned Parenthood center in the Bronx. "Ethically, it's not correct. But you get the sense that it's the preferred option because it gets rid of the problem quick."
Carmen Colon, 21, another peer counselor at the center, said: "Life doesn't have to stop just because you're pregnant. As long as a girl is in school, why shouldn't she be able to take part in school activities. There are a lot of girls who aren't pregnant who are worse role models than some who are."
In many ways, the youths' opinions reinforced the notion that there are no simple answers and quick solutions to the problem of teen-age pregnancy.
"I know of girls who won't take birth control because it means they're planning to have sex," said Teresa Moore, 16, of Milwaukee. "Then, if it happens -- sex -- you have the excuse that you weren't planning to do it, you just got overwhelmed by the moment. That way, it's less of a guilt trip if you get pregnant."
While most of the young people interviewed said they believed that support for pregnant teen-agers is good, they expressed concern that too much support may give the wrong message.
" 'Welfare' backwards is 'farewell,' " said Ms. Haynes of the Bronx. "Welfare has become a life style for some teen mothers. I believe they should be helped, but there should be a limit to that help."
When asked what limits she would impose, Ms. Haynes said, "Welfare would be provided for the first child you have out of wedlock, not the second or third, unless the mother or father worked to support their baby."
Her proposition sounded strikingly similar to one offered by Charles Murray in "Losing Ground: The Coming White Underclass" (Basic Books, 1984). Mr. Murray, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, has called for a return to the mores of the past. As incentive, he proposed in a recent essay in The Wall Street Journal an "end of all economic support for single mothers" by government, including subsidized housing and food stamps.
In his radio address on Saturday, President Clinton also expressed concern about the number of out-of-wedlock births, adding, "We have to be concerned that without the structure, the discipline, the love of families, too many children face a future stripped of hope."
Tom Sartwell, 21, of Minot, N.D., who lives in the state with the lowest teen-age pregnancy rate in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control, agrees with the need for structure. "My boys snickered when I told them my girlfriend was pregnant," he said. "They told me this was going to tie me down. But I have to respect her decision not to have an abortion and to try to stay in school. I got a job and I'm supporting my baby. That's the way it should be."
But Tina Woolever, a 15-year-old sophomore at Hempstead High School, where the controversy over pregnant cheerleaders took place, said girls who are pregnant must also learn or be taught to be more responsible. "And that may mean they have to give up activities like cheerleading," she added.
Ms. Schuldt, 18, who gave birth to a son last year and graduated with her class, said: "There were people who felt I would have been a bad role model being up there as homecoming queen pregnant. But maybe some young girl would have seen it differently. Maybe, she would have seen a pregnant girl, continuing school, planning to raise and care for her baby and being supported by other students."
A 1986 study -- the latest such conducted -- by the Alan Guttmacher Institute found that the high school completion rate of women who became mothers at 17 or younger nearly tripled, from 19 percent in 1958, to 56 percent in 1986..
These and similar findings have prompted several school districts to establish on-site day care and to offer private tutoring and other assistance to encourage pregnant girls to continue their educations.
In North Dakota, for example, pregnant teen-agers can be tutored at home until they give birth or can attend an alternative high school in which students work at their own pace toward graduation.
"We know most of these girls don't want to get pregnant, and we don't want to look down on them when they do," said Kathy Hauser, a teacher who is director of the Souris River Campus, the alternative school in Minot. "In a way, some people view the help we provide as making pregnancy more acceptable, and I can see their point."
Nearly all the teen-agers interviewed, regardless of how they viewed out-of-wedlock pregnancy, shared a common belief: society must get its own act together on the issue.
"It is kind of a mixed message circulating out there," said Ms. Schuldt, who plans to enter college next fall. "It's different when you're older and have money to take care of a child. I can understand that. But if you can treat some unwed mothers with respect, then why not do the same for others.
"Just because you're young, unmarried and pregnant doesn't mean you're less of a person."

HEADLINE: Finding Reliable Picture Developers

BYLINE: By DEBORAH HOFMANN

 BODY:
THESE days, choosing where to have holiday photographs developed can be as tough as deciding where to go on vacation. Film processing has become a basic neighborhood service, with new photo-finishing labs as ubiquitous as greengrocers. But the quality of their color prints can vary greatly, making comparison shopping essential.
As camera prices have dropped strikingly, film processing time has been cut in half and the quality of prints has been improved by technological innovations. The processing of negatives, once handled by operators of varying motivation and training, is today done by computers, which read negatives with more precision. Once negatives are produced, state-of-the-art printers can automatically make customized corrections to a photograph in a process called balancing. 
 People are taking more pictures -- and demanding more for their money. About 17 billion photographs were taken in 1992 in the United States, up from 11 billion a decade ago, said Harold Martin, editor of the Wolfman Report, which follows the photographic industry. Yet, he added, "many consumers still don't realize how good their pictures could be with good processing, nor how bad most processing can be."
In most major cities there are four ways for amateur photographers to get film processed.
MINI-LABS: These process film on the premises, usually within the hour. According to the Wolfman survey, there are about 21,000 mini-labs in the United States, compared with 3,000 in 1982. Despite rapid turnaround, mini-labs generally do more careful work than huge photo-finishers. You can actually watch them cleaning the negatives and making adjustments on computers; perhaps this accounts for the improved quality.
But they do not generally charge a flat rate, and their price lists can be confusing. Cost is based on a developing fee -- usually $3 or $4 -- plus a per-print rate (usually 30 cents to 40 cents apiece), which totals $12 to $16 for a roll of 36 exposures. Increasingly, mini-labs offer premiums like free rolls of film, enlargements or an extra set of prints. Opt for the prints; getting reprints later will be more expensive because of the extra labor costs.
If you are using a lab for the first time, you might wish to stay the hour to observe how the work is done. At the least, ask whether the lab uses fresh, high-grade paper by Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.
"If a print turns out badly, a person assumes that it is something they have done wrong," Mr. Martin said. "In fact, it might be that economizing was done at the finishing end." For instance, he said, every lab should refresh chemicals regularly.
Inspect each print before paying. A blurred image, perhaps caused by the photographer's poor focus, cannot be fixed. But poor contrast in a photograph often can be improved. Most labs will remake poorly color-balanced photos for free. The Fromex chain in Manhattan, for example, allows customers to bring back photographs at any time, said Wendy Mirabal, assistant manager of the Fromex mini-lab at 182 East 86th Street.
Even when everything is done conscientiously, different brands and batches of film can create problems.
"It's like the best chicken soup: everybody loves it one year, and the next holiday it can come too salty," said Cliff Strome, who owns Clicks and the Pro-Print 1 Hour Photo, two mini-lab chains in Manhattan. "Film made in Singapore may differ from film by the same manufacturer in Argentina."
Mr. Strome said he invested $700,000 in new equipment last April to compensate for differences in film batches. He charges between $15 and $16 for a roll of 36 exposures.
CAMERA STORES: These are also good places for processing film, several editors at Popular Photography magazine said. The owner may be prepared to redo work to your satisfaction; $12 is typical for a roll of 36 prints.
OFF-SITE LABS: Camera stores may also sell prepaid mail-in envelopes for you to send film to out-of-town manufacturers' labs like Kodak or Fuji (you pay for the processing in advance). Depending upon the mail, it may take up to two weeks to get prints, but the cost drops to between $8 and $10.
Beware of the lure of bargain-basement prices, sometimes under $4 a roll. Many discount labs provide mailers intended to resemble those used by Fuji or Kodak but instead route film to enormous wholesale processing mills producing tens of thousands of prints a day. Some work with outdated machinery. Occasionally a photograph comes back looking good, but after a few months the colors have changed or faded, a sign that cheap, out-of-date or exhausted chemicals were used. Assuming you could still remember where you sent the mailer (generally a post office box out of state), the odds are minuscule that you could find someone to correct the problem. Tracking down someone to request a refund might cost more in telephone charges than the original developing costs. And there's always the gamble of losing photographs through the mail.
LARGE-SCALE WHOLESALE FINISHERS: These are the middle ground between the most expensive and least expensive processing. They are usually more accountable and capable operations than the discount mass-volume finishers. They rely on collection points (candy stores, pharmacies, video-rental stores) where customers drop off film. The finishers retrieve it and return processed photographs anywhere from 7 to 24 hours later. Typically, 36 exposures cost $8. Bonuses are common; sidewalk placards advertise free photo albums, frames or film.
But to afford such give-aways some finishers may be cutting costs in processing that might diminish the quality of the prints, Mr. Martin said. And even a willing candy-store owner cannot do much to improve your photographs or trace film that went astray.
The most important thing is to build a relationship with an accountable supplier, whether it's in your own neighborhood, close to work or through the mail.
Above all, don't send essential pictures to a new supplier. If your photographs contain your baby's first steps, for example, you might want to consider custom labs that offer a full range of services for professional photographers and generally do work as good as -- if not better than -- that of the other options mentioned.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Hero or Villain, Magic Just Wants to Play Ball

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCKFORD, Ill., Dec. 1

 BODY:
Magic Johnson received a hero's front-page welcome to this northern Illinois city today. He was also ripped by local AIDS activists.
Such is the psychological paradox that the basketball superstar's post-National Basketball Association life has become. In one breath, someone calls out, "We love you, Magic." In another, he is challenged to explain what in the world he is doing here in the first place. 
 On World AIDS Day, Johnson, who is infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, was here not to preach, only to play. "I love ball," he said at a news conference to kick off his tour of five Continental Basketball Association towns. "I'm just a basketball player."
Arguably the greatest team player in the history of the sport, holder of five N.B.A. championship rings, Magic and his peripatetic all-stars beat the Rockford Lightning, 129-119, tonight. Next stop on Magic's tour: Hartford, Thursday night, to challenge another entity from the N.B.A.'s developmental league for the love of a run and the split of the gate.
 
Reporters Applaud
 Tonight's game sold out Rockford's Metro Centre (capacity: 8,900), where the Lightning averages 3,500 fans. Tickets went for as much as $30, which is usually the cost of a C.B.A. night out for a family of four. "One of the most significant sports events in the city's history," said the Lightning's public relations man, Dan Bernstein.
Many members of the local news media stood and applauded when Johnson walked into the small gymnasium on the campus of Rock Valley College for the news conference Tuesday afternoon. He dressed down for the occasion. He wore a wool hat and gray coat over a blue sweatsuit, which had "Magic All Stars" in white lettering on the front of the shirt. His agent and bodyguard wore black jackets with "Magic Johnson Legends Tour" insignias on the back and "Pepsi" embroidered on the front.
So why was this tour's one actual legend really here, in subfreezing temperatures time zones from his home in sunny Los Angeles? He gave no one a palatable answer. He hinted, sometimes unwittingly, at many.
The crowds. The news media. His sponsors. The locker room. The guys. The game.
The grim reality of H.I.V.
 
'Trying to Be Magic'
 The lead headline on the front page of today's Rockford Register Star read: "Magic: I don't dwell on AIDS." He said that only when he takes his medicine, twice a day, does his condition usually cross his mind. "My theory is that if you think about it, that's all there's going to be," said Johnson. "Meanwhile, everything is still happening all around you."
So on and on he goes, just "trying to be Magic."
It is two years since Johnson announced he was infected with H.I.V. and quit the Los Angeles Lakers after 12 seasons. He said then that his new job would be as a spokesman for the fight against H.I.V. Tonight, a Rockford AIDS activist, John Olson, held a candlelight vigil in the rain outside the Metro Centre. And he lit into Johnson for not participating in local World AIDS Day activities.
"This man, who walked out of the Presidential AIDS Commission because it wasn't doing anything, has no intention of supporting AIDS awareness," Olson said.
Johnson did try being a spokesman for H.I.V. He just wasn't very good at it. He started by telling schoolchildren that he would beat the disease, a scientific impossibility and, critics complained, the worst message for kids. He aborted his heralded N.B.A. comeback last November in the face of player opposition, practically insuring that other players who might be infected would keep their mouths shut. Tuesday, minutes after reiterating that discrimination in the workplace against H.I.V. must stop, Johnson decided it didn't really exist in the N.B.A.
"The players who complained had been trying to beat the Lakers for years and couldn't," he said. "So if I'm out, then they get that chance.
"See, I've been real, so you be real about your reasons. Don't come with, 'I don't want to play the game,' because you've been playing against me and with me for three months. Come on. That was a joke."
 
The Smile Disappears
 There was no trademark Magic smile now. No follow-up laughter. The more Johnson talked about the comments made by Utah's Karl Malone, among others, the more detectable his bitterness was. He wanted to play. He still does, but the N.B.A. situation, for him and everyone else, gets much too complex. Better to toy with the inevitable question of another possible return:
"If the Lakers were in a position where they could win it all. . . ."
"If Michael Jordan were to come back. . . ."
Better, for now, to meet the pressures of getting exposure for the sake of endorsement deals by creating his own Magic show time. He found unemployed veterans like Reggie Theus, Earl Cureton and John Long, and there are always young players looking for exposure on ESPN2, which will televise Thursday's game in Hartford, and the chance to run with the best point guard of them all.
He appeared to lack the resolve to make what activists saw as the ultimate anti-discrimination statement for H.I.V. by staying with the Lakers last fall. But Johnson's insistence on finding other places to play must count for something. He hears that he ought to be home every night with his wife, with his young son. It's his business, he said. He's out there. His statement, ultimately, is that he's not about to let others set his priorities.
"If this is what Magic wants to do, what's the disgrace?" said Rockford Coach Mauro Panaggio, a 65-year-old grandfather of 11. "You see what the gate is. People still want to see him play."
 
Too Quiet for Magic
 If he could get his competition fix another way, Johnson would. Jordan and Larry Bird have golf. Golf is a private game in a quiet setting. Too quiet for Magic Johnson.
Trying to make the point that he doesn't need the cheers, the attention, he only made a more convincing case that he does. "I went to a concert the other night and the guy made me stand up two times," he said, as if his arm had been twisted. "The crowd kept cheering, cheering."
Crowds follow him everywhere when he goes on vacation or plays abroad. "If I needed that, I would just play in Europe, where I'm more popular than here," he said. But, of course, his coming South American tour is sold out, he noted. And then it's all aboard for eastern Asia.
He was not too proud to whoop it up tonight with Theus, who scored 40 points, many off Johnson's 21 assists. It would be no humiliating comedown, he said, to bring the ball upcourt tonight against the Lightning's Jay Taylor. If not Taylor, then it would be some sharp-elbowed lawyer at his sports club in L.A. He was going to get himself a game, one place or another. This, at least, was structured, safer, and it still made him feel like an ambassador for the sport, a master of the crowd.
He mugged for courtside snapshots. He high-fived kids when the game ended. He grabbed the public-address microphone. "Please say a prayer for all those with H.I.V," he said, his words a reminder that in the playing arena he always did make the right call.
This wasn't the N.B.A. but it was still very much his element.
"I'm not here to prove anything, just to get the thrill of being out there, knowing I've got to push the button or I could be embarrassed," he said. "For them, the opponents, there's the challenge of trying to take me, beat me, that whole thing.
"I think," Magic Johnson said, unconvincingly, "they get more out of it than me."

Ad Spending Rise Forecast for 1994

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Media spending next year will grow by 7 percent, or 2 percent after inflation, according to a study released yesterday by Myers Reports in Parsippany, N.J., an advertising, marketing and media consulting company.
The report said a strong national television market -- stimulated by home shopping, infomercials and other forms of electronic marketing -- would fuel that growth, with little change in spending in most other media. 
 The annual report by Myers forecast a 10 percent rise in broadcast network television ad spending and a 14 percent gain in broadcast syndication ad spending. By comparison, magazine ad spending is expected to rise 5 percent to 6 percent, while spending in newspapers is expected to rise 4 percent to 5 percent.

Kendall in Shake-Up of Top Officers

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
The supercomputer maker Kendall Square Research stripped its chief executive of his title yesterday and demoted two other top executives as the company sought to contain a financial crisis and salvage its credibility with the investment community.
Kendall Square also restated its financial results for the last year and a half, disclosing a significantly higher loss for 1992 than was previously reported. The company also indicated that it did not know whether the slim profit initially reported for the first half of 1993 would remain, once all the adjustments had been made. 
 The financial revision was forced by the company's announcement on Monday that its auditor, Price Waterhouse, could no longer vouch for the company's previous financial reports. That news had sent Kendall Square's stock plunging 33 percent on Monday, but yesterday the shares edged up 12.5 cents to close at $7.875 in Nasdaq trading.
Yesterday Kendall Square, based in Waltham, Mass., announced that Henry Burkhardt 3d, the company's founder, would be replaced as chief executive by William I. Koch, the company's chairman and largest stockholder. Mr. Koch, probably better known as the skipper of the high-tech yacht that won the America's Cup in 1992, will serve as acting chief while a search for a new chief executive is conducted. Mr. Burkhardt will remain as president.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Burkhardt acknowledged that Kendall Square "made a number of mistakes" in recording its revenues, particularly in sales to universities. Kendall Square had previously insisted that its revenue bookkeeping had been accurate during the last two years, despite questions raised by analysts. "We sure thought we had it under control," Mr. Burkhardt said. "But a lot of sales to universities were inappropriately recorded because the underlying financing from third parties was not contractually in place at the time."
The company said Peter Appleton Jones, executive vice president of the technical products group, and Karl G. Wassmann 3d, chief financial officer, were both being stripped of their titles. Mr. Burkhardt said both would remain as employees to offer advice to Mr. Koch but were no longer officers of the company. Mr. Jones's duties will be handled by Robert Rockwell, vice president of marketing and Far Eastern sales. Ray Fortune, Kendall Square's, chief operating offficer, will serve as interim chief financial officer, until a replacement can be found.
Kendall Square had announced on Monday that Price Waterhouse had withdrawn its auditor's report on the company's 1992 financial results. Kendall Square said yesterday that an internal audit showed that the compay's 1992 sales were actually $4.2 million less than originally reported and the net loss in earnings for the year was actually $4.5 million higher, resulting in a loss of $17.2 million for 1992, instead of the $12.7 million previously reported.
Kendall Square said the new figures might still be subject to adjustment because Price Waterhouse had yet to review them.
For the first six months of 1993, the company had previously reported sales of $24.7 million and net income of $1.3 million. Yesterday, the company said it was estimating sales for the first nine months of only $10.6 million and declined to predict whether the revised numbers would result in a profit or loss for the first nine months.
Kendall Square told industry analysts that the company might end up deleting more than $30 million in 1993 revenues that it thought were on the books. The company said it might have to take a financial charge against its inventory of KSR1 supercomputers and therefore did not want to speculate on the impact on earnings.
Kendall Square issued its findings today in order to "dispel uncertainties raised by these accounting issues and to permit the company to move forward with its business plan," the company said in a news release.
The company also reviewed its assets and said that its capitalized software would be $2.4 million as of Sept. 25, instead of the $6.5 million reported as of June 26.

HEADLINE: Clinton Welfare Planners Outline Big Goals Financed by Big Saving

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
President Clinton's task force on welfare reform has translated his pledge to "end welfare as we know it" into a plan to spend significant new sums on child care, work and job training programs. But the plan provides few specifics about the financing and says its ambitious goals can be paid for entirely by cuts or savings in welfare or other programs for the needy.
A draft of the plan was completed 12 days ago and is subject to revisions before it is presented to Mr. Clinton. 
 A copy of the confidential document suggests that, in its broadest outline, the program seems less the radical departure that Mr. Clinton's oratory has suggested than an expansion of the current law, as embodied in the 1988 Family Support Act.
 
Training and Then Work
 That law provides money for job training and education programs, and requires some welfare particpants to enroll in them. The Clinton plan would expand those training opportunties, and add tougher work requirements at the end.
"We see the Family Support Act as a really core foundation for anything we do," said David T. Ellwood, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services who is one of three leaders of the task force drafting the bill.
The plan reiterates Mr. Clinton's pledge to impose a two-year limit on welfare benefits, after which recipients would have to enroll in a work program or face financial penalties.
 
An Unanswered Question
 But it holds open the possibility that the work program could be temporary, and it does not resolve the ultimate question: What would then happen to poor families who still could not find private jobs?
One Administration official drafting the plan called that "the $64,000 question" that after nearly a year in office, the Administration has still not answered.
The plan suggests that those who exhaust their temporary jobs could simply recyle back onto the welfare rolls, perhaps with reduced benefits.
The working group member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, characterized the plan as "a first draft" and said it underscored the amount of detailed work still to come before one of the President's primary campaign pledges is converted to legislation.
Like the people who devised the Admininstration's initial ambitious health care proposals, the welfare planners did not say how much the plan would cost or specify which program cuts would finance it. So it is hard to gauge the true extent of its ambition.
But some welfare experts voiced skepticism that a serious welfare plan could be financed simply by cutting current programs.
 
New Services Required
 Mr. Ellwood acknowledged that many decisions remain. "The whole question of how exactly the jobs will work is still very much under discussion," he said.
The financing remains a central political difficulty. Many members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, think the time limit can save money and court favor with the public. But the plan makes the time limits contingent on the Government's providing expensive new services, like job training and child care and the working group members are searching for ways to pay for the services. The Administration wants to phase in the program slowly, to reduce the initial costs.
For now, the White House is in the midst of a vigorous internal debate over the timing of the plan. Some see the need to fulfill political promises quickly, particularly with Congressional Republicans pushing a time-limit plan of their own. Others are warning that fast action on welfare will produce political and financial conflicts for the health care bill, which must travel through the same Congressional committees.
The 29-page plan served as the basis of a Nov. 20 meeting of the working group, which has 32 members. The Administration has recruited some of the nation's leading academic experts on welfare, including Isabel V. Sawhill, a White House budget aide, and Mr. Ellwood and Mary Jo Bane, both assistant secretaries at the Department of Health and Human Services.
But so far they have provided more slogans than specifics about how they plan to tackle the challenge of moving five million poor mothers, mostly with few skills, into an economy with nine million unemployed people.
The document from the Nov. 20 meeting gives the first clues. In addition to calling for expanded child care, training, and work programs, it also endorses a national campaign to reduce teen-age pregnancy. It calls for "dramatic improvements in the child support enforcement system" and acknowledges "there is considerable division" within the group over whether the Government should make the payments itself if it fails to collect them.
 
Both Fathers and Mothers
 The plan indicates an enthusiasm for expanding training programs so that they include absent fathers, as well as mothers. Such an expansion could help fathers earn more, and therefore pay more in child support payments. But such an expansion would also add large new costs.
The document also acknowledges the considerable political challenges that surround revamping the welfare system and which, in the past, have defeated ambitious plans by Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter. "Ugly, racist, and mean-spirited images are sometimes loudly proclaimed," the paper said.
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program, costs about $23 billion a year. Food stamps and Medicaid for welfare families costs about $40 billion more. But the volatility of welfare debates is always larger than numbers alone suggest, because the issue touches on race, class and even sexual morality.
Mr. Clinton's plan is similar to Mr. Carter's in one crucial respect: his insistence that any welfare overhaul pay for itself by offsetting cuts or savings in other programs. That is a major reason Mr. Carter's plan failed in Congress.
Bruce Reed, a White House domestic policy aide who is a co-chairman of the task force, expressed confidence that the financing would not similarly stall this plan. "The cost depends how gradually it's phased in," he said.
One way to phase it in, he said, is to start in a limited number of states. Another possibility is to have the new requirements apply only to new welfare applicants, not to those already on the program.
 
Skepticism on Fiscal Claim
 But one Congressional aide who is an expert on welfare expressed skepticism that an ambitious plan could be financed from wringing the fat out of existing programs. "When they tell you it's going to be deficit neutral and they don't know where the money is coming from, I get real skeptical that this is going to be as significant change in policy," he said.
As described in the plan, each welfare recipient would be required to join a social worker in designing a contract that "would detail the obligations of both the recipient and the state."
The state would be required to provide the education, training, or child care a welfare recipient needed to find a job. The welfare recipient would be required to attend the programs.
In general, the work preparation would not exceed two years "for employable persons." But the plan would allow states to grant extensions for people who had not finished high school or needed other kinds of training. The number of extensions each state could issue would be limited.
In the event the state did not have the money to provide the training or child care, the "state would be prohibited from imposing time limits." That is why the extent of Government financing is crucial in determining the extent of the program.
The plan does not specify who would be exempt from the time limits. The Family Support Act already requires welfare recipients to participate in work or training programs.
But it exempts about half of the five million families on the rolls, including, for instance, the mothers of infants. And the current law only requires 15 percent of the rest to be in a program.
 
Some Would Be Incapable
 The Clinton plan envisions "a substantial increase" in the $1.3 billion a year now being spent on the training programs. It would also require less in the way of state matching money.
The Clinton plan acknowledges that not everyone on welfare is physically or mentally capable of holding a job, and argues the system "must be sensitive" to granting them exceptions. Instead of job training, such people might get health or housing assistance or aid, the plan says.
The plan outlines two options for creating the work program that would begin after a welfare recipient reached the two-year limit. Under one option, checks would be distributed by employers; under the other, checks would be distributed by the welfare system, in exchange for work.
The second option is generally considered harder to enforce, because court decision have provided for extensive appeals before a welfare check can be reduced.
In either event, the plan calls for money to finance the jobs from the Federal Government, distributed to states according to a formula. And Federal money would include financial incentives to place people in private jobs, rather than Government jobs.
Such incentives could include payments to the employers who hired welfare recipients, or to personnel concerns that found them jobs. The details would vary by region and be determined by some sort of a public-private council.
 
Jobs Are Transitional

 Mr. Reed, the task force co-chairman, said the jobs are likely to be temporary. "We see these as transitional jobs, not permanent jobs," he said.
That raises the question of what comes next for families that, at the end of the program, could still not find work.
The task force leaders say no decisions have been made. But the plan discusses an option to give states the choice of reducing the benefits "to recipients who had spent at least 18 months in work assignments."
Task force members would not publicly specify how much annual spending they envision when the program is fully in effect. But one member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, noted that the Republicans' plan proposed spending $6 billion a year on child care and training and said "we'd look silly" with a smaller plan.
Where will the officials find the savings? A task force member, also anonymously, said the group was examining welfare, child care, and disability programs for changes to save money. Melissa Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said, "I'm ruling out Medicare and Social Security."
 
Expanded Care for Children
 The plan calls for expansions of child care programs that would cover not only families on welfare but also those of the working poor. Otherwise, it said, "it will be impossible to insure that working people avoid poverty."
It contemplates three ways of doing that: consolidating and expanding current programs, creating a new block grant program or creating a refundable tax credit. It gives no cost estimate.
The plan also calls for a change in the way an important tax credit program is administered. It would give the low-income workers advanced payments on the tax refunds, rather than making them wait until the end of the year.
In an interview this afternoon, Mr. Ellwood argued that the importance of the plan was not in its immediate financial scope but rather in the signals it sends. He said it would change welfare offices from places that mail checks to those that find people jobs.
The document reiterates that vision throughout, arguing the Clinton plan will reinforce "the traditional values of work, family, support, and responsibility."

Chart: "Revamping Wlefare, With Questions Remaining"
 Significant expansion of child care, work, and training programs, which would be financed from cuts or savings in existing programs.

Consideration of a national crusade against teen-age pregnancy, and perhaps new training opportunities for unwed fathers.
 
The draft plan leaves unresolved several crucial questions:
No decisions have been made about important eatures of the work program like how many jobs will be created and how long they will last.
It does not say how much the program would cost or which other programs would be cut to pay for it. (pg. A26)

HEADLINE: U.S. AND EUROPEANS REPORT KEY STEPS TO A TRADE ACCORD

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The top trade negotiators for the United States and the European Community said today that they had made important, potentially decisive progress on a range of issues, including the nettlesome matter of farm exports, that could lead to a world trade accord.
"We have agreed upon an approach to all major issues that would pave the way to the completion of a substantive and comprehensive Uruguay Round," the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said here, referring to the negotiations on updating and broadening world trade rules that began seven years ago in Uruguay.
 
A Way to Break Recessions
 The talks, under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are widely seen as crucial for both economic and political reasons. Success could help revive moribund economies in Japan and Europe, and stimulate uncertain economic recoveries in the United States and Britain. 
 On a political level, a failure to reach a trade agreement would put further strains on the postwar alliance between Western Europe and the United States that is adjusting imperfectly to the end of the cold war.
Neither Mr. Kantor nor his European counterpart, Sir Leon Brittan, gave significant details in public of the progress they said was achieved in two days of talks, and the French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, whose Government has most strenuously objected to the agricultural provisions proposed, later sounded a note of caution.
 
Farm Trade Is Central
 "The basis of an overall agreement has not yet been laid," Mr. Juppe said. Nonetheless, he added that "we have emerged from the deep chill that had descended on relations between the community and the United States."
Officials close to the discussions said the most important progress was made on agriculture, where France's objections to the Blair House accord of last year, calling for a 21 percent cut over six years in the volume of community exports of subsidized grain and other food, have wounded relations with the United States.
Today, Mr. Kantor said, "We have formulated an approach which would successfully remove all the issues in the area of agriculture."
Behind large measures of posturing among delegations here is a complex and politically sensitive negotiation that has entered its decisive phase. It seemed clear that Mr. Kantor's visit had generated significant momentum toward an agreement, particularly in the long-contested area of farm trade -- though without achieving final resolution of any issue.
The American trade negotiator said he would return to Brussels on Monday, after conferring with President Clinton, for what he and Sir Leon portrayed as conclusive negotiations. "We are, I hope, in the final strait," the European trade chief said.
All those taking part in the talks are pushing to conclude an agreement by Dec. 15 because of an effective deadline set by Congress early in the summer. The lawmakers gave Mr. Clinton "fast track" authority -- a deal struck by Dec. 15 can be put to an up-or-down vote in each house of Congress with no amendments allowed. The same practice was followed in approving the North American Free Trade Agreement.
On the ticklish farm export issue, the proposal being carried to Washington and European capitals reflects the sort of horse trading typical of the final stage of a negotiation.
The United States would grant concessions on the timing and nature of European export reductions, in return for improved access to European markets for a range of American farm products.
 
More Time and Flexibility
 Thus, community officials said, the gradual reductions leading to the overall 21 percent cut required by the Blair House accord would be concentrated at the end of the six-year period, giving European farmers more time to adjust. And greater flexibility would be permitted in the mix of products used to achieve the 21 percent cutback.
The Clinton Administration would also reinforce its guarantees that after a GATT accord, it would not initiate legal action against European farm trade practices, officials said.
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who accompanied Mr. Kantor, cited other gains. "We have found a way," he said, "to insure that our farmers will benefit from significant new market access opportunities in Europe in commodities like grain, meat, dairy products and other crops."
The Europeans, officials said, have tentatively agreed to convert some of their quotas on farm imports into low tariffs, as Washington demands.
One of the main effects of the compromise reached today would be on subsidized European wheat exports. The Europeans agreed earlier to reduce these exports to 13.4 million metric tons in 2001, from the current 22 million metric tons. But the pace of the cutbacks would be more gradual than first planned. Instead of falling to 16.4 million tons by mid-1996, the subsidized exports would drop only to 20.6 million tons by then.
Greater access for American farm products is crucial, though, and it is apparently unresolved. The arrival in European markets of big quantities of American grain would presumably enrage the French; a lot more American fruit would trouble the Italians; substantially more American beef would bother the Irish. For such reasons, European foreign ministers, who met after Mr. Kantor left today, were uniformly guarded about the overall prospects for an accord.
"We have the conviction that we are making progress, but it would be dangerous at this stage to draw any conclusions," said Foreign Minister Willy Claes of Belgium, currently president of the community's Council of Ministers.
 
An Issue Long Avoided
 Agriculture has been such a sensitive area because until this round of talks, GATT had not addressed protectionism in farm trade. Set up in 1948, at a time when many European countries were still focused on securing food self-sufficiency after the devastation of World War II, the Geneva-based trade organization has never previously acted to remove anomalies that grew out out of the exclusion of farm products from its rules.
A statement by the foreign ministers after their meeting expressed full confidence in Sir Leon's ability to "obtain, over the next few days, the indispensable improvements necessary to safeguard the essential interests of the community and to overcome the problems that remain."
Among those problems is a gathering dispute over anti-dumping duties, which Europeans think the United States uses excessively to protect hard-pressed industries like steel and automobiles. The community wants stringent rules in any accord setting out the criteria for the application and duration of such duties, while the Americans argue that national sovereignty could be infringed by the proposed measures.
There are also differences over textile trade, in which other nations want quotas removed more quickly than the United States does, and over world sales of movies, where France insists that it needs subsidies and quotas to protect its culture from a Hollywood onslaught.
Moreover, any accords between the Europeans and the United States will have to be extended to the other countries taking part in the talks. While a breakthrough between the community and Washington is viewed as the decisive ingredient in an overall accord, gaining the approval of other countries could take time, with the Dec. 15 deadline approaching.
"Difficulties remain," a European diplomat said. "But the political investment in an agreement on both sides of the Atlantic is so enormous right now, it is hard to imagine a failure."

HEADLINE: Delay in Hearing for Rifkin Stirs Plea Bargain Concerns

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 2

 BODY:
A pretrial hearing concerning the seizure of several thousand pieces of evidence from the macabre world of Joel Rifkin, including a blood-soaked wheelbarrow and chain saw, hypodermic needles, women's underwear, used condoms and a box full of personal ads, was postponed this morning when Mr. Rifkin called in sick from the county jail.
Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper, has admitted to killing 17 women, most of them prostitutes. 
 The delay increased concern among relatives of Mr. Rifkin's victims that the defense and prosecution wanted to explore further the possibility of a plea agreement.
 
The Only Acceptable Deal
 "The only deal we could agree to is one that puts him in jail for the rest of his life," said Margarita Gonzalez, whose sister, Jenny Soto, 23, was among the victims Mr. Rifkin listed in a confession. Her body was found in the Harlem River in May 1992.
"No one's even talked to us about a deal," said Ms. Gonzalez, who, with her mother, has attended all but a few of Mr. Rifkin's court appearances.
Michael L. Soshnick, Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, denied that any deals were in the works and said his client was not brought to Nassau County Court this morning because he was suffering from a stomach virus.
Mr. Soshnick said he had received no formal offer of a deal from the Nassau County District Attorney's office. But law-enforcement officials insisted that a deal had been offered to Mr. Rifkin and that he had balked over some details of the plea bargain.
They said the deal would allow Mr. Rifkin to plead guilty to all the charges against him in exchange for a sentence of 46 years to life.
 
Discussing a Plea Bargain
 Mr. Rifkin has so far been indicted for one murder in Nassau County, two in Suffolk County and and two each in Brooklyn and Queens. If he is convicted of those slayings alone, he could face 175 years to life in prison.
Officials from each of the nine jurisdictions in New York State that have either brought charges or are preparing charges against Mr. Rifkin met at the Nassau District Attorney's Office here on Monday to discuss a plea agreement, law-enforcement officials said. But the talks ended without an accord.
Mr. Rifkin was arrested on June 28 when he was stopped for a traffic violation and the police found the decomposing body of a woman wrapped in a blue plastic tarp in the rear of his pickup truck. Within hours of his arrest, he confessed to killing 17 women and told the police where their bodies could be found.
The current pretrial hearing before Judge Ira H. Wexner is considering the admissibility of Mr. Rifkin's confession and evidence found at his home. Jewelry, clothing and identification documents belonging to many of the victims were recovered in his bedroom, which smelled of oil and gasoline and was littered with old clothing, food wrappers, newspapers, magazines, video cassettes, rolls of undeveloped film and women's jewelry and clothing.
State police investigators testified this week that they had taken 7,000 items from Mr. Rifkin's bedroom, bathroom, closet and garage as they searched for items that might have blood, semen or other body fluids and hair on them.
Blood was detected on many of the items with the help of a what the investigators described as an "enhanced light source." Among them were a wheelbarrow, a chain saw, paint cans, rags, clothing, boots and shoes. The light causes a bright reflection when it strikes a bloodstain.
As Mr. Rifkin nervously shifted in his seat at the defense table on Wednesday, Inspector Alan Brock, told the court that the litter in the bedroom, except for a path to the bed, was a foot and a half deep.
Judge Wexner barred questions by the defense about the content of the video cassettes and the undeveloped film found in the bedroom. Inspector Brock said the film had been developed by the police, but he did not comment on its contents.
By questioning the methods used by the investigators, Mr. Soshnick hopes to raise questions about the admissibility of the evidence.
In his questions to Inspector Brock, Fred Klein, an assistant Nassau County District Attorney and chief prosecutor in the case, concentrated on items found in Mr. Rifkin's room, including wallets, identification cards and jewelry belonging to victims.

HEADLINE: With New U.S. Concessions, Canada Plans to Back Pact

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada announced today that his Government had secured concessions from the United States on the North American Free Trade Agreement and was prepared to drop his opposition to the pact coming into force on Jan. 1.
The announcement removed a last uncertainty about the institution of the three-country accord, which would eliminate most duties and investment barriers within the United States, Canada and Mexico over the next 15 years. 
 Canada, the last of the three countries to sign on, had sought side agreements with the United States to address its concerns, chiefly about the enforcement of what it said were the rules for fair trade.
"I am very satisfied with the progress we have made," Mr. Chretien told reporters in Ottawa today.
But political opponents said Mr. Chretien had obtained little but cosmetics and political window dressing. In dismissing the claims that the accord had been improved, the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament Jean Charest, the former Deputy Prime Minister, said Mr. Chretien got "zero, zilch, nothing."
Both houses of Congress and the Mexican Parliament approved the North American Free Trade Agreement last month. Canada's Parliament approved the pact last spring under the former Tory Government, but because of the approaching Federal elections and a possible change in Government, the legislation was never formally proclaimed.
During the election campaign, Mr. Chretien had threatened to withhold Canadian participation unless certain conditions were met. His Liberal Party had been sharply divided over the trade accord. In elections five years earlier the party had come out against a free trade agreement with the United States, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1989, and will now be supplanted by the new accord.
Yet once elected in October, Mr. Chretien's tough rhetoric softened. Though the agreement is not popular here, Canadian businesses have strongly favored participation and have exercised a powerful influence on the new Government through the new trade minister, Roy MacLaren, a former international business executive and foreign service officer.
 
Troublesome Reservations
 Business noted dramatic export growth to the United States under the existing five-year-old free trade pact. That export growth, in turn, has been the main prop for Canada's recent economic expansion.
Though the Canadians said they wanted only side agreements and not to reopen the pact, their reservations proved troublesome for the Clinton Administration in fighting the battle for approval in the House of Representatives. Some opponents argued that the Canadian objections had proved the accord was flawed.
But while the struggle in the House was under way, a number of influential Canadians let it be known that if the United States rejected the pact, Canada might go ahead with an exclusive arrangement with Mexico, noting advantages for export industries and jobs. This was seen as a further indication of the strong desire here to see the deal through.
Mr. Chretien raised the trade issues in his first meeting with President Clinton in Seattle two weeks ago. Mr. Clinton said he was sympathetic to Canadian concerns. Before making today's announcement, Mr. Chretien spoke again with the President by telephone at 7 P.M. on Wednesday.
The main agreement between Mr. Chretien's Government and the United States was to begin two years of talks on establishing codes covering unfair trade. The two countries will try to define what are unfairly subsidized exports and what constitutes the dumping of goods at below fair value in their bilateral commerce.
The Canadians said they felt the United States trade agencies were capricious in the actions they sometimes took against low-priced Canadian goods. The issue looms large here because the United States buys $4 of every $5 Canada exports to the world.
James J. Blanchard, a former Governor of Michigan and the United States Ambassador, said that standards should help both countries. "It's much easier to promote the free flow of trade if ground rules are more streamlined," he said.
Robert R. Amsterdam, an international trade lawyer in Toronto, said the United States was willing to discuss the rules now because its companies were starting to "feel the heat" of dumping actions by Canada. The Canadian Government has taken action recently against American steel, carpets and copper accessories.
Officials of the two Governments are to conclude a report on the unfair trade codes by the end of 1995, but the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said in a telephone interview from Brussels that neither the United States nor Canada "would be bound to comply with the report."
The Administration would have to work closely with Congress on any changes in the dumping or subsidy procedures, and Mr. Kantor's comment was seen as an indication of the sensitivity of the issue in Congress. The agreement announced today also included a statement by all three countries that the pact did not cover Canada's water resources and that Canada could not be forced to divert water resources to meet fresh-water needs of the United States.

HEADLINE: Russia's Workers Pay Price As Military Industries Fade

SERIES: An Army Adrift -- Last of six articles

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OBNINSK, Russia

 BODY:
In the 1940's, the secret ministry charged with developing the Soviet atomic bomb took over the tiny village of Obninsk. About 65 miles southwest of Moscow, it was close enough to be central, but far enough away not to endanger the capital and the Soviet leadership in the event of a nuclear accident.
Today, what is now called the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry remains in effect the owner of Obninsk. The main city square of what has become a well-kept city of 120,000 features an electronic sign that shows the time, the temperature and the radiation level. 
 The city contains 12 military research institutes and a single factory, Signal, which makes instruments for nuclear reactors and some circuit boards for Polaroid cameras.
 
Almost the Only Employer
 Other than a few service jobs, there is almost no other source of employment in Obninsk, one of at least 74 cities in Russia where more than 80 percent of the workers are employed by military industry.
"There's nothing else here," said Anatoly V. Zrodnikov of the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering here, adding with a chagrined smile, "They told us we were an elite and set for life."
But the abrupt collapse of the Soviet Union, with its centralized economy and bloated military budget, has hit cities like Obninsk very hard, prompting layoffs, lower salaries and sharply reduced standards of living. Economic chaos and the drastic decrease in state financing have forced big enterprises and research complexes like the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering here to look for new, civilian products and markets -- a process known as conversion.
Since 1989, Government spending on arms and military equipment has fallen 78 percent in real terms, said Albert F. Trifonov of Russia's Committee for Defense Industries. Spending on military research and development has dropped almost as much. The Government talks of financing conversion through arms sales. But that appears wholly unrealistic while making the West very nervous.
For all the talk about conversion since 1989, when Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was then the Soviet President, embraced it as an easy answer to demands for consumer goods, there has been precious little of it, Russian and Western officials say. Even here, the Polaroid Corporation's subassembly shop, which began in 1989 and makes a million circuit boards a year, employs only 120 people within the Signal factory, which employs 5,000.
Polaroid's managing director for the Commonwealth of Independent States, George Marquart, says the Cambridge, Mass., company is happy with the quality of the boards, which compare favorably with those Polaroid makes in Mexico and China. In a separate plant near Moscow, Polaroid assembles 60,000 instant cameras a year and sells them all in the former Soviet republics.
But Mr. Marquart knows that Polaroid alone cannot save Signal, let alone Obninsk. "With the drop in building nuclear power plants, Signal's business has suffered badly," he said. "Any project that keeps 120 people employed full-time is very helpful to them."
The breakdown of Soviet manufacturing has been magnified in the once-pampered military industry, which accounted for at least 60 percent of Soviet industrial production and was the backbone of the Soviet claim to be a modern superpower. Military factories had more intricate and hierarchical ties among themselves than their purely civilian counterparts, and they retain an even more distorted notion of the market.
 
Cutting Back
Capital Is Needed As Jobs Are Lost
 In Novosibirsk, a city of 1.5 million people in Siberia, 1,900 miles from Moscow, nearly 80 percent of industry has been tied to the military. At the Oxide factory, which makes capacitors, 70 percent of production was military, mostly for anti-tank weapons. Suddenly it is only 5 percent of current production, which is also down, said Oxide's director, Ivan S. Anichkin, who is furious about the cuts.
The 5,000-member work force has been cut in half. "We've tried to minimize our losses, but we have no money for research or big investments into new products," he said. "We try to get credits from this Government, but it's too expensive and short-term."
Yevgeny N. Kondratenko works for the Lenin Instrument Factory in Novosibirsk, designing optics. "The generals make sure they get good salaries for themselves," he said, using the workers' word for the bosses of these military enterprises. "But there's very little work. We do something. We're just polishing instruments now. We need new inventions or modernization, and that takes capital."
Salaries have been delayed up to three months, he said.
Galina Kondratenko, his wife, broke in to say: "Can you imagine? Three months! How hard that is for the families!"
Mikhail B. Podolsky, who worked on conversion as a designer for the huge Chkalov Aircraft Enterprise, which makes Sukhoi fighters, said that at first, "people didn't take conversion seriously."
 
Finally 'It Wasn't a Joke'
 "It all seemed very far from us, just another crazy idea from Moscow," he said. "Then they stopped buying our airplanes, and it wasn't a joke."
Chkalov, which employs about 100,000 people in 50 different shops, always made some consumer goods, from lounge chairs to small boats and toys. "Everything was of low quality," Mr. Podolsky said. "But there was such a deficit of consumer goods, everything sold. Today it's all different, with imported goods and competition. But only when consumers stopped buying did they think about making the products better."
At Chkalov, too, no salaries were paid for several months at a time, and traditional bonuses have disappeared.
Some factories and institutes have made real efforts to find a niche in the consumer market. Chkalov, for instance, is building a new 28-passenger civilian plane, the AN-38, for local airlines and cargo. Still, the work force there is down 30 percent, real salaries are down by the same percentage, the third shift is gone, and the second is almost idle.
 
Some Don't Try to Convert
 But many more factories, like Oxide, have not even tried to convert and have instead lobbied the Government for cheap credits, new state orders and a bigger effort to sell arms in a shrinking international marketplace.
With the huge reductions in military spending, especially in the last two years, most managers now see the writing on the wall, said Gennadi B. Kochetkov, director of the Center for Conversion and Privatization.
Russia's Committee for Defense Industries says that by far the biggest cuts in government arms spending were in 1992, when spending on arms procurement fell 68 percent compared with 1991, while spending on research and development was cut by 50 percent.
"Conversion only became real in 1992, when there were real reductions in state orders and funding," Mr. Kochetkov said. "It was only then that U.S.S.R. Inc. was really destroyed."
 
Mixed Feelings in West
 These developments both comfort Western Governments and concern them. When the Soviet military operation employed up to 7 million people at 5,000 separate sites concentrated in Russia and Ukraine, the West regarded the Soviet military-industrial complex as a nearly permanent threat.
But given the paucity of successful conversion, the West worries that some of Russia's most advanced weapons will be sold to the wrong countries or that Russia's top scientists may become more susceptible to selling their knowledge to countries like Libya, North Korea and China.
The concerns about proliferation, in particular about sales of advanced rocket engines to India, quiet submarines and civil nuclear technology to Iran and surface-to-air missiles and advanced fighters to China, have strained relations between Washington and Moscow.
Still, as the Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, testified in July to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Washington has detected "neither the sale or transfer of significant nuclear material nor the sale or transfer of the weapons themselves." And while delays in pay, deteriorating working conditions and uncertain futures are spurring some Russian scientists to emigrate, they far prefer the West.
"Washington worries about proliferation, but a lot of Western firms want to buy our technology cheaply by hiring our personnel," said Viktor M. Murogov, director of the Obninsk Institute of Physics and Power Engineering. "Rather than invest in cooperation with us, they want to buy a person and squeeze out his knowledge."
 
Making Do
Conversion Is Difficult
 Mr. Murogov's Institute, with 8,000 employees, is doing research in fast-breeder reactors, which use weapons-grade plutonium as fuel, leaving less harmful waste products with a shorter radioactive life. It has developed small reactors to power spacecraft, a technology in which America is years behind. As part of its own conversion efforts, it has identified and is exploiting a large Western market for radioactive isotopes, used in cancer diagnosis and treatment. It has also developed a sophisticated ceramic filter for milk, derived from one for nuclear coolant.
Mr. Murogov has high hopes for these products. But what interests him the most is an efficient fast-breeder reactor that will find a safe end for the world's growing stockpile of plutonium.
The institute has received 1 billion rubles in state conversion loans to develop 24 ideas for new products. The percentage of his research budget going to military work has fallen from 40 percent in 1988 to 20 percent today.
Like other directors of huge Russian enterprises, Mr. Murogov finds his business weighted down with the residue of socialism, including responsibility for the housing, recreation and health care of his employees. The institute still builds 100,000 square feet of housing each year for its workers, who get to keep the apartments even if they quit. Twenty percent of a tight budget still goes for social spending that municipalities or individuals would pay for in the West.
Mr. Murogov tries to use these perquisites to keep good people. Of the 6,000 scientists who work for him, about 500 are top scholars, he said, and about 60 or 70 are elite specialists. "Even for them, the scientific backbone of this place, the salary level today is much lower than comfort level," Mr. Murogov said. The average monthly salary is 45,000 rubles, about $40; top specialists make between 80,000 and 100,000 rubles a month, less than $100.
The problems of Mr. Murogov's institute are written larger at factories run by less sophisticated managers.
One of these is the Malyshev tank factory in Kharkiv, in Ukraine, which has had no orders for tanks since March 1992 and which turned to making motorcycles instead. It also makes fire engines for oil fires out of tanks, by putting a water cannon and big hose where the gun turret would normally be and painting it red. Malyshev has not found its market yet, though. It is losing money on its civilian products and is being kept afloat by cheap state credits.
The Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, described the travails of Severodvinsk, due north of Moscow near the Barents Sea. "It's a one-company town," he said. "They have a 30,000 work force. They produce atomic-powered submarines, but they're not needed any longer. What is to be done about the town? What sort of market will save it? Does anyone have a solution? No. You may haul me over the coals about it, but it takes time and immense investments to change anything, to convert the plant to new product lines."
Many other factories are even in a worse situation because they made components for end products they never saw. "There are plants in the middle of nowhere with settlements around them, but the plant produces nothing finished, only a half-fabricated something that it supplies to some other settlement," Mr. Kochetkov said. "Now they're faced with a free market and find they have nothing to sell, and no very good ideas about what to make or how to find new investment with which to make it."
The Soviet Union simply remained an industrial economy on the 19th-century model for too long, Mr. Kochetkov said, even in the vaunted military sector. "Obviously we need to move to a post-industrial society."
Managers must learn to do what centralized ministries did for them -- to make decisions. "That's the real conversion," he said.
 
Gearing Up
How Much Will Be Saved?
 In the face of all these difficulties, Andrei A. Kokoshin, the First Deputy Defense Minister, has been working to identify the factories and institutes that will constitute the core of the military-industrial complex. These would get priority in state financing or simply remain state-owned.
In an interview, he singled out the continued development of strategic nuclear forces, electronic surveillance and world-class and salable technologies. It is important, he said, to identify military manufacturers able to sell their products abroad for hard currency, as a way to help finance conversion programs for less vital enterprises.
"One of the prime objectives of the Defense Ministry," he said, "is to make sure that in the long run Russia will maintain its proper place in the international hierarchy of arms manufacturers."
Mr. Trifonov, of the Committee for Defense Industries, also emphasized the state's role in organizing conversion and financing it through arms sales. Only some 110 factories and 600 research institutes and design bureaus will remain completely state-owned, he said, but they will be integrated better. The rest of more than 2,000 key military-industrial enterprises will be turned into shareholding companies in which the state will probably retain a voting majority of shares, but some will also be privatized. Through June, however, only 111 such enterprises had been privatized.
"We cannot experiment with the economy as an academic exercise, as if we were sticking a frog with an electrode and watching it jerk around without any special feeling for the creature," Mr. Trifonov said. "We don't need any more illusions; we've been fed enough of those all our lives."
 
Arms Sales an Illusion
 But the idea of increased arms sales to pay for conversion is another illusion. In 1992, Russia sold only $1.3 billion in arms, according to the Congressional Research Service, or $2.7 billion according to Mr. Kokoshin. Even doubled, that barely begins to pay the costs of conversion for an estimated 15,000 military-related industries.
While conversion in general has so far been a failure, there have been some successes. In St. Petersburg, Impuls, which makes military communications, is producing microwave ovens; in Podolsk, they stopped making rifles and concentrate on sewing machines.
The Kazan Helicopter Manufacturing Association is stressing overseas civilian sales and international air-certification. The association makes durable MI-8 and MI-17 helicopters and is developing the MI-38, which will lift a payload of six tons. It has added 345 workers to its more than 10,000 employees, and now has its own marketing department.
The Tula Shtamp factory, which made shells for salvo systems like the Grad rocket launcher, is producing samovars, fire extinguishers, radiators, grills and gas stoves.
"In almost every case," Mr. Trifonov said, "there is something for these factories to do. Of course, it's usually simpler than before. But a factory that made space vehicles can still take pride in making surgical tools precisely and well."
But Russia is a long way from having a real market. Most companies still are producing what they can, rather than what consumers -- Russian or otherwise -- might want or buy. Peter Almquist, a military-industry specialist, has said conversion thus remains "technology push" rather than "demand pull."
 
Exodus to Private Industry
 With the difficulty of profitable conversion and the strong probability that the Russian military sector will continue to shrink, more and more young scientists and engineers are leaving for private industry. Ivan P. Matveyenko, the chief of the Obninsk institute's experimental nuclear laboratory, said he had lost 20 percent of his scientists, half of them young, because of low salaries. "Half of them I don't mind losing," he said. "But to lose the other half is a problem. They're some of our brightest."
He himself, one of the top scientists in the country, makes $100 a month. "Ridiculous, isn't it?" he said.
But what may be bad for the military sector is likely to benefit the civilian one, as some of the most enterprising managers, scientists and workers move to the regular economy. Such spontaneous conversion is likely to hasten the collapse of the Russian military industry, shorn of its special status, much of its financing and, perhaps most important, its traditional priority access to resources at state subsidized prices.
The result, Mr. Almquist suggested, is likely to be "a significantly smaller Russian defense industry" of perhaps one-third its former size and devoted almost exclusively to military production, with an important focus on hard-currency exports. The rest of the military sector, stripped of its best parts by market-minded managers, will either go bankrupt or turn to civilian products.
Two years ago, Mr. Kochetkov said, most managers of military enterprises said they could not possibly degrade their talents and start making spoons and knives. "But now they realize they need the market," he said. "Now they say, 'We'll make anything -- just give us some orders.' "

HEADLINE: U.N. Agency Finds No Assurance On North Korean Atomic Program

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency declared for the first time today that there was no longer any "meaningful assurance" that North Korea was using its nuclear materials solely for peaceful purposes, adding pressure on the Clinton Administration to reach a diplomatic accord with the North in the next several weeks or move to economic sanctions.
At the opening of a meeting of the agency's board of governors in Vienna, Hans Blix, the agency's director general, stopped just short of saying that the inspection process had totally broken down because of the North's refusal to allow regular inspections. But his aides made it clear that he was ready to make such a declaration by the end of the month, a step that officials in Washington and Seoul have said would mean sanctions. 
 Mr. Blix's comments came as the Communist Government in Pyongyang accused the Clinton Adminstration and the director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, of "intending to push the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war." The statement, monitored in Tokyo, was apparently in response to comments Mr. Woolsey made on Tuesday that the North Korean Government might not be bluffing when it says it would go to war rather than bend to Western pressure on opening its nuclear plants.
 
Declaration Delayed
 Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency have said in recent days that Mr. Blix, under some pressure from Washington, Tokyo and Seoul, is postponing a formal declaration that the agency can no longer track nuclear material in North Korea. The delay is intended to give the Administration a few more weeks to seek a diplomatic solution.
"We are really walking the precipice," an agency official said today. "We want to give the political process one more chance, though."
As recently as Wednesday, North Korea's first Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kang Sok Ju, sent a message to Mr. Blix assuring him that North Korea "totally froze the movement of nuclear material" some time ago, and that "the inspection cameras and seals of the I.A.E.A. remain on the nuclear facilities of our new country."
But Mr. Blix said today that "in the absence of verification, such statements offer little assurance."
In the message, Mr. Kang offered to allow inspectors to visit North Korea for the limited purpose of installing new batteries and film in surveillance cameras. But Mr. Blix rejected a similar proposal a month ago, saying that the inspectors must have the freedom to roam and seek evidence of diversions of material to weapons projects.
Virtually all of the cameras and other suveillance equipment installed at the nuclear site at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of the North Korean capital, have now run out of film and battery power, making it possible for North Korea to slip material past the cameras.
 
Trying for More Time
 A senior South Korean official, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that his country was trying to lower the political heat so that North Korea did not feel trapped. "We are trying to get some more time," he said.
Mr. Blix has repeatedly said that inspection is a "process" that worsens gradually, the longer that inspectors are kept at bay. Today he said that the inspection system could be "fully or partially restored, if cooperation were forthcoming" from the North Koreans.
If the North is pursuing an agreement, however, it is hardly obvious in its public comments. In recent days the Government, in statements monitored in Tokyo, has denounced the United States and warned that it was ready to face sanctions or war rather than back down.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
President Expresses Hope
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Clinton expressed hope today that North Korea would "crawl back off this ledge they are on" in refusing to permit inspection of their nuclear installations. But he said a buildup of American military forces remained an strategy he could still employ to counter moves by the North.
In a series of interiews, Mr. Clinton expressed deep frustration about North Korea's instransigence. He also sought to allay concerns that the United States might be moving toward an imminent military confrontation.
But with the Pentagon weighing options to strengthen United States and South Korean forces if the standoff turns more tense, Mr. Clinton told NBC News in an interview tonight that he would not exclude the possibility of dispatching American reinforcements.

HEADLINE: Russia Election: Some Rah-Rah, No Sis-Boom-Bah

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Russia's precipitate election campaign entered its home stretch today with blocs led by two old-time reform rivals leading the pack, but with a large clump of voters still undecided or altogether uninterested.
Today was the last day that public-opinion polls could be published before the Dec. 12 election for a new Parliament, and they showed that Russia's Choice, led by Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and tacitly backed by President Boris N. Yeltsin, still holds a commanding lead. 
 But they also showed Mr. Gaidar's strongest rival to be a bloc led by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a pioneering economic reformer who shares most of Mr. Gaidar's goals but has been excluded from Mr. Yeltsin's Government since the Soviet Union fell apart. One of Mr. Yavlinsky's running mates is Vladimir P. Lukin, the Russian Ambassador to Washington.
 
The Ins vs. the Outs
 The difference between the two blocs is largely one of personality, plus the fact that Mr. Gaidar, 37, and many other Russia's Choice candidates are government officials, while Mr. Yavlinsky, 41, is the critical outsider.
Mr. Yavlinsky first came to notice as the co-author of the "500-Day Plan" of radical economic reforms that he prepared in 1990 for Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was then the Soviet President and who eventually shelved it. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Yeltsin bypassed Mr. Yavlinsky and tapped Mr. Gaidar as his chief economic adviser.
Whatever their personal differences, the two men's strength in the polls pointed to a Parliament in which deputies supporting fundamental economic change should have a solid block of seats. But there is no telling whether the former rivals will join forces or whether they will be able to mount a working majority.
Mr. Yavlinsky has said he will join with Mr. Gaidar, but only if Mr. Gaidar "acknowledged his mistakes." Mr. Yavlinsky has also publicly declared his candidacy for president, once an election is set.
 
The 5 Percent Hurdle
 Only two other parties or blocs seem poised to clear the 5 percent threshold to gain seats in the State Duma, the lower house of the Federal Assembly. They are the Russian Communist Party and the Democratic Party of Russia, the latter a centrist organization led by a charismatic former construction boss named Nikolai I. Travkin.
A cluster of other groups, including Women of Russia and two reformist blocs, seem to be just below the 5 percent threshold and could clear it.
Under the election rules, half the 450 seats in the lower house will be filled by parties that receive more than 5 percent of the vote; the other half will be deputies elected individually across the Russian Federation. The upper house, the Federation Council, will be composed of two deputies elected in each of the 88 constituent regions.
According to figures compiled by the newspaper Segodnya, if current poll ratings were translated into seats, Mr. Gaidar's bloc would get 102 and Mr. Yavlinsky's 71, followed by 26 each for the Communists and the Democratic Party. But the leanings of the other 225 deputies will not become known until the lower house meets, and experience has showed that deputies elected locally are likely to be conservative.
 
An Improvised Air
 Of 3,333 candidates seeking seats in the lower house, 57 percent come from government structures of one kind or another, 15.5 percent are lawyers or entrepreneurs and 6 percent were deputies in the disbanded Congress.
Even the major blocs are for the most part hastily convened alliances, not political parties in the Western sense. Once elected, deputies are certain to regroup into new alliances.
The most authoritative poll, by the Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion, found that 26.3 percent of voters are still undecided and 12.3 percent do not intend to vote.
Many commentators and politicians expressed concern about apathy, especially for the new constitution. Under the rules, at least half of the 106 million registered voters must cast ballots for the constitution to ratify it.
In any case, many Russians seemed taken aback by their first exposure to a real bare-knuckle campaign, replete with catchy slogans, image manipulation, grappling for television time, lavish promises and even dirty tricks.
By American standards it is fairly primitive stuff. Many candidates use government-allocated television time simply to read long statements into a bare microphone. Arguing against private land ownership, for example, a candidate from the conservative Agrarian bloc described how fishermen would suddenly find their fishing grounds surrounded by fencing and -- worse -- owned by a foreigner.
Even the more sophisticated efforts to shape an image often seem crude. This evening Konstantin Zatulin, a businessman running in Deputy Prime Minister Sergei M. Shakhrai's Party of Russian Unity and Accord, interspersed his monologue on television with shots of himself praying in church or dancing with Cossacks.
Nonetheless, for the first time in Russia's tortuous political history, candidates were demonstrating an appreciation of the power of television and image.
 
Polishing Images
 Posters of Mr. Gaidar showed him in a pensive pose over the legend: "Others talk about it. He does it." Mr. Yavlinsky, for his part, combined his name and those of his top running mates into the acronym "Yabloko," Russian for apple, and learned to tame his unruly hair and to slow his speech for the cameras.
Though Russians have voted many times now, previous ballots have been either staid ideological affairs or skirmishes in a bigger power struggle, with little real campaigning. This has been the first election in which rival blocs and parties have taken their messages to the nation.
But most candidates agree that this is not yet a full-fledged democratic election.
For one thing, it was called by President Yeltsin in September when he disbanded -- ultimately with tanks -- the Congress of People's Deputies, a cumbersome and conservative mass of 1,000 representatives left over from Soviet days. The new Federal Assembly was designed by decree, and Mr. Yeltsin limited it to a two-year term.
The legislature, moreover, is being elected at the same time that the electorate is being asked to endorse the constitution under which it will work. The constitution itself has become an issue in the campaign, especially after several candidates sharply attacked it on television.
Aides to Mr. Yeltsin bridled at the attacks. Earlier this week the Press Minister, Vladimir F. Shumeiko, actually urged that two parties be banned for campaigning against the draft. The request was quickly rejected by the election commission.
Mr. Yeltsin himself has generally stayed out of the campaign, but he quickly let it be known that he would fight for the constitution.
"It is unpleasant that certain of you have started criticizing the constitution," he warned leaders of major blocs at a meeting in the Kremlin. "I have to warn you that free air time will be turned off if you stray from the theme, and your theme is your campaign program. We will fight for the constitution. I ask that you not touch it."
Beyond that, Mr. Yeltsin has positioned himself above the fray, though his backing for Russia's Choice, which groups many of his top ministers and lieutenants, is obvious.
 
Yeltsin's Low Profile
 Some politicians, including several close to Mr. Yeltsin, have criticized his aloofness and his failure in two and a half years as President to form a party. But "party" is still a word that connotes the Communist tyranny to many Russians, and they still seem to expect their President to be at least nominally "above politics."
The haste with which Mr. Yeltsin called the election has been repeatedly evident. It was only this week, for example, that the President announced where the new Parliament would sit.
The lower house, he said, will be in the former East European Economic Community high-rise adjacent to the White House, which was the headquarters of the Congress; the upper chamber would be in the House of the Russian Press, a contemporary building several miles away.
One of the first tasks of the new Parliament will be to finally retire the venerable hammer and sickle, which the former Congress refused to abandon as the state badge. Mr. Yeltsin has proposed a revival of the Imperial Russian double-headed eagle, replete with three crowns, orb and scepter.

HEADLINE: 5 Die in Gunman's Rampage in 2 California Cities

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OXNARD, Calif., Dec. 2

 BODY:
A man with a shotgun and pistol opened fire without warning today in a state unemployment office here, killing three people and wounding four others. He then shot dead a police officer who was pursuing him in traffic, before being killed by the police in a fusillade outside a second unemployment office.
About 50 people, including women and children, were in the unemployment office in this city 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles about 11:40 this morning when the gunman walked in with his weapons concealed in a brown bag, said David Keith, a spokesman for the Oxnard Police Department. 
 Oxnard police identified the gunman as Alan Winterbourne, a 33-year-old computer science graduate who had been unemployed for at least five years and who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in the 1990 Republican primary.
Liz Smith, a woman who was in the office at the time, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that the gunman had rested his gun on a counter and opened fire without warning. "There was no argument; not one word did he say," she said.
 
Singled Out Employees
 She said Mr. Winterbourne appeared to single out employees of the office and to avoid clients. All three of the dead and all but one of the wounded were employees, Mr. Keith said.
The gunman apparently made no statements and left no notes, and the authorities said tonight that they knew of no motive for the shootings.
One of the wounded, who was not identified, remained in grave condition tonight, said Rita Lowery, a spokeswoman for the Ventura County Medical Center in the city of Ventura.
After the shootings, Mr. Winterbourne fled but became trapped in traffic, at which point he left his car and fatally shot a pursuing officer, James O'Brien, with a shotgun, Mr. Keith said. He then drove to the unemployment office in neighboring Ventura, where he again left his car, shotgun in hand, and was shot to death by officers.
A political gadfly, Mr. Winterbourne had received 14.4 percent of the vote in the 1990 Republican Congressional primary. He was defeated by the incumbent, Representative Robert J. Lagamarsino, in the state's 19th Congressional district.
A woman who answered the telephone at the address Mr. Winterbourne gave when he registered as a political candidate said, "We have nothing to say at this time," and hung up.
 
Man of Many Petitions
 An unidentified neighbor told KNBC-TV news that Mr. Winterbourne was "real quiet and very political, and he always has had petitions going.
"There was one going for Earth Day," the neighbor said, "and one for a stop sign, and one for different organizations that he was speaking up for. He had a petition for almost everything."
The gunman's mother, Ila Winterbourne, appeared outside her home with a friend, Tom Olson, who read a statement on behalf the family, which includes a married sister and a nephew.
"They're devastated by the tragedy," Mr. Olson was quoted by The A.P. as saying. "None of them saw this coming. They're grieving for Alan as well as for the families of those who died and were wounded."
Dave Hall, the pastor of Trinity Lutheran Church, described Mr. Winterbourne was "a gentle man" and a pacifist who was active in charities.
The A.P. identified the dead as Richard Bateman, 65, of Ventura, who worked with an agency associated with the unemployment office; Phillip Villegas, 43, of Oxnard, an office supervisor; and a worker, Anna Velasco, 42, of Fillmore.
Among the wounded was Irma Lopez, 47, a supervisor at the unemployment office and the wife of the Mayor of Oxnard, Manuel Lopez.

HEADLINE: Morita, Sony Founder, Hospitalized

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Akio Morita, co-founder and chairman of the Sony Corporation and the leading statesman of Japan's business community, has suffered a cerebral hemorrhage that will force his withdrawal, at least temporarily, from company activities and from his increasingly prominent role as soother of trade tensions between the United States and Japan.
Sony officials said today that Mr. Morita had been taken to a Tokyo hospital Tuesday morning after feeling ill while playing tennis. His condition was diagnosed, and he underwent immediate surgery to remove blood from his brain. 
 The four-hour operation went well, and "his recovery is quite satisfactory," Tsunao Hashimoto, a deputy executive president at Sony, said at a hastily called news conference this afternoon. But he said it was too early to say when, or if, Mr. Morita could resume his business activities.
What was left unsaid is that it seems probable that the 72-year-old executive will be out for several months at least. Rumors were flying in the business world here that Mr. Morita, who built Sony into one of the world's most innovative companies, would have to retire.
 
Unable to Speak
 Mr. Hashimoto said there was no indication yet that Mr. Morita would step down. He said Mr. Morita, who is in intensive care, had not been able to speak, but could respond to his name by squeezing someone's hand.
Sony officials and analysts said that Mr. Morita had not been actively involved in day-to-day operations at Sony since 1989, when he became chairman and passed the presidency to Norio Ohga. For that reason, they said, there would be little immediate impact on the company. Sony's stock rose 70 yen today to 4,930 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. On the New York Stock Exchange, where Sony stock trades in the form of American Depository Receipts, the issue closed up 12.5 cents at $45.125.
Still, Mr. Morita is what Mr. Hashimoto called the "psychological backbone" of Sony. And his absence comes as the giant company, with $34 billion in sales last year, is facing one of its toughest periods since he and a technical genius, Masaru Ibuka, started it in a bombed-out Tokyo department store in 1946.
Like other Japanese electronics companies, Sony is hurt by Japan's recession, the strength of the yen, which makes exporting more difficult, and a lack of hit products. And Mr. Ohga turns 64 next month, so it might not be too many years before the company undergoes another management transition.
Mr. Morita is also likely to be missed in the broader business and political arena, where he has been outspoken in urging Japanese businesses to cease some practices that are viewed as unfair in the West, and where his international outlook has helped calm relations between Japan and its trading partners.
 
A Business Statesman
 "He's been the leading Japanese business statesman on the world stage, and his inability to play that role will be a serious loss to Japan at one of the most critical times in its history," Norman P. Neureiter, director of Texas Instruments Japan Ltd., said.
Mr. Morita is the co-chairman of the U.S.-Japan Business Council, a group of executives from both sides of the Pacific that works to solve trade problems. He has also been considered a leading candidate to become chairman of Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business lobbying organization, when the current chairman, Gaishi Hiraiwa, retires next spring.
Mr. Ohga, Sony's president, met with Mr. Hiraiwa, this morning and said that Mr. Morita would be out for at least a month, according to Hideo Takahashi, an official in the secretary's division of Keidanren. Mr. Takahashi said Mr. Hiraiwa might delay naming his successor until more was known of Mr. Morita's condition.
Mr. Morita would be a somewhat unusual choice for Keidanren because he is still viewed by the Japanese business establishment as something of a maverick. Indeed, Mr. Morita, who is no doubt the most famous Japanese businessman outside of Japan, is more highly regarded abroad than in his home country.
 
A Two-Day Delay
 Sony officials waited two days after Mr. Morita's surgery to make the news public and spoke only after reports starting leaking into the press. Early reports said Mr. Morita had been hospitalized with a cold.
Mr. Hashimoto and other executives said the company wanted to wait until 48 hours after the operation in order to get a better sense of Mr. Morita's condition. They also said they wanted to inform Keidanren first. Others cited the wishes of Mr. Morita's family.
Sony officials said Mr. Morita maintained an active schedule and had shown no signs of problems before Tuesday. He had made eight trips abroad this year, including a three-and-a-half-week visit to the United States and Europe in October.
He played tennis about once a week at 7 A.M., and during one of these matches Tuesday morning he felt somewhat ill. He went home, and when he did not feel better was taken by ambulance to the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital.
Under Mr. Morita, Sony achieved a reputation for marketing flair and consistent innovation, bringing out such products as the Trinitron television, the Walkman, the first consumer videocassette recorder and the compact disk. Mr. Morita has recently been urging the company to stick to developing new products to escape from its slump, Nobuyuki Idei, a Sony director, said.

HEADLINE: Japan Aide Ousted; He'd Criticized Arms Role

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 2

 BODY:
In a setback for the Japanese Government, the Defense Minister was forced to resign tonight after declaring that Japan's constitutional limitations on the use of military force are out of date and urging passage of an amendment to permit full participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The resignation of Keisuke Nakanishi, the 52-year-old director general of Japan's Self-Defense Agency, underscores the intensity of the disagreements within the Government over Japan's expanding international role, especially at a time when the country is seeking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. 
 But it also reflects the fragility of the coalition Government headed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Mr. Hosokawa, while declining to say whether he agreed with his Defense Minister or not, accepted the resignation when it became clear an argument over Mr. Nakanishi's comments could rip apart the coalition and derail his efforts to pass a political reform bill and an economic stimulus package.
Mr. Nakanishi is the first member of Mr. Hosokawa's Cabinet to be forced out of office. His offense lay in explicitly stating an opinion that is widely held, but seldom voiced, among conservative politicians in the Government and in the Liberal Democratic Party, which was forced out of office this year.
Mr. Nakanishi, in making his comments on Wednesday, said he was speakihg because "the environment has changed" and the topic was now open for discussion. That turned out to be a faulty assumption.
By American political standards, Mr. Nakanishi's comments would seem almost innocuous. At a reception on Wednesday night for members of his political party, the Shinseito, who led the rebellion that ousted the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Nakanishi suggested that the Constitution should explicitly permit Japanese participation in peacekeeping operations.
"I cannot help but think that it is inappropriate to cling with tremendous zeal to a Constitution written half a century ago," he told the group. "While we respect the spirit of the peace Constitution," he said, it must be reformed to "respond to reality."
Mr. Nakanishi was referring to Article 9 of the Constitution that was drafted by Gen. Douglas MacArthur when he commanded the American occupation forces in Japan. It declares that "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of a nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes."
After more than a year of fierce argument, Japan passed legislation last year permitting the dispatch of peacekeeping troops under strict conditions, including prohibitions on engaging in any activity likely to get them involved in combat. The law was used to send 600 peacekeepers to Cambodia earlier this year, the first deployment of Japanese troops outside the country since World War II.
The Defense Minister was hardly the first Cabinet minister to express such views. In January, when the Liberal Democrats were in power, the Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, gave a series of speeches on the need for Japan's troops to take on a new role to "maintain global peace and order under the leadership of the United Nations." Breaking a four-decade taboo against discussing the topic, Mr. Watanabe called for a constitutional amendment.
After Mr. Nakanishi's remarks onWednesday night, the Socialists, who are members of the coalition but who have fiercely opposed any expansion of Japan's military role, immediately called for Mr. Nakanishi's resignation. Tomiichi Murayama, the head of the party, said the Socialists had extracted an agreement from Mr. Hosokawa not to bring up the divisive subject of constitutional revision.
Members of the Liberal Democratic Party, seizing the opportunity to embarrass Mr. Hosokawa, soon joined in and brought parliamentary debate on other matters to a halt. They charged that Mr. Nakanishi could not uphold the Japanese Constitution while disagreeing with its provisions. By early evening the coalition membership decided to oust Mr. Nakanishi rather than risk further delays that could threaten their legislative agenda.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Times Mirror President Is Resigning

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The president of the Times Mirror Company and publisher of The Los Angeles Times, its flagship newspaper, will step down Jan. 1 because he is suffering from Parkinson's disease, the company announced today.
David Laventhol, 60, will be succeeded as publisher of The Times by Richard T. Schlosberg 3d, 49, a Times Mirror senior vice president who was responsible for the media company's Eastern dailies. 
 Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive of Times Mirror, will assume Mr. Laventhol's duties as president of Times Mirror.
 
 
New Position
 Mr. Laventhol was given the new position of Times Mirror editor at large, where he will work with the company's editors and executives on editorial content and news matters, particularly at the newspapers, the company said in a news release.
Telephone calls to Times Mirror officials seeking comment after the announcement here late this afternoon were not returned.
Mr. Laventhol's departure comes at a time when The Los Angeles Times is struggling to recover from a persistent advertising slump that has caused the paper to undertake job reductions and other measures to cut costs.
In the last year, The Los Angeles Times has pursued three employee reduction programs, ceased publishing its San Diego edition, and recently announced that it was seeking to sell its downtown Los Angeles headquarters, known as Times Mirror Square.
Some executives at The Los Angeles Times, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the medication that Mr. Laventhol takes causes him great fatigue and that he could not continue the duties of publisher. But some high-level editors at the paper suggested that the Times Mirror board was dissatisfied with Mr. Laventhol's performance and had replaced him.
Craig Silvers, an analyst who follows Times Mirror for Crowell, Weedon, said that Mr. Laventhol's departure was a surprise, but he praised the outgoing publisher for taking "the necessary steps to keep the paper afloat" during the recession.
Mr. Silvers said that Mr. Schlosberg was known as a "sharp operations man" and that his main challenge would be to keep the paper "treading water " and "to maintain adequate staffing levels."
Mr. Laventhol had been president of Times Mirror since 1987. He was editor of Newsday, the Times Mirror's daily based in Melville, L.I., from 1970 to 1978 and served as publisher of Newsday from 1978 to 1987. He previously worked at The Washington Post.
Mr. Laventhol was named publisher and chief executive of The Times in 1989, replacing W. Thomas Johnson Jr.
"Dave asked for the change for health reasons," Mr. Erburu said in a statement. "In his 23 years with the company, he has been a major contributor to the successful growth of Times Mirror. In his new role, we will continue to benefit from his skill and experience."
In a statement posted on The Times employee bulletin board, Mr. Laventhol said, "We have succeeded in countering the advertising decline with strong efforts on the cost side that have increased productivity and efficiency while protecting our core market and avoiding layoffs of full-time employees."
 
 
Poor Financial Performance
 During Mr. Laventhol's tenure, The Times expanded its reporting locally and internationally, introducing new editions and sections in the suburbs and the inner city and for Hispanic readers. But many of those successes were overshadowed by the paper's poor financial performance lately.
The company reported a 1992 loss of $66.6 million, with huge special charges for costs including staff cuts at The Times and Newsday.
Mr. Schlosberg, who becomes the seventh publisher of The Times, joined Times Mirror in 1983 as publisher and chief executive of The Denver Post. In 1988, he was named president of The Times, and in 1990 he became group vice president, newspapers, responsible for Times Mirror's five Eastern newspaper companies and chairman of Times Mirror newspaper management committee. In March 1993, Mr. Schlosberg was named senior vice president.
Before joining The Times, Mr. Schlosberg held executive positions with Harte-Hanks Newspaper Operations and newspaper companies in Corpus Christi, Tex., and Anderson, S.C. He is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and received an M.B.A. from Harvard University.

HEADLINE: A NEW U.S. STANCE ON ATOMIC WASTES

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The Secretary of Energy said today that her department had a "moral obligation" to help electric utilities store spent fuel from nuclear reactors, even though the department could not keep its promise to take the fuel off their hands beginning in 1998.
In a sharp turnaround from the Bush Administration, which denied it had any responsibility for the waste, she said her department might cover the utilities' cost for storage. 
 Under contracts signed in the 1980's, the Energy Department has been collecting a waste disposal fee from utility companies amounting to a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour generated in reactors. It has used about $3 billion in the search for a permanent waste repository but still has more than $4 billion on hand, and it is still collecting $600 million a month.
But no permanent repository will be ready until 2013 at the earliest, said the Energy Secretary, Hazel R. O'Leary, in an interview today. A temporary repository is possible, she said, but "we're not going to make it by 1998." The contracts call for the Government to begin pick-ups of the waste then.
 
Mostly Under Water Now
 During the Bush Administration, the Energy Department argued that the contracts did not require it to accept the wastes if it had no place to put them.
Most of the spent fuel is now stored in pools of water next to the reactor buildings, but at many plants these will be full by 1998. Water shields radiation and keeps the waste cool.
Some utilities have built "dry cask storage," concrete and steel casks sitting behind barbed wire near the reactors, and other companies have asked permission to build such casks.
But in several states, most notably Florida, Michigan and Minnesota, state public service commissions have complained that raising electric rates to cover the expense of building such structures amounts to a double charge to consumers for storage, since the companies have already paid the Energy Department.
"I don't think anybody is really pleased by that prospect," said Janice E. Owens of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, a Washington association of state officials that has been pressing the issue.
 
Paying Costs of Casks
 Mrs. O'Leary said she had directed her staff to find a mechanism by which the department could pay the cost of casks at reactor sites, beginning at the dates that the fuel would have been picked up. This might take the form of a credit against future waste fund payments, an aide said.
Mrs. Owens said another mechanism might be for the Energy Department to develop, manufacture and deliver to each reactor a container that would be used for storage for an interim period. The container would then be used for shipping the material to a permanent repository, she said, and would be the final package for the wastes.
The Energy Department is studying whether Yucca Mountain, in the desert outside Las Vegas, Nev., would be suitable as a permanent repository, but the study has been plagued with technical problems and political disputes.
Mrs. O'Leary said she was convinced that for reasons of security, safety and economy, a centralized storage site for the casks was preferable to cask storage at many different reactor sites.

HEADLINE: Costs of Depression Are on a Par With Heart Disease, a Study Says

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
The annual cost of depression in America is $43.7 billion, on a par with heart disease, according to a study made public yesterday.
About 11 million people suffer from depression in a given year, and for nearly two-thirds it goes undiagnosed and untreated, said the study, which was published in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. 
 "What's striking is that the costs of depression are comparable to those for other major diseases," said the leader of the study, Paul Greenberg, a health economist at the Analysis Group, a business consulting concern in Cambridge, Mass. "In allocating resources as a society, we should consider depression as an important health problem, too."
Dr. Frederick Goodwin, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, said that among major diseases, clinical depression ranks second only to advanced coronary heart disease in the total number of days patients spend in the hospital or disabled at home. "Major depression is far more disabling than many medical disorders, including chronic lung disease, arthritis and diabetes," he said.
 
Tipper Gore's Comment
 The study shows that health insurance for mental illness is not a luxury or a frill, said Tipper Gore, the Vice President's wife, who advises President Clinton on the issue.
The greatest source of economic burden, accounting for more than half the total, comes from depression's impact on work performance, especially among those who receive no treatment. The cost of days lost from work is about $11.7 billion, and impairment from the symptoms while people continue on the job costs $12.1 billion more.
The impairments include poor concentration and memory, indecisiveness, fatigue, apathy and a lack of self-confidence -- and, in those with mania, a grandiose, unrealistic overconfidence. All these symptoms reduce people's capacity to work; on average, for those who are well enough to work, the report estimates that depression reduces a worker's output by 20 percent.
"Depression tends to strike people in the most productive phase of life, and the most productive people," Dr. Goodwin said.
When someone is depressed on the job it can also hamper co-workers, although the report did not include the costs of this effect in the estimates.
 
Burden on Employers Cited
 The costs of depression were calculated for 1990, the most recent year for which complete data are available. In that year 290 million working days were lost because employees' depression was so severe that they could not work at all, the report estimates.
"Because depression strikes early in life and is so often ongoing, depression imposes an especially large burden on employers," said Mr. Greenberg, the health economist.
Depression costs businesses an average of $3,000 for each depressed worker, the report said. A lot of money could be saved if there were more aggressive diagnosis and treatment of depression; treating depression shortens an episode by an average of one-third, the report estimates.
Suicides are another source of costs, because of the loss of lifetime earnings. In 1990 about 15,000 men and 3,400 women in the Untied States committed suicide because of depression, at a cost of about $7.5 billion, the report says.
Psychiatric care, including hospitalization, psychotherapy and medications, totaled $12.4 billion.
 
Hidden Costs Not Counted
 Dr. Goodwin said the report did not consider such hidden costs from depression as the cost of treatment for substance abuse or other problems deriving from the depression, or the cost of unnecessary medical tests ordered by doctors who mistake depression for other diseases.
"Most depressed people present their symptoms to a nonpsychiatrist, and only one in four of these physicians accurately diagnose the problem," Dr. Goodwin said. He suggested that workplace programs "focus as much on depression as they do now on substance abuse."
The report was prepared by a team led by Mr. Greenberg and Laura Stiglin of the Analysis Group, Dr. Stan Finkelstein of the Sloan School of Management and Ernst Berndt of the National Bureau of Economic Research.
The study was based on 1990 figures for the prevalence of three kinds of depression: major, minor and manic. Symptoms of major depression are severe enough to be debilitating. In addition to sadness, the symptoms include thoughts of worthlessness or self-blame, feelings of hopelessness, confusion and indecision, loss of appetite and insomnia, agitation or lethargy.
Symptoms of mild depression include a dour mood that lasts for months or years, a loss of interest in pleasures and any of the symptoms of major depression, though not at such an incapacitating level.
Manic depression, or bipolar disorder, is marked by periods of grandiosity and elation and bad judgment and agitation alternating with periods of deep depression; at its extreme, symptoms include brief psychosis.
Of the nearly 11 million Americans who suffered from depression in 1990, more than 5 million had major depression, about 1.8 million had bipolar disorder and about 4.1 million had mild depression, the report said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Panel Has Grim View Of Fiscal Gaps

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Sketching a grim portrait of New York City's fiscal condition, a panel appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins reported yesterday that the city's long-term budget problems were more severe than previously estimated.
The committee also outlined what it called a "menu" of Draconian and politically unpalatable measures -- including layoffs of city workers, fees for residential garbage collection, postponing of planned hiring of police officers, increases in the sales tax and in property taxes for single-family homeowners, and putting tolls on more East River bridges -- from which city officials could choose to achieve long-term budget balance. 
 "There's hardly a political third rail that we haven't touched," said one of the committee's members, Donald D. Kummerfeld, a former first deputy mayor and budget director, who presented the report at a City Hall news conference.
 
Tax Plan Rejected
 But Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani rejected the panel's proposal for tax increases and reiterated his pledge to phase out several business taxes including the hotel tax and the commercial rent tax to spur the local economy. He has proposed to help balance future budgets by cutting the city's work force and privatizing some city services.
He said the report reflected "a great deal of the economic planning of the prior administration and the economic philosophy of the prior administration."
The panel's main finding -- that the city is suffering from a fundamental imbalance, with the growth in expenditures far outstripping the growth in revenues -- was not new, nor were most of its recommendations.
But the bleakness of its analysis, combined with the specificity of its proposed solutions and the independent standing of its members, gave weight to the report, allowing it to serve as a kind of kickoff to the intense budget debate that will undoubtedly begin when Mr. Giuliani takes office next month.
The essential message of the 19-page report was that the city could no longer balance the budget each year with stopgap measures, as it has during the last four years of recession. Fundamental changes will be necessary, Mr. Kummerfeld said, or the city will eventually reach "a fiscal collision," leading to deficits, downgradings by bond-rating agencies and a state takeover of the city's finances.
"The economy isn't going to bail us out, unfortunately," Mr. Kummerfeld said, "and now we have to do these very tough things."
"The city is going to have to change the way it does business," he said at another point. "It's going to take leadership, it's going to take persistence, and it will hurt."
Mr. Dinkins was careful not to endorse any of the committee's specific proposals, saying it would be up to Mr. Giuliani to decide how to close the coming budget gaps. "I'm confident that Mr. Giuliani and his people will find this useful," the Mayor said of the report.
 
Underlying Imbalance
 The panel also included Dall W. Forsythe, a former state budget director, and William H. Gray 3d, a former Congressman who was chairman of the House Budget Committee. The panel was created by Mr. Dinkins in May, when he was under pressure from members of the State Financial Control Board and other fiscal experts, who contended that the Mayor had failed to confront the city's underlying budget imbalance. Mr. Dinkins asked the panel to propose ways to reach structural balance by saving about $2 billion a year through spending cuts and additional revenues. The city's budget this year is $31 billion.
The committee was scheduled to report to Mr. Dinkins on Dec. 1, a month after the mayoral election, which enabled the Mayor to avoid discussions of difficult budget decisions during the election campaign. The panel came to two initial determinations, deciding that the city's own estimates of future budget gaps were too low and concluding that there were very few city services that could simply be eliminated to help close those gaps.
Mr. Dinkins's budget office estimates that there will be a potential shortfall of $1.7 billion in the next fiscal year, which begins next July, and potential gaps of $2.5 billion, $2.7 billion and $3 billion in the following fiscal years.
But Mr. Kummerfeld's panel concluded that city officials were too confident about receiving certain state and Federal aid, and they calculated higher gaps than the Dinkins administration did. The committee estimated a shortfall of $2 billion in the next fiscal year, with gaps of $3.2 billion, $4.2 billion and $5 billion in succeeding years.
 
A Host of Remedies
 To prevent these shortfalls, the panel proposed a host of remedies, nearly all of which would involve sacrifice and virtually all of which would be politically difficult to achieve.
These were among several dozen recommendations on how the city could save money:
*Cutting the city work force, now about 214,000 people, to 185,000 -- a 14 percent reduction.
*Including teachers and police officers, who have been exempted from previous budget cutting, in the labor reductions.
*Eliminating city subsidies for day care and for private bus routes.
*Charging fees for residential garbage collection.
*Reducing city subsidies to municipal hospitals.
*Eliminating rent regulations and ending most city spending on housing construction.
The cuts in the city's labor force proposed by the panel are somewhat similar to those proposed during the mayoral campaign by Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani, who wants to trim the work force to 180,000, contends that it can be done through attrition and that city services do not have to be compromised if the remaining workers are more efficient.
 
Changes in Work Rules
 But the Kummerfeld panel asserted that layoffs would be unavoidable, in part because city managers must decide which jobs are to be eliminated. The group also determined that city managers will need much more flexibility -- changes in work rules, Civil Service regulations and contractual agreements -- to make the remaining workers more productive and to maintain services.
The committee acknowledged that some city services would suffer, but it also decided that there were few that realistically could be eliminated.
Mr. Kummerfeld and his colleagues on the panel said that even if the city took most of the budget-cutting actions that they recommended -- many of which would require approval by the City Council, the State Legislature and labor leaders -- the city would still have to raise some taxes and impose new fees to balance the budget over the next few years.
The committee recommended no changes in most corporate and commercial taxes because it said increases in those taxes could drive more companies from New York. But it proposed an extension of the surcharge on the personal income tax, which averages about five-tenths of 1 percent; an increase of one-quarter of 1 percent in the city sales tax, now 4 percent, and unspecified higher property taxes for one- and two-family homeowners, who, the report said, "do not pay their fair share of the property tax."
In a proposal likely to arouse much criticism, the panel also suggested that the city cancel plans to hire 1,175 new police officers in February, as it obligated to under the state law that created Mr. Dinkins's Safe Streets, Safe City program. The group also suggested having more patrol cars with only one officer, instead of two.

HEADLINE: Lilco Seeking A Rate Freeze In '95 and '96

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 2

 BODY:
The Long Island Lighting Company said today that it would seek to freeze its rates for 1995 and 1996, a sharp departure from the increases that were anticipated as part of its agreement with the state to close the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station.
Since that 10-year settlement was reached in 1989, the base electric rate here has gone up about 4 to 5 percent each year to allow Lilco to repay the $5.6 billion debt incurred in building the plant. Long Islanders have some of the highest electric bills in the nation, and utility costs have become one of the area's most pressing economic concerns. 
 Business leaders hailed Lilco's decision today.
"This is very significant news for the economic well-being of Long Island," said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, the area's largest business group. "If the Public Service Commission grants Lilco's request, we will receive critical and well-timed assistance in our effort to keep Long Island competitive with other regions of the country."
 
4 Percent Rise for 1994
 Most people had expected that Lilco's base rate, which applies to both residential and commercial customers, would increase for the rest of the decade. Indeed, on Wednesday, a 4 percent increase, expected to bring Lilco an additional $85 million, went into effect for 1994.
And while Lilco's agreement with the state did not guarantee increases after the first three years, it did anticipate that such increases would be necessary.
Lilco said today that a number of conditions that were the basis for the projected increases had changed markedly. They included lower interest rates and oil costs, more purchases of cheaper power from outside Long Island and other regulatory and business considerations. Suzanne Halpin, a Lilco spokeswoman, said that a formal request for the rate freeze would be filed with the Public Service Commission later this month, and that it would include a request for a 4 percent increase in 1997.
"We want to let Long Islanders know that we can control rates and turn around the economy," Ms. Halpin said, estimating that the freeze would save Long Islanders roughly $250 million from the 5 percent increase that the utility could have requested.
While the Public Service Commission declined to comment on the request, experts said it would be extremely unusual for the panel to force a utility to raise its rates.
In some respects, Lilco's decision reflects a trend in the electric power industry. The market for electricity is becoming increasingly competitive because of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which started to deregulate the industry by making it easier for independent power producers to sell energy outside their locality.
In response, many utilities have said that that to survive in this new environment, they will have to hold the line or even cut rates. Coincidentally, this point was made by several chief executives of utilities at the "One World of Energy" conference today at Rockefeller Center, sponsored by Chase Securities Inc.
 
Competition in Whole Industry
 This view was shared by Douglas W. Preiser, an electric utilities analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company.
"This is not a Lilco-specific trend," he said. "The entire industry is facing the same sort of pressures as Lilco is, and they're all trying to do the same sort of thing to avoid entering the rate arena and ask for increases.
"It's no secret that Lilco has one of the highest rates in the country, and if you're facing a competitive environment where someday larger customers may have a choice where they can get their power, it's in your interest to stem the growth in rates to prevent your customers from seeking another alternative. Plus the economy on Long Island is not so hot, so you don't want to be seen as a big part of the problem."
But while Mr. Preiser praised the rate freeze as a smart decision, he remained skeptical that it would substantially close the gap in electric rates between Lilco and the six other electric utilities in New York State.
 
New York State's Highest
 Figures from the state's Department of Public Service showed that on July 1, 1993, Lilco charged a household that used 500 kilowatt-hours a bill of $85.56, the highest of all the state's electric utilities. Next was Consolidated Edison at $82.48, with Orange and Rockland Utilities third at $75.66. All the rest were below $62.
Still, some people were more optimistic about the impact of the freeze, and argued that even deeper cuts were possible.
At a news conference today, Richard M. Kessel, the executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board and an architect of the Shoreham settlement, heralded the rate freeze as "the best energy news that Long Island has had in decades." But he added that Lilco's proposal did not go far enough.
Both the Consumer Protection Board and another agency Mr. Kessel directs, the Long Island Power Authority, which is responsible for decommissioning Shoreham, filed a petition today with the Public Service Commission for a three-year freeze in Lilco's rates, for 1995 through 1997 followed by a rate cut of one-half of 1 percent in each of the next two years.
 
Other Cuts Possible
 Furthermore, if the company wins its two lawsuits against local goverments regarding taxes on Shoreham, saves more than projected in its operations or substantially improves its sales, cuts could be possible sooner, Mr. Kessel added.
Mr. Kessel called the freeze a great opportunity for Lilco rates to catch up with some of the other rates in the state, as several other utilities, like Consolidated Edison, Rochester Gas & Electric Corporation and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, are scheduled for rate increases over the next few years.
It is uncertain what other electric companies will do in response to Lilco's decision.
Mr. Kessel said that Lilco was not burdened by energy purchasing agreements, which require a company to buy excess energy from independent power producers at what are now high prices, as is the case for some of the other New York utilities.
The freeze was also possible, said Ms. Halpin, because Lilco refinanced its Shoreham debt with lower interest rates, saving about $160 million, as well as saving about $120 million by cutting the amount of energy generated by its oil-burning plants and relying more on natural gas. These two measures might not provide similar savings for other utilities.

HEADLINE: Consumers Spending At Fast Pace

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Americans continued spending liberally in October aided by a healthy rise in personal income, the Commerce Department said today.
The new data seemed to support the belief that the economy, experiencing an unusually slow recovery, has finally been gathering strength in the fourth quarter, partly because consumers are recovering their battered confidence. 
 Even a 6.5 percent decline in new home sales in October from September, when they surged 14.9 percent, did little to discourage the idea that fourth-quarter economic growth would meet or exceed 4 percent, up from 2.7 percent in the third quarter.
"We're calling this an expansion, not a recovery," said Cynthia Latta of DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc.
 
Fewer Jobless Claims
 Further supporting that notion was the Labor Department's report today that the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits in the latest week fell by 17,000, to 321,000, the lowest level in two months.
The Commerce Department said personal income rose sixth-tenths of 1 percent in October, moving ahead for the third month in a row, following a revised one-tenth of 1 percent increase in September, bringing the seasonally adjusted annual rate to $5.47 trillion.
Consumer spending, the report said, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in October -- the seventh straight monthly gain -- to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.47 trillion, following a revised four-tenths of 1 percent rise in September.
But because spending outpaced income gains, the savings rate fell in October, the Government said. Americans saved $177 billion in the month, down from $185 billion in September, a very low level that economists find disturbing.
And in a report reflecting more recent trends, major retail chains reported today that sales in November were tepid.
Personal income and spending are considered key indicators of consumers' ability to help fuel the economy. Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy.
The October data follow other indications this week that Americans' economic confidence is rising.
The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence soared in November, with an 11-point rise in its monthly index to 71.2, the highest level since last January.
The group said consumers were more positive in their assessment of prevailing business conditions and "considerably more optimistic" in their future expectations.
 
Buying Cars and Houses
 At the same time, low interest rates on mortgages have convinced consumers to dig deep, raising sales of existing homes to a 14-year high in October. Analysts said the 6.5 percent decline in new home sales in October had been expected, following September's extremely strong and unsustainable increase.
"Home sales generally are on the upswing, one month it's new homes, the next month it's existing homes," said Mark Obrinsky of the Federal National Mortgage Association.
He said that the combined performance of new and existing home sales in October was the strongest since May 1979.
This generally coincides with the belief that Americans are making major purchases -- homes and cars -- that they put off for years, worried about the outlook for jobs and fearing that houses were not the lucrative investment they once were.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips Against Mark, But Advances on the Lira

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the German mark yesterday despite signs that the German central bank might cut interest rates. But it reached an eight-year high against the Italian lira.
Gold prices, meanwhile, rose overseas but fell in New York. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for December delivery lost $1 an ounce, closing at $373.80. 
 Traders said the dollar fell against the German mark after the German central bank did not lower its most important interest rates at its meeting yesterday. The dollar later recovered some lost ground as the Bundesbank dropped the rate on securities-repurchase agreements to 6 percent from 6.25 percent.
 
 
'Still Accommodating'
 "It basically showed they're still accommodating in terms of monetary policy," said Hubert Pedroli, manager of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse in New York.
The repurchase rate is the central bank's principal tool for influencing money market rates.
A cut in German interest rates would reduce the return on mark-denominated investments, and could thereby reduce demand for the mark, driving its price lower.
In New York, the dollar ended at 1.7225 marks, down from 1.7235 marks on Wednesday.
Traders said the market had little reaction to positive data on United States consumer spending and personal income in October, which were in line with economists' expectations.
The dollar edged up to 108.90 Japanese yen in New York from 108.80 yen.
The dollar also continued to soar against the Italian lira. The dollar reached 1,736 lire by the end of the day. The American currency had ended at 1,719.00 lire a day earlier.
 The Federal Reserve intervened, apparently on behalf of the Italian central bank, to stop the lira's plunge, traders said. The American central bank bought lire and sold marks, the currency that trades most with the lira.
Zlatko Glamuzina, chief trader for the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia, said the lira was falling in advance of local runoff elections Sunday that are seen as foreshadowing general elections next year.
The former Communist Party and the neo-Fascists scored strongly in the first round last month.
"If you have marginal parties running the country, how well can they run it?" asked Mr. Glamuzina. "It doesn't inspire confidence."

HEADLINE: A New Temple For Egyptian Art

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
WHEN the Brooklyn Museum first opened its doors in 1897, it was a long and lonely Beaux-Arts shoe box. Judging from vintage photographs, it must have looked extremely odd: it lacked the prominent entrance usual to the Beaux-Arts style, and it stood out starkly against its low-lying, surprisingly rural background. (A chicken farm was next to it.)
But that narrow shoe box was only the first installment in a master plan designed by the New York architects McKim, Mead & White. As the museum expanded east over the next three decades, the West Wing, as the original building came to be called, became just part of a much larger structure in which it played an ever-decreasing role. By the mid-1970's, when the museum completed its last expansion, the original five-story shoe box had become merely the shabby tail of a very large dog. 
 Now, after seven years of planning, fund-raising and construction, the completely redesigned West Wing is leading the Brooklyn Museum into its second century with three floors of exceptional new galleries. Fully opened to the public for the first time today, these galleries complete the first installment of a new master plan that was devised in 1986 by the architects Arata Isozaki & Associates, based in Tokyo, and James Stewart Polshek & Partners of New York.
While the top floor of the wing opened in the fall of 1992 with exhibition space for postwar contemporary art, the two floors below have just been finished. One holds temporary exhibition galleries, the other is a spectacular home for part of the museum's famous collection of Egyptian art. These three floors of splendidly refurbished and modernized galleries provide 30,000 feet of exhibition space with such up-to-the-minute technical support as the museum's first climate-control system.
This first phase of the master plan also includes new offices on the second floor of the West Wing, into which the museum staff will move over the next six months, and the prize-winning Cantor Auditorium, also designed by the Isozaki-Polshek team, which opened in 1991 in the part of the museum added in the mid-70's.
While the merit of the entire master plan, which was devised in the heat of the expansionist 80's and would double the museum's size, remains a matter of debate, the new West Wing galleries are among the most handsome and viewer-friendly of any in the country. Created at a cost of $31 million, from a combination of public money and private donations, the galleries were built from scratch in the shell of the gutted McKim, Mead & White wing. All that remains of the original interior is a cast-iron-and-slate staircase connecting the three floors.
The floor plan is consistent on each level: the dominant feature is a 100-foot-long navelike gallery bracketed at either end by small antechamberlike galleries, and beyond the second is a generous square space that has a small adjoining gallery on its north side. The effect is everywhere one of lightness and brightness: floors are blond, walls are white or pale gray, and details are minimal. Beaux-Arts monumentality is only discreetly acknowledged in granite baseboards, for example, and in the imposing door frames, which, like the museum's exterior, are limestone.
The quality of the new design is most dramatically apparent in the Egyptian galleries on the West Wing's third floor. Installed by Richard A. Fazzini and James F. Romano, respectively the chairman and the curator of the museum's department of Egyptian, classical and ancient Middle Eastern art, they display 500 artworks and artifacts from the museum's world-famous collection of 8,000 Egyptian objects in circumstances best described as dazzling.
The galleries' exceptionally strong but not harsh lighting and the blond-on-blond tones, obviously intended to evoke the sun and sand of Egypt, give everything a crisp, clear look. While much smaller than the Metropolitan Museum of Art's sprawling Egyptian collection, the Brooklyn display is more digestible and far more beautiful: it's not only a great introduction to the subject, but it's also something like an Egyptian Frick Collection.
The installation immediately conveys some of the basic facts of Egyptian art: its profound serenity, its emphasis on stone carved with consummate sophistication, its focus on dignified renderings of the human face and figure, whether the subject is a pharaoh or a peasant feeding a calf. In works alternately magisterial and intimate, the amazing continuity of Egyptian art comes across in these galleries, as does its endless flexibility, especially its ability to both withstand and accommodate outside influences brought by a succession of conquering rulers from Persia, Greece and Rome.
The objects on view range from ornately painted mummy cases and coffins, through dozens of beautifully carved limestone reliefs, to quick ink sketches on fragments of stone or ceramic, known as ostracons. They include exquisite examples of jewelry, makeup cases and the ceramic objects known as faience, as well as a human mummy, two cat mummies and rare papyrus scrolls. Most of these works have not been on view for several years, if ever; many are fresh from the conservation laboratory and an unusual number are displayed in freestanding vitrines so they can be seen all around.
The inaugural display is in two parts that complement each other well. In the first small gallery and the long navelike space, a large chronological section covers Egyptian art's stylistic evolution through nearly 14 centuries, roughly from the 18th to the 31st dynasties. (Some works from earlier dynasties are on view just outside the new wing, in relatively sparse and dilapidated galleries that are about to receive the full attention of Mr. Fazzini and Mr. Romano, at which point the full scope of Brooklyn's Egyptian holdings will be more evident.)
Then, in the remaining three galleries, a smaller exhibition titled "Temples, Tombs and the Egyptian Universe" examines Egyptian art as an expression of Egyptian religion.
The stylistic section begins with the 18th dynasty in the 14th century B.C., one of Egyptian art's golden ages, and concludes with the beginning of its final decline at the end of the Ptolemaic period, around 30 B.C., when Egypt became part of the Roman Empire.
The first small gallery of the stylistic section is devoted to the Amarna period (1354-1337 B.C.), during which the heightened naturalism encouraged by King Akhnaten jolted artistic conventions that had been in place for more than a thousand years. Included here are the museum's famous Wilbour Plaque, which shows the graceful profiles of Akhnaten and his wife, Nefertiti, facing each other as if in a breakfast-table chat. A nearby relief that is especially touching shows Nefertiti kissing one of her six daughters squarely on the lips.
Although the esthetic changes wrought by Akhnaten were reversed after his death in 1337 B.C., the urge toward naturalism weaves in and out of much that follows, especially in the works from the Ptolemaic period, when the objects frequently waver between Egyptian and Greek traits. In fact, overall and without much fuss, this display chips away resolutely at the popular notion of Egyptian art as stylistically static and uniformly idealizing.
The extraordinary viewing conditions speed this understanding: all kinds of individuality seem to literally pop into view here, whether it is the features of a small head that might otherwise have looked generic or the lines and textures of a relief or painted plaque. For a culture thought to be static and hierarchical, these objects have a startling range of individual workmanship, what is called touch in the modern era.
It is not only in the Amarna section that repeated images of everyday life are found. In one vitrine toward the middle of the big gallery, a display of reliefs from the 22d to 26th dynasties is so beautiful it almost constitutes an artwork itself. One can see a calf being born, a woman stacking fruit, a scribe with his tablet, a singer and his accompanying harpist and workmen building a boat. In a vitrine nearer the beginning, an 18th-dynasty relief displays a line of soldiers with less than army-regulation physiques, and nearly every face suggests a different ethnic type. Just below this is an even more striking relief in which delicate lines depict an old man with a creased face, flabby chest and veined arms and hands.
While the first section emphasizes the "what" of Egyptian art and style, the second concentrates on the "why," trying to place objects in the broader social context of the culture's life and thought. For example, the Egyptian emphasis on order and serenity is abundantly evident in purely esthetic terms in the first section; in the second, through a combination of objects and wall texts, this trait is tied to the fear of chaos, or Maat, as it was called, which permeated the Egyptian world view.
Here one can follow the elaborate narrative on the side of a coffin, which shows its occupant making an orderly transition to the hereafter. One can also learn that something as simple as a hand mirror, an elliptical disk with a plantlike handle, was seen as a metaphor for order's triumph because it represented the sun rising out of the papyrus swamp, which was the personification of chaos.
Of course, the two sections aren't all that separate and actually lead into each other. The high point of "Temples, Tombs and the Egyptian Universe" display is the 26th-dynasty relief from the tomb of a vizier named Nespeqashuty. For some reason the relief was never quite finished: some of its elaborate scenes are merely outlined in red paint, others are bluntly cut out and still others are finished with soft contours and fine details. After savoring so many beautiful limestone reliefs, it is perfect to encounter this marvelously precise record of the process that brought them into existence.
If the Egyptian galleries are the jewel in the West Wing crown, the remaining inaugural displays demonstrate that the architects have come up with a scheme that should successfully accommodate different artistic periods and media despite the narrowness of the building. The current installation of postwar art on the fifth floor, however, is overcrowded and in need of pruning.
The fourth-floor temporary exhibition galleries, the first section of which was used briefly last year for the Frederic Bazille exhibition, are being fully inaugurated with a 30-year retrospective of Mr. Isozaki's work, consisting primarily of architectural drawings and meticulous wood models of nearly 20 different projects, including the Brooklyn Museum master plan.
As might be expected when the container and the contents are the products of the same sensibility, this exhibition looks quite good. It gives one a broader understanding of the combination of restraint and sensitivity that is so evident in the West Wing redesign, while also reminding the viewer that Mr. Isozaki can be more daring and idiosyncratic in his designs, as in his Disney office building in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., for example.
It is also useful to see the model for the complete Brooklyn Museum master plan, for it poses the question of whether it will ever be completed and whether, indeed, it should be. From the vantage point of the economically straitened 90's, when bigger is not so immediately seen as better, the new wings and extensions of the Isozaki-Polshek plan look grandiose.
The valuable lesson of the first phase is that its remarkable transformation has been carried out within the existing building. One hopes its brilliant success will encourage the museum and its supporters to concentrate their energies on those parts of the master plan designed to bring the rest of its already large building up to the exhilarating level of the new West Wing.
The new Egyptian galleries and the "Temples, Tombs and the Egyptian Universe" exhibition, on the third floor, and the installation of postwar American art, on the fifth floor, are on permanent view at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park. "Arata Isozaki: Works in Architecture" remains through Feb. 27.

WPIX Is Facing a 3-and-2 Count

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
This is it, the MSG Network says. The final offer. The last chance for WPIX-TV/Channel 11 to air Yankee games on free television and save Phil Rizzuto from idling in pool halls. After eight months of talks during which both sides negotiated from distant galaxies, MSG yesterday offered a deal to swallow all losses and split any profits with WPIX.
If WPIX says no, that will most likely be it, and all 150 televised Yankees games will appear exclusively on MSG. 
 MSG amended an October proposal to split profits or losses with WPIX depending upon whether advertising on WPIX exceeds or falls short of rights and production costs. MSG has given WPIX until Dec. 17 to respond.
"They're saying carry the game for free; I don't know about that," said Michael Eigner, WPIX's general manager, who chuckled while listening to MSG's offer, which was faxed to the news media before it was sent to him. It is a no-risk offer, he admits, better than splitting losses, but he wants a profit guarantee. Eigner measures his Yankees economics against what he could get by selling the same time blocks for movies or other programming.
Based on the previous three years, when MSG bought time on WPIX to air 50 telecasts at $100,000 per game and sold all the advertising, Eigner finds it unlikely that MSG could sell enough advertising to produce profits.
Eigner did not specifically reject MSG's offer, but he sounded gloomy.
 
MSG Suggests Only 30 Games
 The MSG president, Douglas Moss, suggested that WPIX take 30 games only, and use the remaining 20 slots formerly used for Yankees games to show regular programming.
The wrangling between the two has centered on MSG's cost of buying Yankee telecasts, $300,000 per game in 1994, for which MSG would have to be reimbursed. WPIX has contended that MSG paid too much and that MSG's demand that $300,000 be the absolute benchmark is financially untenable.
"We'd be willing to buy games directly from MSG," Eigner said, "but not at $300,000. It has to be financially viable. I didn't buy 'The Simpsons' or 'Home Improvement' because they didn't make sense financially."
WPIX last week suggested placing a value of $250,000 on the block of time it devotes to each Yankee game, which Moss rejected as financially not doable. In Moss's view, in such a scenario MSG would lose from $6.3 million to $9.1 million and WPIX would make from $3.3 million to $6.2 million.
 
ABC in Punt-and-Pray Situation
 ABC looks as if it will be a ratings loser on Jan. 1, unless the prayers of the Sugar Bowl are answered by getting to pick Notre Dame, a pipe dream possible only if Florida trounces Alabama so badly tomorrow that the Gators pass Texas A&M in the bowl coalition poll.
If events don't veer out of control, ABC's Citrus Bowl will start the day with Penn State-Tennessee, followed by the Rose Bowl featuring Wisconsin or Ohio State against U.C.L.A., and a Sugar Bowl matchup of undefeated West Virginia and Florida.
Meanwhile, on NBC, the tentative lineup would most likely match Miami-Arizona in the Fiesta Bowl, Notre Dame-Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl, and Nebraska-Florida State for the national title in the Orange Bowl.
A look at past bowl ratings shows some of ABC's fears: In 1991, a Tennessee-Virginia Sugar Bowl got a 4.9 rating for ABC against an 18.3 rating for the Notre Dame-Colorado Orange Bowl on NBC. The next year, with Notre Dame-Florida in the Sugar Bowl, ABC rated a a 10.8, much more competitive with the Miami-Nebraska Orange Bowl, which ended with an 11.0 rating.
Naturally, ABC won't say that its likely Rose and Sugar Bowls fall short of its desires or that it would prefer Notre Dame over West Virginia.
Mark Mandel, an ABC Sports spokesman, denied that the network is influencing the Sugar Bowl's decision to wait for a Hail Holtz bid for Notre Dame.
"We have a dialogue with the Sugar Bowl," said Mandel. What could that dialogue be?
ABC: "Wait."
Sugar Bowl: "O.K."
Here's the irony: a Pac-10 rule that bars its teams from competing at the same time in bowl games caused NBC to flip-flop the Fiesta and Cotton Bowl starting times, so Arizona and U.C.L.A. wouldn't play at the same time in the Fiesta and Rose. That will hurt the Rose Bowl more than its own teams vying for ratings because it will pit the Pasadena game against a Cotton Bowl featuring Notre Dame.
The Pac-10 decided against waiving the rule, said Jim Muldoon, a conference spokesman. "It was a question of doing the right thing long-term for the Pac-10," he said.
 
AIRWAVES
 CBS's JOHN MADDEN, riding the bus to Miami for Sunday's Giants-Dolphins game, said the key reason Jacksonville got the newest N.F.L. franchise was money, and little else: "They guaranteed $1 million to the visiting teams, and the voters were the visiting teams. For them, it's 'Give me $1 million and I don't care if you sell out or not.' "
Madden on the Giants' winning despite a sputtering offense: "The Giants are dealing with weak offenses in the N.F.C. The Giants will find it easy to keep doing this, because you'll get that weather where you play ball control. It's December football. They've been playing December football all year."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Window to the Mind of Christmas

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
SHOPPING isn't a chore. It is a gift. That's the delightful delusion to which we eagerly fall prey each time we enter the great emporiums of consumer fantasy. Showered with the free spritz of cologne, the bonus kit of cosmetics, the floral extravaganzas of spring and the thrill of celebrity appearances, we can easily forget that we're the ones who are paying for this copious largess. Indeed, we may begin to wonder whether we are worthy to receive it.
Christmas decorations, on the other hand, remind us that it is more blessed to give than to receive, a message that calls for a more Baroque set of signals. For while it is indeed a great pleasure to give, the pleasure is likely to be diluted when the giver is faced with a long list of people who expect to be remembered with, at least, a tie. 
 It's up to Manhattan's inspired store-display directors to transform seasonal coercion into cheerful volition. They want us to know that we're not being pressured to give. We have the opportunity to give. Festooned with ribbons, twinkling with lights, Christmas windows wrap up the ultimate present: the gift of giving.
THE GAP (West Fourth Street and Avenue of the Americas in Greenwich Village, and other branches). No one has a more masterly command of this seasonal sign language than the Gap. The store knows that what people want the most this year isn't a cappuccino machine or a Beavis and Butt-head video. It's the ability to chill out, to keep your head while people all around you are going crazy.
The Gap windows take the prize for studied relaxation. The store that devoted full-page advertisements to simple T-shirts and plain khaki pants understands the value of overstated understatement. So the Gap has adorned its windows with a simple red stripe (it's a ribbon if you want it to be), hung up a not particularly ostentatious wreath, and mounted a big color blow-up poster of a guy -- rugged, but not a dreamboat -- looking out from a backdrop of fresh green pine. There's no snow on these trees, but that's fine. He's dreaming of a cool Christmas.
On the bottom of the poster, it says: "What to Give. What to Get." At once question and answer, the slogan is a soothing prescription to the season's anxieties. Not only is the Gap full of gift ideas, it also brims with nonchalance. Give it, get it, don't sweat it. Christmas is an outfit. A little red, a bit of green. Wear it with a smile and even a touch of sincerity. If you get a little wrinkled, that's not a bad look.
TIFFANY & COMPANY (727 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street). Tiffany, by contrast, long ago perfected the art of the understated overstatement. Since there are no diamonds as big as the Ritz, it pays to get shoppers thinking small. Tiffany's windows are little theaters where the stars (twinkling gems, burnished silver and gold) work for scale. These miniature tableaux prepare the eye for the enchanted microcosm of the jeweler's art. And when the eye pulls back from the windows and peers through the store's glass doors, that grand ocean-liner saloon of a main floor appears to expand like the magic tree in "The Nutcracker."
This year, Tiffany's theaters come draped with popcorn curtains that part to reveal a Tom Thumb circus. Lions, clowns and acrobats, fashioned from enameled silver, cavort against a background of blue felt. Tiffany's Littlest Show on Earth (designed by Gene Moore, who has created the store's Christmas windows for the last 39 years) is exquisite, and admission is free, as if to set an example for generous holiday giving. The windows display no baubles to buy, no brooches riding horseback. And they're sure not selling popcorn.
 
Send In the Clowns
 F. A. O. SCHWARZ (767 Fifth Avenue, at 58th Street). A circus atmosphere also prevails at F. A. O. Schwarz, though here the figures have mutated up to the far extreme of the size scale. If you missed Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, Schwarz's jumbo camels, elephants and crayons are the next best way to shrink the kids.
Like the Russian Tea Room, Schwarz doesn't have to go to special lengths to look Christmasy. Those big glass windows facing onto Grand Army Plaza offer year-round glimpses of coming North Pole attractions. On the Madison Avenue side of the store, there's a Barbie boutique that is a study in pink and pearl. Visions of Joey Heatherton seem to be dancing in what passes for Barbie's head.
 
Off to the Islands
 BERGDORF'S MEN'S STORE (745 Fifth Avenue, at 58th Street). For those who break last year's vow to get out of town this Christmas, Bergdorf's men's store has arranged a South Sea island escape, with palm fronds, coconut matting, star fish, bananas and red wooden monkeys scampering about a simulated colonial planter's hut. But no one's going native here. Anglophile fashions and Edwardian furnishings make this a civilized outpost, while battered appliances -- a phone, a fan, a refrigerator -- complete the period-piece picture. This is a Somerset Maugham Christmas, a stiff upper lip in a tropical heat wave.
 
Devouring Passion
 BARNEYS (Uptown: Madison Avenue at 61st Street. Downtown: 106 Seventh Avenue, at 17th Street). Those who won't accept the gift of giving may profess to be revolted by it. Barneys understands this. It knows that excess is hard to stomach. In the spirit of homeopathic remedy, the store's windows push indulgence beyond parody into the realm of metaphysics. Gone from this year's windows are the follies of the famous, formerly showcased in Barneys' holiday windows like the attributes of the saints. Instead, the store plays havoc with consuming on a more visceral level, with an ambitious, two-store installation on the theme of holiday dining.
"Seasons Eatings," created by Martha King, is a series of fantasy buffets, long tables laden with imaginary party dishes that are grouped according to themes. Relying heavily on visual puns (a shoemaker's tree sprouts from a deep dish of "peach cobbler"), the displays give new meaning to the term groaning board.
Uptown, there's a "Hell Buffet," with infernal delicacies spread out for "Embers Only." Wooden safety matches no longer seem so benign when served up as matchstick potatoes, while a bowl of pasta carbonara comes lightly tossed with charcoal briquets. For dessert, take your choice among the Seven Deadly Sinnamon Rolls. When the selections get too hot, make your way to an adjacent window, where Angel Hair Pasta and a glittering Holy Rolling Pin await you at the "Heaven Buffet."
The surrealistic Fortnum & Mason's continues at the Barneys downtown branch, with buffets on Hawaiian, Las Vegas and marine themes. But the store also offers a special tribute to downtown iconoclasm with a two-window installation by James Vance that depicts the holidays as a scene of domestic violence. To judge from the overturned book cases, Breuer chairs with ripped cane seats and a floor littered with smashed candy canes and tree ornaments, this was not a silent night.
 
Winter Distilled
 STEUBEN (717 Fifth Avenue, at 56th Street). The Steuben store's display department needs to take a squeegee to its dusty holiday presentation. Set on the ground floor of a classic glass skyscraper designed by Wallace K. Harrison in 1959, the store occupies one of the most privileged locations on earth. And Steuben's merchandise could not be more seasonal. The shop's beautiful glass wares are perfect urban distillations of winter, sophisticated city versions of icicles and frozen lakes.
In the Fifth Avenue window, glass pine cones dangle forlornly from skimpy satin ribbons over their natural counterparts. Better lighting could make them zing. On the 56th Street side, stars of yellow canvas with tired-looking points hover over spiky miniature evergreen trees in mottled clay pots. Empty reflection pools out front turn the sidewalk into a dry ditch. If the pools won't hold water, why not pink bubble bath?
 
Silver and Gold
 Glass is used beautifully in the display window at HERMES (11 East 57th Street), where glistening cracked crystal shards have been stuck all over the bark of otherwise naked tree boughs. The effect is something between a child's rope of rock candy and Elizabeth Taylor's safety deposit box, a delicate balance between childhood improvisation and adult indulgence that looks utterly right for Christmas.
The trees are flanked by smaller shrubs with leaves of curled, feathery silver ribbon, and the window's glinting, ice palace impact is enhanced by its contrast to Burberry's window next door. The tone at BURBERRY (9 East 57th Street) is also metallic, but steeped in a mellow, orange light that flickers off dark gold fabric and the warm wood of the shop interior beyond. The unexpected harmony between this pair of carriage trade legends may induce waves of hopeless nostalgia for a time when all it took to be seriously multicultural was to tuck a French silk scarf inside a sturdy British mac.
 
Dead Flowers
 This is the season for dead flowers. Where living trees were once the Christmas fashion, now expired flora are dropping their petals all over town. At CHRISTIAN TORTU, in the new Takashimaya Building (693 Fifth Avenue, at 55th Street), dried amaryllis petals have been formed into ruby red lampshades for chandeliers that ascend toward the shop's lofty, gold-leaf ceiling. It's a flower's dream of the afterlife, a Tiepolo potpourri.
At BERGDORF GOODMAN'S MAIN STORE (754 Fifth Avenue, at 58th Street), the windows resemble enchanted Brothers Grimm compost heaps, with moldering leaves, mosses and mushrooms, gilded bee hives and spectral chandeliers suspended from desiccated branches. Surrounded by proscenium frames, surmounted by crowns, this sleeping beauty of a scene looks to be a fairy-tale version of lingering recessionary gloom. Won't someone enter the palace and kiss the dormant economy back to life?
GUCCI (685 Fifth Avenue, at 54th Street) also gives us an ample dose of nature morte, though the autumnal tones of dried bittersweet and ruddy apples are a supple match for the store's fine leathers. One window at Gucci is piled with cuddly brown teddy bears that have been dressed (or, in Calvin Klein's case, undressed) by such celebrities as Tommy Tune, Annie Leibovitz and Whoopi Goldberg. The bears will be auctioned on Wednesday to benefit Housing Works, a group that supports people with AIDS. And it may be that this season's citywide dried-flower bouquet is a symbolic response to that disease's continuing harvest of young lives.
At FENDI (720 Fifth Avenue, at 56th Street), the symbolism is more explicit. Stretching their wings over groups of somberly dressed mannequins, statuesque engravings of 19th-century angels wear neon versions of the red ribbon that signifies solidarity with those struck by AIDS. The garish neon looks out of place in this temple of refined, classical luxury, but the jarring note is precisely pitched. It would be ugly to look for a matching accessory in a specter that has shattered the world of fashion.
 
The Long View
 LORD & TAYLOR (424 Fifth Avenue, near 38th Street). Lord & Taylor's windows are the Jurassic Park of holiday displays, an enduring family favorite that draws crowds from miles around. And the store makes the greatest effort to pitch the season back onto the spiritual plane, with its animated, intricately detailed fairy-tale tableaux dedicated to such virtues as "A Helping Hand," "The Love of Friends" and "A Song of Peace." There is something movingly archaic about these scenes, almost as if they were the exhibits in the remote corner of some future "Star Trek" version of the American Museum of Natural History, where intergalactic travelers come to explore the glories of an ancient civilization that dwindled at the dawn of the Mall Age.
 
Fashion and Fantasy
 MACY'S (34th Street at Avenue of the Americas). Macy's had the wonderful idea of inviting fashion designers to decorate its Broadway windows, but for the most part the designers didn't rise to the occasion. Who cares that when Tommy Hilfiger hears the word "Christmas," he brightly thinks "Currier & Ives!"? But Josie Natori's silver and white "fantasy in the Imperial Gardens" has a dreamy glow. Silver gift boxes spill from within a pearl-encrusted tree that blossoms with perfumes and costume jewels. And Susie Tompkins remembers what it was like to celebrate Christmas on the beach in a temperate climate, with presents spread out on the sand beneath a whole coastline of trees.
The Clintons have survived the budget fight, Nafta and the President's haircut, so they won't be permanently damaged by Macy's 34th Street windows, where they are the unwitting stars in a witless version of "The Night Before Christmas." Macy's sumptuous ground-floor interior, now suffused with great clouds of rose paper-covered boxes, remains the true miracle on 34th Street.
 
Mannequin Mania
 SAKS FIFTH AVENUE (611 Fifth Avenue, at 50th Street). With Barneys forsaking V.I.P.'s for food, the season's most imaginative mannequins are on view in the windows of Saks Fifth Avenue, which offer a whimsical pageant featuring allegorical figures who represent different genres of gifts. There's a Signor del Suedo (leather bags), a Fiorenza Fragranza (perfume), and a jesterish, hat-twirling "Accessoro, entertainer to the court" who "knows as much about style as he does sport."
The mechanized figures spin to taped music within sepia-toned, Bibiena-style stage sets, their false perspectives creating an ideal visual overture to the sumptuous, fir-lined axis of Saks's main-floor aisle inside. Coupled with the promenade at Rockefeller Center, just across the street, this is one of America's grandest sequences of urban space. Give yourself the gift of seeing it in its best season.

HEADLINE: The Classical and the New in a Musical Adventure

BYLINE: By ALEX ROSS

 BODY:
On an out-of-the-way side street in Brooklyn Heights, nothing is quite as it seems. You enter a building that appears to be a church or a chapel. On the ground floor, you hear the bouncy strains of "Meet Me in St. Louis" as a community theater rehearses its winter production. Upstairs, brightly colored scribblings on the wall strongly indicate a nursery school or a kindergarten. But now there are strange, dangerous noises coming from behind a second door. Walking into a white, high-vaulted auditorium, you see 20 musicians dressed in black, pealing forth the mountainous, molten dissonances of "Deserts," by Varese.
This is the Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble, one of New York City's most adventurous new-music groups. The surroundings are no great mystery; S.E.M. shares space with the preschool at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity. But the story of how the orchestra came to be formed less than two years ago is an intriguing one. No less intriguing is the background for S.E.M.'s program tomorrow at Alice Tully Hall, one of the oddest in recent memory: Varese's "Deserts," Morton Feldman's "Turfan Fragments," John Cage's "Concert for Piano and Orchestra" (with the legendary new-music pianist David Tudor) and excerpts from "L'Orfeo," by Monteverdi. 
 The mastermind of the whole operation is Petr Kotik, a flutist and composer long associated with Cage. Mr. Kotik came to the United States from Czechoslovkia in 1969, having met Cage several years earlier. He formed the S.E.M. Ensemble in 1972, specializing in Cage works like "Songbooks." His own compositions are very much in the Cage tradition, employing indeterminate procedures and a wide range of literary sources.
 
After Cage
 Intense-looking from afar, Mr. Kotik was very genial, even nonchalant, in a recent interview. "I do not have a career," he said wryly. "I might have had a major career as a flutist in Czechoslovakia, but I could not play the same piece over and over again with the same enthusiasm. I am not goal-oriented." More or less on a whim, Mr. Kotik applied two years ago for a grant to record a full orchestral version of Cage's "Atlas Eclipticalis." Nonplussed when the money arrived, he enlarged his ensemble to form the S.E.M. orchestra. A follow-up concert took place in October of 1992 at Carnegie Hall, to considerable acclaim.
Between the first plans for that concert and its fruition, Cage died. Mr. Kotik went to Mr. Tudor in the hope that he would participate as a memorial gesture. This canonic pianist of the American and European postwar avant-garde had been concentrating on electronic composition for several decades and had not played an ordinary acoustic instrument publicly in 20 years. But the Carnegie Hall concert drew him out of retirement; his phenomenal intensity and concentration were undiminished.
S.E.M. was then invited to the U.S. Arts Festival in Berlin in May. Rather than repeat the same program, Mr. Kotik chose a rarely performed piece by Feldman and a Varese masterpiece more talked about than heard. The daring element of the venture was that the conductor had never attempted a fully notated (non-Cagean) score in public. Varese and Feldman are both fearsomely difficult in different ways, music with numberless small gestures and no central pulse.
 
How a Concert Evolved
 Mr. Kotik may be an inexperienced conductor, but he is passionate about his chosen repertory. Last year, "Atlas Eclipticalis" projected a sense of austere control as well as improvisatory richness. At a preview concert in preparation for the Tully Hall performance on Tuesday night, S.E.M. gave a vehement, fairly exact rendition of the Varese, although the Feldman still had a little way to go. "Conducting is utterly exhausting, just like composing" Mr. Kotik said of his new vocation. "There is always something more to be done, to be thought about, and you stop when you just can't think about it anymore."
The conductor insists that his Tully Hall program evolved by chance. Yet it has an underlying logic, a hidden theory about music's tension between repetition and freedom. On the first half, Monteverdi and Cage sit side by side, possibly for the first time anywhere. "In comparison with Monteverdi, Cage is very precise," Mr. Kotik noted with another wry smile. "Both scores leave a lot to the performer. I went back to the manuscript and made my own performing version of the Monteverdi. But music is fundamentally about imitation and repetition. So I also listened a lot to the John Eliot Gardiner recording." The concert tomorrow night will feature period instruments; the soprano soloist, Sarah Pillow, is a veteran of early-music performance.
In "L'Orfeo," the aria "Dal mio Permesso amato" ends with a plea that nature "halt upon its way"; Monteverdi's accompaniment falls into reposeful fragments. The transition is not shockingly abrupt to Cage's "Concert," a 1958 piece in which performers are free to choose among "aggregates" of fragmentary notation, and in which the texture often lapses into silence. Mr. Kotik will present a version with two orchestral groups and two pianists; the soloists are Joseph Kubera, playing an acoustic piano, and Mr. Tudor, playing an electronically prepared piano.
 
An Independent Approach
 In Varese, Mr. Kotik once again proceeds with rigor, and also with independence. "Deserts" is most often performed with an electronic background that the composer assembled from synthesizers and recorded ("concrete") sources. Mr. Kotik rejects the electronic material, calling it chaotic and dated. He prefers the instrumental score, which summons enough monstrous drama on its own.
The concert will close with Feldman, the Cage protege who found his own extraordinary path and whose work has become vastly influential since his death in 1987. "Turfan Fragments," composed in 1980, is very quiet and very tense, not quite so evenly textured as many of the composer's late pieces. Mr. Kotik's program once again reveals a neat sense of juxtaposition: Feldman greatly admired Varese, and "Turfan Fragments" seems to pick up where the ethereal closing bars of "Deserts" leave off.
Despite the intelligence behind it, this concert is a risky, not altogether rational venture. Mr. Kotik admits as much. But he quotes a favorite passage from Feldman's essays: "Art is a crucial, dangerous operation we perform on ourselves. Unless we take a chance, we die in art."
S.E.M. will perform tomorrow at 8 P.M. at Alice Tully Hall. Tickets are $30; $15 for students and the unemployed. Information: (718) 488-7659.

HEADLINE: Songwriters See Copyrights Infringed in Rap Parody Case

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Critic's Notebook article on the "Oh, Pretty Woman" rap parody case pending before the Supreme Court substantially mischaracterizes the views of the United States community of songwriters and music publishers ("Parody, Not Smut, Has Rappers in Court," Nov. 13). 
 While certain forms of parody and satire of musical works may be permissible under the fair use doctrine, the 2 Live Crew rap group appropriated far too much of the underlying work -- and its commercial use of the song usurped far too much of the market for the work -- for the group to sustain a fair use defense in this particular case.
Much more disturbing, however, was the article's irresponsible suggestion that musical compositions that achieve a certain level of success should be thrust into the public domain "as if its fans had ransomed it from the copyright holders." This outrageously regressive attitude, which runs contrary to the principles of free expression and private ownership, has been rejected by nearly every government in the world. Even the Soviet Union refrained for the most part from "nationalizing" creative works in the realization that to do so would utterly destroy the incentives and safeguards that permit creators to survive.
The basis for copyright protection is rooted in the United States Constitution, and the Supreme Court has recognized that copyright protection is the very "engine of free expression." These principles are what has enabled the cultural heritage of the United States to blossom.
Our country is the pre-eminent source of the world's music because American creativity has been nurtured through strong copyright protection. As a result, intellectual property today makes up 5.6 percent of the United States gross national product and is one of the only growing segments of our export market.
I suggest that your critic may wish to re-evaluate his position in light of not only the foregoing thoughts, but also in consideration of protecting the livelihoods of his colleagues. Copyright protection, after all, serves as the cornerstone of The Times's ability to protect its proprietary intellectual property interests throughout the world.

HEADLINE: Where the Money Isn't

BYLINE: By Karen D. Shaw; Karen D. Shaw is president of the Institute for Strategy Development, a financial consulting company.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The plan to streamline Federal bank regulation announced last week by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen makes sense. There is no reason to have four overlapping agencies overseeing the industry. But this fine-tuning may be beside the point. Commercial banks are heading for trouble, and it will take far more dramatic Government action to save them.
Although the industry has made an impressive recovery from the problems of the late 1980's -- banks will post record earnings for the eighth consecutive quarter -- the numbers do not look so good when carefully analyzed. 
 Judged by their return to shareholders, banks remain weak. Ominous signs appear in the otherwise ebullient stock market: even as banks' earnings reach new highs, their market value is falling, indicating long-term trouble.
In all the industry's traditional functions, banks are losing ground to mutual funds, mortgage companies, finance companies and other non-banking institutions. Unhampered by the laws that accompany Federal deposit insurance (commercial banks can't underwrite securities, for example) these competitors lure customers from banks. The competition can also create new financial products, like mutual funds, without the legal impediments that confine banks to high-cost, low-profit ends of the business.
A quick look into the wallet of any consumer reveals the best evidence of banking's problems. Vacations and washing machines used to be financed by installment loans. Now people use credit cards, which are more and more frequently issued by institutions other than banks. Household savings have also left the banking system; money market and mutual fund investments will equal bank deposit balances for the first time ever by the end of the year.
The way companies use banks has also changed. Large companies steered away from traditional banking loans in the mid-80's; they began borrowing directly from pension funds and others in the capital markets. Now, smaller and less stable companies are doing the same. Once finance companies start offering small-business loans (probably next year), the basic franchise of the commercial bank -- commercial lending -- will be under siege.
The corporate landscape is littered with the wreckage of industries that failed to change with the times. But banks can't just disappear. They are backed by a full faith and credit guarantee from the Government. Serious changes must be made quickly to insure that the Government's bet on banks is not called when their profitability begins mirroring their declining market share.
There are two ways to retool the system. The Government could simply take over commercial banking. Private banks would turn over their deposits to Uncle Sam and become unrestricted finance companies. But this would insert the Government into the economy in a dangerous way. Nationalized banks might become inefficient bureaucracies and, as in Europe, slush funds that blindly support foolish Government projects.
A far better alternative is modernization of the financial industry. The Government should continue to insure commercial bank deposits but should allow banks to diversify into more profitable financial services.
One can understand why the Administration might be reluctant to take on another huge reform initiative. But only a major overhaul can stabilize banks, protect the deposit insurance fund and spur economic recovery.

HANSON TO SPIN OFF U.S. AND BRITISH HOME-BUILDING UNITS

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Hanson P.L.C., the British conglomerate, announced plans yesterday to sell its home-building subsidiaries in the United States and Britain through a public stock offering. The offering in the two units, Beazer P.L.C. and Beazer Homes U.S.A. Inc., will be made in the first half of 1994. The home-building businesses had an operating profit of $87 million on sales of $699 million for the latest year. The announcement came as Hanson reported that its earnings fell to $1.1 billion for the year that ended on Sept. 30 from $1.6 billion a year earlier. The company attributed the decline to recession in several markets and a strike at its Peabody Coal subsidiary in the United States. The American depository receipts of Hanson fell $1.375 yesterday, to $19.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: What's What In The World Trade Talks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:

THE OVERVIEW
The United States is negotiating with 115 other nations to broadly rewrite the free trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which have governed most international trade for 45 years. GATT was created in 1948 with the aim of expanding economic activity by eliminating tariffs and other protectionist barriers. Trade ministers have successfully completed seven previous rounds of talks to broaden the original agreement.
The current negotiations began seven years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay, leading negotiators and commentators to call it the Uruguay Round. Its main goal is to broaden the rules to cover trade in agriculture and in services like tourism, insurance and telecommunications. Negotiators are also trying to reduce or eliminate many tariffs. 
 After years of obstacles, there is a growing sense that the trade talks may finally be headed for a conclusion. They have dragged on so long mainly because of disputes between the United States and Europeans over agricultural subsidies. This summer, Congress gave President Clinton special negotiating authority to clinch a deal by Dec. 15. If agreement cannot be reached by then, the Administration will have to seek Congressional permission for another extension, which could prove politically ticklish because of the recent fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In July, Peter Sutherland of Ireland took over as GATT's Director General. In a few months, he has succeeded in getting the world's governments to regard Dec. 15 as a true, pressing deadline. And Mr. Sutherland has warned that if the talks failed again, national leaders must face the blame for harming the global economy.
 
What Is At Stake
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based consortium of 24 of the more prosperous nations, estimates that a successful completion of the trade talks would mean about $270 billion more in annual trade by the year 2002. The extra economic output would come from the more efficient use of labor, capital and other resources.
Some American economists, industry groups and labor unions say that the draft version of an accord now being negotiated will channel most of the benefits to other countries, at least in the short run, and some economists question whether the overall gains have been overstated.
But most economists believe that over the course of years, free trade allows each country to specialize in products that it can make most efficiently, trading them for products made more efficiently elsewhere.
 
The Basics
 
TARIFFS
These are taxes that Governments collect on imports from other countries. The overall goal of the Uruguay Round is to reduce average tariffs by at least one-third. Previous GATT negotiations have cut average tariffs on manufactured goods to 5 percent from 40 percent in the late 1940's. While other nations' tariffs can be quite high, the average American tariff on manufactured imports is 4 percent. Japan, Canada, the United States and the European Community agreed in Tokyo in July to eliminate tariffs entirely on pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, medical equipment, some furniture, and whisky and beer. In addition, it is proposed that agricultural tariffs be reduced by 36 percent in industrial nations and 24 percent in developing nations. Agricultural tariffs vary widely because they are often charged by the penny per kilogram or liter, rather than as a percentage of the product's value.
 
QUOTAS
These are limits on the quantity of imports, like American limits on the number of tons of imported peanuts. Previous talks have eliminated most manufacturing quotas except for textiles and finished apparel. The Uruguay Round would eliminate this exception and also require countries to replace their extensive quotas or bans on farm imports with tariffs that provide comparable protection. Quotas are pervasive in international farm trade, and the United States imposes them on dairy products, peanuts and sugar. Some of the new tariffs could start as high as several hundred percent, and would be gradually reduced.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The agreement, as it now stands, requires that all countries protect patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks, including developing countries, where pirated computer programs, record albums, videocassettes and prescription drugs have been commonly available for years. But Western pharmaceutical manufacturers are angry that the proposed protections will come too slowly to benefit many companies doing business now. Indeed, some drugs will not receive full patent protection in developing countries for 20 years.
 
A NEW TRADE ORGANIZATION
The current text would create an institution in Geneva to enforce GATT's free trade rules. The new institution would be much more powerful than the GATT Secretariat is now, having the power to assess trade penalties against countries by a vote of two-thirds or three-quarters of the nations, whereas the Secretariat can act only when the members unanimously vote to do so -- something that is rare. The Clinton Administration and many Rust Belt industries like steel oppose this new organization because it could prevent American companies from seeking Commerce Department penalties on foreign industries that sell their goods in the United States with subsidies, or at unfairly low prices.
 
 INVESTMENT
The proposed text would ban the widespread practice of requiring high local content in some products like cars and of requiring factories to export as much as they import. The aim of that practice is to preserve local jobs and discourage imports. The proposed agreement would limit the ability of countries to favor domestically owned factories at the expense of foreign-owned ones.
 
TAXATION
The agreement would bar countries from imposing higher tax rates on foreign companies than on domestic ones. The United States is objecting to this rule, which would break a long American practice of individual tax agreements with more than 50 nations. These two-country deals also bar tax discrimination against foreign companies and individuals. But other countries are worried that American efforts to crack down on tax evasion by foreign companies may prove discriminatory, and they are pushing for GATT protection.
 
MAJOR INDUSTRIES AFFECTED BY THE TALKS:
Agriculture. The big dispute holding up the talks for the last three years has been a quarrel between the United States and the European Community over farm subsidies. Last year, the United States and the Europeans agreed to reduce the tonnage of subsidized grain exports by 21 percent, and to limit other farm subsidies. But France, Europe's biggest agricultural exporter, wants the subsidy deal renegotiated. Yesterday, in negotiations in Brussels, the United States tentatively agreed to allow the Europeans to subsidize more grain exports over the next six years than previously planned. In exchange, the Europeans tentatively agreed to convert some of their quotas on farm imports into low tariffs, as Washington demands.
Automobiles. Over the years, the United States and the European Community have each forced Japan to accept limits on its auto exports. The current agreement text would virtually ban these restrictions. Each country would only be allowed one such export limit on any industry, and Detroit car makers worry that they might not get the exemption. The Big Three also worry about clauses in the text that would make it harder to prove that foreign cars were being sold at unfairly low prices in the United States.
Financial services companies. In theory, commercial and investment banks, insurance companies and issuers of travelers checks would all be allowed to do business around the world, subject only to restrictions aimed at protecting depositors and insurance-policy holders. But few developing countries have actually committed themselves to opening their markets, angering American financial-services companies. The Clinton Administration has antagonized some countries by saying that it will not guarantee the continued openness of the American market except in the cases of countries that considerably open their own markets.
Movies, TV programs and music recordings. The European Community now allows its 12 members to restrict the distribution of foreign films, television programs and recordings in an effort to protect the national culture of each country. Several European countries, notably France, have imposed quotas on these imports. Hollywood wants the quotas eliminated. European Community officials are pushing a compromise that would maintain existing quotas at current levels and not allow new ones.
Steel. Some European government subsidies to uncompetitive steelmakers would be banned. But no agreement has been reached yet on whether to ban many other subsidies, and whether to allow penalties like steeper tariffs on countries that continue banned subsidies.
Textiles and apparel. The current text would phase out textile and apparel quotas over 10 years, but the Clinton Administration is trying to extend this to 15 years. The quotas would then be replaced by less-restrictive tariffs. KEITH BRADSHER

Helpful Hints for an Era of Practical Feminism

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Fire With Fire
 The New Female Power and How It Will Change the 21st Century
 By Naomi Wolf
 373 pages. Random House. $21.
Naomi Wolf's messy new treatise, "Fire With Fire," is really two books. The first aspires to be a kind of sequel to Susan Faludi's best seller, "Backlash," arguing that a new era of gender politics is at hand. The second purports to be a manifesto for a new, inclusive brand of feminism eschewing extremism and rigid ideology.
As Ms. Wolf, the author of "The Beauty Myth" (1991), sees it, the backlash against feminism culminated during the years of the Ronald Reagan Administration and ended with the Anita F. Hill-Clarence A. Thomas hearings of October 1991. Those hearings, she argues, focused women's anger and galvanized the development of what she calls the "genderquake": that is, a major shift in the balance of power between American men and women, accompanied by "unprecedented female political activism." 
 To begin with, Ms. Wolf suggests, the election of President Clinton represented the defeat of the patriarchal politics championed by the Republicans at their 1992 convention. More victories for women followed in the wake of last year's elections, including the passage of the Family Leave Act, the reversal of the gag rule in pregnancy counseling and the appointments of women to prominent positions within the Clinton Administration.
Ms. Wolf also notes that the organization Emily's List helped 25 new women win political office by raising $6.2 million in campaign money for 1992, and that women still have "enormous unclaimed" political power. Women spend 85 percent of the consumer dollar, she writes, and in last year's Presidential election, they represented 54 percent of the voting public.
In an effort both to celebrate the positive effects of the "genderquake" and to rally support for the continuing fight against sexism, Ms. Wolf frequently contradicts herself. For instance, speaking of women's growing political power, she declares that "without the women in the media, all these parties could not have linked up in the unstoppable chain reaction that ushered in the new era." Pages later, she asserts that "the mainstream media leave out women in general, and the women's movement in particular, with a comprehensiveness that has disturbing implications for a democracy."
On one hand, Ms. Wolf cites this year's vapid Academy Awards tribute to "Women in Film" and the success of television series like "Designing Women" as evidence of changing cultural politics. On the other hand, she complains about the male domination of Hollywood, noting that 95 percent of Premiere magazine's list of heavyweights in the entertainment industry is male.
It is on the subject of the women's movement -- and its internal divisions -- that Ms. Wolf is most impassioned. In her view, contemporary feminism has alienated many American women, who share its goals of women's rights but shy away from the movement's strident image. She argues that this problem stems, in part, from distortion by the media and the religious right, but she adds that the movement, too, bears responsibility.
In recent years, Ms. Wolf charges, feminism has developed some "intellectually destructive habits," namely an either-or, us-versus-them attitude that emphasizes ideological purity and consensus thinking. Its insistence on a checklist of attitudes (toward everything from abortion to cosmetics), she says, has "closed the word 'feminism' off to enormous numbers of people: women who are not sure about, or who actively oppose, abortion; women who are terrified of being tarred with the brush of homophobia; women who strongly resist identifying themselves as victims; women who are uneasy with what they see as man bashing and blaming; conservative women; and men themselves."
The old "victim feminism," Ms. Wolf contends, depicts women as virginal, peace-loving creatures pitted against violent, aggressive males. It denigrates the importance of leadership, money and sexuality, and it self-righteously identifies with powerlessness. As examples of "victim feminism," Ms. Wolf cites Take Back the Night rallies forbidding the participation of men, and criticism of Hillary Rodham Clinton for submitting to a campaign makeover.
In contrast to this "victim feminism," Ms. Wolf posits a "power feminism" that emphasizes individualism over collectivity, that "hates sexism without hating men," that is willing to use the traditional tools of male society, including the mass media and the political system -- to achieve its ends. Examples of power feminism, she says, include support from Emily's List for female candidates, business counseling provided by the American Woman's Economic Development Corporation, and Attorney General Janet Reno's use of her office "to prosecute deadbeat dads and domestic violence."
In her efforts to articulate an accessible, pragmatic feminism, Ms. Wolf scores some valid points, helping to replace strident dogma with common sense. Unfortunately, her arguments are undermined by sloppy thinking and even sloppier prose.
To begin with, "Fire With Fire" is peppered with dubious oversimplifications and highly debatable assertions. Ms. Wolf writes, for instance, that "the Bush White House went down because it paid too little attention to its female constituents." She maintains that many young women "truly believe that the main thing that determines feminism is body hair." And she asserts that "America, and all its women, won big" by witnessing the ugly face-off between Elizabeth Holtzman and Geraldine Ferraro in the 1992 New York Democratic primary race for a United States Senate seat.
To make matters worse, Ms. Wolf displays a disconcerting penchant for inflationary prose. In "The Beauty Myth," she went so far as to draw parallels between the Holocaust and anorexia; in this volume, she describes what she perceives as discrimination against women in the mass media as "gender apartheid."
Elsewhere in the volume, she resorts to the peppy language of self-help books in an effort to win new converts. She repeatedly insists that feminism should be "easy," "lucrative" and "fun": that is, fun in the sense of "the rape crisis center starved for lack of fun."
In the end, it is such egregious passages, not Ms. Wolf's more persuasive arguments about feminism, that ultimately stick in the reader's mind.

HEADLINE: A NEW U.S. STANCE ON ATOMIC WASTES

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The Secretary of Energy said today that her department had a "moral obligation" to help electric utilities store spent fuel from nuclear reactors, even though the department could not keep its promise to take the fuel off their hands beginning in 1998.
In a sharp turnaround from the Bush Administration, which denied it had any responsibility for the waste, she said her department might cover the utilities' cost for storage. 
 Under contracts signed in the 1980's, the Energy Department has been collecting a waste disposal fee from utility companies amounting to a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour generated in reactors. It has used about $3 billion in the search for a permanent waste repository but still has more than $4 billion on hand, and it is still collecting $600 million a month.
But no permanent repository will be ready until 2013 at the earliest, said the Energy Secretary, Hazel R. O'Leary, in an interview today. A temporary repository is possible, she said, but "we're not going to make it by 1998." The contracts call for the Government to begin pick-ups of the waste then.
 
Mostly Under Water Now
 During the Bush Administration, the Energy Department argued that the contracts did not require it to accept the wastes if it had no place to put them.
Most of the spent fuel is now stored in pools of water next to the reactor buildings, but at many plants these will be full by 1998. Water shields radiation and keeps the waste cool.
Some utilities have built "dry cask storage," concrete and steel casks sitting behind barbed wire near the reactors, and other companies have asked permission to build such casks.
But in several states, most notably Florida, Michigan and Minnesota, state public service commissions have complained that raising electric rates to cover the expense of building such structures amounts to a double charge to consumers for storage, since the companies have already paid the Energy Department.
"I don't think anybody is really pleased by that prospect," said Janice E. Owens of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, a Washington association of state officials that has been pressing the issue.
 
Paying Costs of Casks
 Mrs. O'Leary said she had directed her staff to find a mechanism by which the department could pay the cost of casks at reactor sites, beginning at the dates that the fuel would have been picked up. This might take the form of a credit against future waste fund payments, an aide said.
Mrs. Owens said another mechanism might be for the Energy Department to develop, manufacture and deliver to each reactor a container that would be used for storage for an interim period. The container would then be used for shipping the material to a permanent repository, she said, and would be the final package for the wastes.
The Energy Department is studying whether Yucca Mountain, in the desert outside Las Vegas, Nev., would be suitable as a permanent repository, but the study has been plagued with technical problems and political disputes.
Mrs. O'Leary said she was convinced that for reasons of security, safety and economy, a centralized storage site for the casks was preferable to cask storage at many different reactor sites.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 11, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 3 about disposal of spent fuel from civilian nuclear reactors misstated the amount paid by the utilities to the Federal Government for that purpose. It is about $600 million a year.

HEADLINE: Pitching GATT's Pluses To a Reluctant France

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 3

 BODY:
A spearhead of free trade for most of the world, GATT has become a four-letter word in France, a frightening symbol of a perfidious American plot to drive French farmers off the land, crush French culture in Hollywood's vice and rob France of its very identity.
Indeed, for more than a year now, first a socialist Government and then its conservative successor have been preparing the French to stand alone in the world, even face ostracism, if France decides it must torpedo a liberalized General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pact to save the republic. 
 But with hopes rising for an accord acceptable to France perhaps as early as next week, the rightist Government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur may soon face a different challenge: how to convince a country stirred up by anti-GATT rhetoric that GATT might be good for France after all?
Last weekend, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing warned that France may already have gone too far in its posturing. "Let's beware of isolating France," he said. "It's a dangerous road, full of disappointment and frustration." And if an agreement is not reached, it will take some explaining.
 
An Irritable Mood
 The simplest approach may be for the Government to declare victory, to claim that France's demands have been satisfied, even to boast that France's show of determination has forced the United States to back off. Yet, since any GATT deal will be a compromise, charges of surrender may be unavoidable.
The Government has good reason to be worried. With a painful recession spawning record unemployment, France is in an irritable mood. Further, French farmers have a fearsome record of blocking highways, dumping produce in front of town halls and crying treason whenever their interests are threatened.
Today, in a peaceful warning of what may lie ahead, farmers built a pyramid of wheat in the courtyard of the Louvre Museum here today, imitating the glass pyramid of I. M. Pei. "It's a symbol of European prosperity that is now under attack," one farmer said.
Yet even Mr. Balladur's political future might be in the balance. Since taking office in March, he has enjoyed such popularity that he is now widely considered the front-runner for the Presidential elections in May 1995. A wave of social unrest, though, would badly bruise his image.
 
Seeking Concessions
 Eager to be seen fighting to the end, the Government is still seeking more concessions from the United States, noting that a breakthrough reported by American and European negotiators on Thursday was insufficient. But even in Paris, the expectation is that it will eventually sign onto GATT.
In reality, most French economists and industrialists have long argued that France was set to benefit enormously if seven years of negotiations under the auspices of GATT climaxed in a new global trade accord this month. But so far, their voices have hardly been heard.
Instead, France has focused its indignation on a parallel farm trade pact signed last November by the United States and the European Community requiring a reduction of subsidies for many agricultural exports. As Europe's largest food producers and exporters, French farmers would be hit the hardest.
Then, this fall, after GATT set a deadline of Dec. 15 for the completion of this round of negotiations, dubbed the Uruguay Round because it began in Punta del Este seven years ago, France raised another objection, arguing that the moves to liberalize movies, television and musical recordings would allow Hollywood to crush a French movie industry that had survived because of subsidies.
 
Ignoring a Threat
 On both these issues, because the European Community negotiates as a single trading bloc and can only act unanimously, France's repeated threat to use its veto could not be ignored. And without the participation of the 12-country community, a global trade package would clearly be meaningless.
As part of its strategy, France also has raised the stakes for its European partners, who have been all too aware that a French veto would provoke a big crisis inside a community already weakened by disagreements over the war in former Yugoslavia, exchange rate policies, interest rates, immigration and unemployment.
As a result, while most community countries were campaigning for a GATT agreement, Germany -- France's strongest European ally -- took the lead in preventing France from becoming isolated. "The Americans would be wrong to gamble on a split inside Europe," a senior French official said this week.
The French stance has borne some fruit, forcing Washington to renegotiate with the European Community the farm trade pact signed in Washington last year. And this week, the United States agreed to loosen the timetable for cutting European export subsidies in exchange for greater access to European markets.
 
An Exception for Movies
 On the perceived threat to its movie industry, France first demanded that culture as a whole remain outside GATT. Now it is willing for movie production to be treated as a "specific" exception, a concession the United States has said it would grant if trade in the fast-expanding audio-visual industry was liberalized.
The package under negotiation affects far more than just farm and audio-visual products, involving services for the first time as well as textiles, steel, civil aircraft, telecommunications, computers and government procurement. World Bank economists said they believed that the reduction of the protectionist barriers would bring an extra $200 billion worth of world trade.
If an accord emerges, the challenge for the French Government will be not only to "sell" whatever concessions it has won on farm issues and movies, but also to focus the public's attention on how the country's aircraft, computer, service and luxury industries will profit -- and bring new jobs.
Yet the Government has complicated its task by allowing the emotional farming issue to dominate the debate here. For example, when Patrick Devedjian, a conservative deputy, drew up a report arguing that France should sign a GATT accord "despite agriculture," his own Rally for the Republic party refused to publish it.
Now, with the trade talks approaching their make-or-break point, French farmers said they were already mobilizing in case they felt betrayed. Unlike most French, for whom the GATT debate represents a patriotic stand against ever-encroaching American influence, the farmers are likely to look at the small print of any deal. And some, if not all grain producers are certain to be adversely affected.
"As long as the game is not over, we're not reacting," a spokeswoman for the Federation of French Farmers said today. Her message was clear: Even if the negotiations in Brussels and Geneva end in an agreement this month, the game may be far from over for the Government.

HEADLINE: Jobless Picture Brightens In New York and New Jersey

 BODY:
The employment picture improved in New York and New Jersey last month, according to figures released yesterday, but a persistently high rate in New York City continued to drag down the region's recovery.
In New Jersey, where the unemployment rate had dropped sharply in October, to 6.5 percent from 7.7 percent, the improvement continued in November, falling to 6.2 percent, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Unemployment in New York State, which had risen in October to 7.9 percent from 7.1 percent, reversed course in November, falling back to 7.5 percent.
 
 
New York City Nearly Unchanged
 But the rate in New York City, which for more than a year has been far higher than elsewhere in the region, remained almost unchanged in November. The Federal agency said it stood at 10.2 percent, down from 10.3 percent in October.
In both of the states, the November rates were lower than a year earlier, when they stood at 8.7 in New Jersey and 8.2 percent in New York. In the city, however, the rate was down only slightly from a year ago, when it was 10.5 percent.
Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, who narrowly lost a bid for re-election last month in a campaign in which the economy was the major issue, said yesterday that the November unemployment report reflected a slow but strengthening recovery for his state.
"We have worked very hard for the past four years to try to make the investments that would result in economic improvements that obviously are coming," he said. "It would have been nicer a couple of months ago, but they're coming nonetheless.
As is the case each month, the Federal report released yesterday covered only 11 major industrial states, with rates for the other states to be reported later in December. The rate for Connecticut was not reported yesterday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Offering to Mediate Russian-Ukrainian Disputes on Security

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The United States offered today to mediate a range of thorny security disputes between Russia and Ukraine, including military protection for Ukraine, the dismantling of its nuclear arsenal and Russian compensation for Ukraine's highly enriched uranium, senior State Department officials said today.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher made the offer during a meeting with Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Anatoly Zlenko, as part of the Clinton Administration's strategy to nudge Ukraine into giving up its nuclear weapons by offering it political and economic incentives, the officials said. 
 Officials stressed that the idea was still in a preliminary stage and that Mr. Christopher did not raise the issue directly when he presented Ukraine's security concerns in a later meeting with Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev. But both countries have sought the direct intervention of the United States for some time, and Mr. Zlenko's appeal today led Mr. Christopher to accept.
The goal is to set up talks led by Strobe Talbott, the American Ambassador at Large for the former Soviet Union, and his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts.
 
Third- Largest Nuclear Power
 Ukraine's missiles and bombers make it the world's third-largest nuclear power, after the United States and Russia, and in the last several months, Ukraine has stiffened its conditions for dismantling and destroying them, in part because of a growing pro-nuclear lobby in its Parliament.
Reflecting the ambivalence involved in becoming a non-nuclear state, Ukraine's leaders told Mr. Christopher in Kiev in October that they were committed to ridding the country of nuclear weapons, but want billions of dollars and pledges of Western military protection to do it.
Today Mr. Zlenko denied that his country was using nuclear blackmail to extract security promises and money from the West, telling reporters after the meeting, "I would like to tell you that our economic situation obliges us to find the solution to very acute problems in my country."
But aides to Mr. Christopher said he was very frustrated with his conversation with Mr. Zlenko today, which took place against the backdrop of a meeting of foreign ministers of the 16 NATO members and 22 members of the former Soviet bloc to prepare for next month's NATO summit conference.
Mr. Christopher reportedly pressed Mr. Zlenko on why his country had not yet signed final agreements that spell out how Ukraine intends to spend $175 million in American funds to begin the dismantling of its nuclear weapons. Once the agreement is signed, the United States will send the money.
"Christopher told him there were bureaucratic logjams that he didn't understand," an official said. "He expressed irritation that things were not moving forward at the rate they should be."
The United States has also recently pledged to give Ukraine $155 million in economic aid and loan guarantees in 1994, but only if it makes strides in decentralizing its economy.
"It would be very difficult for us to provide aid in a situation where there remains a command economy," Mr. Christopher said, adding that the United States and Ukraine could not have a "full, satisfactory relationship" until Ukraine became nuclear-free and reformed its economy.
Ukraine's leaders have complained that foreign aid has been inadequate. Mr. Zlenko told reporters that Ukraine needs $2.8 billion to dismantle and destroy its nuclear weapons.
Shortly before coming to Brussels, Mr. Zlenko submitted a letter to NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, requesting legally binding security guarantees for Ukraine, senior State Department officials said. These include a promise to come to Ukraine's defense if it is attacked or threatened with attack by nuclear or conventional weapons and pledges to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and not to use economic pressure on Ukraine for political goals.
 
Arms Treaty Ratified
 Last month, Ukraine's Parliament ratified the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, and in a telephone conversation with President Clinton last week, President Leonid Kravchuk promised to put it into effect.
But Mr. Zlenko said during Mr. Christopher's visit to Ukraine in October that there was no way to guarantee that Ukraine's Parliament will approve the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as demanded by Washington.
On Thursday, NATO foreign ministers threatened to exclude Ukraine from an American plan that would expand NATO cooperation eastward if it did not fulfill its promises to become a non-nuclear state.
In presenting the plan to the countries of the former Soviet bloc today, Mr. Christopher was met with one basic question by a number of Central European nations: When can we join?
Their reaction was decidedly less enthusiastic than that of America's NATO allies, which embraced the proposal on Thursday as a way to offer a hand to the former Soviet countries but avoid letting them into NATO soon.
Although no one nation opposed the American proposal, a number of ministers clearly told Mr. Christopher that they expected more.
 
Goal Is Membership
 "We, the Poles, expect a more positive response to the aspirations that we regard as justified," the Polish Foreign Minister, Andrzej Oleschowski, said today. The plan, he added, "will meet our expectations only if it opens the prospects of membership to partners, who, like Poland, share the purpose and values of the alliance."
The Czech Foreign Minister, Josef Zieleniec, also urged "the accentuation of the prospects of membership."
Mr. Kozyrev, whose country has opposed any expansion of NATO membership to the east, praised the American plan in remarks to reporters. But in the private ministerial meeting, he proposed a "more pan-European approach" to security, rather than a plan under the control of the NATO powers.

HEADLINE: CLINTON REASSURES CENTRIST COUNCIL

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Gently admonishing centrist Democrats, President Clinton today called for them to be a little more understanding of his need to compromise with the right and the left to build coalitions that will advance the centrist's own cause.
The President delivered his plea in a keynote address to the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization of centrist and conservative Democrats that he helped found and that later helped him in his march to the White House. 
 But lately, members of the council have been concerned that Mr. Clinton has abandoned their views on many issues since taking office.
 
Give and Take of Politics
 The homecoming for Mr. Clinton, a former chairman of the group, could have been the scene of an open brawl over their differing approaches to health care. But the President and the council's leadership alike took pains to mute their differences and underscore their common ground.
First, however, the President rebuked his fellow "new Democrats" for not being more understanding of his need to engage in the give and take of politics to achieve many of the programs they had called for during their years together in the political wilderness -- from national service to budget reform to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"I come here to say more than anything else," Mr. Clinton said, "that when you produce policies that embody these values of opportunity and responsibility and community in a democratic society that elects people to Congress and that requires the President to work with the Congress, that requires the accommodation of various interests all across the country in the private sector and requires a partnership with people at the state and local level; having the best ideas in the world does not free you of the obligation to make difficult decisions."
The President told the audience, made up of hundreds of the council's followers from around the country and from Capitol Hill, "I further come here to say that we don't want to be in the position that some of our predecessors were in the other party, where they were willing from time to time to exalt political rhetoric over reality and where they were willing from time to time to let the perfect become the enemy of the good."
On health care, where Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, prefer an approach that contrasts with one being advocated by the council, the President took a nonconfrontational line, focusing more on his objectives rather than how to get there.
Two leaders of the council, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, have offered an alternative to the Clinton health plan. Instead of Mr. Clinton's proposals for global budget ceilings set by government, heavy regulation, employer mandates and oversight boards, the Cooper plan seeks to control health care costs primarily by stimulating market competition.
 
Avoiding Public Spat
 "Do not give up on universal coverage and do not give up on the proposition that there has to be a competitive capacity for all, all employers, including small businesses and the self-employed," Mr. Clinton said. "If you will stay with that, then we can reach an agreement next year."
Mr. Clinton's olive branch was reciprocated by Representative Cooper and Senator Breaux after 24 hours of behind the scenes contacts between the council and the White House to prevent any public spat.
In an afternoon speech to the council's annual conference, Mr. Cooper said: "The Cooper-Breaux bill is closer to the Administration bill than any other bill in Congress. We have a lot more in common than we do in difference."
With regard to health care, Mr. Breaux said, "Let me say clearly that we already agree on much that needs to be done, and we, in the D.L.C., share this President's goal of universal health care coverage for all Americans."
Mr. Cooper told reporters, though, that he still had "grave doubts" about the President's reliance on government controls to limit private-sector health spending.
The President also used much of his speech to convince the audience -- and he appeared to succeed -- that his first year in office was guided for the most part by the council's playbook and should be seen by the organization as a major victory.
That was clear, he said, in the $500 billion deficit reduction package, in the trade agreement, in national service, in tax incentives for small businesses and in the expansion of the earned-income tax credit for low-income families. The object of all these initiatives, Mr. Clinton said, is to convince middle-class Americans that the Democratic Party embodies their interests, articulates their aspirations and can protect their future.
 
Meaning of 'New Democrat'
 "We must fight their fight," Mr. Clinton said. "We must give voice to their concerns. We must give them the chance to build security while embracing change.
"And above all, we must honor those basic values of opportunity, responsibility and community, of work and family and faith. This is what it means, in my view, to be a new Democrat. I was proud to campaign as one; I'm proud to govern as one."
The council's president, Al From, after listening to Mr. Clinton's speech, said he had "no doubt that Mr. Clinton is trying to govern as a 'New Democrat.' " He said that while the Democratic Leadership Council was happy with Mr. Clinton's performance, it would keep its pressure on him because, he said, Mr. Clinton "needs the pressure from our side to counter the pressures from the other side."
The council gave Mr. Clinton a paperweight designed as a golf club to help him hold down all the memorandums it is sending to the White House each day.
"I will tell you this," Mr. Clinton said, accepting the gift, "I did not know this until recently, but Al From had recruited the famous American golfer, Tom Watson, into the D.L.C. Watson was the captain of our Ryder Cup team, and when they came to the White House to get a good send-off for their international competition, Watson says to me, 'Hold this golf club, Mr. President.'
"So, I'm holding the club. I swear, Al From wrote this speech for him. He said, 'Now look at your grip. If you move your grip too far to the left, it gets you in trouble on the right. But if you move your grip too far to the right, it gets you in big trouble on the left. The trick is to keep your grip balanced in the center,' said Tom Watson and Al From."
Later, President Clinton began a two-day Western trip by traveling to a health care clinic in Bernalillo, N.M., where he told doctors and patients that his plan for overhauling the health care system would help to expand the services available in rural communities.
The President was to travel on to Los Angeles, where he is scheduled to take part in a panel discussion on Saturday about California's ailing economy.

HEADLINE: Man's 7-Year Search to Find Job Ended With 5 Dead in California

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: OXNARD, Calif., Dec. 3

 BODY:
Alan Winterbourne wanted a job and even ran for Congress partly because the pay looked good.
But his job search evolved into a long battle with bureaucracy, and it ended Thursday in a shooting rampage at a state unemployment office that left him, three state employees and a police officer dead. 
 The police said today that they were uncertain what set off Mr. Winterbourne, who was 33. They were reviewing documents he had left at a newspaper just 30 minutes before the attack in which he went into detail about his seven-year search for work.
"We've got thousands of things to look at," said David Keith, an Oxnard police spokesman. "Our first review of those documents reveals nothing that gives us insight as to motive."
 
Workers Singled Out
 Mr. Winterbourne, armed with a pistol and a shotgun, walked into a local office of the California Employment Development Department just before noon on Thursday and opened fire. He singled out workers, witnesses said.
Mr. Winterbourne fled in a car after a brief shootout with the police. In the pursuit, he killed an Oxnard police officer and was later killed by the police outside another unemployment office in nearby Ventura, when he emerged from his car carrying a gun. Five other people were wounded, one by police bullets.
The police seized two rifles besides the shotgun and pistol. Mr. Winterbourne had no record of arrests, Mr. Keith said.
Avelina Villalobos, the employment department's office manager in Oxnard, said she did not remember seeing Mr. Winterbourne in the office before the shooting. Asked if any of the victims had worked with him, she said, "To my knowledge, nobody had anything to do with him."
 
'Tell Us the Reason Why'
 Flowers and cards piled up today outside the bullet-marked entrance to the office, which was closed for the day. One handwritten note on a red poinsettia read: "We have comfort in God. We know He took four people home. Please tell us the reason why."
A half-hour before the rampage, Mr. Winterbourne left documents with The Ventura Star-Free Press detailing his search for work. He said he would call later to discuss them with an editor.
Among the documents were job applications and 288 letters to every major employer in the county.
Mr. Winterbourne had been unemployed since 1986 after resigning as a computer engineer for the Northrop Corporation, citing an inability to adapt to a change in assignment. Six months after quitting, he filed for unemployment benefits at the Oxnard office, but his application was denied after Northrop said he had left voluntarily.
The envelope left at the newspaper included a transcript of his appeal to an administrative law judge on Dec. 3, 1986. Mr. Winterbourne told the judge he quit Northrop, where he worked on a missile contract, out of fear for his personal safety, but could not elaborate because of Government secrecy.
In 1990 he lost a Republican primary contest to Robert J. Lagamarsino, then an incumbent Congressman representing California's 19th Congressional District. Mr. Winterbourne said before the primary that he was attracted by a Congressman's salary of more than $100,000. "I think it would be a good job," he said.

HEADLINE: North Korea Softens Nuclear Stance

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
In a move that keeps alive the possibility of a diplomatic solution to the escalating crisis over North Korea's nuclear program, Clinton Administration officials said today that North Korea had offered to allow international inspectors wider access to nuclear sites.
North Korea's latest diplomatic initiative falls short of American demands that it broaden its dialogue with South Korea. But Administration officials said tonight that North Korea hadpresented a proposal that offered hope that international economic sanctions might not be needed. North Korea has said it would view such sanctions as an act of war.
 
Presented at U.N. Meeting
 The new North Korean proposal was presented in a meeting today at the United Nations between North Korean diplomats and mid-level State Department officials. 
 It came against the backdrop of escalating tensions over North Korea's refusal to allow international inspectors to visit nuclear sites to make sure Pyongyang is not developing nuclear weapons. Angry oratory from Pyongyang about Western pressure on nuclear inspections has fueled fears of renewed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
The proposal was made in response to a Clinton Administration effort to forge a diplomatic solution, which was publicly touted by President Clinton last week.
Administration officials familiar with the North Korean offer said it was complex and appeared to establish links between the nuclear and political issues.
 
'Caution Is Prudent Course'
 Traveling with President Clinton in Bernalillo, N.M., the White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, would say only of the New York meeting: "We're not characterizing it. We're going to evaluate and talk to our allies about it."
Another White House official said: "When it comes to the North Koreans, we just think caution is the prudent course."
Behind the official veneer of caution, Administration officials said the North Korean proposal signaled movement on the thorny issue of inspections of nuclear facilities.
"They are willing to allow greater access than their previous proposal," an Administration official said. "It is a significant step."
Specifically, the officials said, the North Koreans said that inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency could have have unlimited access to most of the nuclear sites they have officially disclosed. The degree of access to a small number of other sites would have to be negotiated.
North Korea's nuclear program has become one of the most explosive issues on the Clinton Administration's foreign policy agenda. The Central Intelligence Agency believes that North Korea has already diverted enough plutonium for one or two crude bombs. For months, North Korea has added to Western fears by refusing to allow inspectors to visit all of its officially disclosed nuclear sites, raising concerns that it may try to acquire more bomb-grade material.
Washington has sought to persuade North Korea to agree to inspections through diplomacy, holding out the lure of improved economic and diplomatic relations. But at the same time, Washington has said it is prepared to ask the United Nations Security Council to impose international economic sanctions if the North Koreans refuse.
Time has been running out for a diplomatic solution because Hans Blix, the director general of the atomic energy agency, is approaching the point where he must make a formal declaration that the agency can no longer assure the "continuity of safeguards," meaning it can no longer track nuclear material in North Korea.
Already, film has run out of most of cameras installed by the agency at the nuclear site at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of the North Korean capital, and batteries in some cameras have gone dead.
While a formal deadline has not been set, Administration officials say that as a practical matter, North Korea must agree in the next several weeks to the visits at its officially disclosed sites.
What makes the North Koreans' new offer promising, Administration officials said, is that it appears to be signaling that, as part of a broader agreement, it will give inspectors much, if not all, of the access they require to make sure that North Korea is not using its nuclear plants to make plutonium for nuclear bombs.
In their previous offer, the North Koreans offered only to allow the international agency to replace the film and batteries in the cameras. Mr. Blix rejected that as insufficient.
What makes the North Korean offer something less than a major breakthrough, officials say, is that Pyongyang has still not agreed to give the agency the access it needs to determine how much plutonium it might have diverted in the past. To determine how much plutonium might be hidden, the agency wants to inspect two nuclear waste sites that are not on the list of official installations provided to the agency.
 
No Breakthrough on South
 Nor does the proposal put forward by North Korea today signal a major breakthrough its relations with South Korea. The United States wants North Korea to agree to an exchange of envoys with South Korea.
Washington has said that access by inspectors to North Korea's declared nuclear sites and the exchange of envoys are conditions that must be met before the United State will agree to a high-level meeting with the North to discuss the broader agenda of expanded economic and diplomatic relations.
As an added incentive for North Korea to meet the conditions for high-level talks, Washington has offered to cancel next year's annual military exercises with South Korea.
The complexity of the North Korea new proposal, however, means that Washington must consult with South Korea and Japan before responding and seek clarifications on key points, officials said.

HEADLINE: Scars of Mining Endure as Repair Fund Dries Up

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BULAN, Ky.

 BODY:
Like almost everybody who lives in Ajax Hollow, Charles Miller set his house high on the mountain, far above the winding road and out of the path of the unpredictable stream that floods its banks after heavy rain.
Then the hill that was his front yard melted away in a landslide last year. The slide, caused by the steady seepage of water from a coal mine abandoned decades ago, carried away so much dirt that Mr. Miller's front door is now only a few feet from the edge of a 100-foot cliff. 
 Sixteen years ago, as part of legislation to control strip mining, Congress established a fund financed by the coal industry to insure that money would be available to repair the damage caused by mining, like the landslide in front of Mr. Miller's home.
 
Money Used for Benefits
 But in the last several years, money from the fund, part of which is directed for emergency repairs, has declined as Congress and successive Administrations have diverted it to help offset the Federal budget deficit and to provide pension benefits for widows and orphans of union coal miners.
Last June, the part of the fund used for emergency repairs dried up, and the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement -- the Interior Department agency overseeing the $22 billion coal mining industry -- has made no new money available, even in Kentucky, where the problems are worst.
The office's field engineers here say they have repeatedly asked the Interior Department for help, even appealing directly to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in meetings with him last summer in Lexington, Ky. But the engineers say there has been no response.
Mr. Miller, a 30-year-old heavy-equipment operator who is out of work, is now coping with the consequences.
More than a year after the landslide on his property in Ajax Hollow, a construction crew was dispatched by the Office of Surface Mining. The crew recently laid heavy rocks across the hillside to stop the slide temporarily. But there is no money for permanent repairs.
The mud, sticky as chewed gum, is still moving down the steep slope, undermining Mr. Miller's driveway and threatening the house where he lives with his wife, Anna, and their daughter, Jessica Ann. The slide has made the steep path up to the house so unstable that the Millers may soon be cut off from their home.
His mother's house next door is falling into a widening crevice created by the slide. And his sister's house just down the road straddles the crevice and has been condemned.
"It's hard to tell whether it's going to help at all," Mr. Miller said of the emergency work. "They told me there wasn't any money to finish. But I wish they could have put a little more rock in to make it safer for us."
Federal engineers, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they said they feared reprisals from Washington, said the difficulties in solving Mr. Miller's emergency reflect longstanding problems in the Office of Surface Mining.
In Washington, the press spokesman for the agency, Alan A. Cole, said the field engineers were "committed in protecting the environment and people in the coal fields." But he added: "Congress's appropriations statutes tightly limit the Interior emergency-reclamation spending in any one state. There will always be more of these emergencies than dollars to fix them."
This year, in more than 70 hollows like this one scattered across the coal fields of eastern Kentucky, landslides caused by negligent practices at mines abandoned decades ago have destroyed homes and caused enormous environmental harm.
During the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Congress and the Interior Department's Inspector General investigated accusations of mismanagement in the Office of Surface Mining and produced a series of critical reports. The Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into whether the agency's director during the Bush Administration, Harry M. Snyder, interfered in the enforcement of the strip mining law.
When Mr. Babbitt became Interior Secretary 10 months ago, both the agency's staff and environmental groups hoped he would appoint a strong leader for the agency and provide a clearer mandate for protecting the environment. But engineers and residents here say that under Mr. Babbitt's tenure, conditions in the agency and in the coal fields have got no better and in some cases have grown worse.
"To this point Babbitt has backed off everything he told us he was going to do," said Sidney Cornett, a member of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, an environmental group based in Prestonsburg, Ky. "Things are going on just as they have, which isn't any good."
Mr. Babbitt's top deputies acknowledge that they had not paid enough attention to problems in the Office of Surface Mining. But they countered assertions that conditions in the agency and the coal fields had deteriorated under the Clinton Administration.
"We have tried to hold the line and keep things together, and that has been met with mixed reviews," said Bob Armstrong, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for land and minerals management. But he said that after just 10 months in office, "you're not going to clean up a genuine mess that took 12 years to develop."
The Office of Surface Mining "is a can of fishhooks," Mr. Armstrong said. He added, "Our efforts have been slower than we would like, but I would really take issue with the fact that it is worse."
Mr. Armstrong and the Federal engineers in Kentucky agree that perhaps the most visible problem at the Office of Surface Mining is that it has been leaderless for nearly a year. Robert Uram, a San Francisco lawyer who was a top Interior Department lawyer from 1975 to 1983, has been nominated by Mr. Babbitt to fill the post.
Coal industry executives praised the nomination, which will be considered by the Senate early next year. But environmentalists denounced it, saying that in his private practice Mr. Uram has represented mining companies seeking to avoid regulation.
The Interior Department's critics say they are also concerned that the Administration is considering a proposal by coal states to limit the ability of citizens to bring formal complaints against coal companies for polluting and causing safety hazards.
 
Concern for National Forests
 Conservationists are critical, too, of a Clinton Administration decision in September not to appeal a court ruling that lifted a ban on strip mining in the Wayne National Forest in Ohio. Robert More, an Interior Department lawyer, said the ruling would not set a precedent. But environmental lawyers said the court decision could pave the way for strip mining in national forests in eight states east of the Mississippi.
"If you had told me after the election that conditions were going to deteriorate under Clinton, I'd have said you were crazy," said L. Thomas Galloway, a Washington lawyer who helped write the 1977 Surface Mining Reclamation and Control Act, the Federal strip mining law. "But that's what's happened to some extent."
Of the industrial technologies the Interior Department oversees, perhaps none is more destructive than strip mining, in which thousands of tons of rock and dirt are heaved aside to lay bare seams of coal. Streams are polluted with sediment and acidic material, and wastes are dumped down mountainsides, causing slides.
Over time, water seeping under the wastes causes entire hillsides to move. Such dumping has been illegal since 1977, but landslides at abandoned strip mines are increasing. Federal inspectors said new slides were also likely at some existing mines because coal operators there were still dumping haphazardly, knowing that penalties are weak. A violation typically brings a fine of a few hundred dollars, they said.
The strip mining law was intended not only to end destructive practices but also to repair millions of acres damaged by mining and to respond to emergencies. The law required the coal industry to pay an environmental tax -- 35 cents a ton for coal from strip mines and 15 cents a ton for coal from underground mines.
 
Millions in Yearly Interest
 The Abandoned Mine Lands Fund now has $678 million collected from the coal tax and is accumulating interest of $35 million to $40 million a year. The growing total is being used to help offset the Federal deficit, said Kristi Heisel, a senior budget official in the Interior Department office. In addition, each year the tax raises $240 million, although Congress allows only $190 million to be spent for restoring land damaged by strip mining. Since 1992, Congress has directed that the interest and the remaining $50 million raised in coal tax revenues be used for pension benefits that are due the widows and orphans of workers from bankrupt coal companies.
These shifts upset construction laborers as well as environmentalists. In 1985, more than 1,000 people were working in eastern Kentucky to repair lands damaged by slides resulting from strip mines, according to Federal estimates. This fiscal year, only two projects, employing a handful of workers, were under way, one of them on Mr. Miller's property.
Construction workers said they were dismayed by the trend, especially in light of President Clinton's promise to link environmental restoration with economic rejuvenation.
"Congress took care 16 years ago to see that there would plenty of money to do the work," said John Basso, a construction contractor and former mine inspector from Hazard, Ky. "But now it's being spent for almost everything else than what it was originally intended. Now you tell me, is that right?"

HEADLINE: As Oil Prices Slide, OPEC Reaches Out for Cooperation

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Steep drops in oil prices, like those that followed OPEC's failure to agree on production cuts last week, are usually greeted with relief from consumers.
But the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in an apparent retreat from a seven-year policy of defending oil prices, has issued a tacit warning that lower oil prices are a double-edged sword that can wound all the world's producers, and eventually its consumers. 
 OPEC and oil industry officials said the organization was calling for an international effort to shore up oil prices, which fell to a three-year low of $15.31 a barrel in the United States on Monday, the first trading day after the OPEC meeting. Falling oil prices, they say, are a problem for all countries, not just the 12 members of the oil group.
 
 
Help From Industrial Nations
 The new strategy is to push industrial countries to cooperate in maintaining production levels and prices.
OPEC ministers argue that a steep fall in oil prices will depress the vast and powerful oil industries of the United States and Britain, as well as the many service industries dependent on them.
The organization also argues, and oil experts agree, that if earnings of large oil companies fall drastically,investment in exploration for oil will slow, creating the potential for an eventual shortage many years from now.
Among the less-developed nations that are oil producers, many count on oil revenues to pay for ambitious economic and social plans. A shortfall in financing for such programs could have a profound impact on Mexico, Oman, Yemen, Malaysia, Brunei, Colombia and especially Russia.
 
 
Impact on Russia
 "Oil exports represent the bulk of export revenues for the Russians," said Matthew Sagers, an oil affairs expert at Planecon, a Washington consulting firm. A steep drop in prices, he said, would affect "the pace of economic reforms, their ability to borrow money against oil sales and the stability of the currency, even if it eases the burden on the Russian consumer."
 Declining oil revenues have certainly hurt OPEC members. With inflation taken into account, oil prices today are nearly at 1986 levels. But the member nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, the group's largest producer, have undertaken costly civil projects they can now barely afford. Saudi Arabia has even resorted to borrowing to finance its projects.
The squeeze has led to political upheavals in many OPEC nations.
Algeria's economic situation, for example, has deteriorated sharply as oil revenues have dropped. The country faced a major uprising by unemployed youth in 1988 and is now locked in a virtual civil war intensified by the inability of the Government to improve economic conditions.
Nigeria, too, has been in political and economic turmoil for years, undergoing one military coup after another as its economy fails to keep up with the demands of a growing population.
And Venezuela's development program, sustained for decades with oil revenue, has collapsed.
The first indication of the new strategy became evident at the OPEC meeting of oil ministers in Vienna last week.
 
 
A One-Day Meeting
 During the one-day gathering, the organization's shortest in years, the 12 members served notice that they would not reduce their collective output below the present level of 24.5 million barrels a day. None of the individual nations, continuing to crave oil revenues, appeared willing to sacrifice.
Instead, the organization pointedly called in its official communique for "international cooperation to support prices."
OPEC officials confirmed that the notion of universal production restraint was spreading within the organization. "I think it is time for everyone to face their responsibility," a senior official said.
In a telephone interview today, Alirio Parra, Venezuela's energy minister, said OPEC was determined to "sweat it out."
"Most of us are not willing to sacrifice output any longer," he said. "There will be no OPEC production cuts before March, when we are scheduled to meet and evaluate the situation. Until then, we just have to wait and see."
A number of oil industry analysts warned, however, that unless OPEC returned immediately to its role of balancing supply and demand by reducing its collective output, it would risk seeing oil prices head toward $10 a barrel or lower.
 
 
'They Will Lose'
 "This is a deadly game; they will lose," Gary N. Ross, the chief executive of Petroleum Industry Research Associates of New York, said in an interview.
Mehdi Verzi, an oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, agreed in a telephone interview that oil prices would probably head lower.
"Oil prices have entered a new trading range that can only get lower in the absence of an OPEC production cut," Mr. Verzi said.
The recent failure to raise prices is only the latest example of the oil organization's dwindling power. Even though the OPEC share of oil sales has increased -- to nearly 25 million barrels of the world's estimated daily oil consumption of 68 million barrels -- prices have remained low.
In 1986, OPEC tried a similar strategy of maintaining production, but it eventually failed and prices fell to $10 a barrel, provoking a change of strategy in an emergency meeting.
 Analysts say the organization's latest quest to preserve its share of the oil market is misguided. OPEC, they say, would be better off seeking higher oil prices and cutting as much production as necessary,
"Cartels work if they sell oil," said John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "They don't work when they just try to preserve market shares."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Silver Hits a 3-Month High On Signs of Economic Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Silver prices soared to a three-month high yesterday amid signs that the American economy is growing fast enough to bolster demand from industrial users. Gold prices also rose.
Increased economic activity can lead to increased use of silver, which is used for a variety of industrial applications. 
 "Silver rallied on the favorable economic data," said Bette Raptopolous, analyst with Prudential Securities in New York.
Silver for March delivery, the most active futures contract, leaped 20 cents higher, to $4.85 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Meanwhile, the active February gold contract jumped $3, to $378.60 an ounce.
The Government reported that the nation's unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent in November from 6.8 percent the month before. In addition, its index of leading indicators jumped five-tenths of 1 percent in October, signaling continued improvement in the months ahead. And factory orders surged by 1.2 percent in October to their highest level ever.
Better economic news prompted new demand from commodity funds, traders said. "The funds are looking to economic reports as justification for buying or selling," said Daniel Weissman, head of precious metals trading at MTB Bank in New York.
Rising demand from the Middle East and India are also helping silver prices rise, traders said. Demand for silver in India could reach 100 million ounces this year, according to the New York consultants CPM Group, a 73 percent gain from the 57.8 million ounces used last year.
A growing economy and reduced import restrictions are pushing up demand for silver in India.
The collapse in oil prices is not having much of an effect on gold because of perceptions that the price drop is not likely to last long, Ms. Raptopolous said.
Crude oil has plunged about 29 percent this year, hitting a five-year low of $14.95 a barrel on Thursday amid concerns Iraqi crude exports will return to already glutted markets by the second quarter of 1994. Yesterday, crude oil for January delivery picked up 2 cents to settle at $14.97 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price of oil, a leading industrial commodity, is a key ingredient in future inflation. Investors often buy gold when inflation threatens the value of other assets.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks to Bring France Into Trade Pact's Fold

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 3

 BODY:
On Nov. 19, two days after the House of Representatives had approved the North American Free Trade Agreement, Joseph O'Mara, the chief United States trade negotiator for agricultural questions, arrived here with a startling new mandate: look for compromises with the French and make a long-stalled world trade accord happen.
His mission to Brussels, which started a process that has brought the European Community and the United States to an outline agreement on farm trade that opens the way for a GATT accord, reflected a key policy decision taken by President Clinton and the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, immediately after the passage of the North American pact, senior United States officials said. 
 This decision was a double one: to use the political momentum generated by the North American deal to take the Administration's free-trade message a decisive step further by concluding a languishing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord, and to accept that trade-offs might be necessary with the French and the rest of the European Community even on issues that Mr. Kantor had vowed would never be renegotiated.
"After Nafta, we formally recognized that the French were not isolated and that the community was in fact united in its resistance to the Blair House accord," a senior American official said, referring to an agreement reached last year in the Presidential guest house in Washington, which called for a cut of 21 percent over six years in subsidized European grain and food exports.
"So," the official added, "it became clear that if we wanted a world trade accord, and if we wanted more access for our agricultural and industrial goods in Europe, we would have to show some willingness to change Blair House."
Mr. O'Mara said that by the time he arrived here he was working on the basis that Blair House could be "adjusted," provided the concessions were offset by new trade advantages in such a way that the United States benefited over all.
"That is when the talking got serious and things really started to move," Mr. O'Mara said.
In Europe, Stuart Eizenstadt, the American Ambassador to the community, noted a sea change in the attitudes toward GATT at the time the North American agreement passed.
"Calls poured in to me from senior European officials saying how great the Nafta success was -- you could feel the dam bursting in terms of their readiness to make concessions," he said. "The doubts of European leaders about the free-trade commitment of the Clinton Administration dissolved, and their political courage increased."
 
'Now or Never'
 Certainly, it became clear to European Governments that it was now or never for the seven-year-old GATT negotiations, conceived to make it easier to trade goods and services around the world and thereby encourage the creation of more wealth.
Indeed, the very tortuousness of the approval of the North American pact revealed the importance of the Dec. 15 GATT deadline, after which President Clinton's "fast track" authority expires. That authority allows him to submit a world trade accord next year to Congress for approval without amendments.
In Brussels, Mr. O'Mara found an ally: Guy Legras, a Frenchman and the director general of the European Community's agriculture department.
Fluent in English and a graduate of the top French school, the Ecole Normale d'Administration, Mr. Legras had become convinced that on balance a compromise on agriculture and a GATT accord were in France's interest and the European Community's, European and American officials said.
 
Coaxing to a Compromise
 As a personal friend of Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who is the chief economic adviser to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France, Mr. Legras was particularly well placed to coax the French Government toward a compromise, a process reflected in increasingly conciliatory statements about the GATT standoff by Mr. Balladur over the last two weeks. Both Mr. Balladur and Mr. de Silguy are also graduates of the same school.
The essence of the trade-off between the United States and the European Community that would lead to the outline accord reached yesterday quickly became clear: greatly improved access in Europe for United States agricultural and industrial goods in exchange for a more gradual reduction in farm export subsidies and, in turn a less dramatic effect on the income of French farmers.
"Legras was prepared to take a hell of a lot of political heat on giving us greater market access if we'd take some heat on changing Blair House," Mr. O'Mara said, as he looked over a document outlining the farm accord called, "Peace Agreement between the United States and the European Community." Mr. Legras's secretary said he could not be reached for comment.
 
A Possible Breakthrough
 After the first negotiating session on Nov. 19, the two men met again this week, on Tuesday in Geneva, a day before Mr. Kantor's arrival in Brussels. By then they had drafted the main elements of a possible breakthrough -- an agreement described by Mr. Eizenstat, the Ambassador, as involving "giant cross-sectoral trade-offs."
The United States has secured what Mr. O'Mara called a "market access package significantly better than what we hoped for." It includes a provision that insures the valuable American corn exports to Spain, which had been threatened by community trade barriers, will remain at a level of up 2.3 million tons a year indefinitely.
Moreover, big tariff cuts on products including fruits, vegetables, nuts, processed turkey, almonds and pork should be worth several hundred million dollars in increased American exports, American officials estimated. Community grain tariffs would be kept at a level that should eventually allow American grain to enter Europe and still be priced competitively.
 
Aid to Trade Seen
 Further tariff cuts in areas including paper, wood, electronics, and nonferrous metals should also provide the United States with a significant lift to trade in Europe.
In return, however, Mr. Kantor has had to go further than he said he would. For whatever spin is ultimately put on it by the Clinton Administration -- words like clarification and elaboration are flying around -- the fact is the Blair House agreement that Washington refused to renegotiate has in fact been renegotiated in a way that will benefit European farmers.
The original agreement was for a cut of 21 percent over six years in grain and food export subsidies, taking as a base average the annual community exports in the 1986-90 period. For wheat, the most important product for the French, the 1986-90 figure was 17 million tons. So the cut was to be applied to 17 million tons, eventually reducing subsidized community wheat exports to slightly more than 13 million tons.
 
Cuts More Modest
 But in the proposed compromise, the cuts would apply instead to 1992 exports, which, in the case of wheat, totaled 20 million tons.
The result is that the the cuts in export levels will be more modest, allowing Europe's wheat farmers to export about eight million more tons over the six-year period than called for under the Blair House deal. At current market prices, the concession would be worth nearly $700 million to Europe.
"The off-the-cliff effect of the original agreement for European farm exporters has been avoided," Mr. O'Mara said, "but the integrity of Blair House has been maintained." The same target figure of slightly more than 13 million tons will still be achieved over the life of the agreement.
For other foods, including cheese, beef and dairy products, the same change will take place. The 1986-90 reference period will be replaced by the 1992 export figure as the basis for export cuts.
The United States has also extended by two years a so-called peace clause, which guarantees that the United States will not take trade action against community agricultural exporters for eight years instead of the six-year period in the initial agreement.
Although hesitations remain -- the French farm minister, Jean Puech, said today that "on the agricultural issue, it is still very insufficient" -- it appears that the essence of a deal has been done. If France balked at so late a stage, it would face tremendous pressure from community partners, including Germany and Britain.
"The agreement is pretty much in the bag on agriculture -- we're very close to the birth of the child," said Niko Wegter, the spokesman for the community's international affairs.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bond Prices Rise Despite Strong Jobs Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose sharply yesterday despite the sharp drop in unemployment last month, prompting speculation that the market's recent decline may be bottoming.
The 30-year Treasury bond jumped 19/32 of a point, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.23 percent, from 6.28 percent late Thursday. 
 The 7- and 10-year Treasury notes also posted solid gains, while shorter-term issues advanced slightly.
The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate in November dropped to 6.4 percent from 6.8 percent in October -- the biggest improvement in a decade.
"I'm surprised it didn't unnerve the market more than it did," said Dana Johnson, head of market analysis at First Chicago Capital Markets in Chicago.
News of economic strength tends to depress bond prices because stronger growth can aggravate inflation pressures. Higher inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities. But many bond traders had already anticipated the news of stronger growth, selling securities and pushing down prices in recent days, analysts said.
"I think the bond market has factored in so much bad news, present and future, we are probably near the bottom" of the recent price decline, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation.
Contributing to yesterday's rally were strategies by traders trying to unwind speculative positions.
In recent days, traders betting on a Treasury market decline had borrowed bonds and immediately sold them. Yesterday, when it became clear that bond prices had finished declining for now, these short sellers bought bonds and paid off their loans.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.09 to 1,307.37.

Dollar Rallies, Then Falls, When Traders Take Profits

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday as traders moved to cash in on an early rally that started after the robust employment report was released.
"People were trying to take profits before the weekend," said David De Rosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "The dollar got hit hard." 
 The dollar had been steady in Asian and European trading, but it jumped in New York trading to a four-month high against the German mark after the Labor Department said the economy created 208,000 jobs in November, more than many traders expected. It fell abruptly as traders tried to take advantage of the rally.
After trading as high as 1.7286 marks, the dollar finished at 1.7210 marks in New York, down from 1.7225 marks on Thursday. The dollar also fell to 108.60 Japanese yen in New York from 108.90 yen.
The early rally sputtered in part because traders had already purchased large amounts of dollars, betting the employment report would be strong, said Alfonso Alejo, senior proprietary trader at Sakura Bank.
"The whole planet was long dollars," Mr. Alejo said. "There was no one else left to buy them."
The dollar has risen more than 8 percent against the mark since mid-October, buoyed by a string of positive United States economic reports. With expectations high for a robust recovery, it will take even better growth to push the dollar higher, traders said.
Investors often buy dollars after strong economic reports, betting that stronger growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates to control inflation. Higher rates make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive.
Some dollar buyers were discouraged yesterday because the Labor Department lowered its estimate of new jobs created in October to 147,000 from the 177,000 reported last month, making November's gains less impressive.
Speculation that European central banks were selling dollars for marks to adjust reserves also helped knock the dollar off its highs today, said Peter Michaels, a trader at Fuji Bank.
"Some of the European central banks have dollars to sell and marks to buy," Mr. Michaels said. "It's not a lot, but it's enough to spook the market."

HEADLINE: Want to Reduce Those Tax Bills for 1993? Only 27 Days Left;
Capital Gains Look Attractive, But May Lead Investors Astray

BYLINE: By FRANCIS FLAHERTY

 BODY:
"Eat your vegetables!" If you ignored this parental order as a child, you probably got to hear "The Boy Who Was Too Weak to Play Baseball" or some other, equally alarming tale.
In similar fashion, investment advisers issue stern orders, a main one being, Don't let taxes drive your investments! "Tax considerations in investments should be just that -- a consideration," said Terry J. Siman, the president of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners. For the heedless, advisers trot out scary stories worthy of Mom and Dad. A favorite: "Young Couple's Tax-Free Portfolio Eaten by Inflation." 
 Such stories are more common now because the new Federal tax law widens the gap between tax rates on ordinary income and long-term capital gains. Formerly, the top ordinary-income rate was 31 percent. But beginning this year the rate rises to 36 percent for single taxpayers earning at least $115,000, and married taxpayers earning at least $140,000, and to 39.6 percent for those earning $250,000 or more. With the capital gains rate unchanged at 28 percent (or less for people in lower ordinary-income brackets), the gap can be 11.6 percentage points instead of 3.
Knowing the new law will excite investors, advisers are emphasizing that even though the gap is wider, exploiting it will yield only slim tax savings. For example, by redirecting a $100,000 investment to earn a 5 percent return in long-term capital gains instead of dividends, a taxpayer in the 36 percent bracket will save a mere $400.
In a zealous search for tax savings, an investor may also lose sight of important investment principles. Older investors often need safe, income-producing investments. But tempted by the rate gap, they might put too much money in growth investments for favorably taxed capital gains.
True. But if pushed a bit, advisers admit there is some room for tax maneuvers within the confines of an investment plan. And they have already mapped out some.
One tactic is to "unmix" long and short capital gains and losses, said Stuart Kessler, an accountant at Goldstein Golub Kessler & Company in New York. When only 3 percentage points were at stake, people had little reason to distinguish between long-term capital gains, accrued on assets held more than a year and taxed at no more than 28 percent, and short-term gains, treated like ordinary income.
The wider gap raises the stakes. For a taxpayer in the 39.6 percent bracket, a dollar of long-term gain is worth 72 cents after taxes, compared with 60.4 cents for a dollar of ordinary income. So, at year-end, if the taxpayer has realized a net long-term gain, he may benefit by deferring any capital losses that might offset that gain until January. Why? Because a 72-cent dollar is the best after-tax dollar he can get -- about 20 percent better than the 60.4-cent dollar. Not knowing what next year will bring, the taxpayer should take that dollar now.
But do this only if the loss can be deferred safely. "The market can go nuts in 30 days," Mr. Kessler warned.
Index mutual funds offer another way to exploit the rate gap. These funds have low portfolio turnover: They make few transactions because the indexes on which they are based seldom change. Thus, more of their assets are likely to be held at least a year -- and get taxed at 28 percent -- than are the assets of other funds.
To be true to your investment plan, "Look only for an index fund serving approximately the same purpose as your current fund," advised Madeline I. Novek of Novos Planning Associates in New York. There are 61 index funds available to fit investor needs, from the DFA Japanese Small Company index fund to the Vanguard Index 500 fund of the Standard & Poor's Corporation stocks.
Retirement funds can be shuffled to play the tax gap, too, said Lyle Benson, an accountant with Coyne & McClean, in Baltimore. The reason: People often have some retirement money in taxable accounts and some in tax-advantaged accounts, like individual retirement accounts and 401(k)'s at work.
"Put the ordinary-income producers in the tax-protected accounts," and the long-term-gain producers in the taxable ones, he said. "But keep overall asset allocation constant."
Other strategies -- buying stocks instead of funds to better control when capital gains are realized -- can also "work" the gap. But, even as they described the ploys, advisers emphasized the slim savings and danger of distorted investments.
Why are people so tempted by something that offers small gains and big risks? "Because taxes are a certainty and certainties are comforting," Ms. Novek said. "But investing is uncertain."

HEADLINE: U.S. Should Regulate Corporate Maneuvers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Missing from your discussion of the contest between Viacom and QVC over acquisition of Paramount (Business Day, Nov. 25, 26) is whether a decision of such importance to the nation's communications systems, its economy and Paramount's employees and shareholders should be made under Delaware law. 
 As noted in one of the articles, Delaware courts and Delaware law are generally considered to be biased in favor of management and against the interests of shareholders and other corporate constituencies. This is not surprising since it is managers who decide where to incorporate or reincorporate. In the competition for incorporation and license fees, Delaware has led the race to the bottom of corporate managers' responsibility.
An anomaly of United States law is the absence of Federal control over corporate maneuvers, which affect commerce and the lives of thousands of employees through the dismemberments that frequently follow leveraged buyouts and other transfers of corporate assets. That anomaly can be appreciated by looking at the detailed regulation of labor union activity by the Federal Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act and the National Labor Relations Act.
Federal law now governs the sale of corporate securities. Isn't it time to require that the "internal" activities of large corporations, perhaps those with assets of $500 million or more, be governed by Federal, not state law?

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE FALLS IN NEW SIGN OF BRISK RECOVERY

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
In what analysts called clinching proof of economic speed-up, the nation's unemployment rate fell four-tenths of a point in November, to 6.4 percent, the biggest monthly improvement in 10 years.
The unexpected decline resulted mainly from strong job creation that removed 534,000 people from the unemployment ranks, according to a survey of the nation's households. Many of those people returned to jobs from which they had been laid off. Adult men were the principal beneficiaries. 
 Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, called today's report from the Labor Department "almost uniformly positive."
 
 
Leading Indicators Gain
 The encouraging jobs data came as the Commerce Department reported that the Government's main forecasting tool, the index of leading economic indicators, climbed five-tenths of 1 percent in October, its third consecutive increase after seesawing through the first seven months of the year. The department also announced a third straight solid gain for orders to American factories, which rose 1.2 percent in October.
And the nation's auto makers reported a 10.4 percent gain in vehicle sales in November, with many executives and analysts predicting that the recovery that began in the spring would prove long-lasting. [Page 37.]
But it was the stunning jobs report, which is considered the best single measure of economic performance, that captured the most attention. It reflected job gains in most parts of the economy except the military and apparel industries.
The report also showed job gains in all geographic regions, including drops in unemployment in both New York and New Jersey. [Page 48.]
 
 
'More Sustained' Recovery
 Employers nationwide reported adding 208,000 payroll jobs, and the factory workweek expanded to its longest since World War II, reflecting increased industrial activity. Moreover, fewer job holders had to settle for part-time work as full-time jobs became more plentiful.
"All of the reports we've gotten in the past several weeks confirm that the pace of recovery has picked up," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chief economic adviser to President Clinton, referring to upbeat statistics on retail sales, industrial production, orders for durable goods, home sales, consumer confidence and even incomes. The recovery, she added, had become "steadier" and "more sustained."
Despite the strengths shown today, the inflation-sensitive bond market responded favorably, and and interest rates fell. This, in part, reflected the fact that the 208,000 rise in payroll jobs, based on the separate household survey on which the unemployment rate is based, was only moderately greater than the 175,000 or so that most analysts had expected. Stocks, meanwhile, rose slightly.
Another factor in the markets' reaction is that inflation remains well contained, with little upward pressure on wages or commodities. Today's labor-market report showed that average hourly earnings climbed just two-tenths of 1 percent in November and 2.3 percent over the last 12 months, somewhat less than the rise in consumer prices.
And if the 15 percent drop in oil prices over the last six weeks were sustained, Ms. Tyson noted, this would knock half a percentage point off the 1994 inflation rate.
Still another reason for level-headedness in the financial markets may have been recognition that the decline in the unemployment rate was almost certainly overstated; it partly reflected a decline in the labor force of 81,000 people -- that following a huge October surge of 739,000 additional workers.
And Thomas J. Plewes, a senior official, predicted the four-tenth of a point improvement would shrink, probably by half, after seasonal adjustment factors had received their annual revision next month.
Today's figures were not affected by the change in methodology by which the survey of households is conducted. In mid-November the Government announced that a pilot program using the new procedures indicated a possible half-point rise in the national unemployment rate when the new system is introduced with January figures to be reported in early February. Among other things, the new system will curb a bias that has led to under-reporting of job-market activity by women and over-reporting of it by men.
 
 
Ammunition for Optimists
 Still, today's report provided lots of ammunition for optimists. Even California, which still suffers from military retrenchment, posted a statistically significant 1.2-point decline in its jobless rate, to 8.6 percent. In November 1992, 10 percent of the California work force was unemployed.
Other hefty improvements came in Illinois, down 1.9 points, to 5.9 percent, and North Carolina, down nine-tenths of a point, to 3.9 percent.
One of the clearest signs of a stronger labor market was in manufacturing, which added 30,000 jobs after a small October gain. Before that there had been seven straight declines in factory jobs totaling 256,000.
And while the factory workweek and factory overtime edged up just one-tenth of an hour, or six minutes, both these traditional harbingers of new hiring hit records. At 41.7 hours, the average workweek has not been this long since the late stages of World War II, and 4.4 hours of overtime is the most since this data series was begun in 1956.
 
 
Health Care Costs
 Officials said employers seemed finally to be ending their tendency -- at a time of uncertainty about the cost of medical benefits -- to avoid adding new workers by pushing existing staff harder.
Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, mused today that new hiring might be encouraged by requiring overtime hours to be paid at double or triple regular pay instead of the current one and a half times.
In addition to factory and other worker recalls, analysts said, job growth last month also included construction workers who normally would have been laid off in the autumn but who were kept on longer this year because low interest rates have helped generate more business.
Construction added 27,000 jobs, health services added 32,000 (though none in hospitals) and finance, insurance and real estate added 27,000, the most robust of three straight advances.
 
 
Retail Sales Jobs
 Retail sales jobs rose by less than is customary for the month, thereby posting a 17,000 decline after seasonal adjustment, the report also showed.
The variation among demographic groups, however, was unusually widespread, with the unemployment rate for adult men falling five-tenths of a point while the rate for adult women eased a negligible one-tenth of a point. Each now shows a rate of 5.8 percent.
The rate for whites and Hispanic workers eased six-tenths of a point and 1.1 points, respectively, while the rate for blacks climbed eight-tenths of a point, to 12.5 percent, the same as in August.
Among the 11 components of the Commerce Department's leading, or forecasting index, the only one to decline was the money supply. An advance of such breadth is very rare, analysts noted. The leading index was revised this month to reflect new weightings.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 10, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the main front-page article on Saturday, about the Government's employment report for November, misidentified the Labor Department survey that showed a gain of 208,000 payroll jobs in the month. It was the survey of employers, not households; the separate household survey determines the unemployment rate.

HEADLINE: Editor's Choice

 BODY:
THE Christmas spirit is once again triumphant in the roster of books chosen by the editors of the Book Review as the best of the year: volumes of both fiction and nonfiction filled with collapsed empires, disappearing species, civil wars, guerrilla wars, homelessness, imprisonment, exile, moral decay, narcotics, random violence, an acutely discomforting villain -- and very large animals, some of which may slam you around because they've silently decided they just don't like you.
Anyone listening to the grumbling arguments in weekly meetings for more than three months would hardly have accused the editors of charity, at least toward one another, but they ended up choosing more than half again as many books as they did the year before, from a pool of nominees of the same size. 
 Books nominated for the best-books list were taken from those reviewed here since the preparation of last year's list, and the descriptions given are drawn from the reviews. Six of the 14 chosen by the 11 editors from 37 nominated are fiction: two novels and four collections of stories. Three of these were originally written in languages other than English, and only one was written by an American.
Of the eight nonfiction volumes, only one was not written in English (although it was written in the United States), and only three were not written by Americans. Notably missing from this year's list are histories and biographies, both of which have been prominent among best books for several years. Perhaps one volume here, about Shylock, might be counted a biography, the character possessing so much more reality than most historical figures.
The Best Books are not included among the Notable Books of the Year. The long docket of those begins on page 42.
 
ACROSS THE BRIDGE
Stories.
By Mavis Gallant.
Random House.
The world Mavis Gallant creates in these 11 stories is urban (mostly Paris or Montreal), deeply conservative and, for all its urbanity, old-fashioned. In the title story, timeless as a fairy tale, everything is stock -- except the writing. The material is a staple of popular romantic fiction, which Mrs. Gallant subverts with intelligence and wit. Not every story here is that successful. This writer is a scalpel-sharp anatomist of stupidity, and while this skill can make her work very funny, occasionally her humor works at the expense of her characters. But she has few equals. One story here, "Forain," is as close to perfection as possible, a marvel of wit, feeling and tact in which each detail is exact and telling. That and the title story alone would make this book one of the best collections of fiction in years.

BALKAN GHOSTS
A Journey Through History.
By Robert D. Kaplan.
St. Martin's Press.
The suspicious, angry people of Bulgaria, Greece, Albania, Romania and what was once Yugoslavia -- especially uprooted peasants with fantasy-enriched histories -- think they are fatefully alien to one another, but Robert D. Kaplan, a journalist who has reported on this region for several magazines, demonstrates with gusto that they do indeed form an unhappy whole. The Balkans, boiling into fury once again, have a special fascination, for Communism not only failed to resolve any of the region's historical controversies (layers of them built up for more than a thousand years); it suppressed and thus magnified them, so now it seems the mixture of memory and folklore that is popular history has suddenly sprung out of a forgotten grave into appalling life. Mr. Kaplan occasionally falls prey to gullibility, but the fantastic stories he gathers bring one closer to understanding the real history of the Balkans.

BEFORE NIGHT FALLS
By Reinaldo Arenas.
Viking.
In this memoir, Reinaldo Arenas -- a gifted, untaught novelist who was denied recognition in Castro's Cuba, and imprisoned and tortured as a homosexual before he escaped from the island in the 1980 Mariel boatlift -- links his personal history with a political meditation on his country, told from the point of view of an abandoned son. The role is right: Arenas, who had AIDS, committed suicide in New York in 1990, leaving a note that accused Fidel Castro not only of Cuba's tragedy but of his own. His book reveals Cuban officialdom as unprincipled and corrupt in its liteary politics, and in its macho sexual pretensions. Arenas was one of the world's great loners, and was almost as alienated in America as in Cuba, finding the very Americans he wanted to be closest to -- intellectuals and gay men -- morally flabby. What makes his memoir so poignant and haunting is what he never acknowledges explicitly: that his standard of liberation was absolute, his innocence made him vulnerable to unending hurt, and the freedom he sought exists nowhere.

In more than 80 stories filling a thousand pages and written over 30 years, one might expect to find some sameness. But William Trevor's pure intensity of attention finds an endless new set of subjects and tones in a world worn smooth by handling. His is work of impeccable strength and a profundity rare in the history of short fiction. Because his prose is as plain and natural as daylight, his tremendous achievement seems effortless. Though he shares much of the richness of his countrymen Yeats and Joyce, he avoids their sourness of spirit, and though his vision of the human tragedy can be as dark as that of the Greeks, it is also deeply, though never entirely, comic. There is always the rising hint of faint laughter here. His perfect sympathy with human beings lays out the tragic implications or the mere foolishness of the simple Irish people he writes about, but a native tenderness spares them his malice.

THE FATE OF THE ELEPHANT
By Douglas H. Chadwick.
Sierra Club Books.
National Geographic sent Douglas H. Chadwick, a wildlife biologist, out to make a survey of elephants everywhere, and his book is a kind of elephantocentric view of the world. What emerges is the conviction that preserving elephants is closely related to protecting human beings; both species use up habitat voraciously, and both adapt cunningly to the devastation they leave behind. Mr. Chadwick glides right over some critical issues, but he has good moral taste and an expansive, shrewd knowledge of the world lights his tour of elephant lands: Kenya, Tanzania, Central Africa, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Zimbabwe, even Hong Kong and Japan, where the ivory markets grow despite the world's efforts to restrain them.

THE ISLAND
Three Tales.
By Gustaw Herling.
Viking.
The three tales in this volume rightfully belong to the canon of great works of literature. Gustaw Herling, who lives in Italy but writes in his native Polish, has taken a long time to come to the attention of the world. Until the fall of Communism, his fiction was banned entirely in Poland, and in the West it has been translated only very slowly. Yet any reader approaching these stories will find a timeless world like no other. A Herling story is multilayered, complex and told in a detached voice that bespeaks a wonderful air of courtesy toward the reader; this writeris a supremely civilized man. In each story -- two of them connect morally and physically the actions of people deeply separated by time and distance -- he probes with thrilling delicacy the infinite and eternal consequences of human decisions and intentions. Mr. Herling's vision is humanistic, compassionate, illuminating; it can leave one speechless with gratitude.

JESUS' SON
Stories.
By Denis Johnson.
Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
In this tour de force of compression and moral entropy, Denis Johnson uncovers a universe under the spell of addiction, malevolence, faith and uncertainty. His 11 stories demand to be read like a novel structured along a kind of Cubist chronology. The narrator is a kin of some of Samuel Beckett's great spokesmen, unable to construct a well-made story, unable even to get the facts of his own life straight as he staggers from habit to addiction, participating along the way in abortions, car crashes, drug deals and murder. Mr. Johnson is always compassionate and skeptical. The damaged psyches of his characters keep his readers off balance, and often laughing, but even the sense of humor here seems deranged, menacing; it is all part of the admirable, startling art of this fearless detective of the tortured paths of Americans' moral lives.

JUDGE ON TRIAL
By Ivan Klima.
Alfred A. Knopf.
Ivan Klima's book, first circulated as an underground text in the 1970's in Czechoslovakia, is likely to survive as the key version of the late-20th-century Eastern European political novel, rivaled only by the work of Milan Kundera. Conceived with great intellectual and moral ambition, this many-layered story about a man on the inside of the old regime who acts prudently in his emptiness places the moment of Communist repression in a vastly larger history and thus raises hope for the political orders of the future. This is work in the tradition of Elias Canetti and Arthur Koestler, an honest examination of the agonized pain of Middle European history that suggests that it still has something to disclose to the moral future.

THE LAST PANDA
By George B. Schaller.
The University of Chicago Press.
Although George B. Schaller says this sinewy book was "reluctantly written," no one who cares about life on earth should miss it. In 1980 Mr. Schaller became the first scientist the Chinese Government had ever allowed to study the panda in the wild, and the experience proved far more difficult than his celebrated studies of lions and gorillas. No scientist is better at bringing the reader into his world. He has the gifts of clarity, eloquence and passion, and they make some of what he reveals unnerving. Human efforts to save the panda have been not only late and halfhearted, but so often fundamentally loony that one is embarrassed for our species. "The panda has not evolved to amuse humankind," he warns. And why has humankind evolved? That question the reader cannot avoid.

LENIN'S TOMB
The Last Days of the Soviet Empire.
By David Remnick.
Random House.
A confluence of observation, digging, knowledge and reflection that is classy journalism, this book is a record of almost four years beginning in 1988 when David Remnick, a Washington Post reporter, was assigned to Moscow. In it the Russian democrats, now a beleaguered cadre, come to the fore; these were their best years. A gallery of figures emerges, not all of them remembered much now in the West, sketched with a force close to Balzac. And while the author is sometimes too sentimental, he gives sweeping panoramas of collective farm workers, laborers and miners. He argues convincingly that what did in the old Soviet leadership, right down through Mikhail Gorbachev, was its unending assault not only on people but on memory. By making a secret of history, it made its people increasingly distracted, and desperate, until they overthrew it.

MAZURKA FOR TWO DEAD MEN
By Camilo Jose Cela.
New Directions.
Camilo Jose Cela, the 1989 winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, constructs here perhaps his most mesmerizing fiction, about life during the first four decades of this century in his native Galicia, a life so brutal that the Spanish Civil War, when it occurs, seems a mere continuation of the ordinary. This is a seamless world, with no distinction between human life and nature, and the narrative voices, uniformly vulgar but never obscene, have a monotony that gives them a kind of liturgical cadence, endowing them with an aura of truth. These are the voices of classical tragedy and the argumentative voices of the law; thus they give an active role to death in the development of a fiendishly haunting story based on the simple premise that if you kill someone, sooner or later you will pay because the universe will be justified.

A MOMENT OF WAR
A Memoir of
the Spanish Civil War.
By Laurie Lee.
The New Press.
Laurie Lee is 79, but in his youth this English poet joined the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, and now, before his sight fails entirely, he sets down what happened. More than most, this was a war fueled by illusion; Mr. Lee had his share of that. He was also an unlicked country lad, and his ignorance made him adaptable, protected him. He is not ignorant now. His enormously sophisticated book, a testament to the morality and weakness of humanity, has the plainness of Orwell but the metaphorical soaring of a poem. There is an echo of the 1930's in the prose, but you can hear the maturity of the man and writer as he traces the steps of a youthful combatant whose thoughts are mostly silent to the reader. This has the effect of making "A Moment of War" the reader's own story, and the terrible judgment about life that came to Mr. Lee when he finally killed a man a judgment of the reader.

SHYLOCK
A Legend and Its Legacy.
By John Gross.
Simon & Schuster.
Villainy is good drama, so Shylock has become a touchstone of acting through the centuries. But Shylock is larger than "The Merchant of Venice," larger than theater; and since Hitler showed the world the natural end of anti-Semitism, actors, directors and audiences have all cringed from gazing directly at the Shylock whom Shakespeare created. John Gross, in a book that whisks away a whole world of sophistry, looks at 400 years of Shylocks; it is not only a study of a literary masterpiece, but of history, psychology and changing mores; of imagination, intelligence and evil; of Henry VIII, Elizabeth I and Freud; Edwin Booth, Henry Irving and Olivier. By returning the play, and its performances, to the realities from which they rose, Mr. Gross returns it, and Shylock, to us. This is a singular gift of restoration and a rare example of the gentle power of impassioned reason presented in measured language.

TRAVELS WITH LIZBETH
By Lars Eighner.
St. Martin's Press.
This modern autobiography of a supertramp re-creates in lavish detail the grammar, outlook and economy of the unhoused life as its author, a fortyish hitchhiker, zigzags between Austin, Tex., and Los Angeles. Lars Eighner has a weird prose style, which he uses with deadpan irony; his voice is by turns grandiloquent and simple, and his vision of the world involves abrupt distortions of scale, as people who are all-important at one moment shrink to ciphers in the next. Objects stir him more than human beings; he can rhapsodize over found scraps, like the personal computer, fished out of a Dumpster, on which he wrote this book. Lizbeth is his dog. She shares his wild life, and, while his language about her is often strangely distant, it allows her to become a compelling character in his odyssey -- as strange as any he encounters.

THE QUEEN'S THROAT: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire. By Wayne Koestenbaum. (Poseidon, $22.) A dazzling, high-spirited anatomy of the "opera queen," the homosexual fan for whom opera is a passion and an obsession.
RHYTHM AND THE BLUES: A Life in American Music. By Jerry Wexler and David Ritz. (Knopf, $25.) Mr. Wexler, the wily man who defined the role of the modern record producer, reflects on a lifetime in the music business -- and his doings with the likes of Aretha Franklin, Phil Spector and Otis Redding.
THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT. By David Hockney. Edited by Nikos Stangos. (Chronicle Books, $35.) The second volume of the artist's reminiscences, tape-recorded by Mr. Stangos, is a long, perky monologue -- autobiography with ruminations about art.
THE THEATRICAL NOTEBOOKS OF SAMUEL BECKETT. General editor, James Knowlson. Volume 2: ENDGAME. Edited by S. E. Gontarski. Volume 3: KRAPP'S LAST TAPE. Edited by James Knowlson.

THEIRS WAS THE KINGDOM: Lila and DeWitt Wallace and the Story of the Reader's Digest. By John Heidenry. (Norton, $29.95.) A hugely detailed, engagingly written history of a single bright idea and the "preacher's kids" who turned that idea into a multibillion-dollar global enterprise.
 TO GIVE THEM LIGHT: The Legacy of Roman Vishniac. Edited by Marion Wiesel. (Simon & Schuster, $45.) The sting of the nearly 140 black-and-white photographs of Eastern European Jews, taken secretly between 1936 and 1938 to warn the world of the Jews' doom, is that they are so understated -- portraits of ordinary lives that would soon be no more.
TRAGIC MUSE: Rachel of the Comedie-Francaise. By Rachel M. Brownstein. (Knopf, $30.) A discerning analysis of the life of the Alsatian waif Rachel Felix, who dominated French theater and much of French society in the mid-19th century.

Biography & Memoir
 
 ALWAYS RUNNING. La Vida Loca: Gang Days in L.A. By Luis J. Rodriguez. (Curbstone Press, $19.95.) A chilling, unblinking testimony of the poet's life in the 1960's, when he was running with gangs in East Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley.
ANTHONY TROLLOPE. By Victoria Glendinning. (Knopf, $30.) A smart and winning biography, stuffed with details that come from knowing all of Trollope's work and taking the Victorians seriously.
THE BEGINNING OF THE JOURNEY: The Marriage of Diana and Lionel Trilling. By Diana Trilling. (Harcourt Brace, $24.95.) A conversational, direct, dignified memoir that perforates the hygienic Trilling package. The couple, once revered for their reasonableness, also deserve high marks for coping with the irrational.

DOROTHY L. SAYERS: Her Life and Soul. By Barbara Reynolds. (St. Martin's, $25.95.) By simply relying on her subject's letters, Ms. Reynolds lays to rest the charges that Sayers was a classist snob.

FIDEL CASTRO. By Robert E. Quirk. (Norton, $35.) An indictment, often devastating, of its ego-driven subject and his works, drawn chiefly from public materials by orthodox scholarship.
FLY FISHING THROUGH THE MIDLIFE CRISIS. By Howell Raines. (Morrow, $22.) The editorial page editor of The New York Times nobly describes his passionate fishermanship and the fly-fishing guru who helped him attain it.
FDR. Into the Storm 1937-1940: A History. By Kenneth S. Davis. (Random House, $35.) Mr. Davis's fourth and penultimate volume on Franklin D. Roosevelt casts him as a weak leader in his second Presidential term. The encyclopedic documentation is unmatched.

THE LONG-DISTANCE RUNNER: An Autobiography. By Tony Richardson. (Morrow, $25.) This high-spirited memoir carries the film maker, who died of AIDS in 1991, up to 1985 and reads like the ruminations of a man counting up his good times for the last time.
THE MAN WHO WASN'T MAIGRET: A Portrait of Georges Simenon. By Patrick Marnham. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) A thoughtful, convincing account of a man whose diligence -- 76 Maigret books, 117 other "serious" novels and more than 200 others -- makes his claim to have made love to 10,000 women seem plausible. After his mother died, he stopped writing. Odd.
MARGUERITE YOURCENAR: Inventing a Life. By Josyane Savigneau. (University of Chicago, $25.) Yourcenar (1903-87), author of "Memoirs of Hadrian," intense, cerebral, fascinated by sexual ambiguity, has found a perfect biographer in the patient, wise, industrious Ms. Savigneau.

BYLINE: By Francine Prose; Francine Prose's most recent book is a collection of stories, "The Peaceable Kingdom."

 BODY:
READING travel narratives, we may find ourselves pausing to wonder precisely how great travel writing (say, Rebecca West's "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon") differs from the neighbors' slide show of the family's five days in Rome. In neither case do we take the journey, but only hear about it secondhand; in both cases, selected moments and views have been chosen for us, so unlike the total immersion we seek when we travel ourselves.
Having felt our eyes glaze over when dear ones describe their sojourns abroad, we can only marvel at the skill of those rare writers we'll allow to travel for us. Often, they are people to whom odd or exciting things happen, authors who can observe and describe, deep thinkers or snappy prose stylists. Agreeable or crabby, their dispositions hardly matter so long as they are smart, aware, fired with curiosity and untroubled by the more banal tourist prejudices and anxieties. A survey of recent travel books inspires us to consider the chasm between Rebecca West's accounts of Dubrovnik or Mostar and the slides of the kids next door, posed in front of the Colosseum. 
 Rebecca West is only one of many eloquent women travelers represented in Mary Morris's anthology MAIDEN VOYAGES: Writings of Women Travelers (Vintage, paper, $14), edited in collaboration with her husband, Larry O'Connor. One can breeze through Ms. Morris's introduction ("Women, I have come to feel, move through the world differently than men. . . . The fear of rape . . . most dramatically affects the ways women move through the world") and hop on board with Boxcar Bertha, riding the rails in 1930's Illinois with hobos of both sexes. In 1717, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu notes how Turkish women hide under their veils when sneaking off to meet their lovers. A century and a half later, Mabel Sharman Crawford's "Through Algeria" pleads for a woman's right to tourism, a right taken for granted by the boy-crazy Margaret Foun taine, encouraging and coyly eluding a baron from Palermo, and by the intrepid Mary Kingsley, playfully writing about using salt to dislodge thirsty African leeches. ("It was most comic to see us salting each other; but in spite of the salt's efficacious action I was quite faint from loss of blood.")
There are lots of wild adventures here: Alexandra David-Neel uses a Tibetan Buddhist breathing technique to raise her body heat and keep from freezing to death. In China, Emily Hahn becomes the opium addict she "always wanted to be." Dressed as a man, Sarah Hobson rides a moped through Iran. There is also plenty of attitude: Mary McCarthy complaining about the noise in Florence, Mrs. F. D. Bridges slandering polygamists in Salt Lake City in 1880: "Two rather depressed-looking wives, ugly middle-aged women in poke bonnets, holding unlovely babies, sat in the back, while the new young wife, with her baby in smart hat and feathers, occupied the front seat with their lord and master; not a pleasant or poetical domestic picture; and they were all so ugly!"
Reading the pieces in chronological order provides a mini-history of travel writing. We're reminded that it once was enough for a writer simply to go somewhere and describe the landscape and the exotic local costumes. But in the age of packaged safari tours, the stakes are dangerously higher. Now the travel writer must do something life-threatening or original, or at least stick around long enough to know more than the average tourist.
Cathy N. Davidson is the latter sort of writer. She made four lengthy trips to Japan in the 1980's, and 36 VIEWS OF MOUNT FUJI: On Finding Myself in Japan (Dutton, $20) documents her passion to understand what she found there. This appealing book is always sincere -- and often better than that. Ms. Davidson taught at Kansai Women's University in the suburbs halfway between Kobe and Osaka, and no one could have tried harder to fathom Japanese culture. The result is a series of illuminations not unlike the sudden break in the clouds that finally lets her glimpse Mount Fuji from the window of a bullet train.
In her English class, Ms. Davidson's students must struggle so hard to speak that they have no energy left for decorum or concealment; asked to tell the class about their summer, they detail the gastrointestinal woes endured over the school vacation. A chance encounter in a restaurant reveals the Japanese obsession with foreign table manners. Ms. Davidson's friends take her to places ordinary visitors rarely see: to the sacred grove of a priestess on Okinawa, and to a retreat at which the writer bathes with the Japanese Women's Studies Society, where she notes the women's lack of shame and their "ritual attention to the body." When her husband's brother and sister-in-law are killed in a car accident in Canada, her neighbors and colleagues shower her family with such generosity, warmth and kindness that we may want to rethink what we have heard about a society based on propriety, distance and reserve.
In theory, the society that Thomas Matthews attempts to join in A VILLAGE IN THE VINEYARDS (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23) is closer to our own; yet he and his girlfriend, Sara, are embraced by the Bordeaux wine country with less warmth than Ms. Davidson is accorded in urban Japan. A fervent oenophile, Mr. Matthews rents a house in a wine-making village in order to deepen his knowledge of "French wine and country life." He works in the vineyards alongside his neighbors and learns about wine production; he and Sara hear gossip, attend church services and bingo games, and grieve with the villagers when a local woman is electrocuted in a freak accident.
Here, too, we find glimpses of the hidden: a priest takes the American couple on a tour of his private museum of prehistoric artifacts. Yet this book may be less compelling to travelers than to the sort of wine lovers who have ample patience for a certain sort of lyrical paean to the nuances of the grape: "Wine is the most articulate of beverages. To an attentive and practiced palate, a glass of wine speaks of the grapes that comprise it, the soil that nourished the grapes, and the weather that shaped the year of its making." I was more fascinated by the loving descriptions of what Mr. Matthews and his companion cooked or were served to eat.
Ernst Aebi, a Swiss-born artist who made his fortune "as a renovator of lofts in New York City's SoHo," takes a far more interactive approach to his subject in SEASONS OF SAND (Simon & Schuster, $22). On a quixotic camel safari from Timbuktu to the infamous salt mines in Taoudenni, Mali, Mr. Aebi wanders into the desolate, impoverished settlement of Araouane and decides to take on the challenge of being its sole salvation. After a trip to Switzerland, he returns to Araouane with a "Land-Rover 110 Turbo Diesel, equipped with sand tires, extra fuel tanks, solar panels, a heavy-duty roof rack, reinforced springs and an electric winch," hooked up to a double horse trailer loaded with "saplings, soil, buckets, shovels, tarpaulins, sprinkling cans, seeds, rakes, spare tires, spare parts, medicine, food and lots of jerricans full of water."
A believer in the efficiency of a "benevolent (I hoped) dictatorship," buoyed by natural confidence and the fact that he seems not to have heard of the word "imperialism," Mr. Aebi takes Araouane by storm. Amazingly, he succeeds in revitalizing it -- at least for a while. Soon the villagers have a productive garden, young trees, a school, a hotel and a market economy; then another invasion, this time by Tuareg rebels, undoes Mr. Aebi's work.
"Seasons of Sand" is an interesting book partly because it goes no deeper than it does. Mr. Aebi expresses regret for having introduced greed to Araouane, where previously there was nothing to covet. And he manipulates new desires in order to wipe out entrenched social institutions like the virtual enslavement of blacks by their lighter-skinned Arab neighbors. What are we to make of all this? The reader feels a creeping suspicion of Mr. Aebi's white-hunter, can-do spirit, and yet because of it starving people were now eating vegetables from their own gardens, not sacks of foreign-aid staples. And when the desert and its marauders reclaimed the town, was it worse off than before? Mr. Aebi doesn't think too hard about the political and moral implications of his story, but the reader may -- and may find that these questions enrich the experience of reading his book.
Miles Morland's MILES AWAY: A Walk Across France (Random House, $21) offers less food for thought, though some readers (presumably not those who have made the book a best seller in England) may wonder crossly how Mr. Morland and his wife could possibly find so many grubby hotels and inedible meals in southwestern France. ("How boring Gascon cooking was. How many different things can you do to a duck?") As the tale begins, Mr. Morland forsakes his upscale wage-slave career in the London stock-brokerage office of the American firm CS First Boston, and with his wife (whom he had divorced and then remarried five years earlier) takes off on a compulsive, often tedious and uncomfortable monthlong walk from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic through the foothills of the Pyrenees.
It would take a stronger writer, I'm afraid, to keep me transfixed by frequent updates on the couple's blisters and sneakers and by their costly wrong turns, or to render me suitably charmed when Mr. Morland has a bit of fun with two waitresses' "lack of polish." (" 'More at home milking a goat than serving wine,' I had said.") Readers who cannot hold out until Peter Mayle writes another book may be amused by this journey, inspired by Mr. Morland's trading of security for "adventure," and aware that their own such adventure might resemble the Morlands': equipped with pages from a wide selection of guidebooks, worried about the next night's hotel, plagued by growling farm dogs and their own frayed nerves and sore feet.
Hanns Ebensten's VOLLEYBALL WITH THE CUNA INDIANS: And Other Gay Travel Adventures (Viking, $22) left me with a similar sense of not getting the joke, exactly. Mr. Ebensten, the head of a travel company and "a pioneer in the field of gay group travel," has journeyed from Easter Island to Mount Olympus; he's led intrepid tourists on rafting expeditions through the Grand Canyon, to remote Greek monasteries and the idyllic San Blas Islands off the coast of Panama. Along the way, he's crossed paths with practically everyone: Princess Margaret at the Cotton House on Mustique, Marlene Dietrich cozying up to the bar in a Paris club. And isn't that cute Panamanian guy . . . Manuel Noriega? ("Despite his ugly, puffy face and short, stout body . . . this ithyphallic colonel exuded sexuality like a randy beast.")
Mr. Ebensten aims for the frisson rather than the revelation, a choice that may explain how a writer whose father fled Nazi Germany can rhapsodize over motorcycle police sent to Florence to suppress a student demonstration: "The arrival of these Cocteau-like angels of death turned the dormitory into a homosexual's dream come true. . . . They wore black leather jackets, black turtleneck sweaters, jodhpurs, and boots up to their knees; they had holsters strapped around their waists and menacing billy clubs and handcuffs hanging from their heavy belts."
Given his affection for "picturesquely ragged" Central Asians, it seems unfair of him to fault gay tourists for their fashion mistakes: "Tour members often cannot resist a mania for going forth dressed ludicrously in T-shirts or tank tops and tiny shorts that last suited them 30, 40 or 50 years before in kindergarten."
One would rather watch the neighbors' slide show than hear Mr. Ebensten boast about his good taste and sexual charisma. Happily, other travel books remind us of the difference it makes when a writer really knows a particular place. MAGIC PRAGUE (University of California, $30), by Angelo Maria Ripellino (who was a professor of Russian and a lecturer in Czech language and literature at the University of Rome before his death in 1978), is such a book -- though, to be sure, a strange one, less travelogue than evocation, and the result of a long obsession with the literary, mythological and historical currents that run through the Old Town of Prague.
Not surprisingly, Franz Kafka haunts this volume, as do the mythical golem and the artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo, who lived in Prague when he painted his fanciful human faces assembled from fruits and vegetables. Artfully translated from the Italian by David Newton Marinelli and edited by Michael Henry Heim, much of the text is dense, difficult, lyrical, almost incantatory: "I see a double key to Prague: it is not only a repository of splendors and treasures, dainties nibbled at often enough by foreign boars over the centuries; it is also a heap of singed and stained rubbish, showcases exuding resignation like a large family of chipped utensils, broken-down gadgets and spoiled trinkets." Yet, having read "Magic Prague," we feel that, arriving in the Czech capital, we'd recognize it instantly from what we've learned in these pages, that we could get along more easily than if we'd studied a conventional guide or a book that told us where its writer stayed, what he ate and who he met.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Slouching Toward Utopia in the South Bronx

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
From the classical colonnades of the Greek Revival to the heavy metal wrappers of Frank Gehry, American architects have found many ways to tell the story of modern democracy. But if architecture's version of that story is to be more than a fairy tale, architects must learn to do more than tell it. They must also try to live it. Louis Sullivan once said that for him architecture was not an art but a religion -- "part of the greater religion of democracy." He had a good sense of priorities. It is fine for architects to focus on symbolic forms and images. But if their symbols are disconnected from social reality, their buildings may end up mocking the values they represent.
For the past year, residents of the South Bronx have been working to create a solidly democratic content for architectural form. Rather than sit back and wait for architects and planners to tell them how to improve the prospects for their legendarily troubled borough, they have joined with architects and planners to renegotiate the social contract between citizens and builders. Bronx Center, as the heartening project for this area is called, is becoming a national model for community-based planning, though that dull term scarcely conveys the excitement of an undertaking that promises to change the way people think about urban design. 
 The project began a year and a half ago with the recognition that the South Bronx has suffered not only from neglect but from the wrong kind of attention, and not just from those in the media who routinely depict the place as a hell on earth. In fact, many people like living there. And in recent years, about $2 billion worth of public and private projects have been planned for the area, including the new Police Academy, a court center and a housing complex. But the borough's president, Fernando Ferrer, had the presence of mind to look this gift horse in the mouth.
Obviously, Mr. Ferrer welcomed investment in his borough. But he was painfully familiar with the kind of project that, while physically located in a community, contributes little of value to it. Streets and parks planned by professionals who may have good abstract ideas about places but little knowledge of what it's like to live in this one. Housing projects that displace people from existing buildings and shred the urban fabric. Office buildings that generate jobs for which local residents lack adequate skills. Architecturally impressive buildings that provide temporary construction jobs but offer residents no long-range economic stability.
In 1992, Mr. Ferrer asked Richard A.
Kahan, a former president of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, to help him develop a strategy to revitalize a 300-block area east of Yankee Stadium in the heart of the South Bronx. Mr. Kahan, who volunteered his services, enlisted other volunteers to form a steering committee and hired organizers who corralled several hundred Bronx residents into a series of public forums. Working groups were set up to focus on specific issues like health care, job training, housing and transportation. Volunteer architects, meeting in a private home, set up design studios where residents learned how to translate their ideas into urban forms.
Those ideas range widely from traditional urban design concepts (renovated subway stations, community gardens in vacant lots) to more ambitious proposals (alternative high schools at Yankee Stadium and the Police Academy; "greenway" streets leading to small, "defensible" parks). Mr. Kahan has kept the groups coordinated, while Harold DeRienzo, a political activist, steered the meetings along a firmly democratic course.
The group scored a major success last year when it halted the city's plan for Melrose Commons, a 2,600-unit housing complex near 161st Street and Third Avenue that would have displaced about 800 people from their homes. With the support of the Dinkins administration, residents worked with the architects Petr Stand and Lee Weintraub to overhaul the plan, formulating their own recommendations for housing, stores, routes for pedestrians and cars, and the design of a new park. Their revised plan was approved by the City Planning Commission last month.
At the edge of the planned Melrose Commons complex stands a fine architectural landmark, the old Bronx Borough Courthouse, a granite Beaux-Arts monument built in 1915. Empty since 1978, it looms as a symbol of lapsed civic pride. Mr. Kahan, Mr. DeRienzo and their colleagues want to restore the building and its spirit by turning part of it into a planning center. Renovating the building will cost $800,000. The spirit, which is priceless, was already in vibrant evidence at a meeting I attended a few weeks ago at Lincoln Hospital. The cooperative approach was at the opposite end of the spectrum from the imperial planning practiced by Robert Moses. And it contrasted sharply with the typical community board hearing, where politicians, developers and architects line up against neighborhood activists and watch their energy disperse in rancor.
The image that surfaced in my mind was Ellis Island: this meeting was a port of entry into a city that is made not just of steel and concrete but of information. These people are heirs to the construction workers Lewis Hines photographed in the 1920's, bolting girders into the skyline. Instead of using riveting guns, they are wielding their experience. It turns out to be powerful stuff. They tell each other stories, and a language of urbanism begins to take shape as their stories intersect.
At one working-group session, someone announces that there is $400,000 available in city and state Percent for Art programs. A man talks about his vision of how local artists should be trained. A woman tells the group about a new "electronic atelier" at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, where students will be able to master the tools of multimedia. Click. Art and media -- realms frequently perceived as privileged -- have collided and come down to earth, demystified and accessible. In another group, someone is arguing that the Bronx Center should exclude planners, because they make everything sterile. Someone else says that won't happen in Melrose Commons; the will of residents to remain in their buildings will insure a visually varied streetscape. Click. A connection has been made between political action and esthetic effect.
PEOPLE ARGUED WITH passion, but this was not a contest. It was an entrance into their own city. Many people at this meeting had been trapped within the armor of their grievances. Their Golden Door opened with the recognition that they stood to gain by setting grievance aside. They passed through that door by joining others who have felt similarly displaced.
Experts and politicians have had useful experiences, too. Bronx Center has benefited from their analytic skills, technical information and knowledge of the historical forces behind the borough's decline. But perhaps the most useful asset displayed by Bronx Center's volunteer professionals is their grasp of hierarchy. Though their expertise places them at the apex of the organizational pyramid, they've turned the pyramid upside down. They stand at the bottom, supporting those above.
Morale at the Bronx Center meeting was so intense I was tempted to resist it. Another inner voice wanted to be heard -- a voice of caution. Mustn't get carried away, mustn't get sentimental about poor people, maybe nothing will come of this, it is cruel to raise false hopes. And didn't architecture already go through this in the 1960's, with advocacy planning? Aren't we well rid of the utopian baggage the modern movement came freighted with? Didn't we learn that making forms is the most valuable social service architects can perform?
But it is missing the point of Bronx Center to think that architects must choose between community service and design. Bronx Center is design. It extends the field in which designers operate. It shows that design is not only a matter of form but a matter of content, and that the designer's area of responsibility embraces both.

HEADLINE: LOOK WHO'S WIRING THE HOME NOW

 BODY:
Steven R. Rivkin's vision of electric utilities entering the telecommunications business provides an important new means to reduce air pollution and slow global warming, while also providing a less expensive on-ramp to the information superhighway ("Look Who's Wiring the Home Now," Sept. 26). Cutting peak power demand by communicating and cooperating with consumers via new digital technologies will reduce the use of coal-fired power plants, and create a growth market for electric utilities that build the new telecommunications facilities. President Clinton would be wise to encourage their efforts, which can provide enormous economic and environmental benefits for the nation.

THE Clinton Hill neighborhood in west central Brooklyn is a late-19th-century treasure trove of mansions and brownstones, wide, tree-lined boulevards with broad vistas and a few smaller, charming side streets. A pedestrian roaming its avenues can marvel at fluted and banded Doric and Tuscan columns, bay windows and flower-bedecked balconies, bearded titans in the facades and pretend Loire Valley chateaus capped by conical towers.
On Nov. 10, 1981, a section of the neighborhood, part of the borough's brownstone belt, was declared a historic district, one of 61 such districts created by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. 
 Since the idea of landmarks became law 38 years ago, a debate has raged over the appropriateness of designating areas or buildings that, because of their architectural quality or history, may not be razed or even altered without going through a strict approval process.
But to the people of Clinton Hill there appears to be little doubt: Residents and developers agree that the neighborhood is an outstanding example of the capacity of a historic district to generate housing value by opening the door to new investment and taking advantage of a potential market.
Clinton Hill, they say, fortuitously possessed the unusual combination necessary for success: much space and many vacant (some of them burned-out) buildings; their availability in a time of real-estate expansion; a Federal historic-district tax credit and the eagerness of moderate- and middle-income people to move into renovated housing or to renovate it themselves.
But the pluses also carry with them minuses: complaints about the relatively high cost of housing in a historic district and the difficulty an understaffed landmarks panel has had in recent years in enforcing the regulations.
SOME residents also complain that enforcement, when it occurs, can be excessively bureaucratic and nit-picking and can require changes too costly for low- and moderate-income homeowners. And others point out that while the designation has been beneficial to Clinton Hill, it has not been as helpful for other, less economically fortunate, areas of the city.
In the historic districts of Harlem or the South Bronx, for example, while there are many empty buildings, there have not been enough people of sufficient income seeking housing to make unsubsidized rehabilitations economically viable on a broad scale. And the added cost of conforming to landmark standards adds to the problem.
In Clinton Hill, however, the emphasis is on the positive.
"Historic districts are crucial to the well-being of an area," said Stephen B. Jacobs, an architect and developer who has renovated 30 brownstones and three major apartment houses in Clinton Hill and neighboring Fort Greene. "They are a useful tool that can be used in preserving urban neighborhoods.
There has been an impact on the storefronts, on the buildings, on the quality of life, because somebody was seeing the total picture and trying to institute standards instead of letting each landowner do his own thing."
Naida McSherry, a resident and a real-estate agent, said the designation had enhanced property values. "Had it not been a landmark area people would not have put this kind of money, time and effort into their houses," Ms. McSherry said. "I moved here because the architecture was beautiful, and landmarking meant it would stay that way, that my neighbor across the street could not paint his house chartreuse."
Brent Porter, a neighborhood resident, architect and professor of architecture at Pratt Institute who is also on the board of the Society for Clinton Hill, said that "the historic district has renewed our identity."
"In the 1880's and 1890's," Mr. Porter said, "leading families came to Clinton Hill, one of the highest points in Brooklyn, to establish their mansions. Now we have a totally different identity. We have an across-the-board mix of ethnic and racial groups and income levels, and because of the district we have renewed our pride of place.
"People have a concern for their neighborhood. They find many ways to make it better, from their garden to the stoop in front of their house to a major renovation."
In the late 19th century, when Brooklyn was a suburb of Manhattan, the area that is now Clinton Hill became known as the gold coast. It was the dwelling place of the rich and famous: the Pfizers of Pfizer pharmaceuticals, the Bristols of Bristol-Myers, the Sperrys of Sperry-Rand, the Otises of Otis elevators, the Reynoldses of Reynolds Aluminum, the Liebmans of Rheingold Beer, the Underwoods of Underwood typewriters, the Arbuckles of Yuban coffee and, most especially, the Pratts. Charles Pratt, partner of John D. Rockefeller of the Standard Oil Company, built four mansions near his own glorious house on Clinton Avenue as wedding presents for his four oldest sons.
AS the century turned and it became clear that Manhattan was becoming the prime city address, the neighborhood began to decline. Some mansions were torn down; others were turned into apartment buildings or rooming houses. The area lost much of its distinction and was often lumped with neighborhoring Bedford-Stuyvesant.
But the stabilizing presence of Pratt Institute and St. Joseph's College helped keep it from sinking too far, and by the late 1960's and early 1970's an upturn had already begun. Clinton Hill became part of the Brooklyn brownstone revival that also included the historic districts of Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Park Slope, Fort Greene, Boerum Hill and parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant. Pioneers eager for affordable homes and willing to put in the work to fix them up fled the high prices of Manhattan for the racially and economically mixed areas of Brooklyn, of which Clinton Hill was one, and transformed them.
Clinton Hill itself is bounded by Myrtle Avenue on the north, Vanderbilt Avenue and Fort Greene on the west, Classon Avenue and Bedford-Stuyvesant on the east and Fulton Street on the south. The part of it designated a historic district centers on the Clinton Avenue mansions in the western half of the neighborhood, taking in 17 whole blocks and parts of 12 others.
By the time Clinton Hill became a historic district, gentrification -- the gradual arrival of people with a higher level of income than those already living in the neighborhood -- had already begun. Then, fueled by the real estate boom of the 1980's and the Federal historic-investment tax credit -- 25 percent for housing in historic areas -- gentrification, renovation and development blossomed. (The gentrification process itself received mixed reviews: positive for growth, negative for the displacement of lower-income people it sometimes brought about.)
Now, although the end of the boom has slowed growth considerably, and a change in the law has reduced the tax break, its results in new investment remain. Restored buildings are scattered throughout the blocks of the district, among them Washington Avenue, St. James Place and Gates Avenue, where the historic-district tax credit spurred entrepreneurs and individual owners to buy and renovate buildings.
"IN terms of the renovation of market-rate, moderate-income housing, none of it would have been built if there had not been a historic district," said Mr. Jacobs, whose work includes the Washington Court complex at Washington and Gates Avenues, four buildings and 115 apartments on a block that had been 60 percent burned out and vacant before the huge restoration was completed in March 1987.
There are certain types of buildings, Ms. McSherry said, that probably never would have been restored if they had not been landmarks, because they normally were not the kinds of buildings homeowners would buy and restore: big apartment buildings that had deteriorated, beautiful exteriors with burned-out shells inside.
"Because of the investment tax credit for landmark areas, developers were willing to come in and renovate and make lovely apartments," she said.
Derelict buildings were renovated and put into service at reasonable rents. "There are lights in the windows," said Abigail Golde, a real-estate agent and a member of the Society for Clinton Hill. "There are children on the streets. And it's marvelous."
The change after 1987 reduced the credit to 20 percent, Mr. Jacobs said, limited it to sheltering passive-income losses and eliminated private investors who earn more than $250,000 a year. But restoration and renovation in Clinton Hill has continued despite the change in the tax laws, sometimes taking the form of subsidized housing for low- and moderate-income buyers.
The role of the historic district has remained crucial, residents say. It certainly played a key part in saving the Vendome, a five-and-a-half-story landmark 1887 building at the corner of Grand and Gates Avenues. The city had seized it for back taxes in 1982 and wanted to tear it down because it was in ruins.
But in late 1987 and early 1988 a consortium of private and public groups battled to save it, and it was redeveloped with the assistance of city and state funds.
Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, which played a major role in the development, said that after some financial difficulties the now fully occupied 24-unit building has helped revitalize the surrounding neighborhood. Tenants, all lower income, rent for 15 years and then will be able to buy their apartments as condominiums, Ms. Wylde said.
The Housing Partnership is a nonprofit organization that works with the city and the private sector to create "affordable" ownership housing -- housing that can be bought and carried by people with annual household income of about $25,000 to $50,000. Among its other projects is the Clinton Hill Houses, 48 duplex apartments in 24 attached houses completed three years ago on two previously vacant parcels next to the Vendome. Those 1,100-square-foot units sold for about $100,000 each.
The end of the real-estate boom has created some of the same problems in Clinton Hill as it has in the rest of the city, and residents who bought when the market was at its highest and whose houses or co-op apartments have decreased in value often find it difficult to sell. But Ms. Golde said there were still opportunities for first-time buyers and young families.
Housing prices vary greatly in the neighborhood, she said, changing block by block and building by building. A "modest" house or a larger house requiring much renovation might cost about $250,000, she said; one of mansion quality "could go for under $700,000, though you could certainly spend a lot more."
Co-op prices also vary, she said, but a "nice three-bedroom" might be available for under $200,000. The same is true for rentals, which, she said, "are very strong now, in Clinton Hill and all over the city; a two-bedroom apartment could easily go for $1,000." Less expensive two-bedrooms are available, but those probably have not been renovated.
WITH the benefits of the district come problems, and one of them is a concern over cost for those with smaller incomes. The Rev. Anthony Trufant, pastor of the Emmanuel Baptist Church on Lafayette Avenue in Clinton Hill, said that while the landmarks status had helped maintain a sense of continuity, it was also in a way a curse because it made the price of housing "rather exorbitant" for both buyers and renters.
Price is also a problem in another way: Because all new buildings or changes to old ones must be reviewed by the landmarks panel, which decides if they are historically and architecturally in keeping with their surroundings, the historic district can increase the cost of a project significantly. "We calculate the add-on cost at about $10,000 per unit for exterior facade work and as much as $30,000 a unit, with an average of about $20,000, for interior requirements," said Ms. Wylde of the Housing Partnership.
SHE said that while the historic district had generally been good for Clinton Hill, the cost factor was responsible for difficulties in other, less fortunate districts.
"Clinton Hill came on line as a historic district and a reinvestment area at the height of the 1980's real-estate boom and took advantage of that," she said. "But many other designated historic districts, in Harlem, in the South Bronx and in other parts of Brooklyn, are in the 1990's real-estate cycle and are having a problem."
Very often, she said, the economics of those neighborhoods are not strong enough to support the "extraordinary cost" of compliance with landmark standards. A result, she said, is a gap in financing that inhibits or prevents development and "threatens many of the lower-income historic districts."
But Frances A. Eberhart, the executive director of the Historic Districts Council, said that "people who say that should ask themselves why residents of such districts as the Clay Avenue Historic District in the South Bronx are so keen on historic designation. The residents look on designation as one of the only things that can salvage the quality of their neighborhoods."
The landmarks commission is considering increasing the size of the Bedford-Stuyvesant district, Ms. Eberhart said, and many residents want it to be even larger than the panel's recommendation. To assist in such areas, she said, the landmarks panel runs a facade improvement program that provides grants of up to $15,000, and the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a private supporter of preservationist efforts, manages a program that provides low-interest loans and grants. "In the short run, the costs can be greater," she said, "but in the long run evidence shows that the cost and the investments are worth it."
The rules of the historic district strictly limit what an owner can do.
"Someone who buys a brownstone that is not in a historic district can do anything he or she wants, can take off the stoop, can install any kind of windows he wants," Mr. Jacobs said. "In the historic district, work on the building's exterior has to maintain the character of the neighborhood."
The process of renovation, he said, also becomes more tedious: a review procedure is mandatory, "and to some people such a procedure is an onerous thing."
Ironically, another major concern is enforcement: some residents are unaware of or openly flout the strict standards, and it can be extremely difficult to get them to adhere to the rules.
"MANY people in the neighborhood either assume they can do anything they want to a building or assume a change they want to make is not significant," said Ernie Bitzer, an architect who has lived in the neighborhood since 1970. "People change wood windows to aluminum windows, which is taboo as far as Landmarks is concerned."
The landmarks commission itself is understaffed; it has only one inspector to check on violations throughout the city.
"If the people across the street knock off a banister, I can call landmarks and they can issue a summons, but nothing will happen," said Bill Sikes, a Clinton Hill resident since 1956.
Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the landmarks commission, agreed that enforcement was difficult. "The law is flouted with impunity and violations are going unpunished," she said. "We give them a violation but we can't enforce it. We can take them to Civil Court, but you know what the courts are like, and do you really think the city's Corporation Counsel is going to make putting in the wrong window a prime concern? I don't think so."
On the other hand, those who willingly seek to obey the law sometimes complain that the commission, given the opportunity, is needlessly rigid about such things as windows and colors and that the rigidity can often add unnecessary costs.
Vivian Becker, executive director of the Pratt Area Community Council, a nonprofit housing organization that focuses on the interests of low- and moderate-income residents, said that when the regulations were enforced "people are sometimes held to a standard that can be arbitrary and more expensive than they might be able to afford."
Ms. McSherry said that when she told the commission she wanted to change the color of her cornice, an aide told her the panel wanted to send someone up to her roof and do a scraping to try to determine what the color was initially. "I think that attitude is rather silly," she said.
Ms. Beckelman replied that "part of the general preservation philosophy is to try to maintain what was there originally; the first rule is if it can be fixed, don't replace it."
"'We would never say that we would only approve the original color," she said. "But the reason a district is designated is for its architectural fabric, and color is a part of that fabric."
Ms. McSherry, despite her concerns, said that when the historic district was created it was not big enough. "They would not cross Fulton Street," she said. "There were beautiful buildings on the other side of Fulton that should have been part of the district. There were also very nice buildings on Fulton itself that since then have been destroyed."
RESIDENTS also say that the designation by itself is not enough, that more work is required to continue to improve the area. The Rev. Glory Thomas, pastor of the Apostolic Faith Church on Lafayette Avenue, said that more government involvement, including increased police protection, was necessary.
Tom Schutte, the new president of Pratt (who lives in the Caroline Ladd Pratt House on Clinton Avenue, next door to the Charles Millard Pratt House, the residence of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brooklyn), said he and Pratt were committed to doing "everything possible to preserve the neighborhood."
The school recently planted 35 trees around the border of its 25-acre campus.
Lawrence Golde, president of the Society for Clinton Hill, said that his group maintained the same commitment.
"The advantages of the historic district are sometimes difficult to quantify," Mr. Golde said. "But when real estate agents speak to a buyer it has to be a plus that there are criteria and standards keeping the neighborhood looking and feeling like a good place to live. That has to be a positive thing for an inner-city neighborhood."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
A Principled Approach to Lower-Cost Housing

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IN his 30 years as an architect, Zane Yost of Bridgeport has put principle over profit. The principle is to create quality housing for people with modest incomes. In the best of times, his profits are meager. In a recession, they drop to negligible.
This limited architectural niche has brought him some celebrity. Anticipating by two decades society's current perception that packing thousands of people into enormous masonry projects would not solve the problem, he began designing individual clusters of private homes in 60 developments with a total of more than 7,000 units throughout New England. He is involved now in half a dozen projects around Connecticut. 
 Financing provided by nonprofit housing corporations and the Connecticut Department of Housing have made the units affordable for families earning $20,000 to $60,000. Land taken over from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by the state and given back to the towns is sometimes crucial to keeping prices in the $60,000 to $135,000 range.
Committed to a set of philosophical, social and political tenets, Mr. Yost is sometimes at odds with those to whom he must sell his ideas.
"With the best intentions a great deal of low-cost housing fails because of cheap construction, overwhelming density and sheer ugliness," he said. "Good construction is not what makes housing expensive -- it's the cost of land. Zoning, created with the purpose of making better communities, succeeded instead in creating artificial scarcity, totally destablizing the value of land."
The idea that higher density will bring about lower cost is anathema to him.
"The most expensive building is the high-rise-elevator-fireproof structure that requires expensive maintenance and security after it's built," he said. "The village is the most cost-effective way to build, and the way to a more orderly society.
"We forget that all human beings are affected by where they live, motivated by the need to associate in small groups and have deep relationships with others. They need a community that's under control, supported by a local power structure dedicated to preserving their quality of life."
In his village concept, each family has a private house, private fenced yard and secure parking. Houses are clustered around a common green and there is enough shopping to meet immediate needs. Streets are keyholed into dead ends, and through traffic is diverted to move around the complex rather than slice through it on speedways.
"VITRUVIUS, the early Roman architect," Mr. Yost said, "identified three essential architectural elements -- firmness, a sound structure; commodity, accommodating the form to its use; and delight, the esthetic appeal of the building. Most low-cost housing lacks all three."
His firm, Zane Yost & Associates, has its headquarters in a sprawling Victorian house in Bridgeport, where his design for Marionville, a low-cost town-house project built 25 years ago, won an American Institute of Architects Award.
Forty percent of the original owners still live there, experiencing the pleasures of privacy and paid-up mortgages.
A block away is the 40-acre Father Panik Village, which once had 1,036 units and held out a promise of decent housing for low-income people. Instead it became a dangerous web of blind alleys, corridors and stairways where drug dealing and violence were commonplace. The last buildings were torn down last month to make way for the first 50 duplexes in 25 new buildings that Mr. Yost is designing. Eventually there will be 500 units clustered with private yards, communal green space and shops.
"What sets Yost apart is his innate knowledge of what works," said Jeffrey Sager, principal in Metro Realty of Farmington. Mr. Yost is the architect for Metro's 68-unit complex on 9 acres, in which 40 percent of the units will be rented below market rates, up to $810 for three bedrooms.
"WE interviewed many architects in the affordable-housing field and found that Zane was a leader in the industry," Mr. Sager said.
The Waterbury chapter of the nonprofit Neighborhood Housing Services of America is using a Yost design for Old Farm Ridge, with 144 town houses in clusters of 4 to 12 units on 21 acres. Work on the first 30 units has started and prices for two- , three- and four-bedroom homes range from $72,000 to $95,000.
By simply putting the structures down without laying out lot lines and leaving all unbuilt spaces green, greater use of the land for gardens and play areas is possible. Driveways and roads are kept at the periphery of the cluster. Mr. Yost calls it the "not lot" plan.
"We try not to work with architects," said Adele Strelchun, executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services' Waterbury office,"in order to keep the costs down, but his housing philosophy was very important to me. The houses are lovely, nicer than some of the homes of neighbors who objected to having the development built." So far 176 applications have been received from potential buyers.
AT Waterside Green, Mr. Yost's sold-out 75-unit complex in an industrial area of Stamford, a three-bedroom town house costs $109,000, including major appliances, carpeting, two and a half bathrooms, separate dining room and fenced yard. It was built by Fairfield 2000, a nonprofit agency based in Stamford.
Mr. Yost will work with Fairfield 2000 again to build Clock Hill Homes in Darien. The town has approved a plan for 28 units on a 22-acre site formerly known as the Prindle-Hopkins property. A one-bedroom unit with den will sell for $99,950 and a two-bedroom unit with a den will cost $133,925.
Mr. Yost said the recession had doubtless led some architects to go into subsidized housing to supplement sparse market-rate commissions, but Robert Hurd, who devotes 60 percent of his time to low-cost housing in the Hartford area, has been doing it for 15 years.
"If its done right, it helps people," he said. "It empowers them, gives them a stake in the community."
Kermit Thompson, principal at TPA Design Group in New Haven, is designing 35 rental town-house units and remodeling a housing project in Norwalk. "Affordable housing is one of our largest market areas," he said.
To help some of Bridgeport's troubled neighborhoods, Mr. Yost drew up a plan for putting highway barriers back to back, filling them with decorative plants and positioning them across intersections, forming dead ends.
"The cost is minimal and there has been a dramatic drop in the number of shootings," said Thomas J. Sweeney, the chief of police. "There is less racing up and down and fewer drive-by drug deals."
A total of 40 intersections will eventually be involved. "We are giving the neighborhoods back to the people who live there," said Chief Sweeney.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Change in Belle Harbor;
Failed Condo Project Reborn in New Form

 BODY:
The Belle Harbor section of Queens is providing yet another example of the turn back to traditional housing forms in low-rise residential neighborhoods of New York City.
What began as the "Sea Breeze Condominium" in the hands of one developer a few years ago is now on the market as "Ocean View Homes" in the hands of another. The condominiums -- in seven attached and semi-attached two-story houses on Beach 129th Street -- were partially sold but never occupied after they were completed three years ago. 
 Now they are on sale for $375,000 to $420,000 as two-family houses. The buyers are expected to bring in a renter for the space where in the earlier incarnation there would likely have been a resident owner.
The renter should provide the owner-occupant with enough rental income to substantially offset his monthly carrying costs.
Why the change?
The one suggested by the developer, Lawrence Rosano of Bayside, Queens, is that "People would rather own their own home and have total control." Mr. Rosano, with Thomas Naples and John Norton, bought the project in September.
But it may also be the case that both buyers and banks will be more comfortable with the housing form that is more traditional in the homeownership neighborhoods of New York City. And carrying costs for buyers should be lower.
The previous developer had a few signed contracts when he was forced to abandon the project, including one for a $250,000 duplex. That buyer would have faced monthly housing costs of $1,451, based on a $37,500 down payment and a 7.5 percent interest rate on a loan for the balance of the purchase price. With a 10 percent, or $37,500, down payment on a two-family house, however, a buyer's monthly cost would be only $1,152, the developer says, assuming the same mortgage rate and monthly rent of $1,250 from a tenant.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Informal Cuisine in a Lush Hotel Atrium

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
SEVERAL months ago the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Old Greenwich closed its upscale restaurant Conde's (except for private parties) and is now "making do" with its second-tier eating place, Winfield's Cafe, in keeping with current lighter, more informal dining habits. Conde's was part of a 1980's national trend toward small, gourmet-style restaurants that many hotel chains embraced. Economic times and changing eating patterns have been hard on such efforts.
Winfield's Cafe is situated in the vast 56-foot-high glass-roof atrium that is the hotel's centerpiece. Towering columns covered by climbing greenery, ficus trees, hibiscus, philodendron and other plants, a small pond, streams and waterfall all add to the appeal. In the evening, the sound of live piano music drifts over from a small bar across the way. 
 The menu, as befits the new American cafe-style concept, is brief. It accommodates the current penchant for pasta and other Italian dishes and a few other popular foreign items.
Count among the better entrees a Mexican dish, sizzling fajitas. Winfield's offers a choice of beef, shrimp, vegetable or chicken. We opted for the chicken, which was served in strips, along with green and jalapeno peppers, grilled on a red-hot iron skillet -- delicious. Along with the skillet came a straw basket with flour tortillas (for wrapping around the chicken and peppers) and a container of respectably tangy guacamole, red salsa, shredded Cheddar cheese and sour cream.
Not all ethnic renderings fared as well. Seafood-chicken gumbo, one night's special, was more a bland vegetable soup broth than the swamp-thick Cajun gumbo that is traditionally packed with okra and file (sassafras powder) and deeply garlicked andouille sausage. Another starter, fried dim sum with kim chee, provided adequate dim sum (chicken, pork and shrimp dumplings) and a mound of mildly spiced Korean kim chee (only distant kin to the hot pickled cabbage dish of the same name).
Ethnicity was better served in a garlicky Gorgonzola bruschetta, a thick slice of toasted Italian bread rubbed with garlic and blue cheese, nesting on wilted greens with a sautee of wild mushrooms (oyster mushrooms and shiitake among them) -- good hearty winter fare.
Another old Italian standby was a victim of inventiveness that misfired. The dish was described as mozzarella and olive pesto in carrozza, and the egg batter-dipped mozzarella sandwich was enveloped in a lemon caper sauce that turned the expected crunchy-edged mozzarella in carrozza into a soggy, bready morass that even a plethora of capers couldn't save. Not a good idea.
Better appetizers were the Buffalo-style fried chicken wings (lathered in reddish-pink Tabasco spiciness), served with carrot and celery sticks and a dense blue cheese dip; and Maryland crab cake (a fat, well-browned cake with a cascade of lightly dressed mixed baby salad greens).
Two pasta dishes were also worth attention: prosciutto provolone tortelloni with two small grilled chicken breasts, calamata olives, mushrooms and Parmesan; and penne pasta with spicy marinara, tossed with ricotta cheese and grilled vegetables -- well-seasoned and generous. Another entree, sauteed veal medallions in Marsala jus, was satisfying, though hardly memorable.
Disappointments included dried-out grilled salmon (though the sauteed greens in an orange balsamic vinaigrette had sparkle) and a bizarre grilled barbecued chicken pizza with vegetables and Cheddar cheese that was inedible, with a crust so thin it confounded the pizza fans in our party.
Among several commercial-tasting desserts, a strawberry shortcake was almost rock hard, but the tiramisu, served with two biscotti cookies (a redundancy of sweets), was actually appealing. Raspberry sherbet was also a refreshing choice.
A recent dinner for two came to $50 for three courses apiece, before tax, tip and beverages. A minimal wine list features American, Italian and French selections, priced from $18 to $36, with two wines by the glass.
By choosing selectively you can enjoy a meal at Winfield's Cafe in a perfectly delightful indoor-outdoor ambiance that is at its best at lunch on a sunny day (with natural light pouring into the atrium) during the long winter months.

 BODY:
To the Editor: Bravo on your first color section (Oct. 31), and the Bora-Bora cover photo. As a long-time sales agent for Tahiti, however, I want to clarify Lenore Magida's classification of Tahiti as "expensive."
Over the last year, French Polynesia has experienced a surge in tourism from North America. The addition of two new airlines serving Tahiti has helped bring arrivals up while lowering air costs. Packages now start as low as $1,132 for a seven-day vacation (per person for accommodations in double occupancy, air fare from Los Angeles and inter-island air). While Ms. Magida comments that "dinner for two can easily run close to $100," this is true in many locations from Bora-Bora to the Caribbean. Our Sofitel resorts in Tahiti, like many other large hotels in Tahiti and the outer islands, offer a meal plan at $45 a day for American breakfast and dinner with a choice of entrees. Many packages include day excursions -- such as the shark feeding mentioned in the story -- in the overall rate. 
 Finally, Ms. Magida's hotels ranged from the ultimate in expensive to the ultimate in economy, offering no representation of the wide middle range.

HEADLINE: Old Age Catches Up With the Oil Patch

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: GUADULUPE COUNTY, Tex.

 BODY:
ROBERT SPILLER started calling around a few months ago to sell the 38 old, nearly dried-out oil wells his mother inherited when his father died. His younger brother, Jay, an oilman, was on his list. "Jay, the price of oil is low, and I don't know if I'm doing you right by calling," he told his brother. In the last year, Robert had finished selling off all of his own oil wells.
Jay, always stoic, said he would think about it. The oil from those wells, a relatively low grade, was selling then for about $14 a barrel. Jay figured he could produce for $13 a barrel, and counted on prices going back up. And he wanted to keep his father's wells in the family. 
 So Jay came back with a bid of about $100,000. Not the best offer, but competitive enough to win his mother's favor.
Since then, however, the price has dropped to $10.25 a barrel. Which is why, at noon last Thursday, he was standing among the mesquite thorns and the sulfurous fumes -- looking into the sky for rain, into the horizon for a repair truck that was supposed to have come that morning and into the future for higher prices.
 
A Patch by Another Name
 As a stripper producer, J. A. Spiller is playing the Texas oil endgame. Stripper wells are those whose flows have fallen to 10 barrels a day or less, from perhaps 30 to 100 barrels initially. Operated primarily by independent and smaller producers and not by the major international companies, stripper wells already account for more than a fifth of the state's and nation's oil output, a portion that is growing as this country's reserves are depleted.
Because of their high production costs, they will be the first casualties if oil prices stay where they are, which is possible, given the outcome late last month of meetings of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Weakened by squabbling, OPEC failed to agree on production cuts, and the possible end of international sanctions against Iraq could add to the supplies, pushing prices downward.
Nearly all the stripper production could shut down in the next year or two if prices stay where they are, said Julian G. Martin, speaking for the Texas Independent Production and Royalty Association in Austin. "It would be disastrous -- the wipeout of several hundreds of thousands of barrels a day -- which could only be replaced by imports from the Middle East."
Some economists, however, view the association as alarmist.
Wherever prices head, Jay Spiller is also fighting history in a region whose designation as the nation's Oil Patch is becoming an anachronism. Natural Gas Patch, maybe, as 1993 promises to be the first year that Texas earns more from natural gas than oil, with Robert Spiller among the converts to natural gas.
But as oil prices have dropped and the majors have shifted more of their production abroad, Texas might be better known as the Government Patch, the Medical Patch, the Electronics Patch, the Shopping Mall and Warehouse Patch -- all larger sources of jobs now than oil.
The Halliburton oilfield equipment company is still the state's second-largest corporate employer, but General Motors and its EDS computer services unit form the largest, with Texas Instruments the third-largest, followed by American Airlines and then Wal-Mart. Exxon, the state's biggest oil company, comes in at No. 15. And no company matches the size of the Texas Medical Center in Houston, which employs 53,000 people.
As a result, last week's plunge in oil prices, to the lowest level in five years, caused worry in Texas, but not trauma. "Almost every industry except the oil industry likes low oil prices," said Ray Perryman, whose economic consulting firm is based in Waco, Tex. "As you diversify, you get the benefit. We can pretty well sustain the recovery we've had if oil prices stay at this level."
Not that energy has become unimportant. For each dollar decline in the price of oil -- and prices have dropped $4 in two months -- , Texas loses 17,000 jobs, about two-tenths of 1 percent of the work force. The nation, meanwhile, gains more than 78,000 jobs as transportation and manufacturing costs decline and the economy expands, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
But oil and gas now account for only about 12 percent of the combined gross state product of Texas -- about half what it was a decade ago.
 
The View Beyond Oil
 Robert Spiller -- 44 years old and as fervid and talkative as his brother is reserved -- is not shy about repeating his warnings to Jay. "I let him make his own decisions, but I've told him how I feel," he said from behind a wide, leather-topped desk in San Antonio, where his natural gas operations are based. "He should get rid of his oil wells."
But Jay Spiller has no gas wells or drilling prospects, leaving him only his oil properties and his brother's wary admiration. "He has no overhead," Robert said. "If he can't make a profit, no one can."
Almost every day since he bought the oil wells a month ago, Jay has driven about an hour south of his office in Austin to inspect, repair and plan. He knows the brown, rolling hills of the Austin chalk formation well. He worked them with his father, and he had dozens of wells there even before his latest purchase.
Jay, who is 43, dresses in jeans, mud-stained boots and a broad-brimmed canvas hat. From his Ford Bronco, he talks by a crackling two-way radio with his production foreman, his sole employee.
Jay's oil is not the sweet, West Texas Intermediate -- the benchmark crude whose price is quoted in the newspapers -- but a sour (higher-sulfur) oil harder to refine and therefore several dollars a barrel less valuable. But as the major companies move out, smaller operators see opportunities in lower-grade and stripper wells, which sell for only a few thousand dollars each.
If his oil stays at around $10 a barrel, he said, "You'd have to turn all your operations down." His mild stutter betrays him on the word "turn.' "Wherever you could cut back, you'd cut back."
He argues that with OPEC nations losing billions of dollars of revenue from their oil, they are bound to get prices back up. But he is already watching every dollar.
 
The Rusting of the Patch
 From a compartment between the front seats of his truck, he unfolds a sheet of yellow paper listing the 15 or so of his wells that need repairs, averaging $1,500 each. Holes in the outer tubing, weak pumps, split rods, all hundreds or thousands of feet below ground.
His land is leased from ranchers, with ramshackle barns and lowing cattle still there. Some of his pumps are slowly bobbing and whirring, while others stand rusted and silent.
Last Thursday morning, he expected a truck to arrive with a workover derrick, to pull busted equipment from the ground. He planned to fix all 15 wells, but with oil prices where they are, he will only do two or three.
He was also planning to drill several more wells in December, with the help of about five investors. But at a cost of about $75,000 each, that's now out of the question, for him and many others. In April, the national rig count reached the lowest point in 50 years of record-keeping. It has rebounded somewhat since then, as a few major oil companies, unable to sell their domestic properties, have resumed drilling, though they will probably cut back again if oil prices remain low.
Jay Spiller's foreman used to drill for him. This morning, he drove up in a spattered white pickup, jumped out and doffed his cap to reveal a scalp shaved bald after a lost bet on a Houston Oilers game.
His truck carries a four-wheel Kawasaki motorbike. When it rains, he plows through the mud on the bike instead of in the truck, saving the $500 repair bill that results when mud clogs the truck's joints. "That's a cost-saving technique, and it works," Jay said.
With their marginal production, stripper wells require every such technique Jay can muster. Sometimes the wells keep producing for decades. But falling prices and flows require him to plug some holes. He plugged 15 last year, and would rather not fill any more. "Plugging costs money, too," he said.
His father, Horace, a wildcatter and the son of a wildcatter, began drilling here in the 1930's, and continued, with Jay's and, for a while, Robert's help, into the 1980's.
Guadulupe County still has a Spiller Field, and Robert and Jay still maintain shrines to Horace, lining their offices with his pictures. Robert and Jay both studied petroleum engineering at Texas A&M, then joined their father's company. Even when Jay left the company in 1982, five years after Robert did, Jay continued working out of the same offices.
Jay has three sons, the oldest a freshman at A& who gained his first oilfield experience last summer. He heard about the tough times. "I told my sons, 'If you want to be employed in this business, you'll probably be employed outside the United States,' " Jay Spiller said. "That's how Exxon operates. They're getting out the country and going overseas."
Of Exxon's 1.7 million barrels of daily liquid production, mostly oil, only 286,000 come from the continental United States, half of that from Texas.
 
A Fuel for the Sons
 Or the Spiller sons could drill for gas. The Clinton Administration, with a former oil and gas executive, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, as chief of staff, has been encouraging natural gas production. "It's environmentally clean, abundant, and a cheap resource that's domestically available," explained Tom Sullivan, speaking for the Maxus Energy Corporation, a major independent producer in Dallas.
With a pickup in demand, natural gas prices have been rising, to about $2 a thousand cubic feet, from the $1.60 range last year. Lower oil prices can bring natural gas back down, but not much, since it's difficult and expensive for many users to switch fuel sources.
With all the easily recoverable domestic oil long since found, Maxus, for one, has been looking for gas in the Texas Panhandle and the Gulf of Mexico, and for oil in Latin America and Indonesia. Gas at home, oil abroad is the trend, Mr. Sullivan said, "from an Exxon on down to a Ma-and-Pa operator."
The Robert Spiller Company, with five full-time employees concentrating on natural gas, isn't quite Ma and Pa, but it is down from 15 or 20 employees in the 1980's. Last week, a geological consultant was busy comparing maps pinned to the walls with charts spread across a table to help choose five sites for drilling gas wells by the end of January.
 
Dying or Just Hurting?
 Jay Spiller called for a word with his brother to make sure that the impression left by a speech that Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary, delivered in Texas several weeks ago does not go unchallenged.
"The Energy Secretary referred to the independent producer as a dying breed," Jay said. "We're not a dying breed, but we're a hurting breed. The way the Government can help is to have some sort of floor on the price of oil, or tariff on imported oil, to keep oil at a constant level."
Few see much chance of that, since most of the country likes lower prices. "When it comes to oil, people down here in Texas feel pretty persecuted," said Stephen Brown, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. "But they're outnumbered."
Robert Spiller, in suit, tie and an Aggie ring from Texas A&, can sound and look almost evangelical as he preaches about his industry.
"We're more and more dependent on foreign oil," he said, his voice rising. "Are we willing to pull the trigger to prevent them from pulling another oil embargo?"
He paces his office, shoves his hands into his pockets, then resumes. "I got into the business young and fired up, ready to make the American dream come true. Now we're being inundated with inconsistent prices. On top of it we're being crushed, totally crushed, with the environmental movement. You're talking to someone who has seen the writing on the wall and walked out of it. There are going to be a lot more like me. A lot of those people are just holding on by their fingernails."
Robert Spiller doesn't rule out a return to the oil business. But he was hurt even more than his brother by the 1986 oil crash.
His luck changed when he drilled for gas. On Feb. 21, 1990, on a ranch owned by former Gov. Dolph Briscoe, he discovered the Janey Field, prudently named after the Governor's wife. That first strike turned into a huge plume of flame, but there was plenty left once the fire was out. He has kept drilling nearby.
His brother, meanwhile, continues to try to suck the last drops of oil from the Spiller Field. "I don't think you'll find him drilling a lot of wells," Robert said. "I look at him and shake my head."
Jay Spiller, out in the field, saw that it was past 1 P.M., with no truck or workover rig in sight. Time for a lunch break at the Luling City Market about 10 minutes away.
He nodded to one of the men behind the counter in back, who was spearing brisket from a barbecue pit and carving slabs of it onto brown butcher paper. "Did you see that fellow there?" Jay said as he carried his beef back to a table. "The last well he drilled for me was two or three years ago. Now he's slicing meat."
 
 
 
IN TEXAS, MEDICINE TAKES THE LEAD
 AS Texas's earnings from exporting oil to other regions decline, its earnings from importing patients are rising. Even as new office contruction virtually ceased in the recession, the state's major medical centers continued to expand.
Only about 1 out of 50 Texans still works to discover or produce oil and gas. One of 13 Texans works in private-sector medicine; adding those employed by government, the count rises to 1 in 10, or more than 740,000 people.
Houston, Dallas and San Antonio all have sprawling medical centers and military hospitals, with the Texas Medical Center in Houston the largest. Roughly the size of New York's Central Park, it includes a dozen hospitals and 53,000 employees, with a budget of more than $4 billion. An expansion of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center there is adding as much new space as a 50-story office building.
The center, with headline surgeons including the heart specialists Denton Cooley and Michael E. DeBakey, has attracted thousands of patients from foreign countries, among them the Sultan of Brunei.
William E. Kuykendall, a senior vice president at the center's headquarters and an engineer by training, said that the demands for new roads, lighting, sewers, parks and parking spaces would tax most local governments. "We're kind of like a city hall here," he said.
And while the research, training and treatment are top-drawer, Texas has fallen behind in finding ways to manage costs. The business of medicine here is still, by and large, traditional. Health management organizations are few, with Methodist Hospital at the Texas Medical Center just considering one now.
As a result, the state's medical centers might be pinched more than many others by President Clinton's campaign to control costs. "It's gotten our attention," said Mr. Kuykendall, with pointed understatement.

HEADLINE: Profile: Bernie Feiwus;
A Successful Match: Quirky Catalogue, Offbeat Executive

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: IRVING, Tex.

 BODY:
A NEW black-and-gold flag snaps in the wind that blows more or less constantly across the Trinity River basin outside Dallas, home base for NM Direct, Neiman Marcus's mail-order division.
The flag is a fitting symbol of NM Direct and its chief executive, B. D. (Bernie) Feiwus. "It's kind of like the flag of a pirate ship," he said. 
 If NM Direct is a pirate ship, then Mr. Feiwus, 45, is its swashbuckling captain, flouting convention within the conservative Neiman Marcus empire and leaving his mark on the huge mail-order business. He is as different from the well-groomed merchants who mind the shop for Harcourt General, the conglomerate that controls Neiman Marcus, as the mail-order business is different from traditional retailing.
It is not only his attire -- usually khakis, an open sport shirt and crepe-soled shoes -- that sets Mr. Feiwus apart. This fall, he climbed onto a platform to boogie with a Michael Jackson impersonator at a party for the 1993 Christmas catalogue, and he often hands out odd hats to make a point -- once giving Mickey Mouse ears to an executive whose judgment he considered less than sound.
And the day after Thanksgiving, when treacherous sleet on the Dallas highways prevented some operators from getting to the office, Mr. Feiwus and some of his merchants filled in on the telephones. Even on this hectic shopping day, they did a good enough job to match last year's sales.
Also setting him apart is his microscopic knowledge of NM Direct's business and his ability to use that knowledge to fine-tune mailing lists, catalogue designs, even the timing of conveyor belts.
NM Direct, of course, is no stranger to idiosyncrasy. Long a stepchild of the glamorous Neiman Marcus Group, operator of the exclusive Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores, as well as Contempo Casuals on the West Coast, it is best known for its lively Christmas Books, featuring gifts like a miniature golden train carrying emeralds, rubies and diamonds, mummy cases and even an Angus steer, complete with carving tools and silver serving trolley.
Always a great publicity machine, the mail-order division was never regarded as a big moneymaker. But since Mr. Feiwus took over in 1991, NM Direct has become the company's ballast in a fickle economy, in no small part because of his leadership.
Though NM Direct's vital statistics are not made public, one estimate puts its annual sales at $250 million to $300 million. "It's been their savior in at least a couple of quarters," said Thomas H. Tashjian, a retail analyst at First Manhattan.
A close look at Mr. Feiwus offers some insight into his magic. He has reduced a dependence on the fourth quarter, once the only profitable time of year, by mailing out more catalogues the rest of the year.
He has pushed merchants and creative teams to build brand identities for each catalogue NM direct operates -- Pastille, Horchow, Trifles and Neiman Marcus by Mail -- by forcing them to adhere to standard type sizes and prices.
And he has used his training as a statistician to milk Neiman Marcus's coveted mailing list for all it's worth, striving to send catalogues only to those households likely to make big purchases.
While he has on occasion shocked colleagues with his antics, they are apparently willing to go along because NM Direct has prospered under his leadership. At one meeting, he made them wear sombreros and played a mariachi tape while he announced the foray into Mexico, set for this spring. And he has given quizzes on merchandising, awarding prizes to high scorers.
"We try to be personality-blind around here as long as an executive is an effective leader," said Robert J. Tarr, president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus and of Harcourt General, which owns 63 percent of Neiman Marcus. Mr. Tarr balked at the suggestion that Mr. Feiwus has revived the division single-handed. "There's a team that runs the business," he said firmly.
Still, Mr. Feiwus's tenure has coincided with a distinct shift in NM Direct's fortunes, a turnaround based in large part on strategies he put in place after analyzing the division's costs. That analysis showed that NM Direct could make money with few additional costs if it put out about 30 more catalogues and increased business from January through August. Traditionally, the division mailed most catalogues in the fall, leaving its high-tech distribution center and crack telemarketing and merchandising teams idle much of the year. "Even if customers didn't respond at the same level they did in peak season, our variable costs, mostly part-time labor at Christmas, were much lower, so we could be profitable then, too," he said.
OTHER fine-tuning followed. Neiman Marcus by Mail, which had primarily sold apparel and accessories, scored big with a new catalogue selling home furnishings and decorative items. The division increased the number of packages it mails out each hour by 50 percent, to 1,200 from 800, by varying the speed of four conveyor belts that snake through the distribution center.
Mr. Feiwus also imposed standards for paper weights and type sizes on his creative teams, who were used to cooking up each catalogue differently. Now, the only changes from spring to summer to fall are the merchandise and copy. "We needed to send out the message to the creative teams that whatever you do, you're going to have to live with it for awhile," he said.
Mr. Feiwus does have critics. Some say that for all the efficiency, the catalogues have become less distinctive. "Horchow, in particular, had a unique franchise, but it no longer stands out," said Dick Hodgson, the principal in Sargeant House, a mail-order consulting firm.
When Mr. Feiwus joined NM Direct nearly three years ago, the mail-order business was a tub adrift. The division had always been small and heavily reliant on Christmas, and it had had difficulty swallowing Horchow Mail Order Inc., which Neiman Marcus acquired for $100 million in 1988 only to find it was loaded with inventory no one wanted.
NM Direct was struggling to adjust to a rise in postal rates and United Parcel Service charges and the Persian Gulf War, which sent consumer spending into a tailspin.
Those factors led to heavy markdowns in Mr. Feiwus's first year, and, to protect themselves, merchants placed conservative orders for the spring 1992 catalogues.
But after studying various economic indicators, and his rivals, Mr. Feiwus believed the prospects were good for 1992 and worried about missing out for lack of inventory.
"So I broke the fundamental rule of retailing," he said. Buyers are typically held accountable for markdowns on orders they place, but Mr. Feiwus promised he would assume responsibility for markdowns they might incur by placing bigger orders.
Business began to boom, and has been booming ever since. Mr. Feiwus said sales have climbed 30 percent since 1991, and operating profits have climbed even more.
And Neiman Marcus apparently believes its mail-order division has even greater prospects: it is investing $15 million to add 250,000 square feet to the warehouse and distribution center.
NM Direct is also venturing into Mexico with test catalogues. Mr. Feiwus recently returned from Europe, another potential growth area, as is the Pacific Rim.
This is all heady stuff for Mr. Feiwus. One colleague recently found him in his office staring at the Neiman Marcus prospectus. "I couldn't believe what I was making," he said of his $293,000 salary. "Seeing it there in black and white was a shock. I just never in my life expected to be where I am now."
He was born in East New York to Orthodox Jewish parents who immigrated from Czechoslovakia in 1923. As far as he knows, the name Feiwus (pronounced FY-wus) is unique to his family, having been created by a harried immigration official at Ellis Island.
Mr. Feiwus attended Thomas Jefferson High School, then went to the City University of New York, earning a degree in statistics.
After graduating, he joined Citicorp, where he worked on the national rollout of Visa and Mastercard, a task that led Neiman Marcus to him in 1979 when it was looking for a new vice president for credit. He recalled that the first thing his wife, Leslee, said was, "Dallas? Don't you know that's in Texas?"
"Our concern wasn't so much with religion as it was with the heritage," Mr. Feiwus said. He wanted his children to "understand what it means to be Jewish, and I wasn't sure we could do that without the strong family ties we had in New York." Setting their doubts aside, they moved to Dallas. Two years later, Mr. Feiwus was named controller.
One of his early ideas was to establish a frequent-buyer program. Nothing came of this at first, but when American Airlines started its frequent-flyer program, Neiman Marcus started In-Circle, which rewards its best customers with special gifts and events. One valuable aspect of In-Circle -- regarded as one of the most innovative of such programs -- is the access it provides to information about big spenders.
Mr. Feiwus then moved into sales promotion, where he cooked up other plans to cement Neiman Marcus's ties to customers. His talents soon made him a strong candidate to head the mail-order division, although the company did first do an outside search.
The key to the mail-order business, Mr. Tarr said, is "to make sure your catalogues are going into those homes where there is the highest probability a purchase will be made." And tweaking such probabilities out of mailing lists and sales figures was right up Mr. Feiwus's alley.
Oddly, though, the man who heads one of the more creative merchandising companies insists he has little feel for the goods NM Direct sells. He tried his hand at merchandising for the first time in the current Christmas Book, coaxing the merchants into including two large dinosaurs.
His instincts may be better than he thought. While NM Direct has yet to sell a high-tech airplane ($150,000) or elaborate applique tent ($3,300), a $63,000 mechanical dinosaur is on its way to a Middle Eastern embassy in Washington. The beast's final destination is rumored to be Aspen, Colo., to be the star of a New Year's Eve bash.

THE ECONOMY
 
If the Numbers Don't Lie, America's Going Back to Work
Is it as good news as it seems that the nation's unemployment rate plunged from 6.8 percent to 6.4 percent in November? Skeptics were quick to say that for complicated statistical reasons, the progress reported by the Labor Department last week was almost surely overstated, and financial markets shrugged it off. But with any kind of faith, what you see is a stunning number -- the biggest improvement in a decade, and a compelling sign that this on-again, off-again economy is at last performing its most basic function: creating jobs. Employers added jobs from California to Florida to New York, and most places in between -- and they were more likely to be full-time jobs, too. As those of you with jobs well know, companies have been putting off hiring and leaning on existing workers, uncertain about things like medical costs, but this news may show that they just couldn't hold out any longer.
 
An Economy on a Spree
It's more than jobs. The economic engine keeps gaining speed as it barrels toward that year-end blowout -- which long ago, rumor has it, was some sort of religious celebration. But once Christmas is past, will the vigor survive? Economists are cautious. Last week, though, the numbers were strong: income, construction spending, and factory orders all up, the purchasing managers' index showing the fastest growth since last winter. There were some blips: new-home sales were off, but that followed a surge the month before, so housing still looks good. And retail sales rose just slightly -- but of course any shoppers worth their credit cards would not dream of going wild till it's almost Christmas.
 
Tired of Waiting for S.& L. Job
It's clearly liberating to be nominated for a Government job and then decide it isn't worth jumping through all the hoops. Stanley Tate, named in July to head the Resolution Trust Corporation, but still awaiting a confirmation hearing, didn't mince words last week when he called it quits. "Washington," he said, "is a vicious city, with all kinds of hidden agendas. It is a city full of rumors, allegations and accusations." And why did his nomination die? Because he's a Republican? Because Bill Clinton didn't back him fully? Or because there was something to the "serious questions" that Donald Riegle, Senate Banking chairman, had about Mr. Tate? Mr. Tate's version: bureaucrats were afraid he'd root out mismanagement. Whatever the reason, Mr. Tate, a Florida developer, said he felt "disposable and dispensable." And the bailout agency just keeps on drifting.
 
Mending Hubble, Mending NASA
If NASA were a corporation, it would long since have become an obscure Wal-Mart subsidiary. It's made one cosmic gaffe after another: the Challenger disaster, the flawed Hubble Space Telescope, the apparent kidnapping of the Mars Observer by little green spacepersons. It's no understatement to say, as one space expert did last week, "NASA can't afford another highly visible failure." So the pressure's on the astronauts on the shuttle Endeavour, which lifted off on Thursday. The astronauts' mission: to fix Hubble in mid-space, essentially by putting a pair of eyeglasses on it. If they succeed, secrets of the universe could snap into focus; if they fail, the focus will be on NASA's jugular. But as one Hubble scientist put it, "This is not like going to Grandma's to fix a leaky faucet."
 
OPEC, Where Is Thy Sting?
Twenty years ago, OPEC seemed sure to strangle America with ever-higher oil prices. But last week it was clear just how times had changed. After slipping all year, oil prices plunged to a five-year low after OPEC failed to agree to cut output. So gasoline, steadily cheaper in 1973 dollars, seems likely to get cheaper still, which would help the economy. But everything has a cost, and cheaper gas means auto makers are less likely to put their efforts into making more efficient cars.
 
Victor Posner Is Out of Play
It was an unusual penalty, but the judge said the scope of the violations justified it. Saying they "have had a long and notorious history of engaging in self-dealing and corporate waste," a Federal judge last week banned Victor Posner and his son, Steven, from serving as officers or directors of any public company. The order came in a civil suit brought by the S.E.C. as part of a broader case against Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, and it involved charges that the Posners made secret stock deals with Mr. Boesky. In light of past abuses, the judge said, another warning "would serve little purpose."
 
COMPANIES
 
Paying a Price for Family Values
Family values. So simple a term, yet so laden with subtext. On the surface, it means apple pie, caring, a cozy hearth; but it can also be a code phrase for excluding, condemning, even denying the existence of anything but cookie-cutter Americans. Normally, to cry "family values" is just free speech, but in Texas last week, the price was high. Apple Computer planned to build an $80 million office complex north of Austin, creating 1,500 jobs. But county officials rejected a $750,000 tax abatement, citing Apple's policy of granting health benefits to employees' unmarried partners, and Apple took its blueprints and hit the road.
 
Sony's Pain, And the World's
In 1946, in a bombed-out Tokyo department store, a young man named Akio Morita helped found the Sony Corporation. Since then, as both Sony and Japan grew mighty, Mr. Morita became, in one American's words, the world's "leading Japanese business statesman." So it is symbolic that as Japan's phenomenal half-century shows distinct wear and tear, Sony's chairman falters. Last week Mr. Morita, 72, underwent brain surgery, and he may have to retire. That would be bad news for Sony, where, even removed from day-to-day operations, he remained the "psychological backbone." And it would be bad news abroad, for Mr. Morita has played a leading role in smoothing trade tensions with America.
 
Volvo Vants to Be Alone
The planned Volvo-Renault merger created serious friction at Volvo. Many executives wanted to back out, loath to let Sweden lose one of its corporate stars. But the chairman, Pehr Gyllenhammar, stuck to the plan, seeing strength in having a European partner. Last week Mr. Gyllenhammar lost his fight: The merger was called off, and he quickly resigned, saying that Volvo's managers had "turned their backs on Europe."
 
Job Cuts: A Weekly Ritual
It almost stops being news, squarely in a class with "Dog Bites Man." Another week, and more corporate giants cut thousands of jobs. Last week was no exception. A. T.& T. may cut as many as 4,500 jobs as the long-distance wars take their toll. And airline woes continue to seep through to Boeing, which will cut production, meaning a loss of up to 3,000 jobs. Even the beer industry is pulling in its belly, as Miller said it would close a plant in upstate New York, eliminating 900 jobs.
 
G.M. Downsizes Its Data
Saturated with economic numbers? Good news: Detroit is going to spare you some. Much as eager-beaver pundits crave the latest word, General Motors decided last week that 10-day sales reports were overkill and would scrap them in January; Ford will probably follow suit. Chrysler went to monthly figures a couple of years ago, but then some helpful souls started estimating 10-day sales. While some analysts found the figures useful, most were relieved. "About time," said one.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Again, Hope for World Trade
Your eyes glaze over at the words "Uruguay Round"? You're forgiven: these trade talks have long since taken on a Dickensian dimension. Begun seven years ago to lower tariffs worldwide, the talks have hit more snags than "Bleak House" has characters. But yet again last week the tireless negotiators, including Mickey Kantor of the United States, cried, "Breakthrough!" One snag has been French objections to cutting farm subsidies, but a resolution may be at hand. If there is an accord, it could do much for the world economy. But that's still a big "if."
 
Trade progress is possible, though: last week Canada's new Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dropped his opposition to Nafta. The pact now goes into effect on Jan. 1, and the vigil will begin to see which side was right about jobs.
Tokyo Sweet-Talks the Market
All the Japanese stock market was waiting for, it seems, were some rosy words from the Government; last week it got them. Stock prices had been sliding for weeks. But after the Government finally promised to do what it could, the Nikkei index surged more than 4 percent in a day, then 2 percent the next. Prices are still depressed, though, and they are likely to stay that way until Government actions follow words. "Jawboning," one analyst said, "won't work for too long."

HEADLINE: Corruption Overseas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "U.S. Must Halt Corruption -- Abroad" (Viewpoints, Nov. 21), Frank Vogl highlights the consequences of corruption, from political instability to wasting and rerouting aid money and foreign investment. However, his suggestion that the United States persuade or pressure developed and developing countries to adopt its moral, ethical and legal anticorruption standards misses the point. 
 First, it is not in the best interests of competing countries to adopt laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Adopting such laws would result in a loss of lucrative contracts to "deep pocketed" American companies and the United States would be perceived as imposing its values on other countries and as meddling in their domestic affairs.
Second, international lending agencies may have the "leverage to promote anticorruption initiatives," but establishing a standard and enforcing and monitoring it are another story. For example, applying a Western human rights standard in non-Western countries has caused more problems than it has resolved. Externally defined and generated anticorruption laws, imposed upon developing countries via the international lending agencies, will not work.
Where there is little respect for the law, a situation common in developing countries, statutory solutions are secondary. The laws are perceived as entrenching the incumbent politicians and further enriching the wealthy at the expense of the masses. The people are fed up, and they want a solution that they understand and in which they have some involvement.
That solution is a news media free of the influences of the entrenched and enriched. The lending agencies should pressure the countries that receive aid to remove their hands from the media.
People who are "fed up with corruption" are willing to take the matter into their own hands because they know the consequences of continued corruption: economic stagnation and regression. I suggest laws similar to the United States' "whistle blower" law, offering monetary reward to those who expose, with enough evidence for indictment, entities and individuals dedicated to siphoning money from the government. The responsible, free news media could pursue such stories and expose the wrongdoers.
Further, applying a local standard, with local enforcement and monitoring procedures, would be more successful than imposing a law like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from Washington. Finally, applying a local standard would remove the unfair comparative advantage that Germany, France, Britain and others have obtained, vis-a-vis the United States, in winning lucrative overseas contracts.
Corruption will never be eradicated. However, it may be contained if the process in countries that receive aid becomes more transparent, and if all parties adhere to the same principles and rules.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
For Contrarians, Commodities Are Looking Up

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE American bond market is shaking because it sees signs of economic strength. European stock markets are zooming as evidence mounts that the continental slowdown is ending.
And yet there is consensus that commodity prices will stay low. The assumption is that demand, no matter how strong, will not overtake supply. It is a supreme insult these days to dismiss something as a "commodity business." 
 Nowhere is that clearer than in oil, which last week fell to its lowest level in five years. And that is measured in weak dollars. If you look at oil prices in Japanese yen, they're at a 20-year low.
Another way of looking at oil prices, which might be of interest to investors, is to measure the relative costs of oil and American stocks. In other words, how many barrels of oil could you buy with the same money needed to buy the basket of stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500? Measured that way, oil is the cheapest it has been since 1972, even before the first OPEC oil shock.
Of course, just because something is cheap doesn't mean it won't get cheaper. There is pervasive bearishness on oil now because of worries that Iraq will settle with the United Nations, enabling it to begin shipping large quantities of crude, and because inventories in this country are surprisingly high. And anyway, betting against inflation and commodities has been the winning strategy for more than a decade.
Industries around the world have concluded that it is folly to have inventories on hand, either of excess commodities or of workers that are not absolutely needed. Jim Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Review, has a point when he asks if that may not produce a scramble -- and perhaps even shortages -- when a lot of companies suddenly realize they are having trouble getting what they need.
That could happen sooner rather than later. The American economy is finally picking up steam, as was shown by the surprisingly strong job figures released Friday. Low oil prices themselves are bullish for economic activity, especially in Europe and Japan. A year from now, the chances are good that the major world economies will be doing substantially better than they are now. And if that is the case, oil may not be the only commodity whose price has moved up faster than expected.
There is no guarantee that oil prices will rally soon, of course. But for a long-term investment, one could do a lot worse than oil or the stocks of the companies that produce it. Wertheim Schroder's Mike Mayer notes that the dividend yield on big oil stocks is now about 75 percent of the yield on Treasury bonds, the highest ratio ever save for a brief period in 1986 when oil hit $10 a barrel. He is one of the few analysts pushing oil shares.
In 1981, when oil was peaking, the stocks were loved and crude was expected to hit $100 a barrel in a few years. Now oil is low and the shares are ignored. It may be that the crowd will prove to be just as wrong this time.

Gutenberg Goes Digital

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
THE computer, which in the last decade has created a whole new industry -- desktop publishing -- is now fixing its digital gaze on the venerable printing press.
Ever since Gutenberg, printing large volumes of documents has meant creating a metal plate for each page. Even in today's high-speed, four-color offset printing presses, each page requires its own metal plate. And because making and adjusting these plates is expensive and time-consuming, it is cost-effective to use sophisticated presses for full-color jobs only when making thousands of copies of each page. 
 The digital revolution may change all that. A new generation of presses is emerging that eliminates the metal plates, creating flexibility that should allow shorter press runs and even let the publisher make on-the-fly changes. A full-color advertising circular, for example, could carry a message tailored to each individual customer.
It's the ability to customize that has led Mark D. Kvamme, president of CKS Partners, an advertising agency in Campbell, Calif., to consider buying such a device. "With mass printing," he said, "people end up throwing away a lot of stuff."
Relatively low-cost color photocopiers have been available for years, of course. But with typical speeds of less than eight pages a minute, they are too slow for anything resembling volume production. The faster plateless color presses might crank out 100 to 10,000 copies of a booklet, brochure or annual report, industry experts say, while above 10,000, metal-plate techniques would probably still be more economical.
The reason color printing has typically been complex is that the images must be separated into their primary colors, each with its own plate. And once the plates are mounted, the press must be fine-tuned so the colors align precisely. This involves considerable time and money, so most short-run publications are printed in black and white -- or maybe with one additional color dropped in.
The printing of one- and two-color documents is a $25 billion-a-year business in the United States, said William R. Thompson, a printing consultant and ajunct professor of graphic arts at the University of Wisconsin. He estimates that two-thirds of that market would convert to full color if the high initial costs of setting up the presses could be reduced.
Two of the first entrants in the plateless-press market are the E-Print 1000 by Indigo Inc. of Rehovot, Israel, and the Chromapress by Agfa Gevaert of Belgium. Others expected in the market are photocopier companies like Canon and Xerox as well as makers of conventional presses.
Both E-Print and Chromapress are offset presses that borrow some of the technology at the heart of xerographic photocopiers -- forming images on paper by using electrostatic charges to distribute fine particles of pigment. But each has its own distinctive wrinkles.
Indigo's E-Print, for example, uses liquid inks rather than the dry powders found in most xerographic copiers. Benny Landa, president of Indigo, said the liquid ink can produce finer, more precise images than the relatively large grains of solid toner.
THE press accepts pages -- text, art and photographs -- that exist only as digital computer files. (With conventional presses, the files must be converted to photographic film, then to the metal plates.) The E-Print sends the computer file directly to a laser scanner that forms an electrostatic image on a metal roller. Electrically charged ink particles are attracted to the electrostatic image and then transferred to another roller, known as the blanket, for final transfer to the paper. (The blanket roller, also found on standard presses, acts as the intermediary between plate and paper; it's go-between function is what "offset" refers to in printing parlance.)
Only one color is printed at a time on the E-Print, so the paper is held on the impression roller for four passes if full color is being used. If it is to be printed on both sides, the paper goes into a buffer, to be turned over and remounted for more impressions.
Unlike conventional "web" printing, which uses continuous rolls of paper, the E-Print uses paper already cut into sheets, which it ultimately collates, folds and staples into booklets. Since each impression is new with each turn of the image roller, the press can produce finished booklets one at a time -- each customized for an individual reader.
Robert Conrads, president of Indigo America Inc., said E-Prints have been shipped for sale in Japan and are expected in North America early next year. A fully equipped machine costs about $400,000, although stripped-down models can be had for as little as $200,000.
The Agfa Chromapress is based on xerographic printing technology developed by Xeikon, a Belgian company in which Agfa holds a minority stake. Unlike Indigo's machine, the Chromapress prints on a continuous web of paper. And, with eight separate printing heads, four on each side of the web, it can print on both sides of the paper simultaneously.
As a result, it is a lot faster than the Indigo machine, capable of churning out 1,050 full-color, two-sided pages an hour -- compared with about 500 for Indigo. And because the paper runs continuously, Agfa officials contend, it is less likely to jam. A cutter at the end of the line slices the web into sheets.
The Chromapress uses specially developed dry toners that Agfa executives say are neater than liquids because they are instantly fused to the page by heat. And the image is comparable to Indigo's, Agfa officials insist. (For people who like to compare specs: the Indigo machine produces an image resolution of 800 dots per inch, and the Agfa, 600.)
Like the Indigo printer, Agfa's Chromapress uses no printing plates, meaning each page can be customized. But its much higher speed is so far limiting the amount of variability from page to page.
"We have a software limit and we are still working on the data rate," said Paul Willems, product manager for Chromapress. He said that only textual changes will be possible for customized publications when the machines begin selling next year in Europe, but later versions will be capable of changing graphics as well.
Agfa expects to begin shipments to North America toward the end of next year, well behind the Indigo E-Print. Pricing has not yet been set, but the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, a trade journal, estimates Chromapress's price will be $250,000 to $300,000.
The digital printing press portends all sorts of changes in the way business is conducted. Eric O. Edelman, a consultant in New York with the Finnish paper-products consulting firm Jaakko Poyry, said he expects digital operations to spring up near airports, so that salesmen and marketing specialists will not have to drag heavy bags of brochures and other sales material from city to city.
"They will carry a three-and-a-half inch disk," Mr. Edelman said, "and print what they need for each presentation."

HEADLINE: Soul Central

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Moving as silently as dawn's approach, Art Manley walked over dew-dampened grass one morning recently to an old, concrete fountain at the center of an acre of municipal park land. The 31-year-old jazz musician took a long look out over the slumbering neighborhood that stretched before him in blocks of neat, pastel-colored houses, European-village-style shops and towering cypress, cedar and palm trees.
Only then, as he had for months of mornings, did Mr. Manley plant his snakeskin loafers in the sod, square his shoulders, close his eyes and lift his trumpet to his expertly pursed lips. 
 For more than an hour, Mr. Manley -- smartly dressed in a gray Italian-cut suit, starched white shirt, floral-print tie and pocket handkerchief -- blew a jazz-steeped reveille for this square-mile chunk of predominantly black southwest Los Angeles that is known as Leimert Park.
"I feel a lot of love around here," he said in a whispery voice as he returned approving nods to passersby for his just-finished rendition of "Stella by Starlight." "That's why I come here every morning.
"People really appreciate things over here," said Mr. Manley, who lives a 35-minute bus ride away and who never asks for contributions for his outdoor concerts. "Nobody has ever told me to shut up." Nor is anyone likely to in Leimert Park, which many see as a homespun cultural center in the making.
The neighborhood was created in 1927 by the developer Walter H. Leimert and designed by Olmstead & Olmstead, the successor firm to that of the designer of Central Park.
Leimert (pronounced luh-MERT) Park is situated just south of the Santa Monica Freeway, northeast of the Los Angeles International Airport and north of the city of Inglewood. More than 8,000 people live in this mostly middle-class enclave, which is about 82 percent black. Asians and Hispanics make up most of the remainder. More people own their homes than rent. Property values are relatively high; crime is relatively low.
Despite an ailing local economy and the riots of April 1992, which also struck this close-knit community, Leimert Park has become a haven for black musicians, artists, artisans and entrepreneurs of African-American culture and tastes. Still a long way from tourists' must-see lists, it has developed over the last five years into an Afrocentric enclave, much like Fort Greene, Brooklyn.
Leimert Park has "excellent potential" to become a nationally recognized center of Pan-African culture, arts and entertainment, said Charles E. Loggins, professor of urban and regional planning at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona. His students completed a study of the area last year.
But there are also stress lines beneath the successful surface. Some merchants and artists believe the area is growing too fast for its own fragile good.
From dimly lit shops hardly larger than walk-in closets to the blond-planked floors of sun-gorged galleries, anything from ceramic Aunt Jemimas to masks and headpieces from the Yoruba of Nigeria is for sale.
At Brian Breye's Museum in Black, visitors can gaze at slave manacles under glass and shop for that certain African or African-American symbol of self-affirmation.
You can order halal short ribs and fish sausage from the menu at the Shabazz Restaurant, which is owned by James Abdullah Butler, 49, an aerospace software designer, and managed by his son, Darrell Butler, 28, a former math teacher in the public schools.
"We know it's the black hub," said the younger Mr. Butler who, like his father, is a Muslim. "This area seems to have had a renaissance," he said. "There is a cultural consciousness here where people are 'brothers and sisters.' "
Jackie Kimbrough-Ryan, who owns Kongo Square, an African-American culture shop, with her sister and brother, said there is a "diversity of opinions" in Leimert Park about its future. Clashes occur. "We have a lot of other-mindedness here," she said with a weary smile.
A tectonic rift has been widening since August, when Leimert Park was the site of many of the activities in the citywide L.A. Festival. Some of the more recently arrived owners of arts and cultural shops find themselves on one side, with many longtime operators of the area's many service businesses like beauty salons on the other.
Some merchants like Ms. Kimbrough-Ryan, 56, say they want to bring more Saturday festivals to the area in hopes of attracting still more new faces with dollars to spend.
But Stewart, 39, a longtime Leimert Park resident and hairdresser who uses only his first name, is opposed to the idea. "If they have festivals on Saturday they want to close the street, and that's disruptive to my business," he said from his small loft on Degnan Boulevard, where he lives and runs the Venusian salon. "I have a Saturday crowd, and they want be able to get to me. Let them have their festivals on Sunday when I'm closed."
More pressing, many say, is the concern that Leimert Park has also been rediscovered by large developers and real-estate speculators. Residents fear that outside interests could strip the neighborhood of its kente cloth and cowrie shell ambiance and replace it virtually overnight with the tinsel and neon of so many other Southern Californian commercial districts.
Marla Gibbs, an actress best known for her role as Florence the maid on "The Jeffersons" and more recently as the star of the series "227," bought buildings for an arts and theater complex in Leimert Park in 1990. She said blacks must take the initiative in the neighborhood's further development. "When someone else comes in, it's going to be redeveloped for their purposes, not for yours, because it's their money," she said. Ms. Gibbs said she had invested more than $2 million in her Vision Complex Theater and Crossroads Arts Academy.
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who moved to Leimert Park a year ago and whose Eighth District newly includes the neighborhood, said some changes to the area's core business district, known as Leimert Park Village, were inevitable.
"This area has the possibility of being a nice little cultural niche of small businesses that can thrive with a kind of African motif," he said, adding that there must always be a place for noncultural businesses, too.
One of first changes his office has successfully sought will be welcomed by all: the planting of trees along the southern edge of Leimert Park Plaza, a triangular city park that faces the neighborhood's business district and the residential area beyond.
But others clamor for more drastic changes. James Dodson, the owner of Banjo's Yogurt and Deli, offers what he calls his "radical plan," which calls for cooperative economics among village merchants, who would simultaneously raise money and raze the aging village buildings.
"We should rebuild from the ground up," said Mr. Dodson, 46, who also works as an electrician and who is studying marketing. He said he had to invest $15,000 to upgrade the wiring in his rented building. Few merchants share Mr. Dodson's view.
In the meantime, however, life in the area goes on, and so does its beat -- literally. Along the village's one-block strip on Degnan Boulevard between 43d Place and 43d Street, live and recorded music seem to be everywhere, spilling into the street even in daytime and mixing with the low growl of the occasional passing car. For a cover charge of $3 to $10, anyone can pull up a seat in the long-running neighborhood nightclub scene.
Less than six hours before Art Manley gave his sunrise serenade, he had added his trumpet's piercing voice to the beat of an Afro-Latin jazz band at Fifth Street Dick's Coffee Company on 43d Place, which is across the street from the park.
Last month, Whitman Mayo, an actor best known for playing with Redd Foxx in the television series "Sanford and Son," prepared to guide a crew from Black Entertainment Television on a tour of the latest "in" neighborhood. "There are so many major cities that don't have anything like this, a place for people to proudly develop their culture," he said.
Leimert Park is also catching the eye of black film makers. Allen and Albert Hughes came to Leimert Park to shoot scenes for their film "Menace II Society." And earlier in the fall, Andre Young, better known as the "gangsta" rapper Dr. Dre, brought a film crew and extras here to shoot his music video "Let It Ride."
On week nights, however, band members outnumber the audiences in local clubs like the World Stage. But Richard Fulton, the owner and founder of Fifth Street Dick's Coffee Company, a two-story coffeehouse and jazz spot, said he is not too concerned about the sometimes light turnouts.
"Fifth Street Dick's is not going to make money," he said of his business, which he opened a year and a half ago. "I just want to bring the people together."
A 50-year-old Vietnam veteran, he said he once wandered the streets homeless and in an alcoholic stupor. He is also a force behind the nearby Alcoholics Anonymous center, one of the largest in the city. Mr. Fulton said some 3,000 people visit the center daily.
Commodore Williams, who described himself as a recovering alcoholic, is a weathered fixture around Leimert Park. Supporting himself on odd jobs and his good humor, he said the neighborhood was blooming again because of people like Mr. Fulton.
"It's simple," he said as he swept the pavement in front of the coffeehouse. "He's a man that's been to hell. Now he's trying to bring us a little heaven."

HEADLINE: Free-Market Misery for Latin America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Latin America Finds Harmony in Convergence" (The Week in Review, Nov. 21) suggests that opening markets and pursuing economic austerity offers reformers in Latin America the best hope for raising living standards among the masses and in turn creating a politically stable future.
Recent trends in Latin America confirm just the opposite, showing that living standards for the vast majority of the region's peasants and workers have plunged precipitously at the very time that free-market reformers have been opening markets to foreign producers, privatizing state companies and reducing public spending. 
 Juan de Dias Parra, leader of the Latin American Association for Human Rights, summarized the recent trends at a meeting in Quito, Ecuador, noting that "in Latin America today, there are 70 million more hungry, 30 million more illiterate, 10 million more families without homes and 40 million more unemployed persons than there were 20 years ago. . . . There are 240 million human beings who lack the necessities of life and this when the region is richer and more stable than ever, according to the way the world sees it."
The mass dislocation and suffering that have accompanied the move toward free markets and open trade result directly from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank's neo-liberal development model, which is tailored to the needs of foreign investors irrespective of local conditions and needs.
A better policy for the United States and its lending agencies would be to encourage development that incorporates domestic content laws (to help local producers), compensatory financing (to develop backward areas), and continued social spending (to alleviate the jarring effects of privatization).
Without such provisions and careful planning, opening markets and pursuing austerity will continue to generate mass dislocation, social misery and political unrest throughout Latin America.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Baltics Can Afford to Live a Little

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT

DATELINE: TALLINN, Estonia

 BODY:
THE first snow squalls are already slanting off the Baltic Sea, and darkness settles over the city each afternoon by four o'clock. But these days, beneath the ancient pitched roofs and gabled churches of Tallinn's old town, the cobbled alleyways are suffused, here and there, with the warmth of the Baltics' new glow.
Behind the steamy storefronts where socialism once showed its shabby wares, there are now sleek coffee shops and boutiques, brightly lit art galleries and snug taverns, including a replica of an Irish pub that could just as easily be in Dublin. 
 In these brittle northern latitudes, there is no surer boost to confidence than knowing you can stare winter straight in the eye and not blink. And this December, for the first time since 1989, the people of Estonia and its neighbors, Lithuania and Latvia, are settling in for the Baltic winter with the expectation they will have the heat and hot water to last them through next spring.
After several difficult years enduring a different kind of cold war with Moscow, which at times choked off supplies of gas and oil, the Baltic nations say they have the cash and the fuel to stay warm.
By any measure, these tiny nations -- together they cover an area about the size of the state of Washington -- have come a long way since they bravely wrested themselves loose of Moscow in 1991, the first tug in the rebellion that ultimately unraveled the whole of the threadbare Soviet empire.
Culturally and historically, the three Baltic states had always been the least Soviet of the Soviet republics, seized by the Red Army and annexed in 1940 under Stalin's secret pact with Hitler and its codicils. Not only was their orientation more European than Slavic, but their incomes and living standards were higher, and their economies more productive.
As a result, recovery appears to have come about less painfully here. Inflation, which topped 600 percent a year in 1991, is now below 10 percent in all three countries. Their new currencies, freed from the ruble, are stable and freely convertible on Western exchange markets. Shortages are mostly a thing of the past.
The wrenching shift toward market economies has claimed many victims. Reforms closed factories and state enterprises, leaving thousands without work; the homeless are now a common sight in the rail station in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, and pensioners complain they cannot live on payments of less than $25 a month.
Still, economists say the future looks reasonably bright. World Bank studies predict sustained economic recovery in all three countries by next year, with growth rising steadily through the turn of the century.
At the same time, progress has been made in defusing tensions over the remnants of the Red Army left behind when the republics split away. With steady pressure from the West, the number of former Red Army troops inside the Baltics has declined from 150,000 in 1991 to a ragtag force of fewer than 18,000, all but 2,500 of whom are in Latvia, where Moscow is clinging to key radar installations facing West. Russian troops have been withdrawn entirely from Lithuania.
 
Russians Who Aren't Going
 A more difficult question is the large minorities of Russian-speaking natives in Estonia and Latvia, mostly the families of blue-collar workers resettled during the Communist era. Although many people have been here all their lives, they argue that they are now being relegated to a second-class status, barred from citizenship until they pass rigorous language exams.
But while nationalist hard-liners and political extremists still argue on behalf of a kind of Baltic ethnic purity, the tensions have never resulted in bloodshed, and in Estonia this fall, the Government let Russian non-citizens vote in local elections. Seizing their chance, they stacked city councils in several cities.
For the most part, the largest obstacles to the Baltics' future are no longer economic, but the legacy of corruption, inefficiency and cynicism resulting from a half-century of Communist control. Organized crime has become a major force. In Estonia alone in 1993, gangs competing to control rackets are suspected of setting off some 50 bombs.
In government and the armed forces, corruption is endemic. In an interview, Gen. Aleksander Einseln, the 61-year-old retired U.S. Army officer and native Estonian who is now commander of Estonia's nascent army, waved a sheaf of papers that he predicted would send shock waves through his ranks. "It's the U.S. military policy on conflict of interest, translated into Estonian," he said.
The Baltic nations, small and vulnerable on the edge of Western Europe, also have a traditional reluctance to cooperate closely with one another. While Westerners often think of the three nations as of a single kind, they are distinctly separate places, each with its own language, history, culture, even architecture. Last year, according to World Bank figures, less than 10 percent of the countries' combined foreign trade volume consisted of intraBaltic trade.
Some attempts are being made at Baltic unity. The three countries say they intend to offer a joint contingent of soldiers to the United Nations to serve as a Baltic peacekeeping battalion, and their Parliaments are now studying a pan-Baltic trade agreement.
But an even larger question is how the Baltics will come to terms with Russia, which looms as not only their greatest worry but also potentially their most profitable trading partner. Last month, Lithuania became the first of the new Baltic nations to reach a trade agreement with its eastern neighbor, but not without protests from nationalists who still harbor grudges. Here in Estonia and in Latvia, feelings are even sharper, tinged by suspicion that Russia might use human rights concerns over Russian minorities as a pretext to meddle or even intervene. "For all the progress we have made, we must be careful not to become too confident," said Hannes Walter, an official of the Estonian Defense Ministry. "For now, the Baltics are still a power vacuum."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Washington's Biggest Special Interest Is Still Itself

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MARVIN DAVIS, the billionaire oil and real estate mogul who once owned 20th Century Fox, likes to hobnob with people of influence. In 1984, when Gary Hart was winning raves in Hollywood as a possible Democratic Presidential nominee, Mr. Davis gave a lavish backlot banquet in his honor. Four years later, he donated $100,000 apiece to the Republican and Democratic parties.
So it was hardly a surprise that Mr. Davis invited President Clinton to his Beverly Hills mansion last night as the star attraction of an intimate dinner party, at a cost of $25,000 to $100,000 per couple (proceeds go to the Democratic National Committee). 
 The surprise was that Mr. Clinton accepted.
Mr. Clinton was elected last year on a promise of sweeping reform; his would be the Presidency in which the flow of millions of dollars of special interest donations would be halted. As he introduced his campaign finance package last May, which would virtually eliminate events like Mr. Davis's, Mr. Clinton boldly vowed to "change the way Washington works." His chairman at the Democratic National Committee, David Wilhelm, declared that the party would rely "less on black-tie dinners and more on brown-bag lunches."
The oratory from candidates for Congress was just as enthusiastic. As recently as last month, there was heady talk of a "reform week" on Capitol Hill, when members would approve tight regulations on how campaigns are financed and new restrictions on lobbyists.
For all the promises, the basic culture does not seem to have changed. Members of Congress are still taking expense-paid getaways from lobbying groups. And like many of his predecessors, the President is choosing dinner companions by how much they give.
The campaign finance bill that Mr. Clinton said would be a top priority was rendered toothless by jittery members of the House: it contains no mechanism to finance vouchers for advertising that would go to candidates who limit their spending. The optimism of many new members elected last year on the promise of reform suddenly seemed like naievite when efforts were dropped to impose a $20 limit on gifts from lobbyists (especially contentious was whether the greens fees that lobbyists often pay when they golf with lawmakers would be subject to new restrictions).
"Clinton can say whatever he wants, but the patterns of behavior are the same old stuff," said former Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., of California, who for years cajoled wealthy supporters for donations then ran against Mr. Clinton in the Democratic primaries last year by attacking the system that he himself had thrived on. "This exclusive dinner goes against every concept of a populist Democratic Party."
Michael Waldman, a reformer himself as director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch and now Mr. Clinton's chief aide on campaign finance, defends the President's attendance at the dinner. "The President has proposed reforms that cut off much of the money that has been raised for Presidential campaigns and that will cost Democrats literally tens of millions of dollars," he said. "We are fighting to pass that legislation. We are not going to unilaterally disarm before that happens."
Indeed, if Mr. Clinton can prod the House and Senate to reach an accommodation on the sometimes contradictory bills they have passed, and resolve Constitutional questions, it would be the first major victory since right after Watergate. But the result would likely fall far short of Mr. Clinton's initial package, which offered advertising subsidies for candidates who limited their spending, and sharply restricted political action committees.
To be fair, Mr. Clinton appears to be well intentioned. He put in place the toughest restrictions ever on Administration officials' lobbying after they leave Government. But he underestimated the resistance from Congress, both from the leadership and the rank-and-file members who fear they will be defeated if special interests are restricted.
 
Setting High Standards
 Faced with competing demands, the President also made a decision not to sacrifice political capital by thrusting himself into the negotiations over campaign finance. "A lot of the liberal, progressive Democrats who helped carry the budget hate campaign finance reform," Mr. Clinton said in an interview in Rolling Stone.
If he is being held to a high standard, it is largely one of his own making. "Once you say you're going to be the most ethical and reform-minded Administration in history, you raise the bar," said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "It is inevitable that he will be accused of hypocrisy."
It could be that the only way Mr. Clinton can achieve the changes he promised is by convincing lawmakers that their constituents want solid evidence that they are willing to upset the status quo. Ross Perot, who pressed reform during last year's campaign, will certainly try to keep these issues alive, though his own credibility was tarnished in the debate last month when Vice President Al Gore recalled the Texan's history of lobbying Congress in support of his business ventures.
But there is still a real question of how much disillusioned voters would be impressed by enactment of new ethics and campaign laws. "Everyone has concerns about health care, and issues like the economy," said Ruth Jones, a political scientist at Arizona State University. "But only 12 to 15 percent even give to campaigns."
Representative J. Alex McMillan, a Republican from North Carolina who is the latest of nearly 20 incumbent House members who announced plans to retire next year, does not seem convinced that his colleagues will be moved to change their ways anytime soon. In a parting letter to his constituents last week, a clearly soured Mr. McMillan wrote: "I have been frustrated and greatly disappointed by the failure of Congress and our Presidents to exercise strong, independent leadership, as opposed to yielding to the influence of various special interest groups and the cynical political environment that dominates present-day Washington."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Foreign Aid Of Words, Not Cash

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON stood at the White House with the leaders of all five Central American countries last week and noted that it was the first time in the 20th century that a United States President was meeting a group of democratically elected Presidents from the region. "My message to these distinguished leaders and to the millions whom they represent is simple: The United States will be there as your partner to help," Mr. Clinton said. "We will not make the mistake of abandoning this region when its dramatic recovery is not yet complete."
Fine words, but like much of what comes out of the deficit-plagued Federal Government these days, the reach exceeded the grasp. 
 The hard reality is that in the last few years, American financial aid to the fledgling democracies of Central America -- and to much of the rest of the world -- has fallen, as if off a cliff. El Salvador, for example, has seen direct cash payments shrink to $45 million from $126 million in 1991. Three years ago, cash assistance to Nicaragua was $226 million. It is now $10 million. Hondouras received $50 million in 1991 in direct payments. It is due to get $7.5 million in the current fiscal year.
And the pattern has been repeated in other regions. Public support for foreign aid -- never strong -- is eroding with the end of the cold war. As a result, total foreign aid has dropped by roughly $4 billion since 1985, when the total was about $18.5 billion. "The security interests have diminished, the political interests are small and we don't have much money," said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue.
Experts have begun to worry that the drop in American financial assistance may actually increase political instability in areas like Central America and that this will inhibit economic growth by scaring away new investment. Some of the experts point out that this seems to belie the stated American goal of encouraging the rise of consumer societies abroad that would be better markets for United States exports -- although it is also an obvious, if harsh, truth that large countries like Mexico are far more likely to be taken seriously in this regard than tiny ones.
Indeed, even as President Clinton was trumpeting American concern for Central America, State Department planners were preparing confidential memos warning that aid cutbacks were imperiling the region's nascent democracies. "Without timely material and moral support from other democratic countries, fragile transitions to democratic rule could be lost," said a memo prepared by State Department analysts.
To much of the public, foreign aid is an amorphous, little understood and not well liked program. The $14.4 billion in aid appropriated this year represents only about 1 percent of total Federal spending and encompasses everything from military aid to population stabilization, anti-narcotics programs, disaster assistance, the Peace Corps, non-emergency food aid, help for refugees and contributions to the United Nations and the World Bank.
About 40 percent of this aid is designated for the Middle East and the former Soviet Union (Israel and Egypt remain by far the largest individual recipients under arrangements that date to the Camp David accords). And with a new American commitment of $75 million a year to support the effort to find peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, money for other countries is drying up.
Aid to the Philippines has been cut by 85 percent in the last three years. The United States is $1.2 billion behind on its payments to the United Nations and to international lending institutions. It has failed to meet its promised share of international assistance to nations such as Peru and Guyana. Non-emergency aid to sub-Sahara Africa has diminished only slightly, but Africa hands at the State Department fear major cutbacks.
And the Office of Management and Budget has told the State Department to reduce foreign aid by another 6.5 percent in the next budget. State Department planners say there will be no cuts for the Middle East and the former Soviet Union, meaning that other programs -- mainly in Asia and Latin America -- will probably see reductions of 40 percent to 60 percent.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Part Two of The Free Trade Triathlon

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Clinton Administration is trying to complete a free trade triathlon: the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada last month, a global trade pact this month and greater economic integration with Asia, including a deal with Japan on cars, insurance and several other industries early next year.
After seven years of tedious negotiations and missed deadlines, a global free-trade pact may be just 10 days away, trade officials said last week. Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's top trade official, are expected to announce in Brussels tomorrow a settlement of many trans-Atlantic trade squabbles that have blocked completion of an overall trade pact among 116 nations. 
 The deal is designed to address French objections to an agreement last year that would have cut European Government payments to farm exporters very sharply in 1995 and very gradually from 1996 through 2001. The new deal would spread all of the cuts evenly over the years from 1995 to 2001.
The European Government's payments to exporters have depressed world prices, angering American farmers. In exchange for the slower cuts, the community agreed to open its markets a little wider to American farm exports.
The global trade pact now taking shape is as important as it is arcane. It would cut world tariffs on manufactured goods by a third. It would also broaden the free-trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to cover agriculture and service industries like tourism and insurance for the first time. Until now, the 45-year-old GATT has covered trade in manufactured goods, gradually lowering worldwide tariffs to 5 percent from 40 percent.
Estimates vary widely on the effects of a broader trade agreement on the American consumer and the world economy. The price of a grocery basket of food is unlikely to change much at first, because the agricultural provisions take effect so slowly. But eventually a pound of sugar or a bag of peanuts would probably be a few pennies cheaper. The cost to taxpayers of Federal payments to American farmers would eventually fall by $2 billion to $3 billion or more a year.
The Administration forecasts that the agreement could also create 1.4 million American jobs over the next decade by eliminating foreign trade barriers that keep foreign consumers from buying such American products as records, insurance and corn. But labor unions and some American business executives warn that many jobs could be lost because the Federal Government would be less able to impose special taxes on cheap imports that hurt American companies.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Why Mexico Has Only One Big Hat In the Ring

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
THERE was no white smoke. No cannons boomed. But when the man handpicked by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to be his successor was brought to the headquarters of Mexico's governing party last week, the event represented as secretive and undemocratic a process as any selection of a pope or coronation of a king. That night, thousands of people surrounded party headquarters. And the streets rang not with rage but elation.
The scene might have dispelled President Clinton's vision of a rising democracy in Mexico, and it probably disappointed those who believed that Mr. Salinas would make the process of picking the next president more open than it has been during the 64 years that his party or its predecessor have been in power. 
 But it might also have provided some grim satisfaction for those United States legislators who, during the long debate in Congress over the North American Free Trade Agreement last month, had argued that Mexico was more dictatorship than democracy.
Democracy might seem an odd issue to have been included in a free trade debate, but President Clinton sold the agreement partly on the premise that by opening its economy further with the accord, Mexico would quicken the pace of its political opening as well.
The White House now seems uncertain about how to deal with Mexican reality. Vice President Al Gore traveled to Mexico City last week pledging that free trade "promotes democracy," but he said nothing about the secretive anointment last Sunday of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murietta as the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in an election on Aug. 21 that most people view as no contest. Perhaps worse, Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, was taken to task by the scraggly Mexican opposition for seeming to refer to Mr. Colosio prematurely as "the new president."
Mexico's economy has indeed opened up, with more than 1,000 state-owned companies privatized and many protectionist tariffs reduced or removed already, before the free-trade agreement takes effect on Jan. 1.
But even President Salinas admits that Mexico's political opening has been far more modest. He has said political reform should come after economic restructuring, not before; otherwise the country would risk the sort of instability that undid Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet Union. Since Mr. Salinas's popularity soared after the Nafta vote, it appears that most Mexicans are willing to accept his argument.
Thus it often seems, as it did during the Nafta debate, that the pressure for democratizing Mexico is stronger outside the country than within. Why?
"It may not be politically correct to say so, but there is a very strong element of authoritarianism in many aspects of Mexican life," said Roderic A. Camp, a Mexico expert at Tulane University. Mexico, after all, is still a society where even middle-class families have maids and people routinely identify themselves as "su servidor," literally "your servant."
Mexico has loved a strong leader since before Moctezuma. Indigenous tribes were ruled by caciques, or chieftans, and in some rural communities caciques are still unchallenged. After independence in 1821 ended 300 years of Spanish rule, Mexicans time and again turned to emperors, dictators or caudillos -- strong rulers.
"What we have experienced just recently is still part of this heavy cultural burden," said Raymundo Riva Palacio, an editor of the independent El Financiero. "Last Sunday a king died and a new king was born."
Maybe it was the burden of culture that compelled thousands of Mexicans to stand in the night. Maybe it was the governing party's free sandwiches.
Whichever, not one of the people carried a sign objecting to the near-inevitable succession of Mr. Colosio -- near-inevitable because of the Institutional Revolutionary Party's virtual lock on Mexican political life.
The original party was formed by the post-revolutionary leaders of 1929 so they could maintain power, and it became an incarnation of the Government, dispensing favors, repressing opposition and becoming so entwined with Mexican life that joining many unions still brings automatic membership in the party.
The PRI, as the party is known by its Spanish initials, was also based on allegiance, always leading back to the president. But unlike the typical authoritarian Latin American regime, Mexico is run by civilians, not generals. The PRI has deliberately absorbed weak opposition parties and tolerated a small critical press. And the prohibition against re-election meant the absolute ruler was absolutely discarded after six years.
The system produced an enviable record of stability for a third world country. Unrest surfaced in student riots of 1968, and a near loss for Mr. Salinas in the election of 1988, but mostly Mexico has been at peace.
 
Geographic Release Valve
 Terry L. Karl, director of the Center for Latin American Studies at Stanford University, says the party avoided unrest in part by repressing or buying off potential opponents. Moreover, Mexico has an extraordinary advantage of geography, and the release valve of the Rio Grande. The angriest and most entrepreneurial simply went north when the problems of Mexico got to be too much. As in Communist Cuba, those departures weakened the voice of opposition.
The middle class has generally been quiet, though not necessarily supportive of the government; rather, it acquiesces to it. For many middle-class Mexicans, the government is a path to privilege, not a way to change society. In one 1990 survey, two-thirds of Mexicans said their government was working only for its own interests.
Still, a lot is riding on the August election. After hearing so many promises about the impact of a trade agreement, expectations among ordinary Mexicans for more trade, more pay and more political openness have undoubtedly risen. The United States has great expectations too, especially since Nafta can be abrogated if it seems that promises are not being kept.
Mr. Colosio's contradictory brief in the election will be to give the appearance of real change while also insuring that his party retains power. He not only has to win, but to do so cleanly and convincingly.
He may have gotten the message. The night he was selected, he took the surprising step of proposing to debate the opposition candidates, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolutionary Party.
But such concessions don't always sit well with old-line party members emboldened by Mr. Salinas's victories into thinking the party may rule for another 64 years. More than anything, Mr. Colosio will have to avoid the kind of black cloud now hovering over the state of Yucatan. While Mr. Gore was extolling a hemispheric "community of democracies" in Mexico City last Wednesday, Mexicans in the Yucatan were out in the street, not praising Mr. Colosio, but protesting that the PRI had stolen last Sunday's gubernatorial election, and that they had been cheated again.

HEADLINE: The Difficult Math of Welfare Reform

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
There are approximately 60,000 words in the Administration's plan to overhaul the welfare system, but three of them have the potential to mock the rest and expose President Clinton's bold promises as empty slogans. Those words are: "Deficit neutral funding."
That means Mr. Clinton plans to finance an ambitious set of child care, education and work programs for people on welfare by cutting other programs for the poor. 
 If past practices hold, advocacy groups will rebel, political bloodletting will follow and Mr. Clinton will wind up with a program not nearly as bold as his campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it."
That's what veterans of past welfare wars foresee, as a draft of his plan came to light this week.
"It can't work," said Joseph Califano, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare when President Jimmy Carter failed to win a similar self-financed plan. "Deja vu, isn't it?"
Mr. Clinton's pledge to make welfare recipients work is an enormously popular one, and he turned to it often on the campaign trail last year.
 
What the Public Hears
 The public hears the talk of time limits as a way to get tough and save money. But the plan described in the draft, subject to the President's review, talks of first expanding training programs and day care. That is so welfare mothers can acquire job skills and find people to watch their children while they work. The plan also talks of financing some of the jobs.
That is much more expensive than simply sending welfare checks, which now average about $370 a month for a mother and two children.
How expensive? The Clinton plan does not say, and no one will know the extent until the President puts forward some numbers. The plan itself describes a phase-in to ease the burden.
"We have not fully thought through the financing because we are not sure how much the President wants to do," Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in an interview on Friday.
 
Cynicism Is Perceived
 But Ms. Shalala insists that even a large program can be financed by savings from the current human services budget. She accused old Washington hands of undue cynicism about efforts to make bureaucracies more efficient.
"Is it possible?" she asked. "Yes," she said, arguing that local and state governments are doing it. "Will it be difficult? Yes. Has Washington ever done it? No."
Five million adults and nine million children receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal cash program, and that is a record.
Poor and disproportionately black, seen to be idle, they are not a popular bunch. Welfare and food stamp benefits have already shrunk by about 25 percent over two decades, when adjusted for inflation, and state and local governments remain under stress.
While the cost of welfare is not small, it is not as large as the passions that surround the issue, which are inflamed by notions of race and class and sexual behavior.
The A.F.D.C. program costs about $23 billion a year. Medicaid and food stamps for welfare recipients add about $40 billion to the bill.
That's less than half the cost of Medicare, the $140 billion health insurance program for the elderly. And it's about a quarter of the cost of Social Security, which will reach $320 billion this year.
Mr. Califano has called welfare reform the Middle East of domestic politics, a world composed of warring tribes and irreconcilable differences.
An overly pessimistic judgment? Perhaps. But the plan is still only a draft and the tribes are already on the move.
One is composed of centrist Democrats. In October, 77 of them in the House, loosely affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council, urged Mr. Clinton by letter to stick to the time limits. But they ducked the question of money, asserting vaguely that the costs of various welfare programs could be cut. "You can squeeze other programs that are not as high a priority to pay for this," said Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, a leader of the group. "That's what making choices is about."
The liberal tribe responded in November. A letter signed by 89 Representatives called a time-limit plan arbitrary and said it would "increase poverty and hurt needy families."
And then there is a Republican view, expressed in a House bill that would impose tougher time limits than those being contemplated by the Administration. It does spend money -- up to $6 billion a year for child care and training. But it plans to raise the money by cutting food programs and welfare benefits for immigrants.
Otherwise, the plan would be "taking money from people who work, to give more to people who don't," said Representative Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania. "That's not what anybody beyond the Beltway means by welfare reform."
But existing programs do not yield lightly, even those for the poor. The Administration recently tried to raise $330 million for unemployment benefits, by cutting a disability program for immigrants. Hispanic members of the House were enraged, and defying the Democratic leadership, they defeated the plan.
During his campaign, Mr. Clinton suggested spending an additional $4 billion on training. An aide said this week that it would look silly to propose a more limited program than the one the $6 billion Republican bill.
And even that might not be enough to cover all the families on welfare, even if the Administration finds the money, through real cuts or overly optimistic projections of savings.
A rough estimate prepared for the Administration last year suggested that as many as 1.5 million families would exhaust a two-year limit without finding a job. Past experience suggests that it could cost about $5 billion just to run the work portion of the program. The training portion could possibly double that sum.
That is why the plan now talks about phasing in a program slowly, creating a structure but deferring its costs.
Time limits have the appeal of sounding cheap: two years and then people will have to work. But work where? Some will find private jobs, but many will not, especially in an economy with 8.3 million out of work.

HEADLINE: Gambling, Pariah No More, Is Booming Across America

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., Dec. 1

 BODY:
The newest venture in the booming national industry of legalized gambling is now open for business: futuristic virtual-reality rides to soothe the losers' souls, just up the theme-park escalator from acres of the latest video slot machines.
Here in the desert where Bugsy Siegel started it all six decades ago as a limited-audience, amoral escapade for high rollers, legalized gambling is displaying its growing mass-entertainment role in grand fashion. Three huge new casinos costing a total of $2 billion are opening with a new kind of Hollywood star power, a tie-in emphasis on special-effects theme-park entertainment. 
 "Did you see that?" asked one distracted loser, Jim Czarniecki, emerging in great delight from one of the new participatory trompe l'oeil theater entertainments at the mammoth new Luxor casino hotel.
With its replica of Tut's tomb, the glass pyramid-cum-Sphinx extravaganza is enough to make the old American connotation of the sinfulness of gambling seem as quaintly distant as the Conestoga wagon.
The sin is indeed gone from the nation's gaming industry, obliterated by the notion of mass entertainment. Fifteen years of astounding growth has seen legalized gambling mushroom from just two main casino cities and a handful of state lotteries and race tracks to take root in some form in all the states but Utah and Hawaii, creating an estimated 500,000 jobs.
 
Lotteries in 37 States
 Americans, unrestrained in their entertainment appetite by the recession, spent $29.9 billion on legal gambling last year. That was six times what they spent on movie tickets, as the gambling industry enlarged its share of the nation's entertainment dollar through a dizzying, competitive combination of state lotteries, Indian reservation casinos, and riverboat gambling that saw the industry buck the recession with an 11 percent annual growth rate across the last decade.
Of all the factors that rolled back the bias against gambling, the steady growth of mass-market state lotteries may be most influential if least flamboyant in making gambling accepted more as middle-class recreation. From New Hampshire's first lottery in 1964, elaborate lotteries are now under way in 37 states, raking in 38 cents of every legally wagered dollar. With new, more inviting video technology helping increase play, the total tax revenue from the lotteries alone climbed to $11.45 billion last year, an increase of 12 percent over 1991.
Popular lottery acceptance, recession pressures on state and local budgets, and a sudden cascade of casino investments on land and water are the main factors in gambling's growth.
"People are now looking at gambling as another entertainment option," said Paul Dworin, publisher and editor of Gambling & Wagering Business magazine.
"Americans spend more on leisure and entertainment, and gambling has become a significant part of that economy," said Mr. Dworin, whose own publication has paralleled gambling in moving from editorial pariah to industry resource in a decade of changing attitudes.
In that metamorphosis, no factor has been more noticeable than the shift in morality issues in American politics, which, while coming to focus on abortion more, has spared gambling the fulmination and denunciation of the past.
"Helping this change in attitude is the fact that two of society's moral arbiters and most outspoken critics of gaming -- church and state -- have been quelled in recent years due to their dependence on revenues derived from gaming," concluded a detailed analysis of the industry boom by Wertheim Schroder & Company, investment consultants.
In the least expected part of the explosion, at least 65 Indian reservation casinos have opened since 1989 in 17 states in the hands of tribes resurrected from poverty by gambling that created more than $900 million in annual profits. Eighty more court-protected sovereign tribes have gambling plans in a dozen other states.
They were inspired by the industry's phenomenon, the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn. Since being opened 21 months ago by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, which was once nearly extinct amid urban poverty, it has become the most profitable casino in the world, according to industry estimates. It has greatly increased nervousness in the Atlantic City casino industry as well as pressure in neighboring states to guarantee their own flow of gambling revenue.
Even with the tribes' total profits doubling annually, they control only about 5 percent of the market. In another boom factor as the recession-wounded states scrambled for revenue, Iowa started riverboat gambling only two years ago with two modest operations. Now there are more than two dozen casino boats working the waters and betting handles, and 40 more authorized in six states along the Gulf Coast and Mississippi River. High-stakes gambling goes on round-the-clock in cut-throat regional competition, lately aboard land-locked "riverboats."
 
Boating to the Elevators
 Fun more than fortune is the promised payoff in gambling's modern market approach through theme-park casinos designed by specialists like Douglas Trumbull, the special-effects master who fantasized time travel for such movies as "Bladerunner" and "Back to the Future."
Here within the recently opened Luxor pyramid, there is an indoor Nile for boating from the registration desk to the elevators and a huge atrium that easily includes a mall of food, entertainment and merchandizing. The resort contains 2,526 large, low-priced rooms and traditionally steep house-odds that rise against the cinnamon hue of the desert mountains in 30 stories of black-matte glass and fake Egyptian mystery.
There are three theaters for past, present and future virtual-reality rides that Aldous Huxley only dreamt of, plus an arcade of prototype Sega games for third-dimension pinball buffs, all designed to be profit-making, not come-ons for the casino games.
"I mean, it's like being inside, not just at, the movies," said Mr. Czarniecki, pleased with his bit of loser's bonus in getting to jounce and duck and zoom through a big-screen, Indiana Jones-type of a tumble in a wired seat set before an electronic Egyptian fantasy.
He is a fairly typical modern American gambler, according to industry statistics: one of the 50 percent of adults who have been inside a casino to spend their entertainment dollars, a percentage that has been rapidly rising, and a middle-income worker who regularly plays the weekly lottery in his home state.
Clyde Turner, president of Circus Circus Enterprises, which built the Luxor mega-casino, thinks Mark Twain would savor the current boom, with his insights into such Americana as riverboats, pragmatically shifting mores and bourgeois delights.
 
'Changes in Ideas'
 "The showboat icon of progress and fun that Twain understood is a serious factor in all this," said Mr. Turner, a 56-year-old accountant who was born in this city yet sternly shielded from gambling as a boy by his father, who worked at a small casino.
"Years ago people wouldn't tell their friends they had been here," he said of Las Vegas, one of the fastest growing cities in the nation as the generation of theme-park casinos is built and staffed. "The key to what is happening with legalized gambling is the change in peoples' ideas and thoughts."
The pervasiveness of the change is not always for the better, concede some industry specialists like Eugene Martin Christiansen, a consultant who tracks gaming growth for Gambling & Wagering Business magazine. "Jaded, shopped-out consumers who take a little measured stimulation in Las Vegas now and then are one side of the coin," he noted in his latest industry study. "Housewives who play street-corner video lottery poker machines compulsively are the other."
His larger point, however, is legal gambling's undeniable growth and new status as a national institution. "Gambling is now squarely in the American mainstream," Mr. Christiansen said. "It is an enormous business: about the size in 1992 of the Hollywood filmed entertainment industry." .
He estimates that the nearly $30 billion in annual revenue in the growing gambling industry is equal to all of the revenue in films and related cable and video enterprises in Hollywood, which saw theater patronage dip slightly last year.
Gambling executives contend that the industry, through tighter regulatory controls, has succeeded in driving out most organized criminal influences from casinos, which serve a third of the market. Still, not all states are cooperating in the high-stakes urge.
Idaho recently approved a constitutional ban on casinos, though the state does allow bingo, betting on greyhound and horse races. Colorado, a pioneer in small-town mountain casinos, has set new limits after some towns went from boom to bust because of saturation, a problem in some regions but one that specialists do not expect nationally, at least for the rest of this decade.
 
Rivaling Health Clubs
 The percentage of Americans' personal income spent on gambling has been growing, reaching 0.59 percent last year. According to Mr. Christiansen, this is comparable to what Americans spent on dentistry or on health clubs and beauty parlors. In the eyes of the new generation of entertainment-gambling executives here, wagering is a consumer attraction as morally defensible as the nation's passive mania for movies and videos.
Looming here across from the Luxor's sphinx is a giant lion symbolizing the MGM Grand casino about to open with 5,009 bedrooms -- the world's largest hotel -- and a theme park that will take days to visit. The third in the new generation of casinos, Treasure Island, is already open on the Vegas Strip, complete with an hourly sea battle of actor-buccaneers aboard two full-size sailing ships set in a desert canal just outside the gaming rooms.
"Say, I thought we were here for the gambling," one woman in the crowd said to her companion in confusion the other night as the battle raged. The spectacle was soon over, and her man urgently said, "C'mon." They hurried inside to a vast new gambling mart, in pursuit of their own fantasies.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
'Alliance' to Buy Health Care: Bureaucrat or Public Servant?

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
If the Clinton health plan becomes law, it will put a new institution into the lives of most Americans: the health alliance. Almost no other aspect of the plan is so little understood or so radically different from the status quo.
Administration planners envision the alliances as benign and helpful organizations that would perform many functions now handled by employee benefit departments. 
 In essence, the Clinton alliances would act as middlemen between consumers and health plans. They would collect premiums from individuals and employers, enforce Federal rules on the amount of premiums health plans could charge, rate the performance of the plans the way Consumer Reports might and conduct annual open enrollments when people could decide which plan to join for the year to come.
In short, Clinton advisers say, the alliances would give people more power, more information and more choices in the kind of health care they receive than they have today.
 
Comparing Bureaucracies
 "What we are doing is replacing the inept, wasteful and ineffective bureaucracy, if you will, of the unfettered marketplace," said Judith Feder, a deputy assistant secretary of Health and Human Services.
This, however, is just one vision of the alliance. There is also a nightmare concept from critics on both the left and the right. They see a new layer of bureaucracy imposed on people already dissatisfied with the amount of government in their lives. They see an enormous amount of power invested in the appointed boards that would run the alliances, a situation ripe for corruption and conflicts of interest.
There would be one alliance in every region, whose boundaries and administrative structure would be determined by the states. Everyone would belong to it, rich and poor alike, except those who work for the biggest corporations. Critics predict brutal political battles in state legislatures over how the borders of the alliances are drawn, as localities struggle to avoid sharing their alliances with inner city, poor and high-risk populations.
The critics also fear that making the alliances monopolies will make them as sensitive to consumer needs as the average Department of Motor Vehicles. And, perhaps most of all, they say the Administration's planners are putting an astonishing amount of faith in an idea largely untested in the United States. What happens, many critics ask, if the Federal Government puts 70 percent of Americans, including many of those in the Medicaid program for the poor, into a system of health alliances that fails to work?
"They're too large and they're too regulatory," said Representative Jim Cooper, a conservative Democrat from Tennessee with a rival plan.
Representative Pete Stark, a liberal Democrat from California who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said, "It's a cockamamie program."
The predominant attitude on Capitol Hill, however, may be simply wariness about how an alliance would work. "Who appoints them?" asked Senator Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland. "How would they be accountable? What can you do with them if they're not working? Who watches the franchise in this new approach?"
 
Idea Whose Time Has Arrived
 The idea of health care alliances has been percolating for years. The original rationale is simple: small businesses have serious problems in buying affordable insurance. They are often too small to spread the risk of medical catastrophes. For example, one terribly ill child covered by a small company's plan can send its premiums skyrocketing. And they are too small to attain the economies of scale in administrative costs available to the biggest companies.
Enter the alliances, originally called the health insurance purchasing cooperatives, a name changed on the advice of Clinton political advisers. Like any other cooperative, from those for farmers to those for aging hippie food purchasers, they would presumably combine and strengthen the bargaining clout of members -- in this case, small businesses.
They would spread the risk over a larger pool, share administrative costs and end up, theoretically, as a big and powerful market that health plans would compete to serve. In other words, a little tinkering with the marketplace would solve a social problem, very much in keeping with the political fashion of the day.
The idea caught hold. According to the Institute for Health Policy Solutions, a Washington research group, eight states have passed legislation in the last few years providing for some kind of alliance. Most are focused on the needs of small businesses; membership in all is voluntary, according to the institute, and most are just getting off the ground.
Several alternative proposals to overhaul the nation's health care system now pending in Congress would create alliances. And the Jackson Hole group, an influential gathering of planners from the health industry, government and academia, put alliances at the center of their theory of managed competition, the concept that was eventually embraced by the Clinton forces.
The alliances have an obvious appeal for Mr. Clinton and his advisers, many of whom pride themselves on rejecting stereotypical big-government Democratic solutions to social needs, like straightforward government-financed, Canadian-style health insurance.
They have a new-Democrat, reinventing-government flavor, with a reliance on a magic blend of market and regulatory forces and a populist twist to boot. "Today, only big business has the clout to negotiate lower prices," the official White House account of the health plan says. "After reform, every American will have bargaining strength to get low prices and high quality care."
But by the time the Clinton forces finished drafting their health plan this fall, the alliances had been transformed into something that the original architects of managed competition disdained. They had become far more elaborate, far more regulatory and far bigger than a simple little co-op for small businesses.
Under the Clinton plan, the bulk of the Medicaid program for the poor, on which the Federal Government and the states spend more than $130 billion a year, would be folded into the alliances. The jurisdiction of the alliances was extended to all businesses with fewer than 5,000 employees. (Mr. Cooper's plan, for example, would require participation by companies with only about 100 employees or less.) Alliances would also be responsible for managing a system of subsidies for low-wage companies and low-income people that is an important part of the Clinton plan.
Beyond that, the alliances would collect premiums from employers and employees and pass the money onto health plans, they would negotiate a rate schedule with health care providers that would keep practicing traditional fee-for-service medicine (rather than forming H.M.O's.), and they would insure that participating health plans stayed within the boundaries of a premium price structure set by a National Health Board.
To its critics, the Clinton plan has transformed a market-oriented solution into another Government bureaucracy, and a largely untested one at that.
 
How the Public Sees Government
 Administration officials are keenly aware that this is not an auspicious moment to propose the creation of a network of government agencies; confidence in government remains quite low in public opinion polls. In interviews and in Congressional testimony, Clinton health planners are adamant that the alliances are not a vast new expansion of government.
"There isn't quite as much here as may meet the eye at first," argues Paul Starr, the Princeton sociologist who helped develop the Clinton plan. Walter Zelman, another architect, asserts, "I'm not denying that the alliance is a linchpin, but it's not an enormously powerful structure in the sense that it has all kinds of political flexibility to change rules and to treat people differently."
Administration officials insist that alliance staffs would be modest; Ira C. Magaziner, the domestic policy adviser who led the health plan effort, asserted that even in New York, "I don't think it's a huge bureaucracy."
Officials, however, have been reluctant to discuss just how big alliance staffs would be. One rough estimate -- Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, described it as a very rough estimate -- figured each alliance would cover about a million people and have a staff of about 200.
Clinton aides assert that the alliances would lead to a net reduction in bureaucracy, replacing much of the health benefits bureaucracy of the private sector. Mr. Zelman argued, "Its main functions are in doing, hopefully efficiently, what millions of employers and hundreds of providers and insurers are doing inefficiently now -- collecting money, redistributing money, facilitating the purchasing of and paying for insurance."
Administration officials contend that making the alliances as large as they did, as well as making membership in them mandatory for all but the biggest companies, was essential to spread the risk and prevent the practice of "cherry picking" by insurance companies, or going after the healthiest clients and leaving the sickest and those with the highest risks to fend for themselves. The system would not work, they argue, if alliances ended up serving only small, high-risk populations like former Medicaid clients, inner city populations and a smattering of small businesses.
In the end, the Clinton defense comes down to this: Other, more modest proposals to reform the health care system, like Mr. Cooper's, simply fall short of the goals of guaranteeing health coverage to every American and controlling the rapidly rising health care costs.
Still, the third way that Mr. Clinton so often seeks between left and right has, on the question of alliances, left him open to withering fire from both sides.
The purists of managed competition argue that the Clinton alliance idea is more of a vehicle to control prices than to spur competition. Mr. Cooper said the Clinton version "could be a stepping-stone to a single payer system." A spokesman for the Jackson Hole group, testifying before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, called it "a good health care idea gone bad." Meanwhile, the supporters of a single-payer system counter that their system is much less complicated and far more appealing.
 
Political Reality Raises Questions
 Another set of concerns is practical, not ideological. For all the good intentions of the Clinton planners, just how well would the alliance work in the real, messy world of politics?
There is substantial worry on Capitol Hill about this. For example, the Clinton plan would turn considerable discretion over to state legislatures and governors in setting up the alliances. States would decide how many alliances to have, the details of how to structure the entities and whether to make them nonprofit organizations, independent agencies or agencies of the state. The Clinton proposal does specify, however, that they be run by an appointed board of consumers and employers.
In a Congressional hearing this fall, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, told Ms. Feder: "As sure as I am sitting here, some of these alliances will become monolithic; some of them will take unto themselves powers that are not pro-consumer. They will be thinking more about preserving their own position, about whom they are doing business with and what is in it for them."
Then there is the question of setting boundaries for the alliances; the Clinton plan prohibits redlining high-risk areas and it stipulates that all of a metropolitan statistical area must be included in the same alliance. But some predict a battle in state legislatures that would make Congressional redistricting look tame. "I can assure you that politics will play an important role, because basically there is no redistribution across alliances," said Robert Reischauer, head of the Congressional Budget Office. "So, there will be a temptation to isolate low-income, high-risk people in an alliance if that's feasible."
Clinton supporters argue that much of the criticism of the alliances is being stoked by insurance industry groups and others with a vested interest in holding off true restructuring of the health care system. Still, the debate is clearly joined. While many believe the plan that finally emerges from Congress will include some kind of alliance or purchasing cooperative, it is widely expected to be considerably more modest than the one that Mr. Clinton is proposing. For example, lowering the 5,000-employee threshold necessary to opt out of a regional alliance is a likely area of compromise.
Alain Enthoven, a Stanford University professor of management, an architect of managed competition and principle theoretician of the Jackson Hole Group, seems somewhat taken aback at what has become of his alliance. "I think there are large implementation risks," Mr. Enthoven said of the Clinton plan. "It just seems to me to be this huge leap into the unknown to say right away that everyone's got to be in this thing."


GRAPHIC: Under the Clinton health plan, alliances serve as the middleman: employers, employees and the government would pay premiums into the alliances, which would then pay them out to health plans.
 
The Buyers
Chart: "How Alliances Would Work"
 Employers and employees each pay a share of the cost of purchasing health insurance, and the Government contributes for low-income people.
 
The Alliances
 The middlemen that collect the premiums and pass them on to health plans. The alliances also have many broad responsibilities: They manage the system of subsidies for poor people and low-wage businesses. They make sure that health plans stay within the limits of a federally-set premium cap. They take complaints from consumers and issue report cards each year grading the various participating plans. They conduct an annual enrollment period to let people decide which plan they want for the coming year. They also negotiate rates with doctors who choose to stay outside of health maintenance organizations and practice traditional fee-for-service medicine.
 
The Plans
 Health plans would compete for business. A variety of plans would be available: health maintenance organizations, fee-for-service plans or some mixture of the two. These plans could be organized by doctors, by insurance companies, by hospitals or a variety of other institutions. (pg. 38)

HEADLINE: Venezuela Votes Today, Cautioned by Clinton

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Buffeted by two military coup attempts, a presidential resignation and plummeting economic performance in the last two years, Venezuela's voters are to choose a new President on Sunday.
For the United States, political volatility in South America's oldest democracy is a matter of concern. Venezuela controls the largest oil reserves outside the Persian Gulf and is the United States' largest source of imported oil after Saudi Arabia. 
 President Clinton this week sent his top two advisers on Latin American affairs to Caracas, bearing clear messages of support for democracy.
"Any disruption in the democratic process would inevitably have an immediate and chilling impact on the full range of our bilateral relations," Mr. Clinton said in a letter to Venezuela's President, Ramon J. Velasquez, an elder statesman who is not running. "There would be no possibility of a normal relationship between the United States and a nondemocratic Venezuela."
On Thursday, as newspapers here carried reports of the latest coup conspiracy, a blunter warning came from one of the envoys, Alexander F. Watson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs.
"Military regimes are an anachronism in this hemisphere, vestiges of a dark and discredited past," Mr. Watson told Venezuelan businessmen. He added that an expanded version of the North American Free Trade Agreement "does not include, and will not include, countries that don't have democratically elected governments."
On Friday, security officials said they had detained six officers who they suspect were plotting to sabotage the election.
Venezuela is dependent on oil for 80 percent of its exports. With oil prices at a three-year low, the country is experiencing its worst economic performance since 1989. This year, inflation rose to 47 percent, and the economy shrank by about 4 percent.
The presidential race is too close to call, but the two front-runners are Rafael Caldera, an aging populist who first ran for President when Harry Truman was in the White House, and Andres Velasquez, a state governor from the leftist Radical Cause party.
Polls give a slight edge to Mr. Caldera, who served as Venezuala's President in the early 1970's. He is running as an independent with the support of 16 small parties.
If elected, Mr. Caldera would start a five-year term in February at age 78. Although he has refused to debate his opponents, his program appears to call for reversing some of the moves toward a free market in recent years.
"The country's going through a very serious political and economic crisis, and it needs a very experienced man in the presidency," said Alvaro Celis, a business manager who was handing out Caldera leaflets at a subway station here. "Caldera enjoys excellent physical and intellectual health."
A different view came from Carlos Andres Perez, who steered Venezuela down a free-market course until he was forced to step down as President last May in a corruption scandal.
"Caldera has more or less created the expectation of a return to the past," Mr. Perez told El Diario, a Caracas newspaper, this week. "In reality, this is impossible. As much as he would like to try, he won't be able to do it without causing a catastrophe in Venezuela."
Mr. Velasquez, 40, is running a close second to Mr. Caldera in public opinion polls. A former steel worker and reform unionist, Mr. Velasquez is running on an anti-corruption platform.
"The man comes from the bottom, and he understands the problems of the poor," said Ritxi de Munarrain, a Radical Cause volunteer.
Whoever wins Sunday is expected to take office backed by the votes of fewer than 10 percent of Venezuela's 20 million people.
Not only will the vote be split among four major candidates, but the abstention rate is expected to be twice the level of the 18 percent of the 1988 election, when Mr. Perez was elected. Analysts said discontent with politicians and the complex paper ballot were likely to keep turnout down.

HEADLINE: TRIAL IN SINGAPORE TESTS PRESS CURBS

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Dec. 3

 BODY:
There was unexpected bad news for Singapore investors in the summer of 1992, when Government figures showed that economic growth was sluggish, at least by the standards of this booming Southeast Asian city-state.
A year later, the news may be far worse for the newspaper editors who dared to run an exclusive article citing the Government's numbers. Their exclusive may send them, and their sources, to prison. 
 In a trial that is testing the limits of press freedom in Southeast Asia's most prosperous nation, two editors from Singapore's leading financial newspaper, Business Times, are accused of violating the Official Secrets Act, a law so broadly worded that it bars the release of any information the Government deems confidential.
 
Quarterly Growth Estimate
 In this case, the published information strikes many Singaporeans as reasonably innocuous -- an early, inexact estimate of economic growth for the second quarter of 1992. But the leak was considered so damaging by the Government that it raided the newsroom of Business Times and spent hours rummaging through the computer files of reporters and editors.
If convicted, the two editors, Patrick Daniel and Kenneth James, and their co-defendants -- two securities analysts and a Government economist who are charged with taking part in the leak -- face up to two years in prison.
The case centers on an article that appeared in the English-language newspaper in late June 1992. It disclosed that early, unpublished Government figures showed that economic growth for the second quarter of last year was slower than the 5.1 percent growth of the first quarter, declining to 4.6 to 4.8 percent.
While that sort of growth would be cause for celebration in the United States and most of the rest of the world, it was a disappointment in Singapore, one of Asia's economic tigers and a place accustomed to nearly double-digit annual economic growth.
Although a number of reporters and editors expressed anger over the prosecutions, none would allow their names to be used, saying they feared retaliation from the Government.
 
'Nip It in the Bud'
 Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has said that if the Government allows the leak to Business Times to go unpunished, it could encourage more damaging leaks in the future.
"We thought, better nip it in the bud, get to the bottom of it if we can," he said. "You can't run a Government which is leaking all over the place. You can't sail a ship on the high seas if it is leaking all over the place."
While the Government has provided Singapore's 2.8 million people with a prosperity equaling that of several Western nations -- Singapore looks like nothing so much as an affluent, leafy California suburb -- it has chosen not to offer them Western-style freedom of speech or information.
What would be considered resourceful investigative reporting in the West is considered here to be a threat to the stability of the Government and the financial markets, and to the relative harmony of the city-state's multiracial society.
The Government has banned or restricted the distribution of several foreign publications for their coverage of Singapore, most recently, The Economist magazine, which was placed under a circulation cap earlier this year. Local news organizations are not known for their aggressive reporting on the Government.
The defendants -- Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the Government economist, and the two securities analysts, Manu Bhaskaran and Raymond Foo Jong Chen of the firm Crosby Securities, and the two editors -- have all pleaded not guilty.
 
Editors Deny Violating Law
 The editors have insisted that they did not know they were violating the Official Secrets Act by publishing the growth estimate.
Mr. Daniel, the editor of Business Times, has said that while he knew that the estimate was official, he did not know that it was a violation of the law to publish the information, since it had come to the paper indirectly, through private sources. Mr. James, the technology editor, has said through his lawyer that he was never told the estimate was an official figure.
At the trial, prosecutors have attempted to prove that Business Times obtained the quarterly economic results from the securities analysts, and that they in turn received the information from the Government economist.

HEADLINE: Once Again, President Finds Time to Visit a Troubled State

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CANOGA PARK, Calif., Dec. 4

 BODY:
If Bill Clinton hadn't paid a sick call on California this month, it would have been an exception.
The workaholic President has found time for only three weekends at Camp David and five visits back home to Arkansas. But the trip this weekend to California, a continent away, is his eighth since taking office. 
 With television cameras whirring, Mr. Clinton spent well over three hours this morning with California's United States Senators, the Mayor of Los Angeles and other leaders discussing the state's enfeebled economy and what might be done to nurse it to health. From the floor of an aerospace factory here, he later offered soothing words to an audience composed largely of workers made vulnerable by cuts in military and space spending.
 
Pledging Prosperity
 The setting was a Rockwell International plant that will receive new Federal grants intended to ease the pain from cuts in Pentagon spending, making it an example of Mr. Clinton's pledge to do everything he can to bring back prosperity in California.
Aides made little mystery of Mr. Clinton's motivation: if California does not recover from its recession, they say, the results could prove debilitating to his re-election chances.
With 54 electoral votes, California holds one-fifth of what is necessary to reach the White House. Mr. Clinton claimed that prize last year in a three-man race, but he did so with only 44 percent of the state's votes. And with rising bitterness over 300,000 jobs lost in the state because of Pentagon cuts, the prospect of recapturing that prize is ever more unlikely.
Mr. Clinton's visit was preceded by some good news for the state: its unemployment rate plunged last month from 9.8 percent to 8.6 percent. But that is still more than two percentage points above the national average, and the President was hardly gloating.
Nonetheless, the President was warmly received by the politicians, scholars and business executives who took part in the discussion here at Rockwell's Rocketdyne plant in the San Fernando Valley, which builds engines for the space shuttles.
But the President also heard pleas from Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, who urged him to give special consideration to California by limiting future Pentagon cuts, rethinking plans to close military bases, and providing at least $100 million in small-business loans that Senator Feinstein said could help create 400,000 jobs.
Today, Mr. Clinton announced that Los Angeles would receive a $46.2 million Federal grant to improve its public housing, and the White House noted that the city would become the largest recipient of such beneficence.
The President responded sympathetically to virtually every proposal, including an appeal to end a prohibition on the sale of communications satellites to China. A Hughes Corporation executive said that step would mean thousands of jobs for his company and the state.
The President suggested that the State Department's opposition to such sales was based on its preference "in all close questions" against relaxing restrictions on sensitive exports and suggested that he was considering a Commerce Department recommendation to make way for such sales.
If the state's economy was one motivation for Mr. Clinton's trip, another had to do with prosperity in a much more direct way. The President was expected to raise more than $2 million for the Democratic Party at two fund-raising events today, much of it from the movie stars and executives who were to be the main guests.
Mr. Clinton has asked Congress to tighten campaign finance laws in a way that would prohibit unlimited donations to political parties, and he has put some distance between himself and Hollywood since last spring, when critics began to suggest that he had become rather star-struck.
But the lure of the entertainment industry wealth and its loyalty to the Democratic Party apparently proved irresistible to Mr. Clinton, who agreed to attend an evening reception at the Creative Artists Agency and then to have dinner at the Beverly Hills house of Marvin Davis, the oil and real estate billionaire. Guests like Steven Spielberg, Barbra Streisand and David Geffen paid anywhere from $25,000 to $100,000 a couple for the privilege of dining with the President.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Clinton Chides Hollywood
 LOS ANGELES, Dec. 4 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Clinton gently admonished Hollywood tonight about the dangers of violence in entertainment and called on the industry to be more conscious of its influence in American society.
Mr. Clinton said repeatedly that he was not asking Hollywood to do away with violence. But he urged actors, filmmakers and executives to do more to provide positive role models for young people.
"There are few things more powerful in any time or place than culture," the President said at the first of two star-studded receptions at which he was to raise $2 million from the entertainment industry for the Democratic Party. "The ability of culture to elevate or debase is really profound."
Mr. Clinton's comments were not as blunt as those made six weeks ago by Attorney General Janet Reno, who warned that the Government would intervene unless the television industry curbed violent programming. But they served notice that the President intended to include the entertainment industry in his call for Americans to take greater responsibility for behavior that may contribute to crime and violence.

HEADLINE: U.S. SEES PROBLEMS IN NUCLEAR OFFER

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
North Korea's new offer to allow greater access to its nuclear sites restricts international inspectors at the two most critical installations, leaving the Clinton Administration divided over how to respond, Administration officials said today.
The Administration has scheduled a Cabinet-level "principals" meeting for Monday to try to fashion a response, officials said. 
 After careful examination of the North Korean offer, American specialists today disclosed details of the plan, saying it contained serious deficiencies.
In particular, they said, the North Koreans have not agreed that international monitors could inspect the two most sensitive installations at Yongbyon: their nuclear reactor and their nuclear reprocessing plant, which can be used to separate plutonium for a nuclear bomb.
 
South Korea Criticizes Plan
 In another sign that the issue is far from solved, South Korea today publicly criticized the plan as inadequate.
"The North Korean reply looks insufficient but is something we need to examine," said Han Sung Joo, South Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs.
As Clinton Administration officials debated the proposal, President Clinton stuck to broad themes about his effort to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program.
"We tried to be very firm but also hold out the hand of possible cooperation," Clinton said in interviews with radio stations in Denver and Albuquerque. "They need to come join the rest of us. They need to reconcile with the South, and I want to help them."
But his Administration now faces a critical decision: whether to reject the proposal as inadequate, make a counterproposal or accept much of it as the best Washington can do in a crisis that has raised fears of a renewed conflict on the Korean peninsula.
The North Korean offer was presented on Friday in a meeting in New York with Tom Hubbard, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State.
 
Proposal Is Outlined
 Administration spokesmen declined to discuss the confidential plan, but officials familiar with it say it would work as follows:
*The International Atomic Energy Agency would have unlimited access to five of seven officially disclosed nuclear installations. But these are relatively minor sites.
*The agency would not be allowed to inspect the nuclear reactor or reprocessing plant, but it would be allowed to replace the film and batteries in cameras there. The agency in the past has rejected that as insufficient.
*North Korea said it was willing to negotiate with the agency over greater access to the reactor and reprocessing sites but did not offer anything specific.
In putting forth their offer, the North Koreans not only set limits on the access of inspectors but also specified a series of diplomatic steps to be taken by the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the atomic energy agency. The details of this formula also concern Administration officials.
 
Two Announcements
 The diplomatic process outlined by North Korea is choreographed precisely.
The arrival of international inspectors at installations is linked with two announcements. The United States and South Korea are to announce jointly the cancellation of the Team Spirit military exercise, which is a rehearsal of American efforts to reinforce the defense of South Korea.
Meanwhile, the United States and North Korea are to set a day jointly for a new round of high-level discussions of broader economic and diplomatic relations, including the possibility of diplomatic recognition of Pyongyang.
After these announcements, North Korea will take steps to exchange envoys with South Korea. But it is not clear when and if that would take place since the countries already have been discussing the issue for months.
Additionally, the North Korean plan says that productive "working level" talks with South Korea can occur only as long as Seoul shows its "sincere" attitude by canceling what North Korea calls nuclear war exercises. This appears to be a reference to several military exercises that are carried out in addition to Team Spirit to maintain the readiness of American and South Korean forces.
 
Stop 'International Pressure'
 Another condition is that Seoul stop "international pressure efforts." The proposal does not say exactly what this means. One interpretation is that it is a demand that other countries drop threats to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if does not abandon its nuclear program.
American experts say that on the positive side, the proposal covers all seven of North Korea's officially disclosed nuclear sites and holds out the possibility that North Korea will negotiate access for inspectors to its most critical ones.
But the drawback is that it is highly unlikely that the atomic energy agency can accept restricted access to North Korea's most critical nuclear sites. The North Korean discussion of the exchange of envoys with South Korea is also extremely vague, American officials said. The United States has insisted that North Korea agree to the exchange of envoys with South Korea as a condition for holding higher-level talks.

HEADLINE: Angola and Rebels Agree to Terms for Cease-Fire

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LUSAKA, Zambia, Dec. 4

 BODY:
The Angolan Government and the rebel Unita movement formally adopted terms today for a cease-fire in fighting that was renewed after the forces of Jonas Savimbi rejected his group's defeat in last year's elections, diplomats here said.
The diplomats said the terms had been adopted at talks attended by all negotiators from the Government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. But no date for the cease-fire was announced. 
 "At a plenary session this morning, the two delegations and Alioune Blondin Beye formally adopted the cease-fire," one diplomat said, referring to the United Nations special envoy. "There is no going back on this now."
Another said: "They agreed all points on the cease-fire and then went on to discuss modalities on formation of a new army. When they reconvene next Monday they will discuss a few military aspects but mostly political issues."
Only one issue, how and when to disarm the Unita guerrillas, had previously stood in the way of a cease-fire to halt the 18-year Angolan conflict, in which Unita forces had recently seized control of about two-thirds of the country. All the other details of the cease-fire had already been agreed upon by Thursday at the talks, which opened in Zambia's capital on Nov. 15.
 
Disarmament Issue Resolved
 The diplomats said the negotiators had resolved the issue of Unita's disarmament by agreeing that rebel forces be allowed to hand over their weapons to an armory controlled by the United Nations shortly after arriving in designated barracks.
Rebel forces would also stay a "very short time" in the barracks to allow for a quick selection of those who would join government troops in forming a new national army, which is to be composed of equal numbers of soldiers from both sides, the diplomats said.
After today's talks, Angolan Government negotiators flew home for high-level consultations centering on political demands by Unita, which are to be debated next week.
"They will seek guidance on various political matters and then be back here by Monday morning in time for a session planned for the afternoon that day," said a person close to the negotiators
Mr. Beye, who has imposed a news blackout on the talks, was also flying to Angola's capital, Luanda, apparently to talk to visiting United States congressmen. "It's obvious Beye will use this occasion to also talk to the Angolan Government," one source said.
A Unita official said that among his movement's political demands were that it be given important posts in such areas as the Ministry of Defense or Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Information and the Ministry of Finance or Economic Planning.
 
Decentralized Power Sought
 Unita also wants the Government to decentralize power, giving elected regional leaders power to control budgets and the formation of national and regional police, the official said. The group also wants a revamping of the state-run news media, guarantees of protection for its leaders and a government house for Mr. Savimbi.
Another demand, the Unita official said, is that President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, who defeated Mr. Savimbi in the presidential election last year but did not achieve a clear majority, would have to be Acting President pending new elections.
The elections in September 1992, which were won by the governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, were described as free and fair by international observers.
 
1991 Peace Agreement
 The elections were made possible by a May 1991 peace agreement between the Government and Unita that ended 16 years of civil war, which began after independence from Portugal in 1975.
"We have given in to many military demands of the government at this peace conference," the official said. "It's now up to the government to make significant concessions and show that it wants and means peace."

HEADLINE: Compromises Edge GATT Nearer New Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Efforts to strike a free trade pact among 116 countries have dragged on for seven years for a simple reason: A deal would hurt many politically powerful industries in many countries.
American steelmakers worry that the Commerce Department would not be able to slap steep taxes on low-priced foreign steel. Insurance companies in Southeast Asia worry that they will go broke if American insurers are allowed into their markets. French grain farmers worry that crop prices will fall there if their Government pays them less to export their harvests than if they sell them in France. 
 Most of the trade conflicts between industries are settled by deals that give both sides some of what they want. But the current talks are so broad and complicated that many recent compromises have satisfied no one.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers in India, for instance, are concerned that they will be bankrupted by the requirements that they pay to use Western patents. American pharmaceutical makers have been pushing the Clinton Administration to reopen the compromise because the requirements will not take full effect for 20 years.
 
A New Momentum
 Yet a compromise on many issues seems probable on Monday between the United States and the European Community. The likelihood of a global deal by Dec. 15 is also growing. The new momentum partly reflects the exasperation of many countries over the length of the talks. It also reflects the willingness of the Clinton Administration to accept a slightly less ambitious deal than the Bush Administration had demanded.
No Republican President since Dwight D. Eisenhower has concluded a global trade agreement. Less encumbered by free-trade ideology, Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter clinched the last two global pacts by excluding difficult agricultural issues and striking modest compromises on other issues.
The Clinton Administration is following the same course. American trade and agricultural officials agreed with European officials on Thursday to pursue less sweeping changes in farm trade policies than previously planned. The United States is also seeking to take taxation issues out of the talks and reduce the number of new limits on countries' trade laws. If all these and the other changes sought by the Clinton Administration are made, the trade pact will still rewrite the rules of international commerce, but not quite as extensively as the Bush Administration had planned.
 
A Broader Pact
 The talks are intended to broaden a 45-year-old pact, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. The GATT sets trade rules for international commerce in manufactured goods like cars and television sets. Seven rounds of GATT negotiations since 1948 have reduced the average tariffs on manufactured goods to 5 percent from 40 percent. Tariffs are taxes on goods bought from other countries.
Seven years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay, most of the world's trading countries began the Uruguay Round of talks. The current draft text for the Uruguay Round would reduce the world's remaining manufacturing tariffs by a third, and eliminate many countries' limits on the number of sweaters, coats and other clothing they import each year.
The draft would also apply GATT rules for the first time to agriculture and services like banking and consulting. Governments would have to eliminate the tonnage limits on food imports and reduce their special payments to farmers, which cost $300 billion a year for industrialized countries. They would also have to remove many bans on foreign service companies and protect foreign copyrights, patents and trademarks.
 
Promoting Global Growth
 Most academic economists said they liked the idea of a 116-country free-trade deal as a way to promote global economic growth. Trade allows each country to specialize in the goods and services that it makes most efficiently, and exchange them for other goods and services made more efficiently elsewhere. The result, in theory, is a more efficient world economy.
No one knows what the Uruguay Round's effects will be on the average consumer or the world economy. Most of the effects would be gradual. The limits on clothing imports, for example, would be phased out over 10 years. The Clinton Administration is trying to extend this to 15 years as part of a deal it made last month to win support in Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Even then, the limits would be replaced by tariffs, which would be gradually reduced.
Yet many economists said they believed the economic effects of a free-trade pact would be large. The GATT secretariat in Geneva estimated on Friday that the elimination of tariffs and tonnage limits on food imports would result in a $230 billion increase in world economic output by 2005.
 
Ambitious Numbers
 A study released in January by the Bush White House had much more ambitious figures. The study estimated that the international adoption of the Uruguay Round draft text would increase the size of the American economy alone by $219 billion by 2000.
The numbers are much larger because the study tried to estimate the indirect effects of a global trade deal. For instance, greater protection abroad of American copyrights on computer programs would mean a larger market for American companies. This would prompt these companies to invest more money and develop more programs, increasing the size of the economy, the Bush Administration officials said.
But many American industries and labor unions are worried that the United States is giving up too much in the trade talks.
The text calls for many restrictions on laws that the United States has used to impose steep tariffs on imports that foreign companies sell here below cost or with financial help from foreign governments. Many economists said they disliked the tariffs because they meant American consumers paid more for these products. More countries are adopting the laws and imposing tariffs on American products.
But many American companies, including those in the steel, automobile and computer-chip industries, want to keep the laws. Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, is seeking changes to the text to preserve these laws.
 
Controversial Farm Payments
 An even bigger dispute appears to have been resolved this week. It involves Government payments intended to increase farm exports. These payments have been especially controversial because they depress prices in foreign markets.
The European Community and the United States agreed a year ago to reduce all farm subsidies. The agreement required the community and the United States to cut the tonnage of their subsidized farm exports immediately to the average level from 1986 to 1991, and then reduce this by another 21 percent over six years. The agreement is known as the Blair House accord, after the White House guest quarters in which it was negotiated.
But France rejected the Blair House accord. French farmers are especially influential because two-thirds of French city-dwellers have a parent or grandparent who grew up in the countryside. American and community officials agreed on Thursday that the tonnage reduction to the average level in the late 1980's could also be spread over six years.
For example, subsidized European wheat exports last year were 3.4 million metric tons higher than the average level. Instead of cutting shipments by 3.4 million tons in 1995, this reduction will be divided into six annual cuts totaling 3.4 million tons.
Trade negotiators are racing to finish a deal now because of a deadline set by Congress early last summer. The House and Senate passed a so-called fast-track law then. The law says that any deal struck by Dec. 15 can be put to an up-or-down vote in each chamber with no amendments allowed.

HEADLINE: For Christopher, New View of Mideast Peace Role

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 4

 BODY:
After nearly a year as Secretary of State, Warren Christopher has begun to see himself as a Middle East peacemaker.
Ask him in public about his expectations for a comprehensive peace in the region, and he is certain to give an intensely guarded answer. His remarks to reporters in Brussels on Thursday about his current eight-day trip were typical: "I would urge that expectations be lowered about what can be accomplished over just a few days' period." 
 But in private, seated with his aides in the back of his limousine, he is apt to rattle off a checklist of things that need to be done, measuring his success in tiny bits of progress he has made. In recent weeks he has even allowed himself to construct a tentative timetable and muse about an endgame for an overall peace settlement, his aides say.
 
'Time and Patience'
 It is not that Mr. Christopher has suddenly transformed himself from the cautious lawyer who once painstakingly negotiated an international cotton textile agreement for the Kennedy Administration into a larger-than-life visionary. Mr. Christopher has often said that he is not a man of grand gestures or dramatic flourishes, and a senior aide said that even his message to his senior Middle East advisers today in a planning meeting was modest and simple. "This is going to take a lot of time and patience," he said.
But with the breakthrough of September's Israeli-P.L.O. accord, Mr. Christopher has moved away from the listening mode he said he was in last February, when he came to the Middle East for the first time as Secretary of State, and has begun to focus on specific areas where the United States can seize opportunities.
Part of his investment of diplomatic capital in the Middle East stems from a belief that Washington "is the only honest broker with clout," as one of his aides said.
On another level, the frustrations of the Clinton Administration policy in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti have prompted Mr. Christopher to redefine and repackage America's foreign policy priorities by training the spotlight on places like the Middle East where Mr. Christopher may have more of a chance for success.
 
Four Goals for Trip
 As part of his strategy for the Middle East, Mr. Christopher has set himself four precise goals for a trip that is taking him to Israel, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, senior Administration officials said.
First, he will try to find specific ways to help carry out the Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
In recent days the Palestinians have declared their negotiations deadlocked and appealed for Washington's "urgent intervention" in resolving the critical remaining issues in their self-rule agreement. Certainly, the fact that Dennis Ross, the Administration's special coordinator on the Middle East, now talks two to three times a week on the telephone with Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, and that Mr. Christopher himself will hold meetings with Mr. Arafat in Tunis and Amman this week highlights the dramatic changes that have transformed the political landscape in less than three months.
But Mr. Christopher is likely to limit his involvement to suggestions about issues like what the Palestinians should do to meet World Bank requirements rather than intrude into thorny internal security issues, like what the boundaries of Jericho should be, that are supposed to be resolved in the next nine days.
 
A Reluctance to Intervene
 "I don't know that there is an appropriate role for me," Mr. Christopher told reporters before leaving for dinner with Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. "If I was asked by both parties to do something, I certainly would. But I certainly don't want to interpose myself in any way."
The second goal Mr. Christopher will pursue will be to help make the Middle East a more friendly neighborhood for Israel by urging the Arabs to support repeal of anti-Israeli resolutions at the United Nations, to reconsider their recent decision to maintain the economic boycott of Israel and to meet with Israeli officials. The main reason Mr. Christopher will visit Morocco, his aides say, is to show appreciation for King Hassan's efforts to reward Israel for its accord with the Palestinians.
Mr. Christopher's third goal is to build on progress in the talks between Jordan and Israel. Last Wednesday Jordan and Israel initialed an agreement in Washington that allows Jordan to reopen banks in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Mr. Christopher will explore ways to move forward on trade, development and water issues.
Despite wide-ranging predictions among officials in Jerusalem about Jordan's willingness to make a separate peace with Israel, the United States has no illusions that King Hussein is on the verge of signing an accord without a comprehensive peace that includes Damascus.
 
Visit to Syrian Capital
 The fourth and most important goal -- and the most difficult -- will come in Damascus, where Mr. Christopher will meet with President Hafez al-Assad on Sunday and again on Thursday.
While the Israeli-P.L.O. accord is a crucial step toward peace, American strategic interests are locked into acheiving an Israeli-Syrian peace, which would help isolate Iran, a Syrian ally.
Mr. Christopher has a double task on his agenda: to convince Mr. Assad that the United States has no intention of abandoning him, or of leaving him alone to scuttle the Palestinian peace with Israel.

HEADLINE: Israel Restoring Drained Wetland, Reversing Pioneers' Feat

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HULATA, Israel, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Rumbling across a desolate landscape of dark brown earth, a fleet of bulldozers has been working to reverse part of what was long considered one of the major feats of Zionist pioneering: the draining of the Hula swamplands in the Galilee region of northern Israel.
Churning up clouds of peat dust, the bulldozers have been scooping out earth for a lake that will be the core of a planned area of 1,500 acres of restored wetlands at the heart of the Hula Valley. 
 The $25 million enterprise, one of the biggest environmental projects ever undertaken in Israel, reflects a basic shift of priorities. Ambitious projects that altered nature to expand agricultural settlement -- the stuff of Zionist lore -- have given way to a new awareness of the environment and a realization that farming alone cannot form the backbone of the Israeli economy.
The drying of the Hula lake and marsh in the 1950's freed some 15,000 acres of land for cultivation. But it also left behind a tangle of ecological problems so serious that planners are now preparing to reflood this area at the center of the drained basin.
 
Now Unfit for Farming
 Dried peat soil from the bottom of the marsh has decomposed, burned and released pollutants that once were filtered by the swamp, leaving a wasteland unfit for farming.
Draining the Hula, north of the Sea of Galilee, was a powerfully symbolic national enterprise, celebrated with patriotic fervor much as the space program was in the United States. It was expected to reclaim expanses of peat soil under the marsh that were considered to be both highly fertile and a source of fuel.
Millions of gallons of swamp water previously lost through evaporation were to be channeled in canals to the Sea of Galilee, the national reservoir. And eliminating the marsh, officials said, would destroy a breeding ground of malaria-carrying mosquitoes.
Between 1951 and 1958, a network of canals was dug to drain the lake and swamp. According to press reports at the time, Agriculture Minister Kadish Luz declared, "Land had been redeemed from hostile nature, and water that had been a menace to health turned into a blessing."
 
Peat Was a Problem
 Although thousands of acres were brought under cultivation by neighboring settlements, problems emerged in large tracts of land with high concentrations of peat soil.
The dry peat disintegrated, sank and burned in underground fires caused by spontaneous combustion. The fertility of the soil declined sharply, and it released nitrate pollutants that were washed by rains into the Sea of Galilee. As farmers stopped cultivating large areas, the land was overrun by mice and weeds, and peat dust whipped up by winds covered the region.
The desolation contrasted sharply with the teeming animal and plant life that had filled the Hula marsh, situated at a meeting point of tropical and temperate climate zones. Several species unique to the swamp became extinct when it was drained, and even though a 750-acre nature reserve was set aside to recreate the lost wetlands, their rich diversity largely vanished.
When the draining project began, destruction of this everglade environment was not deemed too high a price. There was little ecological awareness in the 1950's, and those experts who warned of problems were overruled by the planners.
 
Need for Land and Jobs
 Also, with waves of new immigrants arriving in Israel's early years, the Hula project filled a pressing need for jobs and for agricultural land that could support farming settlements.
"It was clear that agriculture and settlement were top priority, and it was considered obvious that swamps should be drained," said Amotz Zahavi, an Israeli conservationist who had lobbied for preservation of some of the marsh. "No one imagined that you could say no to drying the Hula."
Azaria Alon, another conservationist, recalled: "The draining was deeply troubling to nature advocates, but it was difficult to talk about it, because anyone who spoke out was considered anti-Zionist. This was seen as a tremendous achievement, celebrated in writing and song."
"But it wasn't thought through, and the result was ecological destruction," Mr. Alon said. "I'm against such policies that enthusiastically promote all kinds of big projects that change the face of the land without a comprehensive assessment of their environmental impact."
Officials of the Jewish National Fund, a land reclamation and development agency that first drained the Hula and is now reflooding part of it, insist that the original project was not a failure, arguing that it provided a livelihood for farming settlements.
 
No 'Mistake' or 'Regret'
 "We're not saying that it was a mistake and that we regret it," said Moshe Rivlin, the fund's chairman. "The new project is a response to the problems that emerged."
Shimon Amar, a 63-year-old worker who had helped drain the Hula swamp and is now taking part in the reflooding project, said he saw no contradiction between his labors today and 40 years ago. "Potatoes, melons and cucumbers were grown on this land, but there are also neglected areas that produce nothing, and they should be saved," he said. "Now they'll be turned into something completely different, a tourist attraction. It will be beautiful."
The reflooding plan calls for the creation of a wetland wildlife park that will include a lake and islands surrounded by marshes and boating canals for visitors. The water used to reflood the area is expected to raise the depleted water table under adjacent farmland, helping improve yields in about 5,000 acres of peat soil.
The 1.3 billion gallons of water needed for the project will be drawn from the Jordan River, which used to flow through the Hula marsh but was diverted when the swamp was drained. The river's meandering course will be restored as part of the reflooding plan.
The project is scheduled to take three to five years, and is being managed jointly by the National Fund, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Israel Lands Administration. If it succeeds, planners say, another area of similar size may be flooded.
Giora Shaham, the project director, said a balance must be struck among the competing interests of environmentalists, farmers and tourism promoters from neighboring settlements who want to make money for their hard-pressed communities.
 
What Kind of Animals?
 The tourism developers want activities that draw visitors, like boating, hiking and jeep tours. They would build guest accommodations and stock the area with a wide variety of animals, including some not native to the Hula region.
Environmentalists say the area should be managed as a wildlife refuge where only animals that once lived in the wetlands, like water buffalo deer and wild boar, will be reintroduced to restore the original marsh habitat. Visitors would be limited. As for farmers, they want to reduce the areas to be flooded, and to devote more resources to improving agricultural yields.
The lessons learned from the Hula draining, Mr. Shaham said, were part of a process of trial and error that would continue as the reflooding project is monitored in the coming years.
"This is a corrective plan which will have to be tested as it is carried out," Mr. Shaham said. "More corrections may be needed in the future. We are not perfect. We are not God."

HEADLINE: Gunman Robs Riders in Van, Killing Driver

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

 BODY:
A man driving an illegal livery van on a Brooklyn street was shot to death on Friday night in front of four other passengers in what the police said was the first shooting involving the unlicensed vans, which have proliferated on city streets in recent years.
The shooting of the driver, Frank James, 45, comes as the police struggle to stop a seemingly unending series of killings of cabdrivers. But unlike the 41 cabby killings this year, the shooting Friday night happened in front of several passengers who were also held up by the gunman. 
 A police spokesman, Sgt. Anthony Barlanti, said the gunman got into Mr. James's Ford Econoline van at Avenue P off Flatbush Avenue, pulled a gun and told the passengers to put their heads down. As the van drove south on Flatbush Avenue, the gunman ordered the driver to turn off the main road to East 26th Street, where he robbed the passengers. He hit one with the butt of the gun and then shot the driver in the head, Sergeant Barlanti said.
The sergeant said there was no apparent motive for the shooting and no indication that the driver had put up a struggle. Two passengers fled on foot as the others ran to a nearby home and called the police. The gunman was still at large.
 
Immigrant's Part-Time Job
 Mr. James's vehicle was one of the hundreds of illegal vans that offer commuters low-cost rides, often from subway stops to residential areas.
Like many of the slain cabbies, Mr. James was an immigrant, having come from Guyana 14 years ago. He worked as a pest-control worker at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, and drove the van part time to earn extra money, Sergeant Barlanti said.
A father of two children, Mr. James had recently moved with his family from Flatbush to the second floor of a two-story brick building along a residential street in Cypress Hills.
"They were just a normal family with two kids and now they don't have a father," said Lystra Gaddy, 35, a next-door neighbor of the family. "It's very sad."
Michelle Casimir, a neighbor, said she was watching television when Mr. James's wife, Kathleen, 26, came running down to her apartment after hearing that her husband had been shot. "She was crying and sobbing," Ms. Casimir said.
At the house where the robbery victims fled after the shooting, a resident said that the passengers came to her door knocking and screaming for her to call the police.
"At first I thought it was a prank," she said. "As soon as I saw the blood I told my husband to go open the door."
Although the police said Mr. James was apparently the first unlicensed van driver to be killed, it was not the first time passengers have been held up. One morning last July, three young men, two of them armed with guns, held up a city bus, terrorizing and robbing 22 passengers. Although the bandits fired some shots into the roof of the bus, there were no serious injuries and the thieves escaped with $300 in cash and jewelry.
 
A Popular Service
 The illegal vans first appeared in the Bronx in the early 1970's and quickly spread to Brooklyn and Queens, providing something the official transit system largely did not: fast service into Manhattan or between outlying areas and subway stops.
The vans, many with frosted glass and comfortable seats, have become so popular along some city bus routes that the Transit Authority estimates that it loses about $30 million a year, or 7 percent of revenues because of the vans.
The loss of riders has caused the Transit Authority to drastically reduce service along six heavily affected routes in Brooklyn and Queens. And the service cuts, in turn, have prompted still more people to turn to the vans.
Despite the popularity of the unlicensed vans, Friday's incident underscores the risk that passengers face when they ride the unregulated vehicles.
Haji Shasique, a shopkeeper at K & A Grocery on Flatbush Avenue, near where the shooting occurred, said that about three months ago, a woman was robbed nearby at gunpoint by a group of teenagers on one of the vans. Mr. Shasique said the youths jumped off the van as it pulled to a corner.
"Nobody is safe on the bus or in the van," he said. "But at least the bus has insurance and the van has no insurance."
 
'Anything Can Happen'
 Josephine Saunders, a resident of Crown Heights, said she does not ride the unlicensed vans.
"You don't know the driver and anything can happen," Ms. Saunders said. "Even if you take the bus and get robbed on the bus it's better."
Yesterday, at the corner of Flatbush and Foster Avenues, more than a dozen vans full of passengers drove by in less than 10 minutes.
" I know it's very dangerous, but the bus has many problems," Sandra Desir, a native of Haiti, said as she got off a van. "The van is faster."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Giuliani Suggests Style Will Be Close to the Vest

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
When Rudolph W. Giuliani assumes office next month, he will be an anomaly, the first New York mayor in modern politics who has not held a previous elective post. And so whatever his governing style will be, it will have to be worked out in the crucible of one of the nation's most visible, high-pressure offices.
The first few weeks of Mr. Giuliani's transition offered few clues about how he will govern, beyond his awareness that he had to begin healing the city after a racially polarized vote. 
 But in the last week, as he made his first two high-level appointments, he began showing a few signs that as mayor he may govern with the deliberative close-to-the-vest approach of the prosecutor he once was, and less of the instinctive politician's flair for using the bully pulpit.
One telling moment came Thursday. Mr. Giuliani stood side by side at a news conference with his newly named Police Commissioner, vowing to take back the streets, when the specter of the city's financial problems made an unwelcome intrusion into the occasion.
 
Politically Unpalatable Menu
 The Mayor-elect was asked what he thought of a long-awaited report that echoed at least one theme of his campaign: that the city faced long-term fiscal problems more severe than Mr. Dinkins's advisers had advertised. It outlined a "menu" of politically unpalatable solutions including millions of dollars in taxes, fees, layoffs and efficiencies.
But in the same disdainful tone with which he criticized the Dinkins administration during the campaign, Mr. Giuliani dismissed the report as "old thinking" reminiscent of "the prior administration." Then he turned his attention back to his virtuoso campaign issue: crime.
The moment could have been an example of the political maxim that a leader sends one message at a time. But when Mr. Giuliani condemned the report again on Friday, saying "it has no application of a philosophy of stimulating the economy of New York City," even some of the people close to his transition effort viewed his response as a missed political opportunity to begin preparing New Yorkers for the difficult choices ahead.
 
No Debate Until Ready
 But privately, Mr. Giuliani's advisers said he dismissed the report because he had no intention of engaging in the budget debate before he was ready. One of them said Mr. Giuliani and his senior staff members were concerned that if he embraced some of the report's suggestions of layoffs and more efficient government, he would have to answer why he was rejecting its companion recommendations for fee increases, tolls and property and sales tax increases. And others said he was loath to speak until he had found a budget director and had a budget plan.
"Wait until we get our people, our personnel in place," said Richard Bryers, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani. "Then you'll see a different approach laid out."
Each mayor or governor brings a new style to office. Some figures, like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, muse aloud about their decision-making. Some, like former Mayor Edward I. Koch, shoot off ideas, opinions, insults and mischief like Fourth of July sparklers. At two news conferences last week, Mr. Giuliani made clear that so far at least, he plays close to the vest.
 
Corruption? 'Against It'
 He repeatedly used humor to sidestep questions about the governing initiatives ahead. When his choice for police commissioner, William J. Bratton, was asked how he would combat the lingering problem of police corruption that has dogged the force, Mr. Giuliani interrupted and quipped, "he's against it," deflecting the question.
When Mr. Giuliani named Ninfa Segarra, a Board of Education member, as a deputy mayor, he made several jokes again before finally answering the question about which salary she would take while holding down two posts. She would, he eventually made clear, take the $112,000 deputy mayor's salary and drop the $15,000 Board of Education stipend. And even as he said he would "substantially" reduce the number of deputy mayors -- currently six -- he gave no further hints of which posts would be eliminated.
His style is reinforced by those around him. Despite the creation of a highly visible transition council, Mr. Giuliani's true inner circle is shaping up to be largely lawyers and former assistant Federal attorneys, who can act as if they are empaneling a grand jury, not a municipal government.
While Mr. Giuliani has not yet formally named any deputy mayors or personal advisers beyond Ms. Segarra, it is becoming clear who will be around him. When Mr. Giuliani had the final meeting with Mr. Bratton before offering him the job, the small group in the session with him were Peter J. Powers, a tax lawyer who is the transition chairman; three former assistant United States attorneys, Howard Wilson, Randy M. Mastro and Dennison Young Jr., and Richard Schwartz, a former Parks Department official under Mr. Koch and then Mr. Dinkins.
 
Checking Out the Furniture
 Minus Mr. Wilson, who was chairman of the search committee for police chief, much the same group of advisers was recently in City Hall looking over the offices, space and floor plans, said aides to Mr. Dinkins. This time the group also included Fran Reiter, the chairwoman of the State Liberal Party, and Richard M. Berman, a lawyer who once worked for Senator Jacob K. Javits.
Still, the secrecy surrounding the transition is such that while publicizing the existence of an ethics code, Mr. Giuliani's aides have declined to identify the people serving in what are potentially the most sensitive transition positions, reviewing the inner workings of city agencies for the Mayor-elect. Cristyne Lategano, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, said that the volunteers would have to be alerted that their names would be released because some had not expected their names to be made public.
How quickly Mr. Giuliani will be in a better position to start detailing his plans -- particularly in the area of fiscal policy -- is not certain. Despite his early heady prediction that he would have a police commissioner, budget director, and finance chief by Thanksgiving, some of his advisers admit privately that it has been harder than expected to lure high-caliber executives from private business. Several of their first choices to be interviewed have turned them down.
But with his earliest selection of Mr. Bratton and Ms. Segarra, Mr. Giuliani signaled a few things about his administration: that he is not afraid of strong personalities or controversy, that he is taking pains to avoid taking his constituencies for granted, and that he repays political loyalty.

Son of Joe Hill: Quiet, Patient, Alive as Ever

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
THERE was a distant time when this was more of a union city and the working class had a legion of labor organizers, many of whom knew the lyrics to "Joe Hill," the leftist ballad of the ghostly union idealist who finally did expire, it seems, sometime after the 1960's. Nowadays the city seems to have a greater number of illiberal polemicists on union-dead newspapers than it does labor organizers. Which only makes more encouraging the arrival of Francisco Chang upon Gotham's fabric heart in the mid-Manhattan garment district.
He is a 28-year-old, Korean-born, Spanish-speaking sweatshop organizer in behalf of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and its new experimental strategy of shop-by-shop confidence building instead of confrontational, hit-the-bricks tactics of the past generations of Eastern European sweatshop workers. This means Mr. Chang, speaking in Korean to the newer owners and Spanish to the newer workers, tends to respond in quiet ombudsman fashion to the specific shop complaints about lost wages, denied overtime pay and missing fringe benefits that have long been the bane of each immigrant wave of sweatshop workers as they tend toward meekness in their new land. 
 Mr. Chang's job may sound like a desperate tactic in a desperate industry, half of whose 50,000 city workers are in nonunion sweatshops, according to the I.L.G.W.U. But on Dec. 18, Mr. Chang expects to celebrate with 350 loyalist workers the six-month anniversary of the union's new Garment Workers' Justice Center. The workers will not only attend, but also run the show and script a new union strategy for slowly enlisting workers shop by shop and complaint by complaint in 60 targeted factory buildings between Seventh and Ninth Avenues and 35th and 40th Streets.
This tight bull's-eye contains most of the 3,000 small, ever marginal, ever portable sweatshops of Francisco Chang's target group. This is the perpetual vineyard in the endless task of the I.L.G.W.U., which is grateful, even so, for the industry that remains in such a job-depressed city as this. "It's 1910 all over again," says Marty Berger, a career organizer for 35 years in the garment district, speaking with a certain envy of his young colleague's patience and optimism.
Mr. Chang discovered his knack for unionism when he held a tough job in a hat factory as a teen-age immigrant. He never heard of "The Pajama Game," the musical about organizing, but he looks as if he could sing the lead role with grand ebullience. "Look, 40 workers showed up last March after I distributed 10,000 pamphlets in the district, so I can say there is progress now with 350 coming for the celebration," he says. "Unions can't come on with a preset agenda and a lot of staff organizers these days," he says, speaking as the only staff member in the center, one who relies on 15 sweatshop workers for their after-hours union work.
"The key eventually is that we don't go to the workers, the workers come to us" as word of initial small successes in back-pay problems at a given shop is spread through word of mouth, explains Mr. Chang, who enlists aid from government labor law agencies at critical moments. When contacts and confidence grow from a track record at most of the shops, his committee will signal that, finally, it is time for him formally to organize a swath of shops.
Thus, his organizing art is not so simple as the lyrics of "Joe Hill." Some immigrant workers mistrust unionism because of experiences back home. Then, too, the industry is turning more to immigrant sweatshops in Miami and elsewhere, putting jobs here at greater risk.
Part of Francisco Chang's art is explaining the tricorner economics of the industry to its own workers, not immediately risking their livelihood on union cards. He teaches where the money goes as the big retailers put in orders with the 500 jobbers, or manufacturers, who then farm out the work to the 3,000 contractors whose workers he is trying to groom. When this is grasped by workers in a shop with a problem over minimum wages or overtime, they sense injustice and want to do something about it, he says, and increasingly turn to his center's worker volunteers and himself. Several successful job shutdowns, sit-ins, and even takeovers of freight elevators and sewing machines have occurred, he notes, some lasting weeks, and virtually all unnoticed in a city where private-sector unionism seems so moribund.
But there have always been I.L.G.W.U. successes, Mr. Chang says in his optimism, citing the union's organizing of sweatshops in Chinatown. This, of course, was followed by fresh sweatshops opening in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, site of a newer Chinatown. There, the I.L.G.W.U. has patiently opened a second justice center like Mr. Chang's. And a third is in Williamsburg, among Hispanic workers.
"This is just the beginning," says Francisco Chang, rather lyrically.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Ban on Wall Street Gifts Hurts McCall Campaign

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The October decision by Wall Street's leading bond underwriters to ban political contributions was widely hailed as a significant move toward cleaner government. But the timing could not have been worse for the new State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, who is trying to bankroll what will clearly be an expensive campaign in 1994.
Mr. McCall, who wants to become the first black person to win statewide elective office in New York, estimates that the decision will cost him $2 million in campaign contributions. He based that on the amount that his predecessor, Edward V. Regan, typically received from the bond houses. 
 Mr. Regan resigned earlier this year in the middle of his term, and the State Legislature elected Mr. McCall, a New York City Democrat, to succeed him.
"Those are the people who normally provided the majority of the money for this office because they're the ones that have an interest," Mr. McCall said of the underwriters. "That's the money that's drying up."
The Wall Street firms typically gave tens of thousands of dollars to incumbents and other leading candidates for state and city comptroller because those officials are responsible for awarding the state's and city's highly lucrative bond business.
Mr. McCall said he will need a minimum of $3 million to run next year. The ban on contributions from underwriters has forced him to search elsewhere, and he has done most of his prospecting out of the state.
He has held fund-raisers in recent weeks in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington and Boston, and has scheduled other events for Atlanta and Chicago. His first New York event will be this week at the Grand Hyatt in Manhattan.
Mr. McCall said he does not think the ban on contributions will significantly diminish the influence of money on politics.
"All these efforts will really miss the mark," he said. "What you need is public funding. The abuses were serious and something had to be done. But what was done doesn't make any sense because it doesn't solve the problem. We've still got to go out and raise large sums of money, and however we do it there will be questions."
 
Father Defers to Daughter
 Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island was undoubtedly being chivalrous last week when he said he would set aside his own decision whether to run for governor next year until his daughter, Representative Susan Molinari, decides whether she wants the job. It is even likelier that he was being smart.
As a young Republican woman, and an Italian-American Roman Catholic who supports the death penalty and abortion rights, Ms. Molinari could be a formidable contender, as she is telegenic and well-spoken, and, in a simpler age, might have been called "peppy." She would be the kind of statewide candidate who could strike fear -- or at least fright -- into the hearts of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Democrats.
Ms. Molinari, who was elected to her father's old seat in Congress after he gave it up to be Borough President in 1989, said she would spend the next few weeks exploring a possible candidacy by talking with Republican and Conservative Party leaders, friends and family. Among the considerations, she said, was whether she could win party support, raise enough money and be willing to give up her Congressional seat to run.
Ms. Molinari, who has become a bigger presence on the political talk show circuit and in Washington than most junior House members -- in part because she is a Republican, and a woman, and a supporter of abortion rights -- said she thought Mr. Cuomo would be politically vulnerable next year, because of New York's lackluster economy and fear of crime, among other things.
"It has been over 20 years of Democratic control of the Statehouse," Ms. Molinari said. "Has anybody's lives gotten better? Has there been any more fairness and safety for anybody in New York State?"
Mr. Molinari predicted, "You're going to see a tremendous amount of support coming her way."
 
Council Race Finally Decided
 One month after Election Day, the outcome of a City Council race on Manhattan's Upper East Side was finally decided last week. Andrew S. Eristoff, the Republican incumbent, was declared the winner over his Democratic challenger, Jane R. Crotty, by a margin of 135 votes out of 47,000 cast.
The candidates had also squared off last spring in a special election won by Mr. Eristoff by 57 votes. They were fighting to fill a Council seat vacated by Carolyn B. Maloney, who was elected to the United States House of Representatives in November 1992.
In both contests, Mrs. Crotty was slightly ahead when the results on voting machines were counted, but Mr. Eristoff prevailed after prolonged, labored counts of absentee ballots -- which his campaign made a big point of sending to the doorman apartment buildings of the district, where house-to-house canvassing of voters is impossible and telephoning sometimes reaches only domestic servants.
The special election in February was among the most expensive Council races in the city's history, with Mr. Eristoff, an heir to a White Russian emigre fortune, lending his campaign $110,000 of his own money, and he is estimated to have spent much more this time.
Mr. Eristoff said he had to spend a lot of money on the campaign, primarily because, in his view, Mrs. Crotty had several inherent advantages: the district has more than twice as many registered Democrats as registered Republicans, and she was supported strongly by many labor unions and by the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a Queens Democrat.
 
No Senate Race for Roukema
 Representative Marge Roukema has become the most recent big-name New Jersey Republican to decide against testing the incumbency and the wealth of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat, next year.
Mrs. Roukema announced last week that after several months of serious consideration, she will not run for the Senate in 1994 because she prefers her current job in the House of Representatives, where she has spent the last 13 years. She said she will spend next year concentrating on health care reform and the proposed sweeping changes in the welfare system.
Mrs. Roukema is the second Republican within a month to shy away from the Senate race. Representative Dick Zimmer announced on Nov. 8 that he could not raise enough money for what is expected to be a tough primary and an even tougher general election campaign against Mr. Lautenberg, who in previous races has spent millions of dollars of his own money to win.
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean announced about two months ago that he would not be a candidate, despite the urgings of state and national Republican leaders.
Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian has emerged as the front-runner for the G.O.P. nomination. He has already established a fund-raising committee, started pulling together a campaign staff and met with national party leaders like Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader.
Mr. Haytaian said last week that he needed to raise at least $1 million to be a viable candidate for the nomination and that it would take at least $10 million to run against Mr. Lautenberg.

HEADLINE: Even the Most Dedicated Need More Help to Help the Neediest;
In 'Double Recovery' and Sharing His Story

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
By his own reckoning, Raymond Lopez should not be alive today, looking trim at the age of 52 and sporting a persistent smile beneath the tweed cap that rarely leaves his head.
From the time he was a teen-ager growing up in the South Bronx, Mr. Lopez had already begun a slide into alcoholism. Most of his days were consumed with playing cards or betting on the horses or organizing neighborhood gangs. When he did not have a gun, his weapons of choice were an ice pick or a hatchet, which he concealed beneath his coat. 
 He also suffered from bouts of manic depression, during which he would burn off boundless energy by walking the highways for days with no sleep. He did not know he was mentally ill until he was well into his 30's, he said, because he always was too stubborn to seek help.
 
Like 'Death Wish'
 "I wanted to be a wise guy all the time, not listening to anybody," Mr. Lopez said recently. "I thought I was Charles Bronson there for a while, walking around like I was in 'Death Wish.' I thank God I'm alive."
Now the tales that he once spun for fellow jail inmates and for patients at the mental hospital where he spent six years are used to encourage others who, like Mr. Lopez, suffer both from mental illness and drug or alcohol abuse.
Mr. Lopez is one of 50 such people enrolled in Project Moving On, a program in downtown Brooklyn that helps them learn to live on their own and develop vocational skills. The program is operated by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Since the program began eight years ago, Project Moving On has guided hundreds of people through the slow, often fragile process called "double recovery" and has helped them get jobs and apartments. For many, it is their first time living on their own after decades of institutionalization or subsisting on the streets.
 
Donations Are Crucial
 The Neediest Cases Fund, now conducting its 82d appeal, raised $4.5 million last year for programs like those of the Brooklyn Bureau, to aid New York City's poor, disabled and unfortunate. The Times covers all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar can be used for direct services.
At Project Moving On, which has an annual budget of $600,000, the contributions help fill a $140,000 gap not covered by government money. Because increases in the program's public funds have not kept up with inflation, money from private donations such as those given to the Neediest Cases Fund are crucial, said James Hood, the Brooklyn Bureau's assistant executive director.
For Mr. Lopez, the money not only helps finance his recovery but also pays for his transportation when he takes the stage to address hundreds of people in other programs for MICA's, mentally ill chemical abusers.
 
Hilarious and Heartbreaking
 Debra Rubowitz, a program supervisor and Mr. Lopez's primary counselor, said the sometime hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking story of his life never fails to keep listeners rapt. "They're very taken with Raymond, because when he goes through where he's been and how far he's come, they have some hope," Ms. Rubowitz said. "He's come a long way."
For seven years, Mr. Lopez worked as a diesel mechanic at a Postal Service garage in Manhattan. Although he was often drunk, he said, he was usually able to function. But his drinking finally got the better of him and he was dismissed, starting a decadelong downward spiral.
For a time he lived in a hotel for transients, then agreed to join a group of drug abusers and other alcoholics traveling to Virginia to work on a farm. Instead, they were taken to North Carolina and the little money they earned picking tomatoes was held back for room and board, Mr. Lopez said. Eventually he ran away from the farm, owing $67 to his employers.
 
Life Turned Around
 He hitchhiked around the Northeast, finally landing in Washington, where he lived for several months in a shelter for the homeless. But he was soon arrested for breaking windows with an iron pipe and was committed to a mental hospital, St. Elizabeths. There, Mr. Lopez said, his life was finally turned around.
"St. Elizabeths was a horrible place," he said. "And I promised myself that if I ever got out of there, I'd never do anything to get back in."
All signs seem to indicate that his days in hospitals are over, Ms. Rubowitz said. Mr. Lopez now lives in an apartment with a roommate who has gone through many of the same problems. He sees a psychiatrist regularly and takes lithium to control his manic depression. He spends most of his time at the Brooklyn Bureau, where he helps members of Project Moving On learn to work with tools. By early next year, he said, he plans to look for part-time work.
"My main goal right now is to keep feeling the way I feel about myself," Mr. Lopez said. "Sometimes, that's all the work I can handle."

HEADLINE: Even the Most Dedicated Need More Help to Help the Neediest;
An Opportunity to Start Over in a New Land

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
It is almost two years since Yakov Borisevich Alesker declared himself a political refugee at the United States Embassy in Moscow and immigrated to New York with his wife and daughters. At the age of 54, when he could have been basking in the accumulated glory of a long career at a prestigious Soviet engineering institute, he now finds himself near the bottom of the ladder at a Brooklyn vinyl-manufacturing plant.
As an expert in polymers, Mr. Alesker received 40 patents in construction techniques and published dozens of books and scientific papers in the former Soviet Union. He won praise from the Communist Party, and even a shiny red automobile in recognition of his accomplishments. But as a Jew, he said, his life was haunted by a growing anti-Semitism that finally became unbearable. 
 The family gave up a seven-room apartment in a tony part of Moscow for four small rooms in a building of faded gentility in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. These days, Mr. Alesker rides the subway to work, where he taps out computer formulas to tint sheets of vinyl that will become shower curtains and upholstery. Late in life, he is starting over.
 
Accounting and Computer Training
 Mr. Alesker's transition has been helped by the U.J.A.-Federation of New York, one of seven charities that provide a variety of social services through donations to the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Through the U.J.A.-Federation's Employment and Guidance Service, which trains needy people regardless of race, religion or ethnic origin, Mr. Alesker received training in accounting and computer skills that he is using on the job today.
"I knew he was frightened because of his age," said Joan Berger, a senior case manager with the employment service . "But his attitude, his eagerness, his efforts in getting himself a job were just unbelievable." Mr. Alesker threw himself into his classes and sent out 200 resumes, finding a job in the plastics industry just a week before he graduated from the courses.
It has been nine months since he was hired by Nuhart Inc. in Green Point. "He's a highly intelligent man," said Sol Graf, the company's general manager, who emigrated from Hungary in 1966 and has hired many Soviet Jews over the years. "He's working out just fine. He is among the best we've ever had, education-wise."
Mr. Alesker, a diminutive man with a regal bearing, tells of his exodus in true Russian fashion, full of historical sweep and personal drama, interspersed with gentle jokes and folksy aphorisms. "You can feed a wolf much, but he will still look in the forest," he said, explaining his search for a job in his field even though he was offered other work.
 
At Risk Because of Religion
 Mr. Alesker was born and raised in Moscow, one of three children of an engineer. The family lived comfortably by Russian standards, but when it came to their religion, they were always at risk. "Every day of my life in Russia, I had to remember that I am a Jew," Mr. Alesker said. "When I had to choose an institute for my education, I couldn't choose the one I wanted because they didn't want Jews. I had a gold medal for getting the highest score in all my subjects, and still they rejected me."
Learning about Judaism was next to impossible, he added. "I didn't learn Yiddish or Hebrew," he said. "I didn't attend synagogue, only on Yom Kippur. We went to the Moscow synagogue, but it was dangerous even to go. Special agents from the K.G.B. would take pictures and give them to the university officials, who could expel you." As a child, Mr. Alesker said, if he read books on Judaism, it was always "under the pillow."
Once he became an engineer, Mr. Alesker said, anti-Semitism continued to haunt him. At one point during the early 1980's, a delegation from his institute was assembled to visit West Germany and instruct the Germans on an infrared heating device that Mr. Alesker had patented. At the last minute, Communist Party officials intervened and told his supervisor that there were "too many Jews" in the delegation, Mr. Alesker said. He was left behind.
 
A Monument Toppled
 But the last straw came even as many restrictions on Soviet life were easing. In 1991, thugs in Belarus toppled a monument marking the grave of Mr. Alesker's father, a veteran of World War II, and spray-painted it with swastikas. "My father was not only a kind man, he was a man who was for me, maybe the second God in my life," he said. "He was awarded many honors in the military. He worked very hard for Russia, and it was very tragic for me to find pieces of his monument on the ground with these fascist symbols painted on them."
An official investigation produced no suspects, Mr. Alesker said, which further disheartened him. "I couldn't live in my country anymore," he said. "It was not only one episode. There is anti-Semitism that grows deeper and deeper in Russian life. With perestroika and new troubles, many politicians try to explain that it is Jewish people who are at fault. By culture, I am Russian, but when you see this anti-Semitism every day, it is terrible."
He and his wife, Raisa, an economist, and their daughters, Julia, now 31, and Victoria, now 14, decided to leave.
Victoria is now a freshman at Brooklyn Tech, one of the city's selective public high schools. A promising violinist, she has won a scholarship to continue studying and performs with a community-college orchestra that otherwise consists of adults. Raisa has completed a computer training course and is looking for a job.
At the same time, the family is trying to pick up the threads of its religious life, observing all the Jewish holidays now. Last spring, the Aleskers were invited to celebrate Passover at the home of an Orthodox family in New Jersey, where they shared meals and the Haggadah and reveled in the freedom to do so.
Yet Mr. Alesker still seems to be looking over his shoulder, back at his former colleagues and at the change-shaken country that is an indelible part of who he is. "Let me just say that I am a Muscovite," he said. "My whole life I lived in this city. Now I live in New York, but to tell the truth, my heart is in Russia."

HEADLINE: The Public Interest vs. Solo Motorists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The article by Barbara Presley Noble on proving commuting options for workers ("Getting Them There Is Half the Job," At Work, Nov. 21) did not address the social, economic and environmental impact of not dealing with pollution and congestion caused by excessive use of automobiles. 
 Irresponsible commuters force the rest of us to breathe filthy air, leading to illnesses and an overall reduction in the quality of life. The trip-reduction rules of the Clean Air Act of 1990 are intended to address the larger social costs of solo driving for the benefit of an entire region -- not just the individual motorist.
By law, the New York area and nine other regions are required to find ways to reduce automobile use and change the daily commuting patterns of workers. To help employers, the New York City Transportation, Environmental Protection and Economic Policy and Marketing departments have held briefings on the new Federal mandates. These sessions have reached about 200 corporations, and more than a quarter of the affected employers have received information about the program. In addition, the city Transportation Department has already organized two demonstration projects, helping 80 businesses prepare for the November 1994 start-up date.
As the article says, "changing the mindset of employees" will be difficult. New York City is providing its business community with advance notification and assistance and working to insure that the program will be as palatable as possible. What is at stake is not individual rights, but the collective rights associated with the air all of us must breathe and the roads we all share.

HEADLINE: The Trade Deadline Approaches

 BODY:
Top negotiators say they have made important progress toward agreement on new international trade rules. Yet the world's 116 trade partners remain divided on critical details with only 10 days left to strike a deal.
Over the last 50 years, trade has been the foremost engine of growth: In seven previous rounds of negotiations, tariffs have been brought down from an average of 40 percent to under 5 percent. That, in turn, has allowed trade to grow at a 5 percent clip -- fast enough to add trillions of dollars to the world economy. 
 By Dec. 15 -- a deadline set by Congress -- negotiators must settle their differences. They appear close on big issues, but apart on scores of knotty disputes. Everybody will have to blink if small squabbles aren't to sabotage world growth.
The current trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, envision a grand bargain. Industrialized countries would agree to import more food and clothing from the less-developed countries. They, in return, would open their markets to exports of services, like telecommunications, and intellectual property, like movies.
For the first time, international rules would govern trade in agriculture, services, intellectual property and foreign investment. The likely impact would be substantial. In the U.S. alone, open borders could cut consumer prices by a few percentage points according to government estimates -- a handsome tax cut that would primarily benefit low-income families. Overall, a trade accord could add hundreds of billions to the world economy.
The draft text and tentative agreements from which officials will work this week offer significant gains. Manufacturing tariffs would be cut by about one third. Textile tariffs and quotas would be phased out. Foreign investors would be guaranteed the same treatment as domestic companies. And every country would honor patents and copyrights. The principle of imposing identical tariffs and conditions on imports from every trading partner -- an important protection for weak countries -- would be extended beyond manufacturing.
So who's holding up the deal? For starters, the European Union and the U.S. -- ironic because they would be the big winners from an accord. The U.S. would win from both sides of the grand bargain because, almost uniquely, it exports food, services and intellectual property.
But what's good for a country isn't good for each industry. In France, a tiny number of farmers are fighting cutbacks in agriculture subsidies; France also wants to shut out U.S. movies and television programs. The U.S. is fighting to protect its textile manufacturers and shipbuilders. And as long as the developed countries hold back, the third world won't agree to new intellectual property rights. The entire Uruguay Round could unravel.
These aggravating disputes can probably be solved. But a fracas created by the U.S. over anti-dumping laws is more difficult. Countries are currently permitted to retaliate against imports that are sold at prices below their cost of manufacture -- a practice known as dumping. But the rules are so loose that many countries -- including the U.S. -- manipulate them to find dumping where none occurs. The draft text would stymie such use of anti-dumping laws for protectionist purpose.
But, giving in to domestic manufacturers, the Clinton Administration wants to change the draft in ways that would give governments leeway to misapply anti-dumping statutes. The U.S. might come out ahead in the jungle warfare that would ensue. But that would tarnish the principled position the U.S. has backed for 50 years -- that trade should be dictated by rules fair to all, to benefit the world economy and consumers everywhere.

HEADLINE: In America;
A Philadelphia Story

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Phyllis Lawrence knew something was up when the kids started clamoring for Time magazine.
These were high school youngsters in Philadelphia who had been used to hanging on street corners and being cool, gossiping night and day about who was having whose baby and the latest casualties of neighborhood combat. They were not much interested in school, were even less interested in reading, and generally ignored the proposition that there was a future for which they should be prepared. 
 Four years ago, in an experimental program financed by the Ford Foundation, an effort was made to reach these kids. Twenty-five were selected. They were 14 years old and in the ninth grade. They were not the cream of America's high school crop. They were poor kids, primarily from single-parent families that were on welfare. All were black.
The idea was to have a local organization, in this case the cumbersomely titled Opportunities Industrialization Center, step into the lives of the youngsters and stay with them for the four years of high school. If the plan worked, some lives would be salvaged and society would avoid the heavy expenditures associated with adult job training, welfare or prison.
The effort was dubbed the Quantum Opportunities Program and it was quite an adventure.
The kids were paid about a dollar for every hour they participated. For each dollar they earned during the four years, a matching dollar was placed in a special account to help finance college or some other form of post-high school training.
Nonsense was not tolerated. Phyllis Lawrence and her co-coordinator, Reuben Mills, started with the basics. The youngsters would be well groomed. The message to the boys, said Ms. Lawrence, was: "No pants hanging off your heinie. Let's put on a pair of pants with a belt, and let's wear a tie."
"Young ladies were expected to wear stockings," she said, and no one wore sneakers.
The youngsters received counseling at the center and intensive remedial work in English, math, social studies and the sciences. They received training in citizenship skills. They were required to perform community services, such as working with the homeless.
There was a cultural component. The youngsters were taken to plays and to the opera. There were outings in which they wore tuxedos and gowns. They were taught the proper way to behave in restaurants and were not spared the perennial, "Keep your elbows off the table."
Throughout the program the youngsters were encouraged to read and then to discuss what they had read. That got off to a slow start. Magazine subscriptions were ordered, including subscriptions to Time. The coordinators kept pushing. Read, read.
On one occasion, well into the program, the Time magazines were late. To Ms. Lawrence's surprise, several youngsters came to her, "And they wanted to know, 'Well, where's our Time magazines?' "
Ms. Lawrence said she tried to conceal how happy she felt. "They wanted them. Of course, we rushed as fast as we could to get their Time magazines."
Perhaps most importantly, the youngsters were assured that the program would be there for them the entire four years. "They saw us as their family," said Ms. Lawrence. "And it was so important to have a male as part of the program. There was such a need for that."
The four years ended in June. Of the 25 participants, 18 are in college, three are in post-high school apprenticeship programs, two are in high school equivalency programs, one is still in high school, and one is in jail.
Those results are very impressive. When the program was launched, proponents thought that 70 percent of the youngsters would never last the entire four years. A control group of 25 similar youngsters who were not in the program had a high school graduation rate of only 42 percent.
Sixty-two percent of the control group is currently out of school and unemployed.
The Quantum Opportunities Program was tried in five cities in five different states. The Philadelphia program, which spent approximately $15,000 per youngster, had the best results. It's worth a very close look.

HEADLINE: In Haiti, a Growing Disillusionment With Clinton

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEOGANE, Haiti, Dec. 2

 BODY:
People in this sleepy seaside town celebrated the election of Bill Clinton last year. Like Haitians throughout this country, they saw the election as presaging the quick restoration of democracy here and the return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Braving beatings by soldiers who pursued those who dared speak to outsiders visiting this town, people continued to praise Mr. Clinton even after he broke a campaign vow not to return Haitian refugees fleeing their country. The most common explanation for Mr. Clinton's continued popularity was that if Washington would bring democracy back to Haiti, as it had pledged, little else mattered. 
 But with efforts to restore Father Aristide stalled in the face of defiance by Haiti's military, which overthrew him 26 months ago, faith in Mr. Clinton has turned to scorn and despair.
 
Doubts About Washington
 On a shadeless beach here , few people said they still believed that Washington cared enough or that other countries had the will to force the Haitian military to surrender power.
"We had a beautiful faith in Bill Clinton that was not borne out," said Paul Jean, a fisherman who was repairing his wooden boat.
"There was an accord signed between President Aristide and General Cedras in front of the whole world to settle this crisis. The army has violated its word, and the United States, by doing nothing, has lost its honor."
In fact, the United States has acted since the army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, broke his commitment to resign on Oct. 15 and allow Father Aristide to return by Oct. 30. Washington has sent Navy ships that still patrol the waters here, often visible from the shore, to enforce a global embargo on oil and arms supplies meant to punish the military.
 
Withdrawal of Ship
 But for most Haitians, the withdrawal of an American troopship in early October in the face of a rowdy dockside protest by army sympathizers set the stage for the many other setbacks the diplomacy here has suffered since. The ship carried about 200 American and Canadian soldiers who were to have begun the process of retraining Haiti's unruly security forces.
Throughout Haiti now, across class lines and irrespective of the sentiment for or against Father Aristide, a populist leader feared by the wealthy but adored by the country's poor masses, resentment of the outside world, primarily the United States, is growing.
"Let Bill Clinton speak one last time on our country," said Sauveur Mimi, a fisherman. "After that, we won't care to listen any more."
"It's not like there a million Haitians who are against Aristide and five million who are for him. We are talking about a handful of people who are running this country, killing more and more of us every day while they violate the popular will."
 
Effect of Sanctions
 Feelings about the current economic sanctions, the third effort to impose an embargo on Haiti since Father Aristide's overthrow, are similarly sour.
In Leogane, the effects of the sanctions are seen most clearly in the lack of transportation. Push carts and bicycles have replaced automobiles on the highway that leads to the town, and jobs are few. But as a coastal town, Leogane manages to survive well enough on fishing income, supplemented by the distillation of cheap white rum that is sold in poor quarters of the capital, Port-au-Prince, about 20 miles away.
Foreign relief workers say that elsewhere, however, hunger and disease are spreading at an alarming rate.
"The people asked for the embargo, a total embargo, because we were willing to sacrifice anything if the result was going to be real freedom," said Edner Pierre, a 26-year-old who spoke angrily. "Why hasn't Washington ever wanted a full embargo here? They keep doing just enough to crush the people while the army just keeps getting richer."
In Port-au-Prince, a wealthy businessman who opposes Father Aristide expressed a similar view.
"You get the feeling the United States is mocking us," he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "Their will has been the law in this region for as long as anyone can remember, and yet they pretend to be powerless here. You have got to ask yourself, 'Do they really want Aristide to come back?' "

A map yesterday with an article about disappointment with Washington's efforts to restore democracy in Haiti mislocated the town of Leogane in some editions. It is about 20 miles west of Port-au-Prince, not east of it.

HEADLINE: Did Time. Fought Flood. Willing to Work.

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

 BODY:
"What are you looking for?" the woman behind the desk at the job placement agency in downtown Chicago said to the broad-shouldered young man standing before her.
"Anything," he said, clutching his cap nervously. "Anything." 
 The woman asked what his last job had been.
"Burger King."
And when was that?
His voice was low: "1991."
The woman asked what he had been doing since.
He swallowed. "I've been in boot camp." And then, in the silence, he added quickly: "For young men going down the wrong road."
His name is Greg Yance. He is 23 years old, a convicted drug dealer four months out of the Illinois Department of Corrections Marine-style boot camp. What he did not tell the woman -- indeed, what he did not get the chance to tell anyone at the downtown hotels, department stores, restaurants and drugstores where he has been looking for work -- was that as part of boot camp he had fought the Mississippi River last summer, and in that war he was a hero.
To the people doling out job applications, boot camp might just as well be prison. But to Greg Yance, those four months transformed him. "We say: 'We graduate from boot camp; we can do anything,' " he said.
Hurling sandbags along the levees was the best job he has ever had. "We had a purpose," he said. "People thanked us."
The people of what used to be the tiny town of Niota, Ill., have given testimonials about how for eight days last July Mr. Yance and his fellow inmates gave their all to hold back the river and to try to save their town. The other inmates nicknamed Mr. Yance Nature Boy because he was always pointing out the rabbits and birds. He was also the one who wrote the songs they sang as they worked. One refrain: "I'll be your sandbagger, baby; I'm gonna sandbag all night long."
When the levee finally broke, Mr. Yance wept. He and the other inmates had to be ordered away from the river. The people of Niota are white, the inmates mostly black. "It didn't matter what color you was," he said. "The only thing mattered was how loud can you sing, and how fast can you throw the bags."
After they had moved onto the next town -- people up and down the river were pleading for their help -- the inmates received a thank-you card, covered with signatures, "with love from your Niota family."
Mr. Vance's three-minute conversation with the woman at the employment agency was the only interview he had in a day spent going from the Marshall Field department store to six downtown hotels to a restaurant with a "help wanted" sign in the window. In a month of looking, he said to a visitor to Chicago, he had only one other interview, equally brief, at a new Walgreen's downtown.
He said he had a good feeling about Walgreen's. "I was sure they were going to call me," he said. Mr. Yance says he spends three days a week looking for work and two days at home waiting for phone calls -- calls that don't come.
What Greg Yance would like to tell all the personnel people downtown who seem not to have noticed him is this: "I've worked 18-hour days for $3 a week -- throwing sandbags dawn to dusk, stepping in water with snakes, and insects I never seen before. It was 110 degrees. Our uniform be soaked with sweat when we finished. After all that, we still got to do our P.T. -- physical training, push-ups, jumping jacks, stomach crunches. Then we jog our three miles. I'm a hard worker. I'll start at the bottom. Making $3 an hour would be a big accomplishment for me."
 
The Ability to Lead
 One of Mr. Yance's references is John W. McCorkle, the superintendent of the boot camp, in Roodhouse, Ill. Mr. McCorkle, a 6-foot, 5-inch Vietnam veteran who specializes in intimidating inmates, said he would give Mr. Yance a glowing recommendation.
"You could see Yance's leadership qualities," he said in a telephone interview. "He was the one who came out singing. He noticed all the little things, like the wildlife. He showed me he had a good heart, a strong heart. He's extremely bright. I wish I could put him in a uniform and have him be an officer here. Wouldn't he be great?"
For now, though, Mr. Yance is back where he started, in one of Chicago's poorest and most violent neighborhoods, on the West Side, where when he was 8 years old his father was shot to death. Mr. Yance himself carries a bullet in the back of his neck, though he was shot in Rockford, Ill., where his mother had sent him to live with relatives several years ago in the hope he would be safer there, but where he ended up selling drugs.
Twenty years ago a young man like Greg Yance might have found work in the neighborhood tool and die factories; today they are mostly shut down. The wire factory that is open has a sign out front: "No Help Wanted." The one growth industry, it seems, is drug dealing. Mr. Yance said that when he got home last August the local kingpin himself extended a job offer. Asked if he had considered it, he said: "I'm not going to lie to you. I've thought about it. I be thinking I could make $100, then $200. I want to give it to my mama, but she'll ask me where I got it."
 
Trying to Be Positive
 And so the other morning, like many mornings since he got off his three-month, at-home detention at the end of October, Mr. Yance went looking for legal work. He put on the clothes his stepfather, William Wade, a disabled blast-furnace worker, had bought him a month ago: black slacks he had hemmed himself, a white shirt he had ironed the night before, a gray and black sweater and matching tie, black loafers with the heels already worn down from job-hunting.
His mother, Yvonne Yance, 39, who for 13 years has worked as a secretary in the state welfare office, had some advice for the oldest of her three children as he left the house: "Be positive."
Squaring his shoulders, Mr. Yance raised his voice in the trademark boot camp chant: "Hoorah!"
Talking at home two evenings earlier, he listed all the people he knew who had been shot and killed in the last year or so : "My homey Alex dead. Carl got shot. He was in boot camp, came back and got into the same thing, selling drugs. Pookie got killed. He my best friend since sixth grade. Derrick got shot. And Baby Ty. Frank shot dead in the head. He died two days before his 23d birthday."
Asked to name the young men he knew who had jobs, he could think of only one: Demetrius Simpson, 26, a $6.40-an-hour grill server in the employee cafeteria at the Hyatt Regency downtown. (Pointing out that he has no arrest record, Mr. Simpson said it took three months of looking to land that job three years ago.)
 
Tough New Battles
 Battling a wild river seems easy, compared to what Greg Yance faces now. Last summer was war: It did not matter that he had been expelled from school in the 10th grade for packing a gun, nor that he had belonged to the Vice Lords, nor that he sold drugs.
Now, he is looking for a job in a town where even law-abiding citizens cannot find work. His resume: a piece of lined paper on which he has painstakingly printed his former jobs: Burger King, setting up rooms for conventions at the Holiday Inn O'Hare, selling hot dogs at the Lincoln Park Zoo, cooking at a fast-food restaurant.
Walking briskly toward the subway on a cold morning last week, Mr. Yance passed two young men, in black parkas and skullcaps, on a stoop a block from his house. One called out: "When you gonna come back and get some duckets?"
"P-O," Mr. Yance said, and kept walking. To the visitor, he explained: "That mean posse out, you're out, bye-bye." The young men, he said, were drug dealers.
A few steps farther, he pointed to an alley. "That's where I got arrested," he said. One more block was an abandoned building. "My brother got arrested there for selling drugs the day after me." Felix Yance, 20, got out of jail last summer. He is living with a girlfriend; he does not have a job.
Paying the $3.60 round-trip fare with money borrowed from his sister, Crystal, 22, who was working in telemarketing until she had her baby last month, Mr. Yance rode the subway downtown. First stop: Marshall Field; they might need stock boys for the Christmas rush. On the street outside, he smoked a cigarette while men and women hurried by with their briefcases. "I'm nervous," he said.
 
'They Might Call Me'
 He took the small black-pearl stud from his left ear and removed his cap. "Respect," he said. Walking past the Christmas displays -- which reminded him that he had spent last Christmas in jail -- he arrived at the ninth-floor personnel office.
One question on his job application: Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Mr. Yance wrote "yes," with a note that he would explain in an interview. When he handed the form to the receptionist, she informed him that all the Christmas jobs were taken.
"That's O.K.," he said, heading back to the street. "Someone might quit. They might call me."
For the next four hours, with a biting wind blowing up from Lake Michigan, he walked from one hotel to the next, filling out applications for security guards, cashiers and restaurant workers. Entering the Hyatt, he looked uncomfortable. "I feel bad," he said. "I lied to my mama. I told her I had an interview at the Hyatt. I felt it was necessary. When things aren't going right for me, seems like she gets depressed. She thinks it's still the 70's. She thinks I can just walk out the door and get a job."
One of his last stops was the new Sheraton, where a year ago 9,000 people, many of them unemployed professionals, had waited in a brutal snowstorm for a chance to be busboys and housekeepers. Five hundred were hired. There was nothing for Greg Yance.
It was inside the Marriott on Michigan Avenue that he spotted the ADIA employment agency. The woman there said she would keep him in mind for temporary office and "light industrial" work. Afterward, Mr. Yance confided that he had considered lying: "I wanted to tell her I was in college."
He earned his high school equivalency diploma in boot camp. He would like to go to college. He has a lot of big dreams. He talks of becoming a psychologist. Or moving to Niota. "I dream of Niota," he said. "Me with a farm, and corn."
 
Jobs Are Few
 But right now Niota is just that, a dream. The 250 townspeople who once lived there, many of them factory workers, are hoping the Federal Government will buy their ruined homes so they can relocate. While they still talk reverently of the inmates working with sandbags, they are too anxious about their own futures to be in a position to try to help Greg Yance, or anyone else.
Jobs that Mr. Yance might once have got in Chicago -- driving a truck, say, or a bus, or working in a factory -- seem beyond his imagination. Thinking wistfully of last summer, he said he would like to work with his hands. "That's what I'm best at," he said. "Backbreaking work."
The next morning he went downtown again, still searching. In a telephone call that night, his voice was flat. "One of my friends got killed today," he said. "He was out there selling drugs. Somebody drove by and shot him in the head. I seen the ambulance when I was coming home."
No, Mr. Yance said, he did not cry. "Same old thing," he said. "Another life wasted."
He didn't find a job last week. He plans to continue his search this morning.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: Flatbush;
Citing Image, Group Resists Aid for Poor

BYLINE: By Lynette Holloway

 BODY:
After a restructuring of the city's anti-poverty program, 11 more communities began receiving a share of $13 million in city and Federal money last week intended to finance programs to combat problems like unemployment and school dropouts.
Most of the communities welcome the money, but in one, East Flatbush, the designation has prompted serious opposition. 
 The East Flatbush Coalition, an association of about 300 homeowners, has hired a lawyer to have the designation -- and the $230,000 it would bring them -- withdrawn, on the grounds that it would taint the image of their neighborhood and promote red-lining among banks and insurance companies.
"There is nothing positive about this designation," said Edward Bryant, chairman of the coalition. "They will have us lined up for social services. We don't want that."
But Gladys Carrion, commissioner of the Community Development Agency, which administers the anti-poverty program, maintains that the neighborhood needs the money. She characterized the opposition as a small but vocal group that does not represent the interests of the 30,000 people living in poverty in the area.
"There is poverty in Flatbush," she said. "The people protesting this designation own homes and rent the basement out to poor people, usually newly arrived immigrants, who receive public assistance. Who do they think they are trying to fool?"
Flatbush, where more than 30 percent of the residents are of West Indian ancestry, is an attractive community of quiet side streets with brick row houses and handsome brownstones. This is not the first time the community has fought the city's poverty designation.
In 1979, when East Flatbush was first designated, residents met with Mayor Edward I. Koch and other city officials and lobbied to have the money turned back, saying they did not need or want it. They won.
But 18 months ago, after reviewing census data, Ms. Carrion and Mayor Dinkins concluded that poverty had increased citywide and announced the restructuring of the city's 27-year-old Community Action Program.
The restructuring increased the number of communities served from 33 to 44 and expanded the eligibility standard to meet the Federal Government's poverty guidelines. The program, which now serves 1.45 million residents, receives city tax money and Federal Community Service Block Grants.
Under the old program, areas were designated solely on the number of people receiving public assistance and supplemental security income within a community board's district. Now, communities are designated if 30,000 or more people, or 30 percent of the population, within one community board district live at or below the Federal poverty line.
In addition, the new standards gauge income levels in groupings of census tracts with total populations of at least 8,000, allowing for small poverty clusters to be identified within larger, overall more affluent community boards.
The program allocates money to community-based organizations that provide a variety of services ranging from youth leadership and drug prevention programs to adult job readiness and housing assistance. In Flatbush, four agencies will receive the money. The groups are the Flatbush Development Corporation, the Italian-American Civil Rights League, the Flatbush Haitian Center and the Myriad Association Inc.
"Just because there is a large block of middle-class homeowners in Flatbush, they shouldn't dictate who gets services," said Jose Velez, executive director of the Flatbush Development Corporation.
"There's no harm in this. The agency is here and this additional money helps to stabilize the needy population."
Mr. Bryant said his group's lawyer, Lynn Terrelonge, plans to bring the case to court after Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Guiliani formally takes office, hoping that the new administration will be critical of the Dinkins-era designation.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: Red Hook;
Community Court Planned

BYLINE: By Lynette Holloway

 BODY:
A community-based court, the city's latest approach to coping with misdemeanor cases, will arrive in Red Hook next spring, and it will be tailored to the particular needs of this fading waterfront community.
The first community court was set up in Manhattan eight weeks ago and deals mainly with transient criminals in the Times Square area. The Brooklyn version is also a three-year pilot project, but it is geared to hometown criminals, especially to those in and around the Red Hook Houses. Fear, drugs and guns have long been part of the landscape of these apartments. 
 The Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said last week that the exact site of the new court was still being scouted. Its location in Red Hook is certain, though, and it will be dedicated to Patrick Daly, a revered elementary school principal who was gunned down about this time last year as he searched for a missing student at the Red Hook Houses.
"There is no question that the shooting of Patrick Daly was the precipitous moment when we said we have to do something about the Red Hook Houses," Mr. Hynes said. "Before then we had been talking about the court and where we would put it, but the incident decided the location for us."
Like its counterpart in Manhattan, the Brooklyn court will primarily handle misdemeanors like prostitution and low-level drug possession. But it will have a wider range of services, including a night court for nonjury criminal trials and civil and family courts. The accused will be arraigned at precinct houses using video monitors, and a team of defenders will be assigned to the court so that they will become familiar with the Red Hook area and its residents.
A goal of the community courts is to mete out public service sentences as alternatives to jail time -- assigning graffiti writers to a number of hours spent cleaning up graffiti, for example.
Besides finding a building to renovate for the Brooklyn court's use, officials are looking for additional financing. Assistant District Attorney Gene Lopez said that the United States Justice Department had provided a $150,000 grant to help organize the court, and the office has also applied for a $125,000 grant from the New York City Housing Authority to develop construction plans.
Other public and private funds are being sought. Officials would not estimate the annual cost of running the new court; the Manhattan court's annual budget is $1.1 million.
"We're always searching for innovative ways to address low-level persistent crimes that eat away at the quality of life at all of our developments, and this court offers a different approach," said Alan Aviles, the New York City Housing Authority's General Counsel. "We're willing to do what we can to make it work."
It is unclear how many cases outside Red Hook would be diverted to the court from the Kings County Courthouse.
Community-based courts were once the rule in New York; they disappeared in 1962 when the courts were centralized.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Marketing Meat in the Age of Tofu

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
IT is 9:30 A.M., and most of New York is lurching into a normal business morning, but the meat market district, after another busy all-nighter, is just winding down. James Ortenzio -- known as Mr. Meat on the bustling cobblestone streets just below West 14th Street -- is holding court in his office, eager to explain the intricacies of this little world, which struggles daily to fill regular and rush orders from dining rooms, hospital kitchens, school cafeterias, grocery stores and butchers' shops across the city.
"Every day is a different surprise," he said as he flipped through orders from Gallagher's steak house, the Four Seasons Hotel, Brooklyn Hospital, the Federal Reserve and the Manhattan Chili Company. "Today's surprises included a guy who wanted a large quantity of veal tenderloin we didn't expect. Somebody else didn't ship turkey because a truck broke down, so we had to go around the corner. Another place wanted venison saddle; all we had was venison rack." 
 As chairman of the Greater New York Meat Trade Institute, the 48-year-old Mr. Ortenzio, who owns several businesses himself, is the meat market's biggest champion, a kind of mayor of the district. He also advises foreign governments and international companies on trade, and exports to 17 countries, supplying embassies and royalty. Trained as a lawyer at night school, he holds master's degrees in philology, linguistics and business administration and sprinkles through his conversation references to Stanford's econometric forecasting model, Ghiberti's doors in Florence and discussions with B. F. Skinner, the late behaviorist.
Yet in his crumpled fedora he moves easily through the market near the waterfront, where raw flesh hanging from shiny steel spikes is flung across loading docks and burly men in long white coats with pink stains dart out of frigid brick warehouses breathing frosty little clouds.
"I'm not interested in living in the sophisticated uptown world," he says.
Buffeted by changing eating habits and economic forces, the meat market has needed navigators in recent decades. The age of tofu has been unkind. Red-meat consumption fell nationwide from 132 pounds a person in 1970 to 114 last year. At the same time, new distribution trends hurt the wholesale market, with supermarkets and fast-food chains developing their own supplies and competition from modern markets, like Hunts Point in the Bronx, a major rival. Developers, too, cast covetous eyes on the market in the late 1980's, trying to ride the real-estate boom westward in Greenwich Village. The district's rail spur, which once brought meat cars directly into a warehouse, closed and the building was converted into the West Coast apartments.
Figures are hard to come by, but there is no question that the West Side market has shrunk since the mid-1970's, said George Puchta, an area supervisor for the United States Department of Agriculture.
Still, the district, whose roots date back more than a century, when farmers in horse-drawn wagons carted produce to it, has adapted and survived. The market profited from the soaring popularity of poultry, as national consumption jumped from 34 pounds a person in 1970 to 60 pounds last year. Suppliers learned to cater to new ethnic tastes, culinary trends and demands for convenience. One of Mr. Ortenzio's companies offers 30 varieties of ready-made kebabs.
There were experiments, too. For example, Mr. Ortenzio rose to the complaint of buyers for nursing homes who said lamb was expensive and tough for the elderly to chew. Enter the "lambette." Mr. Ortenzio said: "We take the lamb breast, a cheap cut, remove the fat, cut a pocket, stuff it with ground lean trimmings, deep-freeze to minus-30 to kill microbes, mold it like a chop and cut it on a saw. It costs 40 cents for four ounces, and they like it."
Now 75 companies remain, employing 2,300 people and selling $1 billion worth of meat a year -- about 600 million pounds. More butchering is done out of town, with cuts delivered to the district in compact boxes. To keep the district full, Mr. Ortenzio is recruiting food companies that do not deal in meat. The latest are the Petrossian caviar company and Lanciani Patisserie.
"There's a lot of vitality," said Mr. Ortenzio.
Mr. Ortenzio started as a truck driver. Along the way he became a master butcher, raised cattle, was a chef and ran a restaurant. With a $5,000 down payment, in 1979 he bought Long Island Beef, where his father was a supervisor -- "a case of reverse nepotism." From that $2-million-a-year business, he built a network of firms grossing more than $100 million.
As chairman of the institute, Mr. Ortenzio has helped negotiate labor contracts, assisted in compliance with food inspections and arranged credit and health insurance. He even persuaded the bakers to vent their exhaust to the street to fill the air with the ovens' aromas.
He also dabbles in politics. A Democrat, he broke ranks to serve as finance chairman of a committee that raised $1 million for Rudolph W. Giuliani's mayoral campaign.
Amid a recent morning mist and drizzle, he strolled the district, whose warehouses are still centrally cooled by brine pumped through iron pipes installed in the 1800's. Chain-smoking and zigzagging across the sidewalks, he bantered with supervisors in cubbyhole offices and slapped the backs of workers hauling dollies. Never lingering, he mixed small talk with handshake deals, wended his way past large upright scales and band saws and pushed though floppy rubber-flapped doors that keep the indoors cold.
Steve Yip, whose company Mr. Ortenzio helped move from Chinatown, asked to have some chicken business thrown his way. Mr. Ortenzio agreed to "take care of it." Minutes later, chatting with contractors about what they said were unavoidable cost overruns on a refrigeration project, he promised to "work something out." Next, a curbstone debate on the city's best lemon tart. Then he paused near a conveyor belt, which fed chunks of meat into a giant grinding machine, to hear a worker's complaints about his boss.
Breaking at Frank's Restaurant up on 14th Street, Mr. Ortenzio headed for the rear table permanently reserved for him. His lunch: linguine with white clam sauce -- and an appetizer of prosciutto.
Even as he relaxed, the business of the market went on around him. Throughout the district, clerks and answering machines took urgent calls from all over town placing orders for overnight deliveries.
"It's a commando job every day," Mr. Ortenzio said.

Fresh Food, Fresh Ideas at a Market

BYLINE: By Emily M. Bernstein

 BODY:
On Jan. 2, an old meat-packing plant in a stretch of old warehouses along the Hudson River at 125th Street will get a new tenant: an enormous discount fresh-food market called By Choice.
Sandwiched between the river and the abandoned and partly dismantled West Side Highway, the store is the first arrival in an area that has been the focus of a long-delayed development plan called Harlem-on-the-Hudson. 
 By Choice, opening in a brightly painted building between 132d and 133d Streets, will offer "everything from pigs' feet to caviar" at prices 30 percent to 40 percent lower than the average Manhattan supermarket, said Joseph Fedele, the store's president.
Within a year, he said, the store hopes to bring grocery shopping into the computer age, with a cutting-edge plan involving terminals, like automatic cash machines, scattered around Manhattan. Customers would punch in their shopping list and specify an evening delivery time.
Mr. Fedele and his partners, Anthony Frazier, Adam Berkey and Ken Schwarz, plan to keep prices low by buying directly from producers and to do their own butchering and processing at the market.
"Because we cut four distributive levels out, it's a much fresher product," Mr. Fedele said. "It's much closer to where it would be if you cut it out of the ground or slaughtered it at the plant."
The building is 43,000 square feet, 24,000 of which will be used for sales. That will include a produce area, a small dry-goods section, vast butcher and fish counters and a deli. The store, which is modeled in part on Stew Leonard's in Connecticut and similar markets around the country, will also include videos to entertain children and to educate buyers about food and cooking.
The store would be the first of its kind in Manhattan. Many Upper West Side residents now drive to warehouse-style stores in New Jersey or Connecticut.
The store will hire 75 workers for its opening and plans to increase that to 200 by the end of the year. Mr. Fedele said employees would be trained by the company and would be given an ownership stake in the store.
Mr. Fedele said the store's location made it convenient to large numbers of people, and that market studies show an income range of $5,000 to $500,000 within a one-mile radius.
The market should also appeal to many neighborhood residents forced to depend on small stores with little selection and high prices, he said.
"Because you live in a lower socio-economic area, you should not be forced to eat day-old bread," Mr. Fedele said. "Everything is overpriced and old up here, and you have to buy it in a disgusting environment."

Melrose Commons Nearer Start

BYLINE: By Raymond Hernandez

 BODY:
Plans for Melrose Commons, a 30-square-block development, came closer to reality when the City Planning Department certified it recently.
That decision has opened the way for a final review by residents and elected officials. Although the review process sometimes becomes a forum for enormous opposition, the plan for Melrose Commons may have already met its toughest challenge: an early public outcry that forced a major revision of the initial proposal. 
 Last year, when city planners first considered certifying a project for the area, plans called for a middle-income community of 3,000 new units to be built along the largest contiguous stretch of municipally owned land in the city -- a tract that sprawled through the area south of 161st Street, to the east of Yankee Stadium.
But when residents learned of the project after one bumped into a city worker taking notes on the street, the certification process was halted amid protests from people who feared that the plan would displace residents and businesses. Some of those fears were based in history: stretches of the borough were devastated in the late 1940's when Robert Moses built the Cross-Bronx Expressway.
But unlike the Cross-Bronx project, Melrose Commons began to incorporate its critics into the planning process. Residents, planners and officials from the office of Borough President Fernando Ferrer met regularly to redraw the plan.
"This is unique," said Kevin Nunn, a deputy director of planning in the Bronx Borough President's office.
"They have been involved in facets of planning that heretofore other communities have not been invited into."
Officials now predict that similar partnerships will increasingly determine the fate of large, publicly financed urban renewal projects.
The new plan has been scaled down to 2,000 units and is part of the Bronx Center, a proposal to revitalize 200 square blocks in the neighborhood with construction of new homes, apartments and businesses.
"This project is the shot in the arm that the Bronx needed," said Carlos Padilla, a member of the We Stay Committee, a group of residents and merchants that opposed the initial plan and helped outline the new one.
He said the group's main goals were to have a constant role in planning, limit relocation and give longtime residents who are relocated proper compensation for their property and priority for any new housing.
"We wanted the project to fit in our community, and it does," Mr. Padilla said. "Moving the people out would be just like what was done to the Indians."

HEADLINE: Network Maps Way Out of Medical Maze

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
THE feeling of being in a medical maze is familiar to any patient in a suburban hospital who has had to go to an acute-care medical center in Manhattan for surgery.
Under State Health Department regulations, community hospitals, like the United Hospital Medical Center in Port Chester, can offer patients only primary care and routine surgical procedures. Havva S. Idriss, president and chief executive officer of the 294-bed United, said: 
 "Traditionally, when our patients needed sophisticated treatment such as bypass heart surgery, our physicians had to send them down to a tertiary medical center, such as New York Hospital." Tertiary medical centers, she added, are designated by the state "to deal with serious illnesses that require more sophisticated, complex procedures."
 
First Member of New Network
 To be admitted to a tertiary hospital, the patient, with sheaves of X-rays and medical records in hand, traditionally deals with a whole new cast of medical practitioners.
"It has been a very stressful occurrence," Ms. Idriss said. "Often tests that have already been done on the patient have been repeated as ordered by a doctor at the new hospital. The truth is that duplication is not uncommon. It is very hard on the patient." To say nothing, she added, of the added cost and time wasted on the duplicated tests.
Such overlapping procedures should soon be a thing of the past now that United has affiliated with the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan as part of an alliance known as the New York Hospital Care Network, Ms. Idriss said.
"On Oct. 29, United became the first suburban hospital to join the New York Hospital Network," she said. "The strategic planning process, which involves the medical board's staff and heads of both hospitals, has been in the planning stages for almost three years, and we are very pleased with the outcome. It is a win-win for everyone concerned: doctors, patients and hospital administrators alike."
Dr. David B. Skinner, president of New York Hospital, said: "One of our major goals is to have one-stop medical shopping for patients. Overall, the New York Hospital Care Network's mission is to maintain excellence in the delivery of health-care services and medical-education programs through an integrated health-care system.
"The alliance puts us in a competitive position to deliver health-care services much in the same way envisioned in the managed competition at the heart of the Clinton or Cuomo plans." He added that the hospital now has the ability to enter into contracts with corporations, businesses, health-maintenance organizations and other groups "to deliver cost-effective health care."
 
Access to Other Institutions
 In anticipation of changes in the health-care industry, George A. Vecchione, executive vice president and director of New York Hospital, said corporations with employees who live in several different locations will someday routinely contract with health alliances to deliver services to their employees through groups like the New York Hospital Health Care Network.
United Hospital's affiliation with New York Hospital, which has 922 beds in Manhattan and a 326-bed psychiatric division in White Plains, means that patients at United will also have access to a dozen other institutions that are part of the network, which includes nursing-care establishments, specialty hospitals like the prestigious Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan and outpatient services in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn.
In turn, United, as part of the network, will now make its nursing-care pavilion, its outpatient clinic and other services and programs available to New York Hospital patients.
 
Aided by Computers
 Ms. Idriss offered an example of how the new arrangement might work. "If a patient who, let's say, lives in Rye, comes home after an operation at New York Hospital and needs cardiac rehabilitation, instead of having the patient going back to New York Hospital for rehabilitation, we can supply it," she said.
Describing the network as a "private initiative on the part of New York Hospital to address the issues of escalating health costs in lieu of changes in the health-care industry," Ms. Idriss said, "It is a very sensible arrangement because it makes the best use of every hospital's resources, which leads to economy of scale and operational efficiencies.
"There should be significant savings realized through integrated and consolidated services, with the end result of offering more health-care choices at lower costs to the 100,000 consumers in our area. And as an added benefit, our physicians at United will have access to the latest discoveries and medical research and technology through New York Hospital's vast research and education institutions."
What makes sharing information viable is the computer. In the pilot program in effect at United Hospital, all patient information is computerized at bedside.
Dr. Edward V. Gundy, an orthopedic surgeon in private practice and vice president of United's medical board, said that the computer will give network affiliates access not only to patients' charts but also to their laboratory work, X-rays, medical work, other charts and recommendations from doctors -- in short, a total patient profile.
 
More Services Available
 "It is a tremendous boon for doctors and patients alike and so much more efficient," Dr. Gundy said. "The information that nurses put on a patient's chart is computerized and when the system goes on line, all vital information about a patient will be coordinated and transmitted electronically to other institutions in the network, which means, for instance, that when I send one of my patients down to the Hospital for Special Surgery I can do it quickly.
"What is more, all the patient has to do is show up at Special Surgery without worrying about picking up numerous X-rays and medical records first."
The alliance, Dr. Gundy added, will not only increase the number of health-care services for residents but will also help consolidate such overlapping operations as rehabilitation services, nursing-home and home-health-care services and inpatient and outpatient psychiatric programs.
"I see alliances such as this one playing a big part in the solution to the problem of delivering affordable quality health care," Dr. Gundy said. "It will surely help hospitals contain costs through sharing services instead of duplicating their facilities. And the services of doctors will also be shared. Doctors will have more time to do what they were trained to do. Everyone should benefit."

HEADLINE: Fast Boat to Manhattan May Sail From Yonkers

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
WITHIN two years, Westchester residents may have another way to travel to Manhattan: a 30-minute ferry ride from a Hudson River pier here to 38th Street. Mayor Terence M. Zaleski of Yonkers announced late last month that he was negotiating with the Port Imperial Ferry Corporation of Weehawken, N.J., to start the commuter service as early as 1995.
Arthur Imperatore, owner and president of the ferry company, said that a new generation of high-speed boats traveling at 35 miles an hour -- more than twice the speed of his present fleet -- would be used for the Yonkers run. 
 Mr. Imperatore's company operates other ferry services, including two from Weehawken to midtown and downtown sites and another from Hoboken, N.J., to Battery Park City. The company is planning another run from Hunter's Point in Queens to a terminal at 34th Street on the East River. Port Imperial Ferry also operates a 90-minute cruise of New York Harbor and an excursion from midtown to Tarrytown from spring to fall.
In addition, Port Imperial Ferry operates buses to take travelers from ferry terminals to other locations in New York City, a service included in the price of the ferry ticket.
 
Nyack Also Under Consideration
 The cost of the half-hour, one-way ferry ride from Yonkers to Manhattan would be $7, and monthly commutation tickets would be available.
The commute from the city pier here could tie into a similar service planned out of Nyack in Rockland County, where the state recently awarded a route to Port Imperial, Mr. Imperatore said.
The emphasis on ferry service is a result of the High-Speed Ferry Task Force appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo earlier this year to study ways to relieve congestion on highways, bridges and tunnels leading into New York City.
The Governor has called ferry transportation a key element of his New, New York economic revitalization program for the metropolitan area and has described the boats as an "environmentally sound means of travel" and "a great way to get to and from work."
 
A Private Deal
 The service from Nyack and Yonkers to Manhattan would operate during the morning and evening rush hours, from 6:30 A.M. to 10 A.M. and from 4 to 7 P.M., said Vince Baglivo, a spokesman for Port Imperial. More runs would be offered if the number of riders increased, he said.
While the state is backing the principle of ferry service out of Nyack and Yonkers, implementation of the commuter lines "will be essentially a private deal" between the municipalities and the ferry company, said Robert Weber, a spokesman for Mayor Zaleski. Some state or Federal money may be used by the city for developing parking or renovating a pier, he said.
Mr. Baglivo said: "Essentially, the state has invited a private company with private funding to negotiate the deal as opposed to the way subsidized mass transit works."
Yonkers's plans are part of the city's latest effort to revitalize its waterfront area. Some of the revitalization projects, but not the ferry service, will be paid for with county funds.
 
It's No Longer Arthur's Folly
 For the ferry service, Yonkers will conduct a study to determine if a ramp or an additional parking structure is needed at the terminal. Also, the negotiations with Mr. Imperatore have focused on who will be responsible for providing security at the pier, Mr. Weber said.
Mr. Imperatore, 68, formed the company in 1986 and now carries about 20,000 ferry passengers a year. "In the beginning, when I started, they called it Arthur's folly, but it has proved not to be a joke," he said. "It is quite profitable now."
He estimated that he would need five more boats for the Yonkers and Nyack routes and that each boat would cost about $3.2 million and would be capable of carrying up to 350 passengers, compared with the older boats, which seat up to 400 people.
The new ferries have glass tops, bars and refreshment services and are heated and air-conditioned. "They are quite beautiful, very upscale," Mr. Imperatore said. "And once people take our boats, they get hooked on the enjoyment of it. It's not the subway or the train."

HEADLINE: 2 Senators Take 2 Approaches On Health: 'Now!' vs. 'Now?'

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
One Irish-American grew up in Hell's Kitchen and became an intellectual. The other was raised in privileged surroundings and went straight into politics.
The first has written hundreds of books and articles as the Senate's only working scholar. The second has written hundreds of laws, more than anyone else in the Senate's 204 years. 
 Pat Moynihan of New York and Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts are the Senate chairmen who will have dominant roles on health care next year. Each is a sponsor of President Clinton's plan, but the two Democrats' approaches are as different as their careers.
 
Impatience and Caution
 Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, has been pushing national health insurance since 1969. He wanted to do it then. He wanted to do it last summer. He wants to do it now.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Committee on Finance, will go ahead and do it, all right. But he wonders if this is the right time, and the right social problem to tackle.
Even so, they are friends who appreciate each other's talents and resist the urging of allies to seize the prime role on health care, to defend those Senate verities of turf and procedure.
 
Republican Motives
 Republicans who would prefer to work in the more conservative confines of the Finance Committee fanned that issue, titillating a capital that thrives on such disputes, and the health bill was ultimately referred to neither committee as Congress rushed home last month.
In the long run, this procedural roadblock will either be cleared or prove irrelevant. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said last week that he expected the bill to go to the two committees. And even if it does not, Mr. Kennedy said, "it doesn't make any difference; we can each originate new bills."
This Senate tiff -- the House has somehow avoided such wrangles for the time being -- is a token of how much health care is now a Congressional issue, with Congressional customs and characters a major influence on its future. The jurisdictional issue is a marker for the future, over who has charge of the inevitable, but less noticed, revisions.
Even Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who stepped forward to block part of the bill from going to the Labor Committee, acknowledges that whatever emerges next year will not be one committee's product, but "a collective bill."
In that collective, expect Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Moynihan to work together, as they did when the New Yorker first came to the Senate in 1977. The two of them joined the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., and Gov. Hugh L. Carey of New York in a St. Patrick's Day appeal, renewed in subsequent years, urging Americans to stop arming the Irish Republican Army.
A picture of the four of them as football's Four Horsemen of Notre Dame, hangs by Mr. Kennedy's desk in his Senate office. The broad humor of that picture is more Mr. Kennedy's style; Mr. Moynihan's brand of wit is drier.
They have known each other since the 60's, vote alike about 90 percent of the time and respect each other's abilities, though in fact no past legislation has brought them to collaborate as closely as they acknowledge they must on health care.
 
Mutual Admiration
 Mr. Kennedy calls Mr. Moynihan "one of the giants in the Senate" and "an enormously significant, thoughtful and profound writer" with an intellectual breadth that reaches beyond details to concepts.
Mr. Kennedy, who has spent 31 of his 61 years in the Senate, said Mr. Moynihan was one of those rare colleagues who could "have a very interesting, personally satisfying life outside the Senate, and were sufficiently sure of themselves individually and personally to be able to maintain their basic integrity in the service of the Senate."
Mr. Moynihan, who deferred to Mr. Kennedy and let his committee have the first Senate hearing with Hillary Rodham Clinton, said, "I admire him hugely," especially his colleague's efforts to push his committee's liberal agenda in the Reagan-Bush era.
"He doesn't get frustrated and angry," Mr. Moynihan said. "He has soldiered very well through those 12 years. And he has been thinking about health for a generation."
 
Kennedy's Mission
 In the 80's, Mr. Kennedy was probably best known as the prime Congressional voice on civil rights, leading successful fights against Republican Administrations on voting rights, sanctions against South Africa and discrimination by employers.
But his efforts to maintain health and education programs in the face of Reagan Administration cuts were also accompanied by some new health legislation, including a 1986 measure allowing workers to maintain employer-based insurance by paying the premiums themselves when they leave their jobs.
Despite renewed efforts in the late 1980's, national health insurance, which he said in 1969 was "an idea whose time has been long in coming," has eluded him. Labor's unwillingness to compromise undercut his efforts in the early 1970's, and President Jimmy Carter's reluctance to move on insurance prompted Mr. Kennedy's ill-conceived 1980 campaign for the nomination.
This year, with a President for an ally, Mr. Kennedy has been eager for action. He lent 10 staff members to Mrs. Clinton's task force that developed the plan. He tried to get health care dealt with as part of the budget bill this summer, but failed. Then he said his committee could report out legislation before the end of this year. And he has been holding hearings here and in Massachusetts, two or three days a week, all fall.
 
More Recent Concern
 Mr. Moynihan comes lately to health care. In the 80's, he played major roles in assuring the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, in changing the tax system and in transforming Federal highway legislation into a program that promotes all varieties of surface transportation.
Last summer, when Mr. Kennedy was urging speed on health care, Mr. Moynihan was openly wondering if it would not be better to try to deal first with welfare. That has been his trademark issue since he first began writing about the decline of the black family in the 1960's.
It was also his major concern when he worked as a counselor to President Richard M. Nixon, the third President he served (after John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and before Gerald R. Ford) in what he calls a gallimaufry of domestic and international positions.
Even now, while he says "we're going to go ahead" on health care, he finds much, both practical and philosophical, to worry about. He shook up the Administration in September by calling the financing of the health plan a "fantasy," but says he is now somewhat reassured by their revisions.
Still, "I have a question," Mr. Moynihan said on Friday after returning from trade talks in Geneva. "It's very abstract. And that is, in economic theory there is a sort of a literature on 'point of entry.' At what point is it too late to go into a particular sector? For example, you would not start an automobile company today."
 
Both Underestimated
 Mr. Moynihan, 66, says that medicine has advanced so far that the task of providing national health insurance will be immensely more difficult than it would have been when President Harry S. Truman first urged it, or even when Senator Kennedy did.
Mr. Moynihan's caution and Mr. Kennedy's impatience on health care reflect the Senators' obvious differences.
But they have something very important in common as they approach health care. Each has been vastly underestimated in the Capitol.
Mr. Kennedy's upholstered route to the Senate, which he entered at the constitutional minimum age of 30 while his brother was in the White House, plus his often mangled sentences and his having been thrown out of Harvard, led a lot of people in Washington to think he was dumb. They also thought he did not work hard.
But scholars whom he has brought in to help on legislation come away impressed that he asks the right questions and remembers the issues. Colleagues have found him indefatigable in preparation for a hearing or on a foreign trip, and relentless in building a political army, as when he worked to defeat the Supreme Court nomination of Robert H. Bork in 1987.
His strategic skills are formidable. This summer, for example, he demanded that Clinton Administration officials retreat a bit on their student loan plan to satisfy Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican. He said they would need Mr. Jeffords's help later on.
They reluctantly retreated. In September Mr. Jeffords became the only Republican to endorse the Clinton health care plan.
Mr. Moynihan's omnibus range of interests has lulled some people in Washington into doubting his seriousness as a lawmaker. But his persistence on politically premature issues, like the decay of the black family, has laid a foundation for influence now that he is the chairman.
Sometimes even he underestimates himself. He finds that ideas he has long championed, like banning some handgun ammunition, matter much more now that he is chairman, the first New Yorker to head the Finance Committee since 1849. After he proposed taxing the Winchester Black Talon bullet, which causes more injury than ordinary bullets, out of the market this fall, Winchester simply dropped production.
When Mr. Moynihan succeeded Lloyd Bentsen as chairman of the committee in January, some skeptics doubted he could handle its shifting coalitions. But with Republicans offering no votes at all, he worked with the 10 other Democrats on the 20-member committee to get the tax elements of Mr. Clinton's budget bill through last summer.
One critical knack the chairmen share is the ability to work with Republicans, something not often seen among natural partisans like Mr. Kennedy. That does not keep Finance Committee Republicans from working to keep the health bill out of Mr. Kennedy's Labor Committee, where his liberalism would have most influence.
But if the legislation advances toward passage, it will need Republican support, and in different ways, each man draws Republican allies. Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, who has collaborated at times with both of them, described the styles this way:
"Ted Kennedy is very earnest, very straightforward. There is never any doubt of where he stands. He is very good to work with, straightforward, no hidden ball. His word is his bond.
"Pat is very bipartisan, one of the favorite senators of Republicans, a person who is receptive to a whole variety of ideas. He likes ideas from wherever they come. If I have an idea, he is an audience for that idea."
Another Republican, Senator Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, who serves on both committees, said, "Ted is 'we got to get it done, we got to get on.' You know this guy is in charge. Sometimes with Pat, you think it's both of you."

HEADLINE: Finland's Opera Now Has A Home

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, Dec. 4

 BODY:
In recent years, Finland, with composers like Aulis Sallinen, Joonas Kookonen, Einojuhani Rautavaara and Erik Bergman, has produced more operas of international distinction than any other country. For a small nation on the northern fringes of Europe, that is a remarkable achievement.
Almost as remarkable has been the fact that up to this week, Finland has lacked a theater specifically designed for opera. The two most prominent operatic entities in the country played in makeshift spaces: the Finnish National Opera in the 500-seat Alexander Theater, built in 1879 for the amusement of the Russian garrison stationed in Helsinki, and the Savonlinna Opera Festival in the temporarily covered courtyard of the 500-year-old Olavinlinna Castle. 
 Now, that lack has been grandly rectified, and in a way that does belated honor to the country's modern-day tradition of operatic composition. On Tuesday night, the gleaming new Finnish National Opera on Toolonlahti Bay in the center of this city was inaugurated with Mr. Salinnen's gripping opera "Kullervo." The title role was sung by Jorma Hynninen, a world-renowned baritone who is also the former artistic director of the Finnish National Opera and the current director of the Savonlinna Opera Festival.
The opening was the beginning of a five-day celebration of the new theater, which was in fact completed in the spring and has seen various concert, operas and ballets since May in productions adapted from the Alexander Theater. These were intended to acclimate the company to its vastly expanded new home, nearly three times the size of the old theater although, at 1,385 seats, still only one third the size of the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
 
A Wide-Ranging Audience
 This week's festivities, which attracted dignitaries and critics from around the world, also included the first new production for the new theater by the Finnish National Ballet, "Swan Lake"; the first new production of a standard-repertory opera, "Carmen," a repeat of "Kullervo" and a concert on Saturday.
"Now we Finns can show the world we can be successful in our art on our own turf," said Walton Gronroos, the company's director. "We don't need any more to go around the world," he added, referring to the company's frequent tours. "Now, the world will come to us."
The reaction in the Finnish press was rapturous, and there was good reason for rapture. The new building won an architectural competition in 1977. But what one Finnish critic called "a lack of money and political will" delayed the start of construction until 1986, with further delays caused by the recession and the bankruptcy of several subcontractors. The "Kullervo" premiere took place in Los Angeles in early 1992, after it had become clear that the Helsinki theater for which it was intended would not be ready. The total cost of the construction was $135 million.
The design, by a three-member architectural team headed by Eero Hyvamaki, may lack the boldness of Alvar Aalto's Finlandia Hall on the same shore; to some, the exterior looks like dated corporate modernism. But its white walls and arched glass atriums blend well with the light-colored exteriors of both Finlandia Hall and the National Theater on the other side of the bay. The white walls look particularly striking flooded with artificial light on a long Finnish winter night, with the grounds and the bay itself covered in pristine snow.
Inside, the theater is more striking still, with the high-tech look of so much Nordic architecture softened by light gray marble and polished parquet floors of red beech. The auditorium -- there is also a flexible small hall seating between 200 and 500 -- may be intimate on American terms, with no seat farther than 100 feet from the stage. But backstage, everything is spiffily up to date, and company members have pronounced the acoustics first rate.
The stage size is up to international standards, too, permitting the company to assay Wagner and other large-scale scores for the first time. Mr. Gronroos, who is still an ensemble member at the Deutsche Oper of Berlin, will sing Wolfram when that company presents Wagner's "Tannhauser" here in April, and there will be a Finnish production of "Lohengrin" in June.
"Kullervo," which was warmly received at its Los Angeles premiere with the same production and much the same cast as this week in Helsinki, made a somber yet symbolically appropriate opening opera. That was partly because this tale of a cursed destroyer of all that he loves comes from the "Kalevala," the national epic of Finland.
Sibelius wrote a "Kullervo" Symphony, but shied away from opera. Mr. Sallinen's score continues a compositional line from Wagner through Sibelius to modernity; its debts are obvious but so is its originality. The composer uses speech and electronic effects and dissonance where expressively appropriate. Yet his idiom has a gloomy Romantic breadth that appeals to international opera audiences. Certainly the performance, with not only Mr. Hynninen but also a supporting cast headed by Jorma Silvasti, a strong young tenor, and the veteran conductor Ulf Soderblum, did Mr. Sallinen's opera full justice.
 
Out of the Mainstream
 Given the overtly mythical nature of "Kullervo," there was some discussion at a symposium on new Finnish operas on Wednesday as to just what the Finnish opera "boom" represents and how internationally appealing it can be. While the Finnish National Opera has performed several new operas widely, and while there have been a few notable foreign productions, new Finnish opera has hardly joined the mainstream repertory.
Partly, said Pekka Hako of the Finnish Music Information Center, that is because "it is hard to whistle Finnish national values." Seppo Heikinheimo, the chief music critic for the leading Helsinki newspaper, The Helsinki News, went so far as to suggest that the entire phenomenon had been artificially created by the Finnish Government's sponsoring tours and subsidizing critics to come to Helsinki. This accusation of impropriety was met with shocked harrumphing, since most of the assembled critics had indeed participated in a Government junket to attend the opening.
On the other hand, such payments are accepted practice in Europe, and Finnish opera has a truly wide appeal, proven by its solid sales on compact disks, especially in the United States. One might even suggest that Finnish composers have followed the same practice as Andrew Lloyd Webber, who has built anticipation for his musicals by first releasing recordings. "Kullervo" was available for months before its Finnish premiere, and Mr. Bergman's "Singing Tree," not scheduled for its world premiere until 1995, is already in the record stores.
For the future, Mr. Gronroos said the main immediate need was for the company to adjust technically and psychologically to its spacious new surroundings, and to get used to presenting 200 opera and ballet performances in repertory over a 10-month season. "The small house is still in the brains of our people," he said.
The "Swan Lake" production was a re-creation of Vladimir Bourmeister's version of the Petipa-Ivanov model by Josette Amiel of the Paris Opera Ballet School. The dancing was appealing but provincial, despite the 22-year-old Nina Nyvarinen's convincing Odette/Odile. Just how effective the company will be in a wide range of standard repertory remains to be seen, although the Finns' success in such repertory at Savonlinna bodes well.
Mr. Gronroos, who has been accused of plotting too conservative a course, said he intended to sustain the company's commitment to Finnish operas, with a new production of Mr. Kokkonen's "Last Temptations" in September, "The Singing Tree" the following season and a world premiere in 1996-7.
He conceded that the very grandeur of the company's new home might daunt composers comfortable in less imposing circumstances, but he remained optimistic that the theater would ultimately benefit Finnish opera.
"I believe that our artistic level will be higher now," he said. "I hope everything will be easier for us, and that the creative power will still be very strong."

France said that "excessive optimism" had emerged in recent days about a successful conclusion of world trade talks, underlining that problems remained on the eve of decisive talks in Brussels between the European Community and the United States. The statement, by Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, followed meetings between Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and the European Community's trade negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, and GATT's Director General, Peter Sutherland. [Page D1.]
 
The Economy
November's steep drop in the unemployment rate reflected the second consecutive monthly increase in manufacturing jobs, a heartening rebound for blue-collar America that could persist and even accelerate in the next few months, according to economists and labor experts. But they also warn that it is not likely to last. Downward pressures include automation and a trend among manufacturers to move jobs overseas, not just in search of lower wages but also to be closer to foreign markets. [D1.] 
 The sharp drop in the price of oil began to push down prices of gasoline. The average price at the pump fell by almost 2 cents a gallon for self-serve unleaded regular gasoline, according to a national survey. The drop was the steepest since near the end of the Persian Gulf war in February 1991. [D1.]
Top officials of the American Medical Association appealed to doctors at a meeting in New Orleans to show reason and restraint in criticizing President Clinton's plan to overhaul the nation's health care system, even as members of the group's rank and file vowed to seek major changes in the White House proposal. Several state delegations, including those from New York, Florida, Indiana, Virginia and Texas, said the A.M.A. should re-examine its support of a proposed Federal law to require employers to provide health insurance for their employees. [A14.]
 
Companies
A Delaware court's criticism of Lazard Freres and other players in the battle for control of Paramount Communications tells much about the specific tussle between Viacom and QVC Network to gain control of Paramount. But perhaps more important, the details of the case speak volumes about the fragility of a system intended to protect the interests of shareholders. [D1.]

HEADLINE: SPLIT ON STRATEGY AT A.M.A. MEETING

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Top officials of the American Medical Association appealed to doctors today to show restraint in criticizing President Clinton's plan to overhaul the nation's health care system, even as members of the group vowed to seek major changes in the proposal.
At a meeting that displayed the group's divisions over tactics and strategy in the coming battle over the nation's health care system, Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the association, said, "We want to make policy, not politics." 
 "We have everything to gain and oh so much to lose if we start drawing lines in the sand while the ship of reform is still at sea," Dr. Todd told more than 500 doctors gathered here for the semiannual meeting of the group's policy-making body, the house of delegates.
 
Employer Mandate Questioned
 But leaders of the doctors' organization found anxiety, frustration and discontent among the members. Several state delegations, including those from New York, Florida, Indiana, Virginia and Texas, said the A.M.A. should re-examine its support of a Federal law to require employers to provide health insurance for their employees.
President Clinton's plan, like a policy the association adopted in 1990, endorses such a requirement, known as an employer mandate. But some doctors, echoing Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress, are now suggesting that such a requirement may be unwise.
Dr. Ed L. Calhoon, a general practitioner from Beaver, Okla., said the A.M.A. policy on this issue was misguided, and he asserted, "Employer mandates will drive many small companies out of business."
By contrast, Dr. Rebecca J. Patchin, an anesthesiologist from Orange County, Calif., said she supported an employer mandate. "It's the only way" to achieve insurance coverage for all, she said.
American Medical News, the weekly newspaper of the association, said this week that there was a serious split in the organization because "it represents an impossibly diverse membership with conflicting economic interests."
As a result, it said, the A.M.A. and other medical societies have sent mixed signals to the White House and Congress. While endorsing President Clinton's goal of health insurance coverage for all Americans, the association has harshly criticized many of the proposed means to that end.
 
Fighting Caps on Premiums
 The trustees of the group today affirmed their desire to be "a constructive agent of change," working closely with the White House.
But at the same time, the trustees denounced Mr. Clinton's proposal for Government regulation of health insurance premiums. They said that participation in Mr. Clinton's "health alliances" should be voluntary, not mandatory. They objected to the White House proposal to set quotas for the training of medical specialists, and they expressed disappointment with Mr. Clinton's proposals on medical malpractice suits.
To redress such grievances, Dr. Todd suggested a strategy of cooperation, which he said that he had already used with some success. For example, he said, Mr. Clinton agreed that all consumers should have access to "fee for service" health plans, in which consumers can choose any doctor and pay separately for each service, as an alternative to health maintenance organizations with a limited roster of doctors.
In addition, Dr. Todd said, the package of health benefits that would be guaranteed to all Americans under Mr. Clinton's plan is similar to the one proposed by the A.M.A.
 
Note of Apprehension
 While Dr. Todd and other officers of the association struck conciliatory notes in their public remarks, the written reports from the board of trustees were full of apprehension. The A.M.A. has a membership of 290,000, fewer than half the doctors in the nation.
The trustees accepted the idea that spending on health care should be predictable, but urged Congress to reject the type of "budget enforcement techniques contained in the President's plan." Specifically, the trustees resisted Mr. Clinton's proposal for a new Government agency, the National Health Board, that would set limits on premiums.
Under the Clinton plan, all employers with 5,000 or fewer employees would have to get insurance coverage through large purchasing pools known as health alliances. The A.M.A. trustees said this number should be reduced to the range of 100 to 500 employees.
And in a report to the house of delegates, the trustees said: "For employers beneath the threshold, participation in the alliance should be voluntary. Employers above the threshold should remain out of the alliances to create true competition."
The Administration says such a proposal would defeat the purpose of the alliances, which is to concentrate the purchasing power of consumers in the marketplace for health care.

HEADLINE: A Surprise: Blue-Collar Jobs Rebound

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 5

 BODY:
After Terry Ochs got out of the Marine Corps last spring after eight years as a helicopter crewman and aircraft mechanic, he journeyed up and down the West Coast and throughout the Midwest searching fruitlessly for maintenance work with an airline.
Finally, he returned home with his wife and 4-year-old son to live with his parents in Fond du Lac, Wis., and widened his search to include, among others, the Brunswick Corporation's outboard engine factory there. 
 Two weeks ago, the 26-year-old Mr. Ochs became one of about 175 people Brunswick has hired in recent months. He is joining a second shift Brunswick added to its production schedule last week to meet a rebound in demand for pleasure boats.
"It takes a load off my mind," Mr. Ochs said over the telephone from his new employer's factory Friday.
 
Role of Manufacturing
 Mr. Ochs's good fortune reflects the manufacturing sector's part in the surprisingly strong economic statistics released by the Federal Government last week, including Friday's announcement of a sharp drop in overall unemployment in November that took 534,000 people off the unemployment rolls.
New service-sector jobs accounted for the vast majority of those who found employment. The job figures also declined because more than 80,000 people who did not find work on a regular payroll quit looking. But the figures also included a gain of 30,000 workers at manufacturing companies like Brunswick.
It was the second consecutive monthly increase in manufacturing employment, a heartening rebound for blue-collar America that could persist and even accelerate in the next few months, according to economists and labor experts. But they also warn that it is not likely to last.
"This uptick is real, but it does not change the underlying currents," said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert teaching at the University of California in Berkeley. Downward pressures include automation and a trend among manufacturers to move jobs overseas, not just in search of lower wages but also to be closer to foreign markets.
 
Expanding Output Needed
 Indeed, the most recent long-range projection by the Bureau of Labor Statistics concludes that output will have to expand at an average rate of 2.4 percent through 2005 to keep manufacturing employment, now just over 17.7 million, from falling below 17.5 million. That is far above the 1.1 percent growth rate from 1979 through 1992, a period when more than three million manufacturing jobs were lost.
Still, there is no denying that companies like Brunswick are making it a cheerier Christmas for thousands of blue-collar workers. And Brunswick has company, especially in the Midwest.
"On the basis of the latest survey by the National Tooling and Machining Association, I'd say our industry has a minimum of 4,000 openings, and 10,000 is probably more realistic," said Harry Moser, president of Charmilles Technologies in Lincolnshire, Ill., a distributor of equipment used in making molds and dies that other manufacturers need to make plastic parts. "We are hiring engineers as fast as we can find them. We're busy because our customers are."
 
More Chrysler Workers
 Those customers include the Chrysler Corporation, which recently added a second shift to its Belvidere, Ill., factory, bringing to more than 3,000 the number of workers added in recent weeks at that plant, which makes Chrysler's new compact car, the Neon.
There are midsized companies like the privately held MacLean-Fogg Company in Mundelein, Ill., which supplies hardware to telephone and power companies and plastic fasteners to auto makers. It expects to add about 50 employees in the next year to its work force of 1,000 to cope with sales growth of 15 percent.
Small manufacturers are chipping in, too, especially those like Perceptron Inc. of Farmington Hills, Mich., that supply the auto industry.
"We have added about 10 people since the beginning of November to bring us up to about 85 employees," said Dwight Carlson, chief executive of the company, which makes laser-based inspection systems for auto makers that cost up to $250,000 each. "We added a second shift and there's a lot more overtime."
 
Some Executives Skeptical
 Federal data suggest that the manufacturing employment rebound began in October, when a net gain of 12,000 jobs was reported. The 42,000 jobs added in the last two months do not come close to compensating for the 256,000 lost from March through September.
Many in industry have a hard time believing that manufacturing employment is actually expanding. The most recent survey of the National Assoication of Purchasing Managers, which focuses on 300 industrial companies, concluded that manufacturing employment actually fell last month. And some executives are openly skeptical.
"We may add a person or two, but I'm being very careful," said Brad Roller, president of Swiger Coil Systems Inc., a privately held company in Cleveland that makes electrical coils used in mass transit motors and in rebuilding industrial motors.
In addition, when a manufacturing company and other agencies contract out anything from cleaning to data management, the statistical result is a manufacturing job lost and a service-sector job gained. Thus, manufacturing-related employment might be rebounding at a healthier clip than surveys show.
At any rate, data released last week suggest that pressure to hire new employees is growing because the current work force is being stretched to its limit. The average workweek edged up six minutes in November to 41.7 hours, the longest since the end of World War II. And overtime was running at 4.4 hours, the highest since the Government began tracking such data in 1956.
In the real world, such figures are reflected by the decision of Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest maker of construction equipment, to add 350 people to factories in Illinois from September through the end of this month and to project hiring 320 more early next year. Last spring, the company was meeting most of the growing demand for its products by piling on overtime.
A variety of forces are contributing to American manufacturing job opportunities. There are new products, like Lumitex Inc.'s recent expansion of its fiber optic display lighting technology from electronic instruments into shoes made by L.A. Gear and bike helmets made by Bell. The privately held company, based in the Cleveland suburb of Strongsville, expects to add slowly to its work force of 80 for the next few months and then hire more rapidly in the spring, said Peter Broer, its president.
There is also new popularity for old products. Surging domestic demand for pretzels is creating new jobs at pretzel machine makers like the Reading Pretzel Machinery Corporation in Robesonia, Pa.
In a few cases, companies are bringing overseas production home. Brunswick has moved engine production from a joint venture in Japan to Fond du Lac and this week at its Tulsa, Okla., factory, Brunswick will start making a new model fishing reel, a product typically made in Asia.
Of course, nothing helps like general economic growth. That is what has allowed Georgia-Pacific to add second shifts at building-products plants in Russellville, S.C., and Madison, Ga., increasing employment at each of them by 135 workers. It is also encouraging steelmakers like the Nucor Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., and the Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation of Roanoke, Va., to take on new employees.
The most noticeable increases occur when innovation and general economic growth are pushing in the same direction. Morton International Inc.'s automotive group is racing to keep up with demand for its airbags, which are going into more car models at the same time car sales in general are growing.
Morton, which expects airbag sales to be close to $1 billion this year, double last year's total, has hired 625 employees at four plants in Utah since July and expects to hire that many more in the next seven months.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
New F.C.C. Chief Looks Beyond the Corporations

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Reed E. Hundt got a sobering lesson in tough challenges in June. As part of a group hiking to the 14,410-foot summit of Mount Rainier in Washington State, Mr. Hundt found himself exhausted and gasping for oxygen at 12,800 feet. The guide told him he had reached his "personal summit," and ordered him to sit tight while the rest of the group went on to the top.
Now Mr. Hundt is pursuing a new "personal summit," and says he has no idea yet how far he will get. Last Monday, he was sworn in as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, becoming chief regulator of the nation's airwaves and a central figure in shaping the broader revolution in telecommunications. 
 He arrives during a time of great change in media and telecommunications. Digital technology is blurring the lines between television and telephones, while wireless services are changing the nature of local phone calls. Under the old rules, these businesses were separate realms.
But now Congress and the Clinton Administration are weighing ideas to overhaul the nation's communications laws, amid growing support for a more free-wheeling regulatory policy that permits greater rivalry between industries.
 
How to Regulate
 In an interview this week, Mr. Hundt made it clear he favors that kind of approach. "Come here and look at this," he said, pointing to an old, yellowing globe that he inherited along with his office. The globe showed French West Africa instead of Senegal, Mali and Mauritania; part of China was carved out as Manchukuo, a name imposed by Japan during World War II.
"Think of this as the Communications Act of 1934," Mr. Hundt said of the globe. "It's not an object of ridicule -- it's an historic artifact."
That stance echoes the view of Mr. Hundt's two predecessors, Alfred C. Sikes and James H. Quello. But the shadings of emphasis are different, in that Mr. Hundt argues that government must step in to promote broader social goals.
"There are thousands of buildings in this country, with millions of people in them who have no telephones, no cable television and no reasonable prospect of broadband services," he noted. "They're called schools."
Relying only on corporate decisions, he said, will not insure that the benefits of advanced communications reach into the schools and to masses of ordinary Americans.
"Corporations will build networks to the point that they are economically optimal," he said. "But market mechanisms will not lead to networks being built to the optimal social point."
Mr. Hundt offered few clues about how he would achieve these broader social objectives. But his stance is sure to rattle many industry figures who want to eliminate current regulations rather than add new ones.
Mr. Hundt, 45 years old, will take over the agency as something of an outsider. A Washington lawyer, he has represented a few communications companies before the F.C.C. and in court. But he is primarily a generalist, better known for his work in antitrust law.
He has been a close friend of Vice President Al Gore ever since the two attended St. Albans preparatory school in Washington, and he went to Yale Law School with the Clintons. He worked on Mr. Gore's Senate campaigns and his Presidential bid in 1988, and on the Clinton Presidential campaign of 1992.
Those who know Mr. Hundt describe him as an intensely energetic man with a keen intellect. For months, he has been meeting with F.C.C. and outside experts to absorb as much as possible about the issues.
His plate will be full. Congress is demanding that the F.C.C. straighten out the confusion over cable television rate regulations, which have produced unexpected price increases for many customers. The F.C.C. has also been ordered to write new rules by June to auction thousands of new radio licenses for wireless "personal communications services.".
Eli Noam, director of Columbia University's Institute for Tele-Information and one of the people Mr. Hundt sought out for advice, said Mr. Hundt's generalist background offered some advantages. "He's more likely to be open-minded and bring a fresh perspective, and not associated with any industry dogfight," Mr. Noam said. "He goes in there with a lot of good will."
Communications lawyers noted that the F.C.C.'s agenda tends to be nonpartisan and that generally favors easing barriers to competition. "There has come to be something of a consensus about what constitutes good policy," Philip Verveer, a communications lawyer and longtime Democrat, said. "Good policy favors open entry, full use of facilities, no restrictions on output. It doesn't really matter whether you're a Republican or a Democrat."
Mr. Hundt seems to have taken that view as well. Discussing legislation that would lift many restrictions on telephone companies while attacking their monopolies, Mr. Hundt said he had been struck by the wide range of support. "The message that was coming back to me, from all kinds of people, was that this is not simply a Democratic idea or a Republican idea -- it's just good legislation."
That does not mean his job will be free of disputes. There will inevitably be huge arguments over tiny details that greatly affect industry groups.
"The honeymoon won't last long," Mr. Noam of Columbia said. "There are more toes to step on here than at a centipede convention."

HEADLINE: A Plan for Gates, a Call for Pickets;
Bordering Newark, Maplewood Finds Proposal Causes a Rift

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD, N.J., Dec. 2

 BODY:
No wall or fence or gate stands between this pretty suburb and Newark, not yet anyway.
But the rift that seemed to develop between them last week is real and growing with each new report about a proposal to build several gates that many people thought were intended to separate Maplewood from the state's largest city. 
 While Mayor Sharpe James of Newark and Mayor Robert H. Grasmere of Maplewood attribute the situation to a lack of communication, the two are slugging it out in the media. On Thanksgiving Day, it was the "Today" show. On Dec. 9, "Donahue." In between the two have been interviewed by dozens of television, radio and print reporters.
As a result, what residents of Maplewood say began as a traffic problem is now a story about the affluent suburb versus the impoverished city and whites trying to barricade themselves from blacks with gates on selected streets. And Hillcrest, a racially and economically diverse neighborhood in Maplewood abutting Vailsburg, a similar community in Newark, is fending off charges of racism and elitism from all corners of the globe.
"It was never about keeping people out," lamented David Chavis, a founder of the Hillcrest Neighborhood Association, who expects another firestorm of publicity when a public hearing on the proposed gates is held Tuesday night.
 
'We've Talked About Organizing Pickets'
 But critics of the plan are unmoved say they plan to organize Newark residents to attend the hearing. "The proposal is extremely offensive," said Luis Quintana, a Newark deputy mayor. "We've talked about organizing pickets."
The proposal for gates, Hillcrest residents say, came out of a long process of figuring out what to do with a worrisome problem: cars careering through the neighborhood's narrow streets to avoid three traffic lights.
Residents, after complaining for years that the cars were a danger to their children, came up with the idea of installing five ornamental gates that would create cul-de-sacs so that cars could not cut through. The State Department of Transportation granted preliminary approval to the plan and on Nov. 22, so did the Maplewood Township Committee.
The next day, a 193-word item in The Star-Ledger in Newark described a proposal to install five steel gates along the Newark border as a crime-prevention tactic that would keep all traffic from Newark out.
 
Gates of Iron and Brick
 Mayor James reacted in a fashion that could have been predicted of his city's fiercest defender: he was outraged. Recalling a proposal in Elizabeth a few years ago that would have built a wall in a neighborhood facing a Newark housing project, he fired off an irate letter to Mayor Grasmere.
The letter said, in part, "I am extremely disturbed by the elitist mentality Maplewood has demonstrated that says that certain municipalities like Maplewood have no crime, while other municipalities, like Newark, breed criminals." And Mr. James had copies of his letter faxed to reporters.
Maplewood officials said the article misstated the where and why of the plan. First, they say, the issue is not crime, but traffic. Second, of the five gates (which will not be steel but scrolled iron and brick), four will stand not on the Newark border but in the interior of Hillcrest, facing the rest of Maplewood.
The fifth gate is to face Irvington Avenue, a main thoroughfare that separates Maplewood and Newark, on a blocklong street constantly trammeled as a short cut.
[Mort Pye, the editor of The Star-Ledger, said in a statement yesterday: "We received complaints about the crime emphasis in the story. In subsequent stories we took pains to explain this was a long-considered plan to help solve traffic problems in the neighborhood."]
But it is too late for Maplewood to contemplate the symbolism of gates or publicize the plan to avoid any misunderstanding.
Picking up on Mayor James's reaction, dozens of reporters descended on Hillcrest. On "Today," Katie Couric introduced the story as one about one town in New Jersey wanting to erect gates to keep out the other. "Donahue," taped last Thursday afternoon packaged the story as a racial issue. It was broadcast in 20 markets and will be broadcast locally on WNBC-TV Channel 4 on Thursday.
A producer prepped the audience for a controversy where "those constructing the fences are white middle class, those on the other side of the fence are mostly minority poor."
The audience was shown a video of Maplewood that panned through its quaint downtown and most exclusive residential streets. It did not show Hillcrest -- eight blocks of tidy tract houses (selling for about $150,000) on compact (40-foot-by-100-foot) lots. A video of Newark showed streets with "for sale" signs on sorry-looking buildings, not bordering Vailsburg, which has both private houses and condominium developments.
 
Mayors Blame Each Other
 Until this incident, relations between Newark, a city of 275,000, most of them black, and Maplewood, with about 21,000 residents, about 12 per cent black, were cordial. Many Maplewoodians work in Newark, come from Newark and have relatives in Newark, residents of both places say. Before a movie theater opened in Newark two years ago, Newark teen-agers went to Maplewood's theater.
The mayors blame each other for the brouhaha. Mr. James said he had reason to be confused about the plan because no one in Maplewood told him about it. "At a time when Arafat and Rabin are talking, when the Berlin wall has come down, we should be talking," he said.
Mr. Grasmere said there was nothing to say about the plan since it was considered a neighborhood matter. And he is angry with Mayor James for comparing the issue to world events. "It does not have any impact on Newark," he said.
Meanwhile, the founders of the Hillcrest Neighborhood Association, Mr. Chavis and Kenneth Pettis, say the real story of Hillcrest, of a neighborhood united to improve itself, has been subverted.
"Two years ago, Hillcrest didn't exist," Mr. Chavis said. "It was just another area in Maplewood." The association was formed after the township decided to institute one-way streets in Hillcrest, Mr. Chavis said, which the residents beat back.
 
Rejected Speed Bumps
 From there, residents banded together, creating block associations and instituting a neighborhood newsletter, to form their own solutions, Mr. Pettis said.
"On 'Donahue,' people said why not try speed bumps or other things," Mr. Chavis said. " We thought of speed bumps, but snow plows wouldn't be able to get through. We thought of ornamental planters or something like that, but we realized we needed something that could be opened if necessary in an emergency. So we came up with the gates."
The paradox of being called elitist and racist does not escape Mr. Pettis, who is black, or Mr. Chavis, a white civil rights advocate who directs the Center for Social and Community Development at Rutgers University and works organizing communities in Newark and Camden.
"Hillcrest is 50 percent black," said Mr. Pettis, a New York banker who has lived in the neighborhood for more than seven years. "And it's not upper middle-class by any stretch of the imagination."
It doesn't help, he said, that the situation between Maplewood and Newark is being lumped with other controversies. On "Donahue," he said, he felt uncomfortable on a panel that included residents and officials from two communities in Long Beach, Calif. -- one affluent and white, the other Mexican -- feuding over a proposed wall. "Racism and elitism do exist," he said. "But that's not what we've been about."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Times Mirrors Family Ties Fade

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
Management changes announced last week at the Times Mirror Company accelerated an evolution that is changing one of the largest family-dominated media empires in the country.
The company's president, David Laventhol, said he was stepping down and two senior vice presidents were given new responsibilities and titles in what was widely seen as the start of a competition over who will succeed the company's chairman, Robert F. Erburu, who is 63 and is expected to retire in two years. 
 Mr. Erburu, a longtime adviser and intimate of Times Mirror's founding Chandler family, is likely to be the last chairman with such close ties to the Chandlers. The transformation is likely to leave the company with a cadre of professional managers who are less concerned with the influence of the family and more concerned with hard numbers.
For generations since 1882, the Chandler stewardship of the company's flagship, The Los Angeles Times, virtually defined the power that can go with control of an important newspaper. Times Mirror sold shares to the public beginning in 1964.
 
The Signs of Change
 Chandler family members remain on the company's board and own about one-third of the company, though they control 54 percent of shareholder voting power. Still, the "corporatization" of Times Mirror has been under way for years as the company has grown, felt shareholder pressure and, more recently, been pushed to control costs because of sagging advertising revenues.
After this next step in the transformation, the new generation of managers will be measured against a family standard that for decades has included a commitment to journalistic excellence.
In addition to The Los Angeles Times, the company owns Newsday on Long Island and in New York City and newspapers in Baltimore, Hartford and elsewhere. The company, which derives about half its $3.7 billion in revenues from newspapers, has been enormously influential in helping to define the future format of newspapers.
The emerging group of managers will also be watched for decisions that could affect newspapers nationally. In Baltimore, for example, the company has long been toying with whether to preserve that city's valued Evening Sun as well as its morning sister publication. In New York, some analysts say, new managers might be tempted to review the company's resolve to support its expensive nine-year effort to make New York Newsday a financial success.
Mr. Laventhol, who is suffering from Parkinson's disease, is stepping down on Jan. 1 as president of Times Mirror and as publisher of The Los Angeles Times. He is to remain a member of the board.
Because of the types of managers now rising within the company, his departure is likely to be seen as the final phase in the company's move away from the Chandler family's direct involvement in management. Otis Chandler, the last of the Chandlers to be so involved, stepped down as chairman in 1986.
 
Experience From Outside
 The two men who are said to be in the running for the top job are both 49 years old -- Richard T. Schlosberg 3d, an executive for many years at small newspaper companies who has recently been running Times Mirror's Eastern newspapers, and Curtis A. Hessler, a former vice chairman of the Unisys Corporation who joined Times Mirror in 1991.
What may be more significant than their relative youth, however, is the broad experience both men bring from places other than Times Mirror. Mr. Schlosberg is seen as ahead in the competition because he was named to take over Mr. Laventhol's high-visibility responsibilities as publisher of The Los Angeles Times.
But some securities analysts said it was possible that Times Mirror could turn to a complete outsider. Analysts said last week that the emergence of a new generation of professional managers was welcome at a company that has come under criticism in recent years for weak financial performance. Last year, Times Mirror reported a loss of $67 million after one-time charges that included employee buyouts. Largely because of the recession, it has seen operating profit from its newspapers shrink from a high of $377 million in 1987 to $126 million last year.
Kenneth T. Berents, an analyst at Wheat, First Securities, said Times Mirror had been known as a company with excellent properties but, recently, not excellent financial results. As it shifts toward the first group of managers without family links, Mr. Berents said, the financial community expects a more cold-blooded management style.
"You will see this company much more focused on the bottom line, whoever replaces the current management," he said.
 
A Source of Success
 Some in the industry do not welcome such changes. They say the historical success of family-dominated newspaper companies came partly from the managers' ability to separate the drive for profit from the drive for quality. Some of those strengths are lost, they say, if professional managers, struggling to meet traditional business benchmarks, lose sight of journalistic values.
The Los Angeles Times, sharply conservative and stridently anti-union through most of its history, is often cited as an example of the success of family management. Otis Chandler, who was its publisher from 1960 to 1980, was widely credited with turning what had been a financially successful but parochial publication into a world-class newspaper.
It has often been said that Mr. Chandler was driven largely by a personal sense of ambition for the newspaper. He had the confidence to try to improve The Los Angeles Times, some writers have said, because his family's place in California and American history was so closely linked to the newspaper's success.
Mr. Erburu, the current chairman, was a lawyer at a firm that has long represented Chandler interests. Since 1961, he has been a top executive at the company, helping design a strategy to diversify by buying major media properties across the country. Some analysts say Mr. Erburu has governed in the style of a family member.
Mr. Erburu is active, for example, on a host of civic and charity boards. Among his moves was the promotion of Mr. Laventhol, a unique figure in American newspapering, to the second-highest position in the company.
 
New Definitions of News
 In a long career as a respected editor at such newspapers as Newsday and The New York Herald Tribune, Mr. Laventhol pioneered new approaches to news that are now widely accepted.
Know as a believer in articles about life style issues, he helped redefine newspaper coverage that by the 1950's was considered dry and predictable. In 1968, he designed The Washington Post's Style section, which had broad influence nationally and is still a much-praised "soft news" element of The Post's coverage.
In a time when few former editors reach the top ranks of newspaper corporations, Mr. Laventhol is finishing his career near the top. Among other jobs, he has been Newsday's publisher, a Times Mirror corporate executive and its president since 1987.
"Laventhol," said Gerald D. Reilly, a newspaper consultant, "is one of the few left at that level who is really from an editorial background." Some in the industry say the increasing power of executives with little experience in the news side of newspapers is one result of the growing control by big corporations.
Mr. Laventhol, who has supervised cutbacks that have shrunk The Los Angeles Times staff by 23 percent over three years and closed its San Diego edition, is no sentimentalist. But he is known for a keen sense of the journalistic ambitions that make news organizations work.
 
Newsday's Big Move
 The ambition he is most closely associated with was the decision during the 1980's to move Newsday, the highly successful Long Island newspaper, into competition with New York City newspapers by starting New York Newsday, in essence a separate newspaper.
New York Newsday loses millions of dollars a year. As soon as the news of Mr. Laventhol's departure from the company presidency spread last week, newspaper people were speculating about whether the company might now take a harder view of the New York losses.
Robert M. Johnson, Newsday's publisher, quickly said the impact of Mr. Laventhol's departure was "none." Mr. Johnson, 48, was one of those whose chances for a top Times Mirror position appeared to be stalled by the new corporate responsibilities parceled out last week to Mr. Schlosberg and Mr. Hessler. Both were named executive vice presidents. Mr. Erburu is to assume Mr. Laventhol's title of president.
In recent interviews, both Mr. Erburu and Mr. Schlosberg said in the strongest terms that they would not consider withdrawing from New York. "We're committed to New York Newsday. Period," Mr. Erburu said.
But, in answer to a question about Times Mirror's financial results recently, Mr. Erburu acknowledged that the company had been feeling pressure. "When you go through a period like this, it's very disconcerting and no one is very happy about it," he said. "But the fundamentals are very sound."
The issue for Times Mirror is whether the next person who sits in Mr. Erburu's chair will agree.

A survey says that cause-oriented campaigns don't just make people feel good, they work, too.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
CONSUMERS consider advertising and promotional campaigns that try to do well by doing good to be believable and effective, according to the results of what is thought to be the first comprehensive survey of public attitudes about this increasingly popular marketing trend.
Among the 1,981 people interviewed for the national survey, 66 percent said it was somewhat or very acceptable for companies to participate in what is known as cause-related marketing or point-of-purchase politics. By contrast, 17 percent said it was not very, or not at all, acceptable; the remaining 17 percent said it depended or they did not know. 
 The practice encompasses a broad range of programs by which companies seek to sell their goods and services by also offering to help social, charitable and political organizations. Usually, the causes being benefited are widely supported, like fighting homelessness, crime, pollution and hunger. Sometimes, though, the campaigns take sides on hotly disputed issues like abortion, gay rights and gun control. Among the best-known cause-related marketers are American Express, Ben & Jerry's Homemade, Body Shop International and Members Only.
The survey was conducted in August by the Roper Starch Worldwide market research company in New York for Cone Communications, a marketing and public relations agency based in Boston that specializes in cause-related campaigns for clients like Avon Products, which sponsors a program called the Breast Cancer Awareness Crusade, and Ryka Inc., a footwear company with a foundation to combat violence against women.
"We were talking to companies about cause-related marketing," Carol L. Cone, the chief executive of Cone, recalled during an interview last week, "and they wanted to know: 'Will it create brand loyalty? Will it cause people to switch brands?' We didn't have the answers."
Edward B. Keller, an executive vice president at Roper Starch, said: "It's a coming issue that needed to be better understood and documented. And we wanted to get some benchmark figures, so we can track this over time."
Ms. Cone said the survey's "most surprising factor" was the relative strength of corporate social responsibility as a reason people gave when asked what they considered when buying brands.
"It's now in the second tier of important purchase influences," she added, though reasons like past experience, price and quality remained far more important. In response to questions asking about the likelihood to switch if price and quality were equal, 66 percent said they were somewhat or very likely to switch brands "based on a good cause," while 62 percent said they were somewhat or very likely to switch retail stores.
Ms. Cone said she was "pleasantly amazed" at the relative lack of cynicism about the motives of marketers who practice point-of-purchase politics. Seventy-one percent of the respondents agreed somewhat or strongly that it "is a good way to help solve social problems," and 64 percent agreed somewhat or strongly that it "should be a standard part of a company's activities."
Twenty percent said they bought something in the last year "because it was associated with a cause or issue." That figure doubled among so-called influentials -- trend-setting, socially active consumers.
Still, there was some skepticism. When asked whether cause-related marketing was "just for show to improve the company's image," 58 percent agreed somewhat or strongly.
And 62 percent said marketers should demonstrate they actually believed in the causes and issues they embraced by becoming involved for more than a year or by making similarly long-term commitments. Ms. Cone termed that significant because such campaigns were often short-term promotions.
While the survey explored the aspects of what Mr. Keller called "standing for something your customers stand for, to let them feel buying your product is an expression of their commitment," one intriguing topic that went unmeasured was whether people shun marketers that take stances on issues at odds with their own opinions. He said he hoped to address that in the next survey, which he and Ms. Cone plan to conduct in two years.

Bond Traders Shrug Off Job Gains

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
With its response to the stronger- than-expected November job data reported on Friday, the bond market seemed to be saying, "O.K., we already know that the fourth quarter is going to be strong."
The increase in nonfarm payroll jobs of 208,000 was more than the consensus forecast of 180,000. In addition, the factory workweek rose to 41.7 hours, a post-World War II high; construction jobs increased, and manufacturing jobs rose for a second month. 
 These factors suggested that there would be a good jump in industrial production this month and added support for a forecast of a 4 percent or more growth rate in the gross domestic product for the last three months of this year.
Despite the job news -- a strong economy worries bond traders about the risk of inflation -- bond prices closed higher on Friday, after an initial round of selling. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended the day at 6.23 percent, down from 6.28 percent on Thursday.
 
News May Have Been Digested
 "People are finding that the economy is picking up, but the news does not tell them that the economy is picking up more than their expectations," said Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
If traders and investors have finally accepted that outlook, a moderate jump of two-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index, due out Thursday, and a similar increase in the Consumer Price Index, due Friday, should allow the market to hold its own or even rally a bit.
But the data on new jobs did not provide much insight into next year and, therefore, did not dampen the fears that a firm first quarter of 1994 could force the Federal Reserve Board to quickly raise its short-term interest rate target, which has been 3 percent for more than a year.
Other data released on Friday might cause additional concern along this line. Car and truck sales showed that the strong pace of October was sustained in November. In the last 10 days of November, car sales were at an annual rate of 7.5 million, while truck sales were at 5.9 million. For the month of November, cars sold at an annual rate of 7.1 million, matching October, and trucks were at 5.6 million, up from 5.4 million.
This pace means that the production schedule in the first quarter of 1994 may not be high enough to keep car and truck inventories from falling too low. If the car makers increase production, all other things left unchanged, current economic forecasts would have to be raised. Because many forecasters are betting on a slowdown in the first quarter from the pace in the fourth quarter, such an increase in automobile production could cause problems by making it more likely that the Fed would raise short-term interest rates.
This concern seems clear in current short-term interest rate levels. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to Federal Reserve possibilities, finished at 4.20 percent on Friday, its highest level since the summer.
The discount rates on three- and six-month Treasury bills are near their highest levels since the end of last year, when traders and investors were worried that strong growth in the fourth quarter would spill over into 1993 (which, of course, it did not). On Friday, the discount rate was 3.10 percent on the three-month bill and 3.26 percent on the six-month bill.
One measure of expectations for short-term interest rates compares the three-month and six-month bill rates. With a current three-month rate of 3.10 percent, a 3.42 percent rate is needed in the second three months of a six-month bill to pull the rate for the entire six months up to 3.26 percent. That implied 3.42 percent rate three months from now is more than a quarter of a percentage point higher than current three-month rates. So, traders concluded that buyers were assuming that the Fed would raise its 3 percent interest rate target.
 
Not Always Clairvoyant
 Treasury bill rates are being pushed higher by other factors, including the Government's increased reliance on short-term borrowing to cover the budget deficit, as the end of the year nears. But the levels are still a good barometer of market concern, even if they are often wrong as an indication of what the Federal Reserve actually winds up doing.
"The sentiment has moved to the side that it will be sooner than later," said Darwin L. Beck, director of the economics department at CS First Boston Corporation. "If the economy moves up to 3-percent-to-4-percent growth rates next year, the Fed will not hold off."
With such concerns in the market, the inflation reports this week are more important for shorter maturities. Mr. Beck forecasts a one-tenth of 1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index, over all, and a still moderate two-tenths of 1 percent rise in the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices.
Such a report would surely ease inflation concerns on the heels of a jump of four-tenths of 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index in October. With 11 months of the year counted, inflation would be up just 2.7 percent at an annual rate, still below the 2.9 pace of 1992. But another tick up -- an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent -- could intensify fears of Fed action.
"A big C.P.I. number would reinforce the view of a Fed tightening sooner rather than later," Mr. Beck said.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
Wisconsin Is on Top a World Away

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 5

 BODY:
For Wisconsin, the road to the Rose Bowl wound through the back streets of the Ginza and redefined Big 10 football's idea of an away game.
As vendors sold sushi in the stands, Wisconsin pushed through Michigan State's weak defensive line today and won a fairly painless victory, 41-20. The triumph gave Wisconsin a 9-1-1 record for the season and a place in the Rose Bowl against U.C.L.A., the first trip to Pasadena, Calif., for the Badgers in 31 years. 
 Wisconsin's long drought actually served as a Big Ten tie breaker. Wisconsin and Ohio State finished with identical records and played to a tie during the season. But under Big Ten rules, it is Wisconsin's turn to play in the Rose Bowl because Ohio State went to Pasadena more recently, in 1985.
Tokyo is not the ordinary venue for decisive games; ask most Japanese about the Big Ten and they will tick off the world's largest electronics firms. But the game, the annual Coca-Cola Bowl here, was scheduled more than two years ago, when the $400,000 gate guarantee and an offer to pay the teams' way over sounded particularly good to a mediocre Wisconsin squad.
 
Governor Makes the Trip
 By game time, some Wisconsin fans began to complain that the biggest matchup in a generation would be played half a world away. But hundreds of others flew here to watch the game, including Wisconsin's Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who, mindful of where he was visiting, brought a trade mission in tow. With a surprisingly stiff recession still gripping Japan, the trade team seems likely to run into a significantly better-organized defensive line in Japan than the Badgers did.
"Coming to Tokyo actually worked to our benefit," said Barry Alvarez, Wisconsin's coach, who had the team practicing at 11:30 P.M. back in Madison, Wis., in an attempt to combat jet lag. "There were fewer distractions than at home where everybody was already looking past this game to the Rose Bowl. We were able to control our kids, and focus on this game first."
The two who focused best were Brent Moss and Terrell Fletcher, who ran for two touchdowns each. Moss rushed for 152 yards in the game, and Fletcher picked up 133. Meanwhile, Darrell Bevell, the Wisconsin quarterback, completed 14 of the 19 passes as Wisconsin piled up more than 500 yards in offense.
The Badgers' only trouble came in the first quarter, when Michigan grabbed an early 7-3 lead on a 33-yard touchdown pass from Jim Miller to Mill Coleman.
 
The Tide Turns
 Michigan State threatened again, but Wisconsin's Scott Nelson picked off a Miller pass and the tide quickly turned, with Fletcher's 1-yard touchdown run putting the Badgers ahead, 10-7, with 9 minutes 21 seconds left in the first half.
By halftime, Wisconsin had a 17-point lead, 24-7. In the fourth quarter, Michigan State put a brief scare into the Badgers by closing the gap to 14 points, 34-20, on a 33-yard field goal and then recovered a well-executed onside kick. But on the next play, a pass by Miller was intercepted by the Badgers' Ken Gales. Wisconsin then marched 92 yards for a the game's final score.
"That interception late in the game iced it all for us," Alvarez said.
 
Some Japanese Badgers
 Wisconsin, it turned out, enjoys a surprisingly large following in Tokyo. The Tokyo Dome, usually the home of the Yomiuri Giants, Japan's most famous baseball team, was sold out, with a crowd of 51,000. Among them were several hundred Japanese who have graduated from Wisconsin and some of the more than 30,000 American expatriates living here.
"The year I graduated, 1953, was the first time Wisconsin ever went to the Rose Bowl," said Keith G. Johnson, who now runs one of the largest American-Japanese joint ventures, Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi.
Wisconsin lost that game, 7-0, to Southern Cal. It lost in Pasadena again, in 1960, to Washington by a score of 44-8 and then fell to Southern Cal, 42-37, in 1963. Now, after 31 years, the Badgers get another chance. "It's been a long, long time," said Johnson.
Not that that fact was foremost on everyone's mind. At today's game, fans could try one of Japan's best, and least publicized, technological innovations: the portable beer keg.
Then there was the play by play, which came over the loudspeaker in two languages, and the Wisconsin fans, themselves, who walked around Tokyo's biggest stadium wearing styrofoam hats that looked like giant blocks of cheddar cheese -- the famous cheeseheads.
Such exuberance is rare in Japan, especially in public stadiums, and the natives were a little mystified. But now they know: Wisconsin is going to the Rose Bowl.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Mad City Goes Bonkers
 MADISON, Wis., Dec. 5 (AP) -- Two police cars were damaged after thousands of Wisconsin football fans surged into the streets early today in a wild celebration of their team's Rose Bowl-clinching victory in Tokyo.
Fans poured out of bars, restaurants and dormitories onto nearby State Street, the main drag between the Wisconsin campus and State Capitol building, for a raucous demonstration that included the repeated singing of "On, Wisconsin," the school's fight song, and shouts of "Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!"
But less innocent forms of celebration led to 14 arrests, the police said.
About 3,000 fans made their way to Camp Randall Stadium, where one group tried to bring down the goal posts. Fans at the stadium said the specter of the Oct. 30 post-game stampede, in which dozens were hurt after a Badger victory, kept today's celebration from being even wilder.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Reaches for Iron Rule

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It has been suggested that the elections for Parliament and a new constitution in Russia on Dec. 12 will provide the democratic legitimacy needed by President Boris N. Yeltsin and his economic advisers to take the tough decisions necessary to revitalize the Russian economy ("Runaway Rubles," by Anders Aslund, Op-Ed, Nov. 24). 
 But the circumstances under which these elections are being carried out, and the nature of the constitution to be approved, indicate that what is really in the making is a new form of authoritarian rule in Russia. This is no surprise, for it is not the absence but the presence of democracy that constitutes the greater obstacle to Mr. Yeltsin's strategy of radical economic reform.
This strategy calls for strict government budgetary austerity and rapid liquidation of unprofitable enterprises, which would have the predictable consequence of generating mass unemployment and even greater social and economic distress than the Russians are experiencing. This kind of economic "shock therapy" is extremely unpopular, especially among workers, retirees and all those women and men who are already suffering and would be hardest hit by accelerated dislocation.
Any Russian government responsive to the democratically expressed preferences of its citizenry would search far and wide for an alternative strategy of transition that would not impose such huge immediate costs on so many people. The opposition that the Yeltsin administration has encountered in trying to implement its economic reforms thus has far deeper roots than some obstreperous old Communist elites and their allies in the disbanded Parliament.
Contrary to Mr. Aslund's view, the only way in which President Yeltsin and his economic advisers will be able to impose their radical economic reform policies is by taking advantage of their current political hegemony and by wielding the enormous power afforded to the executive by their proposed new constitution.
Those Westerners who believe that shock therapy is indispensable for the long-run health of the Russian economy, whatever the short-run pain it causes, may take some comfort from the new political order in Russia; but they should honestly admit (as do some of their Russian counterparts) that what they are getting is a Russian General Pinochet.
As for those of us who believe in the potential for democracy and for an alternative -- more gradual and more humane -- transition to a mar
ket economy in Russia, we can only lament what is happening now, and hope against hope that it does not permanently set back the cause of democracy and economic revitalization in that long-troubled country.

Looking Beyond Peace

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: PARK RIDGE, N.J.

 BODY:
"There's a story behind every one of those ornaments," said Richard Nixon, looking more robust than he has in years, showing me the Christmas tree in his home. Lest sentiment intrude, he quickly turned to the purpose of my annual visit: a review, parts on the record, of what's ahead.
Stacked on his desk is the manuscript of his latest book. On the 20th of next month (the 25th anniversary of his first Inaugural Address), the 37th President, who will then be 81, will bring out "Beyond Peace." The theme of this 150-pager -- likely to be his eighth nonfiction best seller, a publishing record -- is: "After peace breaks out, we usually have periods of stagnation; we must find challenges as stimulating as war." 
 Nixon, in his nonpartisan years, has not lurched leftward: "When the rest of the world is turning away from big government, we shouldn't be turning toward it. The problem with 'reinventing government' is that they want government to be doing better the things that government shouldn't be doing in the first place."
He hopes that Bill Clinton keeps his centrist Nafta coalition together, dropping the McGovernite left over the side. But do voters really care about foreign economic policy? That's not the point: "The public's interest in Nafta was not in the issue, but in the battle."
Though the battlefield on which Clinton feels most at home is domestic affairs, Nixon -- the old Moscow summiteer -- thinks this President should not hesitate to share what he has recently learned in the Nafta fight with Boris Yeltsin at next month's Moscow summit.
"Clinton could give Yeltsin good counsel," says Nixon, "on how to deal within a multi-party system. It's the kind of hard-earned advice that Yeltsin can use now."
Can we help relieve the tension building between Russia and Ukraine? "Our line to Ukraine should not be to deal with them just because they have nuclear weapons, but because they have 55 million people and you don't want a rogue state." He's high on Ukraine's Kravchuk, and thinks the U.S could be a broker in the delicate nuclear disarmament.
Nixon has urged Yeltsin to press ahead on privatization. "To paraphrase Churchill, the free market is the worst economic system except for all the others. But the central question in Russia is: Can democratic capitalism provide progress better than Communist capitalism, the kind they have in China?"
He gave me a mock-suspicious look. "Weren't you the one who put me up to saying 'We are all Keynesians now'? Well, we are all capitalists now. If democratic capitalism fails in Russia, that will be water on China's wheels." That's why we should encourage reform, a movement greater than individual reformers, in Russia.
What about India, a democratic nation, where capitalism is lagging? "India, which will be more populous than China in the next century, must ask itself this question: Can democratic socialism compete with Communist capitalism?" To pose the question is to answer it -- only capitalism, however modified, can compete with capitalism -- but I had never heard it posed before.
Nixon is too much the pragmatist on China, preferring quiet diplomacy and bonds of trade to public pressure on human rights: "Economic freedom will open up any closed society."
But his newer theme is "there isn't any third world anymore. Only two worlds, rich and poor. Wealth divides China, East and West Europe, the north and south nations."
On hot-button issues at home, he remains progressive. Abortion: "The state should stay out; don't subsidize and don't prohibit." Gun control: "I'd go further than the Brady bill. Guns are an abomination." (From this I deduce he is not running in '96.)
On TV violence: "Hollywood thinks America is sick -- hunh! They're the sick ones." He's against the balanced budget amendment -- "a meat ax when you need a stiletto, but it'll probably pass" -- and in favor of term limits: "incumbents have asked for it."
Assessments of the Clinton Presidency and the Republican field, as well as his views on initiatives on health, education and welfare, await appearances at publication time. For now, it's inspiring to see the old warrior using every minute as a golden bullet, staying well by staying productive -- never, never quitting.

School Meals

 BODY:
The number of free or reduced-price lunches served in the region's schools continues to climb, and breakfast programs for pupils are expanding as part of the federal government's $4 billion-a-year National School Lunch Program. At the same time, the number of paid lunches has fallen, in what state officials call a sign of families' economic struggles. In total, the number of breakfasts served has jumped 35 percent in four years, propelled by heightened concerns about nutrition and educators' belief that it's hard for children to do well if they haven't had something to eat.

HEADLINE: A Deal Done in U.S. Style Dazes an Ex-Soviet State

 BODY:
This article is based on reporting by Barry Meier in New York and Raymond Bonner in Tbilisi, Georgia, and was written by Mr. Meier.
Three years ago, a fledgling New York company persuaded officials in the former Soviet republic of Georgia to give it an exclusive 25-year contract to erect an elaborate international telephone system that would bring the world a dial tone away. 
 What Georgia has received so far is a system that lets only six people call internationally at once. There are also stacks of telecommunications equipment sitting on the lawn of the nation's parliament building.
After the Georgian Government changed hands last year, officials there concluded that the Videotel Think Tank Corporation of Hempstead, L.I., was not up to the task. So they terminated the contract, which the company has valued at $45 million, they sued it for fraud and they opened talks with American Telephone and Telegraph and other companies.
 
Enlisting Help
 But Videotel, which denied any wrongdoing and blamed Georgia's civil war for its problems, was not ready to give up. The company, which is co-owned by a longtime political associate of Republican Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and a man with a criminal record, has unleashed a counterattack led by advocates ranging from Caspar Weinberger, the former Defense Secretary, to Harold M. Ickes, an adviser to President Clinton, and a prestigious New York Law firm.
As a result, in the midst of Georgia's war, the United States Ambassador to Georgia, Kent Brown, flew to the front last month to visit Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Georgia's leader, and asked him to restore the company's satellite link.
 
Favoritism Is Denied
 "We want to make sure that foreign markets are open to American companies and contracts are respected," said Strobe Talbott, Ambassador at Large to the former Soviet republics. He and other American Government officials insist that they took no special action on Videotel's behalf.
The dispute over Videotel, a tiny company of seven employees, which has never installed a public telephone system and has no profits or sizable office of its own, reflects the rough-and-tumble nature of doing business in former Communist countries.
Along with producing lawsuits worldwide, the fight has engulfed the World Bank. Last year, the bank described Videotel in a memo as a "bottleneck" to Georgia's future and indicated concerns about its exclusive telephone contract. But Videotel has since lobbied the bank to withhold a $40 million loan to upgrade Georgia's telephone service until officials there honor the company's pact.
"We are caught in a whirlwind between a company and a Government," said a World Bank official who insisted on not being identified. The loan, which could provide a bonanza to tiny Videotel, is still pending.
That a company like Videotel could muster such legal and lobbying barrage might appear surprising. But then, the owners of Videotel -- Easa Easa and Joseph L. Schwartz -- are unusual men.
 
The Partners
No Strangers To Controversy
 Until his retirement a year ago, Mr. Easa, 63, had served for 18 years as head of Nassau County's Regional Offtrack Betting Corporation, a political patronage plum with flexible hours and an annual salary of $139,000. A lawyer, Mr. Easa, who declined to be interviewed, is a longtime Republican leader in the town of West Hempstead and an old friend of Senator D'Amato.
Mr. Schwartz, a computer consultant, said in an interview that he met Mr. Easa in the late 1970's while developing data transmission networks for OTB operations. He said that Videotel was formed in 1988 to build computer networks, but changed gears after learning of Georgia's interest in a telephone system. The technologies used to transmit voice and data are similar, he said.
Neither of Videotel's owners is any stranger to controversy. In 1989, Mr. Easa, who is also a real estate developer, agreed to settle a complaint by the New York State Attorney General that he failed to give condominium buyers required disclosures about his business activities.
 
Problems With Checks
 Public records show that Mr. Schwartz, who is Videotel's chief executive, was indicted three times in New York City in 1974 on grand larcency charges involving accusations that he passed more than $300,000 in bad and forged checks.
In separate interviews with two reporters, Mr. Schwartz initially denied that he had a criminal record. But when confronted by court records, he said that he believed that the cases had been sealed and that he would never have to discuss them.
Mr. Schwartz, who pleaded guilty under an agreement to two indictments, said he served two months of a one-year prison sentence. "It was a long time ago and I was a fool," he said.
More recently, both Videotel and Georgian Intelcom, its joint venture with the Georgian Government, have had financial problems. Last month, as part of a lawsuit, Videotel agreed to pay $46,000 to IDB Communications Group Inc., of Culver City, Calif., for telecommunications equipment Videotel ordered in 1991.
Videotel stopped payment on a initial $25,000 check for the equipment after it was shipped, said Thomas McDermott, an attorney for IDB. For his part, Mr. Schwartz said the check was stopped because the order never reached Georgia. Others with claims pending against Videotel or its joint venture include Austrian Post, Telephone and Telegraph, which relays Georgian Intelcom's calls, and the Russian Satellite Communications Company, which carried those calls.
 
Georgia's Worry
Who Will Control A Vital Service?
 For Georgian officials, the issue is not simply money but regaining control over a basic service at favorable terms. Videotel's pact gives it 80 percent of any profits from Georgian Intelcom, which provides international phone, telegraph, fax and mail service. Videotel invested $240,000 in the venture and Georgia added $60,000. Five of the seven board seats went to Mr. Schwartz, Mr. Easa, their wives and Jack Easa, Mr. Easa's brother and law partner.
"This means that we had lost control of a strategic industry," said Nodar Kharatishvili, the First Deputy in the Georgian Ministry of Communication, which oversees phone service. As did Mr. Kharatishvili, Mr. Shevardnadze said he believed that bribery might have been involved.
"It is either ignorance, huge ignorance, or there is some dirt" Mr. Shevardnadze said in an interview.
Mr. Schwartz rejected such suggestions and said Georgian officials had broken the deal because Videotel would not bribe them. He also said the contract was fair because Videotel had assumed the project's risks. He also said Videotel had recently delivered equipment he estimated to be worth $1 million but Georgian officials had refused to install it.
"I feel like it is a place that is in chaos and everyone does what is best for them and not what is best for the country," Mr. Schwartz said.
 
Expression of Little Confidence
 Last year, when a World Bank team visited Georgia to lay the groundwork for the $40 million loan, it concluded that Videotel appeared to lack the experience and financial backing to fulfill it promises. And the team told Georgian officials to "consider as a matter of urgency their options for the future," according to a bank memo written in October 1992.
In March, the Georgian Government sued Videotel in Federal court in Hempstead, accusing the company of fraud, saying it delivered faulty equipment, siphoned off thousands of the joint venture's dollars to its own bank account and submitted phony invoices. Videotel, which denied the claims, responded with a breach-of-contract lawsuit against Georgia.
Videotel has also sued one of the Georgian Government's American lawyers, saying he had slandered Videotel, and has sued Deutsche Telekom, a German telephone company, contending that it had tried to steal the Georgian business. That case, which was decided against Videotel, is on appeal, Mr. Schwartz said. The suit against the lawyer, Paul Dietrich, is pending; Mr. Dietrich has denied any wrongdoing.
 
Influential Help
Applying Pressure In U.S. and Abroad
 The Park Avenue law firm of Rogers & Wells has represented Videotel, assigning Mr. Weinberger and several other lawyers to the matter. It has also hired Harold M. Ickes, an adviser to President Clinton, and Richard L. Armitage, who, until May, headed the State Department's humanitarian aid programs to the former Soviet republics.
The aim of Videotel was a simple one: to persuade the Georgian Government to restore its valuable contract. The effort's price tag to date is some $2 million in legal and lobbying costs, according to Mr. Schwartz.
United States Embassy officials in Georgia, who initally viewed the matter as a minor fracas, were among those caught in the crossfire. In a recent interview, Ambassador Kent Brown, who visited Mr. Shevardnadze last month on the battlefield, confirmed that he had received a letter about Videotel from Mr. Armitage, who now heads Armitage Associates, a consulting firm. Frederic C. Hof, a member of Mr. Armitage's firm, also contacted embassy officials enclosing letters from his boss to the Georgian leader.
Mr. Hof said Mr. Armitage's firm had not sought to lobby embassy officials. Mr. Ickes's office said he was traveling and unavailable to comment.
 
Getting a Senator's Ear
 The growing interest among Federal officials may also have been stimulated by a call from Easa Easa to Senator D'Amato. Mr. Easa told the Senator that the company's lawyers thought it would be helpful if State and Treasury Department officials were aware of Videotel's problems, according to Frank Coleman, a spokesman for Senator D'Amato.
It is not exactly clear what happened next. But in mid-August, Senator D'Amato wrote to both Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen thanking them for taking an interest in Videotel. Mr. Coleman said the letters were the only action taken by the Senator and were similar to those he would write for any constituent.
"The continuing efforts of this Administration in relation to this matter is very much appreciated," Senator D'Amato wrote.
 
Difficult Position
Loan Quandary For World Bank
 World Bank officials perhaps soon felt the greatest pressure because of the stakes involved with its loan. The $40 million loan is expected to greatly improve Georgia's antiquated domestic telephone service, benefiting Videotel if it retains exclusive international rights to the system.
Videotel's lawyers said they went to the World Bank because they believed that an initial $450,000 lent by the bank to Georgia was being improperly used to, among other things, finance that Government's lawsuit in the United States against Videotel.
The problem soon landed in the lap of Ernest Stern, the World Bank's acting president. On Aug. 12, Mr. Weinberger wrote to Mr. Stern, suggesting that if Georgia nullified Videotel's contract then the member of the bank's board from the Treasury Department would, under Federal law, be required to oppose any future loans to Georgia.
"I am sure that we can agree that Georgia's abrogation of a binding contract with an American company would have severe ramifications," Mr. Weinberger wrote on Aug. 12. Mr. Weinberger did not respond to requests for comment.
In late September, bank officials wrote to Mr. Shevardnadze stating that their position on Videotel's skills and future in Georgia was "neutral." But a bank executive, who insisted on remaining anonymous, said Videotel's lobbying had not influenced its position.
"We are not anti-Videotel," that official said. "It's just that the telecommunications' environment in Georgia would benefit from a more competitive approach."
Despite the warnings of Videotel's well-connected advocates, more competition is likely. Companies including A.T.& T. have recently agreed to nonexclusive contracts with the Georgian Government that will provide international phone service at far lower rates to consumers and bigger returns to the Government.
Mr. Schwartz has said that Videotel is open to negotiating with Georgian officials.
For his part, Mr. Shevardnadze said the company would have to operate without its exclusive contract.
All may not be lost for Videotel's owners, Mr. Easa and Mr. Schwartz. Should the Georgian Government have to buy out Videotel's contract, they could profit handsomely. While the two sides fight in court, Mr. Shevardnadze said that in deference to American officials, he had decided not to investigate the company.
"I did not want to create a scandal, because this company is associated with America and they are our great friend," Mr. Shevardnadze said.

HEADLINE: PITTSBURGH BANK IS BUYING DREYFUS FOR $1.85 BILLION

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
The Mellon Bank Corporation said yesterday that it would acquire the Dreyfus Corporation, the country's sixth-largest mutual fund company, for $1.85 billion in stock.
Like many big banks, Pittsburgh-based Mellon is trying to move away from the traditional business of taking deposits and making loans, which represents a declining share of the nation's financial activity. This year, for the first time, the nearly $2 trillion in mutual funds equals the amount on deposit at the nation's banks. 
 "Lending is a no-growth business," said Livia S. Asher, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "If you look at demographics, what's growing is managing money for the aging population."
 
Banks Have Started Funds
 Many large banks have started mutual funds to lure customers discouraged by the low interest rates earned on savings accounts and money market funds. But Mellon, which is paying a steep price for Dreyfus, is being more aggressive than most. Other banks, including Chase Manhattan, have bought smaller mutual fund companies to add to their product lines. And some, like Nationsbank, have formed joint ventures with securities companies.
But no other bank company has more than $20 billion in mutual fund assets under management. Dreyfus manages $80 billion in more than 130 mutual funds. The PNC Bank Corporation, also of Pittsburgh, will be a distant second in mutual fund assets under management, with $18.8 billion.
Frank V. Cahouet, Mellon's chairman, said he hoped that after the acquisition, 60 percent of Mellon's $3 billion in revenue would come from fees rather than from interest payments on loans. That compares with less than one-third at most banks.
Mellon already manages $135 billion in assets, mostly in the form of pension funds. Last year, it bought the Boston Company, which provides administrative services to mutual funds, from American Express for $1.45 billion in cash and stock. And Mellon has also recently acquired more than $8 billion in mortgage portfolios and a finance company.
 
Industry Is Called 'Mature'
 "The pure banking industry is mature and undergoing consolidation, yet the rest of the financial services industry is growing rapidly," Mr. Cahouet said.
While Depression-era laws are meant to keep banks out of the securities business, regulators have allowed them to use a legal loophole to offer their own mutual funds.
For its part, Dreyfus has been a leader in money market funds but has been slow to tap into the explosive growth of stock funds. It is one of the few mutual fund companies whose assets have declined in recent years. Moreover, Howard Stein, Dreyfus's chairman, is 67, which may be a reason why he decided to sell now.
The move by banks into mutual funds is in some ways reminiscent of the trend a decade ago to create "financial supermarkets," when companies like American Express, Prudential Insurance and Sears, Roebuck bought brokerage firms. Those deals generally did not produce the synergies their sponsors hoped for.
Mellon and Dreyfus executives did speak of offering credit cards and mortgages to Dreyfus customers and selling Dreyfus funds in Mellon branches. Nonetheless, in many ways this transaction is aimed less at synergies and is more an effort by Mellon to diversify away from banking.
Executives of the two companies predicted little in the way of efficiencies from the merger. Dreyfus has contracts with the Bank of New York and First Data Resources to provide custody and administrative services for its funds. It will be several years before those functions can be moved into Mellon operations.
"Both organizatons are growing and we can hold costs flat and grow revenues," Mr. Cahouet said.
Mellon approached Dreyfus with a merger proposal four or five months ago, and entered intense negotiations last month. On Nov. 11, however, Dreyfus cut off the discussion, largely because its management was concerned about how much autonomy it would have after the merger. Last week, Mr. Cahouet met with Mr. Stein, who was on vacation in California, and reassured him that Dreyfus management would remain largely independent. The deal was struck last Friday and announced yesterday morning.
 
Mellon Stock Falls
 Mellon estimated that its earnings per share would be reduced 9 percent next year and that the transaction would not increase earnings per share until 1996. Many investors were skeptical that the company would be able to meet even those projections. Mellon's stock yesterday closed down $2.375, at $53, while Dreyfus's shares gained $1.875, to $46.375.
"The market will need a lot more confidence that they can find the cost savings and revenue enhancements," said Joseph Duwan of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a brokerage firm that specializes in banks.
An unusual feature of the transaction is that Dreyfus has accumulated $750 million in cash, which will be added to Mellon's capital. The bank said that its financial projections require that it earn an 11 percent return on that capital, a level that struck many analysts as high.
"A conservative figure would be half that," said Ms. Asher of Merrill Lynch. Nonetheless, Ms. Asher said the overall deal should produce an average return for Mellon. "It's not a home run, but it doesn't destroy their value," she said.
Moreover, many analysts praised Mellon's effort to expand out of traditional lending. "Ten years ago, Mellon was mainly a corporate lender," Ms. Asher said. "Mellon has made great strides in moving away from traditional banking."
The transaction involves some fancy legal footwork, because the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act prohibits banks from sponsoring a mutual fund. But since banks can choose investments, sell funds and provide computer support to funds, all Mellon will have to do is use an independent company yet to be chosen to provide the largely ceremonial function of sponsoring the funds. Banks typically pay one-tenth of 1 percent to one-fifth of 1 percent of the funds' assets a year to the firm that acts as a sponsor.
Federal regulators generally accept banks' entry into the mutual fund business, but have grown increasingly concerned that bank customers may not fully understand the risks of the funds in which they invest and may think that the funds are insured by the Federal Government, which they are not.
To meet these concerns, Mellon expects to propose a strict code of conduct for its sales activities.
The acquisition is expected to have little effect on Dreyfus or Mellon customers, other than to fill their mailboxes with more financial offers. Mellon already offers its own family of funds in its 450 branches.

HEADLINE: Zuckerman Is Given Deadline of 90 Days To Deal for Coliseum

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins joined with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday in giving the developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman 90 days to close on his deal to buy and build on the New York Coliseum site at Columbus Circle or forfeit his $33.8 million down payment.
City officials said the move was an attempt to prompt serious negotiations for a development there, though not necessarily one as large or as expensive as the contract specifies. Under the 1989 contract, Mr. Zuckerman is required to pay $338 million for the site and build a 2.1 million-square-foot office and retail complex. 
 An aide to Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani criticized Mr. Dinkins for trying to force Mr. Zuckerman's hand in the waning days of the Mayor's term. Although Mr. Giuliani will be unable to stop the 90-day clock, his administration will take over before the 90-day limit runs out and, therefore, may be able to negotiate with Mr. Zuckerman over the project.
The Mayor-elect may be more favorably inclined to accommodate the developer, as Mr. Zuckerman's newspaper, The Daily News, endorsed Mr. Giuliani in the mayoral race.
Mr. Dinkins's move was the latest in a brewing feud with Mr. Giuliani on the Mayor's attempts to wrap up major pieces of unfinished city business in the last weeks of his term.
"It is another needless irritant," said Richard Breyers, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani, "and an example of decisions that bind our options. We would have rather that negotiations continue than put a 90-day time clock on the discussions."
For more than a year, the Dinkins administration has had the ability to force Mr. Zuckerman's hand on the matter, as the transportation authority has tried to do since the last legal obstacle to the project was removed in September 1992. But until Mr. Dinkins lost the mayoral race, he had argued for continued negotiations with Mr. Zuckerman.
Yesterday, in announcing the 90-day closing notice, Mr. Dinkins said he now agreed with the M.T.A. that the 90-day deadline was the best way to force serious negotiations. Dinkins administration officials denied that the move was an act of retribution because of the Daily News endorsement of Mr. Giuliani.
 
Refers to Revised Plan
 Mr. Zuckerman, speaking from Washington, said he would meet with lawyers to review the closing notice and assess its implications. In recent weeks his partner, Edward Linde, has said that a closing notice would surely lead to a lawsuit by the company so that Mr. Zuckerman would not lose his deposit.
"We are ready to build a development at Columbus Circle that is consistent with the revised plan," said Mr. Zuckerman, referring to yet another revision on his original design that he submitted to the M.T.A. on Nov. 30 in an effort to put off the closing notice.
The new design calls for the project to be much smaller than under the original contract. It would preserve the existing office tower at 10 Columbus Circle and would replace the coliseum itself with about one million square feet of office and retail space.
Without rejecting the latest design proposal outright, the transportation authority and the Economic Development Corporation, which is negotiating on behalf of the city, said the plan did not offer a price for the property and did not give a development timetable.
Under the 1989 contract with the city, Mr. Zuckerman's company, Boston Properties, agreed with the M.T.A. to build a 2.1 million-square-foot complex at the site near the southwest corner of Central Park. But for nearly a year Mr. Zuckerman has maintained that the project was no longer feasible because of the city's depressed real-estate market.
 
Modified Plan Possible
 Both city officials and M.T.A. representatives have acknowledged that the coliseum site is probably no longer worth its original $338 million price tag. Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said it was entirely possible that Boston Properties could present a modified plan that would be acceptable to all parties.
When asked whether Mr. Dinkins was exacting revenge upon Mr. Zuckerman in joining the M.T.A. in issuing the closing notice, Mr. Sullivan said: "We never talked about that. We talked about how to get the site developed."
The closing notice, hand delivered yesterday to the New York offices of Boston Properties, was issued just hours after the M.T.A. and the Dinkins administration reached an agreement that would make the city equal partners in long-term plans for the site. The agreement means that if Mr. Zuckerman fails to close, the city still stands to make millions from the site.
If Mr. Zuckerman does close on the current contract, half the $338 million would be redirected by the city to the M.T.A. for mass-transit improvements, with the balance going to the transportation agency over five years. The agreement also establishes a timetable for discussions among the M.T.A., Boston Properties and the city to try to decide whether an alternative to the existing plan is possible.
Should Boston Properties not close during the 90 days and Mr. Zuckerman is forced to forfeit his $33.8 million down payment, the money would go to the city and then be redirected to the M.T.A. over two years. Moreover, the city would benefit from any revenues the M.T.A. gets from the site, including revenues from the office space, garage and coliseum itself. This income would come after the M.T.A. breaks even on its operating expenses.
Also, Mr. Dinkins yesterday committed $750,000 of city funds for improvements to the coliseum plaza. This amount would be matched by the M.T.A.
Mr. Zuckerman was first named developer of the coliseum site in September 1985. But almost from the moment he unveiled his plans for the 3.4-acre property, the city was hit with a barrage of lawsuits over the plan. Neighborhood residents, environmentalists and others argued that it was too big, and delayed the project through a series of lawsuits.
In 1987 Mr. Zuckerman lost his main office tenant and partner when Salomon Brothers backed out. But the last legal obstacle to the project was put aside in September 1992 when a Federal Appeals Court said the development would not violate Federal Clean Air rules.

1985: Mortimer B. Zuckerman agrees to build a 2.9 million square foot project at Columbus Circle on the site of the Coliseum, owned by Metropolitan Transportation Authority that would include housing and retail spece.
 
1988: Mr. Zuckerman, scales down the plan with shorter, thinner towers that will be 500,000 square feet less thatn the original proposal.
 
1989: A redesign of the project leads to a contract between the M.T.A. and Mr. Zuckerman that calls for 2.1 million square feet of space.
 
1993: On Nov. 30, Mr. Zuckerman submits a new proposal that cuts the amount of space to about one million square feet and preserves the existing office building. The Coliseum would be demolished.

Cray Research Does Poorly In Computer Sales to Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Cray Research Inc., America's largest supercomputer company, has fared poorly in recent supercomputer procurements by Japan's Government.
"Cray has sort of been blown out of the water," said Raul Mendez, president of International Systems Research, a supercomputer consulting firm in Tokyo. He said Japanese companies had "bid incredibly low." 
 Japan's Government is now buying 11 supercomputers as part of an effort to stimulate the nation's slumping economy through increased public spending. The United States Government, which has complained that Japanese Government procurements are not fair, has said it is watching the bidding very carefully.
Already seven of the 11 contracts have been announced, and three of the winning machines are American-made. But the results show a pattern that Washington has expressed disapproval of in the past, in which American machines are bought only when there is no Japanese competition.
Cray won one contract for its C-90 machine in which it was the only bidder. The two other American computers were selected in cases that specified massively parallel processing, a new technology in which Japanese companies barely compete.
 
Japanese Bids Win
 But in four cases in which Cray's conventional supercomputers competed directly against Japanese machines, Fujitsu won three times and Hitachi Ltd. once.
Tak Kato, manager of strategic marketing for Cray's Japanese subsidiary, said the Japanese companies had been "cutting their prices very substantially."
Mr. Kato said that Tsukuba University, for instance, had budgeted four billion yen, or about $37 million, for its procurement, but Fujitsu won with an offer of less than two billion yen. A similar pattern occurred in the bidding for the Angstrom Technology Partnership, a Government-affiliated research project, he said. Cray, however, has not lodged any complaints about the procurements.
Fujitsu officials said they were not allowed to discuss their prices, since that information could be disclosed only by the buyer. But they insisted the company competed fairly and won because of the innovative design of its VPP-500 computer, which combines aspects of parallel processing with a more conventional technique known as vector processing.
Since a 1990 supercomputer trade agreement was signed by the United States and Japan, American companies have won three bids out of 15 from Japan's Government, not counting the latest procurements. But all the victories were uncontested.
Still, the NEC Corporation, one of Japan's three supercomputer companies, has fared even worse than Cray, winning no bids so far. And American companies are virtually guaranteed several sales of massively parallel machines, in which hundreds or thousands of processors work on a problem together to increase speed.
 
No Competing Bids
 An agricultural research institute is buying a computer sold by the Digital Equipment Corporation and designed by the Maspar Computer Corporation. The institute required software that was available only on the Digital Equipment machine, so there were no competing bids.
The third winning American machine is made by the Thinking Machines Corporation.
Japanese officials have long complained that the American supercomputer market is closed. Indeed, the United States Government has never bought a Japanese supercomputer.

HEADLINE: Premier of Haiti Is Seeking Talks To End Impasse

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Groping for a way out of the political impasse that has resulted in crippling sanctions on his country, the Prime Minister of the Government of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide today invited representatives of a cross section of Haiti's society to a new round of negotiations intended to restore democratic rule.
But the Prime Minister, Robert Malval, said that he has yet to receive any assurances from Haiti's military leaders that they will send representatives to this new conference or abide by its decisions. Indeed, Mr. Malval said he did not sense in the country's military leaders a new willingness to compromise on the return of Father Aristide, the exiled president. 
 Mr. Malval also said that he has agreed to stay on in an acting capacity after his resignation, which he announced last week, takes effect on Dec. 15. That news produced a flicker of optimism from Clinton Administration officials, who have been stymied in their efforts to find some way of breaking the impasse. The Administration had worried that if Mr. Malval left office, the Government of Haiti would be left entirely in the hands of the military, which ousted Father Aristide in 1991.
Mr. Malval and Father Aristide later met with President Clinton in the White House, where the President expressed his relief that the Prime Minister had decided to stay on.
 
More Flexibility
 One knowledgeable Administration official said that Mr. Malval's resignation was also intended to free him from the sway of President Aristide in order to be more flexible in negotiations with military leaders.
Having moved from Prime Minister to Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Malval is technically no longer an Aristide appointee and therefore feels that he could take more of an initiative to propose solutions in talks with military leaders.
State Department officials say that Mr. Malval's threat to resign has also frightened elements of Haiti's upper class and provided the impetus for the new round of talks.
At a news conference today, Mr. Malval stressed that the new talks would be held to carry out an accord worked out during the summer on Governors Island in New York. The agreement is aimed at restoring Father Aristide to power. The Prime Minister said he would not engage in any rewriting of the agreements.
 
'End of the Rope'
 Mr. Malval, who has been in the United States since last week, said that "everybody is becoming increasingly conscious that we have reached the end of the rope," and that he hopes that "we can sit and try to find an acceptable way out of the crisis for all the parties involved."
Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, is reeling under the weight of United Nations-imposed economic sanctions that are intended to force the military leadership to hand over power to Father Aristide. In the Governors Island accord, Haiti's military leaders pledged to accept Father Aristide's return. But they have since reneged on that pledge, prompting the imposition of the trade embargo.
"All we know is that the country is desperate," Mr. Malval said. "The country is bankrupt. The central bank has no exchange, no reserves. The country will soon be out of oil, and more important, the country will have no more hope to go on."

HEADLINE: On Congress's Home Front, Faith That All Politics Is Indeed Local

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: MELBOURNE, Fla. Dec. 5

 BODY:
The Congressman knocked at the door of Everett Quint, a 64-year-old retired cabinetmaker.
Mr. Quint peered through the crack and immediately recognized Representative Jim Bacchus. "I know how you voted on Nafta!" Mr. Quint growled. 
 "I think you'll think about it differently a year from now," Mr. Bacchus said with a smile.
"I don't think so," Mr. Quint snapped back.
Welcome to the other side of Congress, the home front far from the marble stairways and ornate caucus rooms where legislative deals are struck. After adjourning in a blaze of headlines last month, most representatives headed home, not for a break but to plunge into the kind of meat-and-potatoes service to constituents that often has more to do with a lawmaker's political success or failure than a vote on a highly contentious bill.
 
'Citizen Saturday'
 On Saturday, Mr. Bacchus, a Democrat and an earnest man who neither smokes nor drinks nor plays sports, gathered up a dozen supporters for a visit to Sherwood Forest, a sun-splashed neighborhood in this conservative, largely Republican city on Florida's Space Coast. They were on a food drive for a local soup kitchen and homeless shelter. On other of Mr. Bacchus's "Citizen Saturdays," he and his group have built ramps for the disabled to watch liftoffs at the Kennedy Space Center and marched for breast cancer research.
Many officeholders count on local actions, like cutting through red tape for a veteran or interceding with the Small Business Administration on behalf of a local company, to heal wounds caused by the larger issues in Washington.
This is particularly true for Mr. Bacchus, a second-term Congressman who supported President Clinton on the budget and the North American Free Trade Agreement despite overwhelming mail and phone calls urging him to vote the other way.
 
One by One
 "The campaign never ends," said the 44-year-old Congressman, who came to politics as a political reporter for the Orlando Sentinel. "I'm in the district in which Bill Clinton got the lowest percentage of the vote of any Democrat in Congress. I win by reaching out to people one by one, through relentless retail politics."
In other words, Mr. Bacchus is betting his congressional career on the adage that all politics is local.
Mr. Bacchus won re-election in 1992 by a mere 3,555 votes out of 161,300 cast even though he had spent three times more on his campaign than his Republican opponent. Local Republicans and supporters of Ross Perot say they will not let Mr. Bacchus escape from their cross hairs next time, and they hope Mr. Bacchus's vote in support of the free trade agreement will drain him of at least some of the campaign money donated by big labor.
"There's not much chance at all he will be re-elected," predicted Dennis Walter, district director of Mr. Perot's party, United We Stand America, noting that Mr. Perot won 26 percent of the vote here in the 1992 Presidential election, his largest share in any Florida district. "The 100 or so members I've spoken to in the last two weeks are very upset with him."
But Mr. Bacchus carries on.
A nonpolitician might have desisted politely after Mr. Quint's less-than-hearty welcome. But Mr. Bacchus is a schmoozer, and before long the two headed for the garage, where Mr. Quint showed off three antique automobiles that he is sanding down and patching into shape.
Mr. Quint did not bend on the trade agreement, but his wife filled two bags with corn flakes, bread and cans of fruit cocktail for the food drive. The Congressman thanked the couple and told them to call him whenever they needed help.
Down the street, Mr. Bacchus encountered Dick Rivers, a retired Air Force officer, who was angry about the Clinton Administration's handling of the United Nations-sponsored relief mission in Somalia. Mr. Rivers complained that his son, an Army platoon sergeant stationed in Mogadishu, gets only one hot meal a day and must sleep in his armored personnel carrier while, Mr. Rivers believes, the Somalis are being catered to.
"It's a waste of money," Mr. Rivers concluded.
Mr. Bacchus nodded sympathetically and pledged to make inquiries about the son's living conditions. An aide immediately followed up on the conversation and learned that Mr. Rivers was also having trouble with the Veterans Administration, which he said owed him a payment for a costly prescription. The aide promised he would do what he could.
 
Voter 'Heartburn'
 Political opponents deride such efforts as meaningless political gimmickry.
"It's all part of the media perception he is trying to produce that shows him as a neighbor who thinks like you and acts like you," said William R. Tolley, a business consultant who lost to Mr. Bacchus in the last two elections and is favored to win the Republican nomination again. "It has some impact, but it doesn't affect the heartburn of voters upset about his votes on Nafta and the budget."
Mr. Bacchus countered that he voted for the trade agreement because it would create many jobs for the high-tech manufacturing industries like the Harris Corporation that are situated in his district. And, he said, side agreements that he insisted on will protect citrus and vegetable growers in the area from surges in Mexican imports.
Mr. Bacchus said he was convinced that a strengthening economy would soften the anger and that constituents would remember him for his community services, his strong support of the NASA space station and his successful efforts to win financing for a new veterans hospital.
"I'll win my usual 51-point landslide," he predicted with a faint smile.
During two days traveling up and down his Atlantic coastal district, Mr. Bacchus also sponsored a jobs workshop that brought together business people and local and Federal officials, visited the home of a family whose son is recovering from brain surgery and needs Social Security disability assistance, and met with a local space contractor seeking to qualify for a $17 million contract for minority-owned businesses.
While executives from the contractor, Analex Space Systems, looked on, Mr. Bacchus called the Small Business Administration's Congressional liaison in Washington to ask for expeditious consideration of the company's bid. As he left the office, the Congressman asked the company's executives to let their employees know of his effort.
Between stops, Mr. Bacchus worked his car phone to nudge the Federal Aviation Administration to remove a huge radar station that his constituents around Patrick Air Force Base believe is the cause of a recent upsurge in cancer cases.
The Congressman then called to thank David Hinson, the administrator of the aviation agency, for agreeing to move the radar station in November 1995 -- and to ask that the date be moved up at least a year.
When Mr. Hinson agreed to look into the matter, Mr. Bacchus asked if he would mind if he told reporters about the conversation.
Mr. Hinson saw no problem.
"Anytime I can do anything for the F.A.A., let me know," the appreciative Congressman said. "I'm on the Science Committee."
As he hung up the phone, Mr. Bacchus mused, "I wouldn't mind if it were moved before the election."

HEADLINE: Venezuela Victor: Will Vows Be Kept?

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 6

 BODY:
On the campaign trail, Rafael Caldera promised that gasoline prices would remain frozen at 22 cents a gallon, that a new national sales tax would be abolished, and that the deficit would be cut by asking foreign creditor banks for a break.
At the same time, Mr. Caldera's economic advisers quietly traveled to the United States and tried to reassure foreign business executives that the 77-year-old presidential candidate was just saying these things to get elected. 
 On Sunday, Mr. Caldera won a tight four-way race for the presidency. Now, many Venezuelans are wondering whether his campaign promises mean anything, knowing that the country has been shaken by two coup attempts and a presidential resignation over the last two years, and that any false steps by Mr. Caldera could renew political instability and cause inflation to leap above its current annual level of 45 percent.
The stakes for the United States are also clear. A coup would reintroduce military rule to South America, a continent that is now entirely governed by elected civilian presidents. Political chaos could choke the flow of oil from Venezuela, the United States' second largest source of imported oil after Saudi Arabia.
 
Political Agility Needed
 Elected with only 30 percent of the vote and facing a Congress split among five factions, Mr. Caldera will have to display political agility to guide Venezuela successfully over the next five years. Despite his appeals for "national understanding" during the campaign, the President-elect called his defeated opponents "immature" on Sunday night and proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow him to dissolve Congress "when it does not carry out the will of the people."
To his opponents, Mr. Caldera, who started his political career when Franklin D. Roosevelt was in his second term in the White House, is an aging, closed-minded autocrat.
"Caldera is mentally stuck 25 years back, to the time when he was President," said Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, the presidential candidate for the Copei party. "He will be a disaster for the country."
But for many people in Venezuela, where 75 percent of the population is under 35 years, Mr. Caldera is a reassuring grandfatherly figure who exudes experience and moral bearing. Unlike his predecessor, Carlos Andres Perez, who resigned in May because of a corruption scandal, Mr. Caldera has a reputation for personal honesty and he attends Roman Catholic Mass every Sunday.
Unlike his two predecessors, who openly lived with their mistresses, Mr. Caldera has been married to Alicia Pietri de Caldera for the last half century. On Sunday night, the platform at his victory party was crowded with most of his six children and 10 grandchildren.
 
Pragmatic Approach Predicted
 Mr. Caldera has run for the presidency six times, winning only twice, on Sunday and in 1968. A founder of the Copei Party in 1946, Mr. Caldera deserted it this year when it refused to nominate him. Running as an independent, he forged a diverse coalition of 17 small parties ranging from Communists to those who long for Venezuela's right-wing military Government of the 1950's.
To critics worried about Mr. Caldera's free-spending, populist reputation, his supporters cite his presidency in the early 1970's as a time of balanced budgets when oil was selling for $2 a barrel.
"Caldera has got a lot of double talk," Andres Duarte Vivas, the president of a trading company, said here today. "But circumstance will dictate that he take a very pragmatic approach. On privatization and economic reform, he is not going to backtrack."
Fernando Egana, an aide to Mr. Caldera, insisted in a recent interview that "the record of Caldera is completely opposed to the statist, populist image."
But with new foreign investment running at about half of last year's levels, business people appear to be waiting for clearer signals on Venezuela's future economic path.
 
Market Changes Attacked
 The campaign oratory was not very assuring to the business community. Attacking the free-market changes of his predecessor, Mr. Caldera promised to slow privatization, to scrutinize future foreign investment in energy areas and to cut the ballooning budget deficit through austerity, improved tax collection and renegotiation of the foreign debt. Budget austerity, he hastened to add, would not go so far as cutting state payrolls or salaries.
"I am against this epidemic of privatizations by people who consider that everything will be resolved by selling everything that we have," the President-elect said at a news conference today. Mr. Caldera, a lawyer by training, added that slumping world oil prices gave Venezuela "legal grounds" to renegotiate its foreign debt.
Currently, 23 percent of the $22 billion national budget goes for servicing the country's $27 billion foreign debt. But according to a Finance Ministry study, most of the debt is in the form of bonds, leaving only 10 percent of the debt subject to renegotiation.

HEADLINE: Guguletu Journal;
A Brutalized Generation Turns Its Rage on Whites

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUGULETU, South Africa, Dec. 2

 BODY:
"I can leave you here and go away and come back just now," Victor Mdekazi told a white guest in this black township. "When I come back I will find you so-o-o-o much in blood."
He sat in a parked car around the corner from the gas station where Amy Biehl, an American Fulbright scholar, was slashed to death in August by a taunting mob of young men for being a white in the wrong place. 
 Mr. Mdekazi, 18 years old and an organizer for a black nationalist student organization, intended no threat, merely basic instruction in an unpredictable factor of South African politics: the temper of the country's marginalized young blacks.
They are, to judge from a day among them in Guguletu, spirits calloused by apartheid and resistance. They scorn deals made in their name at negotiating tables. They anticipate the nation's first free elections either with bottomless cynicism, or with fantastic expectations. Even their leaders wonder if they can be led.
 
An Education in Hatred
 "We've got to be realistic and honest here," said Tsietsi Telite, the chairman of the Pan Africanist Student Organization, which comes closest to speaking for the hardened core of the generation. "That hatred, you grow up, it develops within you. It needs much political education to give it direction."
Since the killing of the American woman, Guguletu, an otherwise unexceptional black settlement foundering in the ocean of destitution that laps at the edge of idyllic Cape Town, has accepted its new notoriety without apology.
For local militants, the trial of seven local youngsters -- two of whom were freed after a witness said he was too terrified to testify -- has become an opportunity to demonstrate rejection of white authority.
They journey to the trial in downtown Cape Town, war-dancing outside the hedge of razor wire the police have put up for security, chanting "One settler, one bullet," hissing "Settler!" at white journalists who pass by, laughing from the public gallery as the witnesses testify.
The consensus among these young people is that Amy Biehl was at fault for coming where she was not wanted, and that the white courts have no right to judge the accused.
 
A Familiar Story
 The death is now part of the community lore. Residents call the slain woman Amy. Without being asked they will point out the spot where she was killed.
"It's the whole country, it's not only the few children," said Wowo Nofemela, 47, whose 22-year-old son, Mzikhona, is one of those on trial. "The environment is not right."
Guguletu's bleak environment has rapidly deteriorated under the migration of rural poor seeking work. The original dreary blocks of tiny homes have been swamped by squatter shacks, muddy warrens of smoke-stained sheds.
To Mr. Nofomela, a groundskeeper, the miracle is that Mzikhona is the first of his six children to get in trouble. They grew up without playgrounds, often without shoes. Four are now adults, and jobless.
For all his suffering, though, Mr. Nofomela defers to whites; his children do not.
 
'They Have Power'
 "Our parents, they are cowards for the Boer," said Linda Mayekiso, 21, the girlfriend of Mzikhona Nofomela and, like the arrested man, an ardent Pan Africanist. "The youth are not scared, and they have power."
Besides, she said, the adults had jobs to lose, however poor. The young have nothing to lose, even prospects.
The militant leaders who provide the political vocabulary for the anger say they discourage racial hatred by delicately avoiding the word "white" and describing the enemy as "settlers," or "oppressors." But they concede that such distinctions are often lost on the streets.
"You see a car of white people," said Simphewe Mfengu, 19. "You can't define, is it an American or what, is it an oppressor or what?"
Victor Mdekazi added, "There are people living in squatter camps, even if Joe Slovo can go to that squatter camp they will kill him." Mr. Slovo is the chairman of the Communist Party, an anti-apartheid champion so revered that many squatter camps are named for him.
As the apartheid barriers erode, familiarity seems to breed only more resentment.
Vusumzi Noge, an 11th grader who transferred this year to a newly integrated school in the prosperous white suburb of Mowbray, said he was heartbroken and wrathful to see the libraries and laboratories unimaginable in Guguletu. To the snubs of white students, he responded with steely defiance.
"I don't care," he said. "Because it's not their land, it's our land. It's all our land."
Among the angry young, the the scheduling of the first free elections has not diminished the bitterness.
 
Will Disillusion Set In?
 Some expect a quick and chilling disillusionment.
"It's going to get worse, because each and everybody, they have got visions," said Martha Holobo, 23, who runs a fruit stall at the edge of one of the squatter camps. "People think freedom means they will all move to the rich houses in Mowbray, and the whites in Mowbray will move here."
Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, has sought to dampen dreams of sudden economic equality. The Pan Africanists encourage such hopes as a birthright.
Whatever support these young blacks offer to a new president and his government, they say, will be conditional.
"As long as it's an African, we are going to respect him," Linda Mayekiso said. "As long as he delivers the goods."

HEADLINE: Woman Is Penn President; The First in the Ivy League

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Judith Rodin, the provost of Yale University, has been chosen president of the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the first woman to head an Ivy League institution.
Dr. Rodin, 49, a behavioral psychologist who is a Philadelphia native and a Penn alumna, will assume the post next June and face a number of problems, including a relatively low endowment, the need for academic consolidation and issues of racial strife and free speech. 
 As provost of Yale, Dr. Rodin was a candidate for the Yale presidency after the resignation of Benno C. Schmidt Jr. She led the university during the difficult year after Mr. Schmidt resigned, instituting a system to reduce the budget deficit and calming the faculty members and students, who were concerned about cutbacks and layoffs.
 
'I'll Be Watched'
 Speaking by telephone from Philadelphia, Dr. Rodin said "the Ivy League's having a woman at the highest level is symbolic."
"I understand I'll be watched," she said.
While Yale and Penn both have had women as acting presidents, the appointment of Dr. Rodin is the first in the Ivy League, which comprises Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn, Princeton and Yale. Among the women at the highest level in major academic institutions are W. Ann Reynolds, chancellor of the City University of New York; Nannerl H. Keohane, who was installed as president of Duke University this fall, and Katherine Lyall, the president of the University of Wisconsin.
Dr. Rodin said her vision was "to make Pennsylvania a leading institution and a great university with a truly international perspective."
She will succeed Claire Fagin, the nursing department chairwoman who has been Penn's acting president since the resignation of Sheldon Hackney last June. Mr. Hackney is now chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
 
'Exciting and Dynamic'
 Last fall, Dr. Fagin asked not to be considered as a candidate for the job; instead, she announced that she would lead the university during the search for a president and then return to teaching.
Alvin Shoemaker, chairman of the search committee and chairman of the board of trustees, said his committee interviewed more than 60 people and found Dr. Rodin "the most exciting and dynamic" of all the candidates. He said the search committee was particularly pleased at Dr. Rodin's connections to Philadelphia, where her mother still lives, and to Penn, where she received her bachelor's degree in 1966. She received her Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1970.
"We haven't had one of our graduates serve as president in about 50 years," Mr. Shoemaker said.
As to her ability to deal with a relatively low endowment, $1.35 billion, Mr. Shoemaker said that recent efforts to raise money had paid off and that "her main job will be to keep the momentum going." (By comparison, Harvard University's endowment is $5.8 billion, the largest in the Ivy League.)
Another challenge that Dr. Rodin faces is academic consolidation. Last October, to cope with relatively low income from its endowment, the university's School of Arts and Sciences eliminated religious studies, civilization and regional economic science departments, shifted the astronomy department into physics and brought in outside administrators to overhaul the Slavic languages department. Many faculty members were distressed by the action.
Mr. Shoemaker said he thought Dr. Rodin's experience at Yale would help her deal with these and other problems. Trouble developed at Yale last year after Mr. Schmidt announced a plan to close a budget gap by cutting nearly 11 percent of the faculty members of arts and sciences and by cutting programs and departments. The faculty members and students rebelled, leading to Mr. Schmidt's departure.
Richard Levin, the new Yale president, said yesterday, "Thanks to her skillful leadership, the faculty was quite satisfied with the outcome of restructuring."
Dr. Rodin said: "The actual change at Yale was carried out by me. We engaged the faculty. With the necessary discussion and participation, they can be made to feel good about consolidation even if the outcome is difficult and results in a closed department."
 
Problem of Racial Tension
 At Penn, Dr. Rodin will also face problems arising from campus racial tension and the issue of free speech.
In one incident last year, a white student called five blacks students "water buffaloes" after they refused to break up a party in front of his dormitory. The blacks students complained to a university panel that he used the word "black" in his remark; he denied this.
In a second incident, a group of students organized by the Black Student League destroyed about 14,000 copies of The Daily Pennsylvanian, a student-run newspaper. The black students said they were protesting what they believed to be a racist slant of the newspaper.
In the first case, the complaint was eventually withdrawn, and in the second, university officials dismissed disciplinary proceedings against the black students.
Nevertheless, Mr. Hackney, who was then president, was widely criticized for the university's code regulating offensive speech and for his handling of the two incidents.
Last month, Dr. Fagin rescinded the speech code as unworkable and appointed a commission, composed of faculty, students and trustees, to recommend how to handle the matter to the new president.
Dr. Rodin joined the psychology department of Yale in 1972, became chairwoman of the department in 1989 and was appointed in 1991 by Mr. Schmidt as the dean of the graduate school. Less than a year later, after the provost quit in the midst of the faculty revolt, Mr. Schmidt promoted her to provost.
As a behavioral psychologist, Dr. Rodin did research on eating disorders, establishing a link between a mother's behavior and the daughter's. She also has studied obesity and jealousy.

HEADLINE: IN NOTING ABSENCE, A.M.A. SEES A SNUB

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Struggling to quell a revolt within their ranks, leaders of the American Medical Association criticized the Clinton Administration today for not sending any high-ranking officials to their convention here to defend the President's plan to overhaul the nation's health care system.
The association supports Mr. Clinton's goal of guaranteeing health insurance coverage for all Americans. But with many elements of the Clinton plan coming under fire from doctors, there was no one here to speak for the White House, to rebut the critics or to defend the President's proposal to require all employers to provide insurance for their employees. 
 Doctors said that the absence of high-ranking Administration officials was notable because the position of the association itself was in flux, and that there was a lot of misinformation circulating about the President's plan. Moreover, officials of the association said that they told the White House last week that they expected a groundswell of opposition to parts of the Clinton plan, and that they suggested that the President or his aides hold a meeting for doctors here to allay their concerns.
 
Some See Signs of Drift
 Hillary Rodham Clinton got an enthusiastic reception when she spoke to the medical association six months ago in Chicago. But since then, the White House seems to have lost political control of the health care issue, and Democrats in Congress say they detect ominous signs of drift in the Administration's campaign. Rival proposals to revamp the health care system are being taken more seriously. And the White House, after searching for several months, has still not named anyone to coordinate efforts by the Administration and its allies to secure passage of comprehensive health care legislation.
"We blocked out time for a discussion of health care reform this afternoon, in case there was some senior official from the Administration, but that just did not materialize," said Dr. Daniel H. Johnson Jr., speaker of the house of delegates of the medical association, the group's policy-making body.
Dr. Joycelyn Elders, the Surgeon General, has a seat in the house of delegates by virtue of her Government position. But she is not here. By contrast, Dr. C. Everett Koop used to attend regularly when he was Surgeon General in the Reagan Administration.
The highest-ranking Administration official in attendance at the association's convention here was Dr. Philip R. Lee, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, who flew in for the day on Saturday to discuss the training of doctors. But the debate today involved bigger questions about the political and economic feasibility of the Clinton plan.
 
Clinton Aides 'Booked Up'
 The association has more than 290,000 members, accounting for nearly half of the nation's doctors, and runs an influential, well-financed lobbying operation in Washington. The house of delegates includes doctors from every state and from more than 80 medical specialty societies.
In Washington, Jeffrey L. Eller, a White House spokesman, said today that the President, Mrs. Clinton and their aides were "booked up" and did not have time to attend the association's convention. But he said the Administration intended to continue working with the association.
Leaders of the medical group say they are trying to be helpful to the Administration and need all the help they can get from the White House. The doctors are considering a significant change in policy: backing away from their position in support of a Federal law requiring employers to provide health insurance for their employees. The proposal for such an employer mandate is a central element of Mr. Clinton's plan to guarantee insurance coverage for all Americans.
Dr. Raymond Scalettar, former chairman of the association, said today: "It would have been useful for Administration officials to express themselves at this meeting and to explain why they view an employer mandate as the only way to go. If Administration spokesmen had appeared, they would have been welcomed, ushered in and given the opportunity to speak."
In the absence of such spokesmen from the Administration, "many doctors are beginning to have second thoughts about the employer mandate," Dr. Scalettar said. "As they deal with patients who have small businesses, they are being asked to reconsider."
 
'Intolerable Burden'
 Doctors from nearly a dozen states have endorsed resolutions saying that an employer mandate would, in the words of the Indiana delegation, "place an intolerable burden on small businesses."
Some doctors say this is a pocketbook issue for the doctors, because they themselves run small businesses and would have to provide comprehensive insurance coverage for all their office workers under the Clinton plan. Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the association, said he believed most doctors provided insurance for their employees, although he had no data to confirm this.
Mr. Eller, the White House spokesman, expressed no great concern about the possibility of a change in association's policy. "If there is a better way to reach the ultimate goal of universal coverage with comprehensive benefits but no employer mandate," he said, "we will seriously consider it."

HEADLINE: Reactor Passes Point of No Return In Uphill Path to Fusion Energy

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

DATELINE: PLAINSBORO, N.J.

 BODY:
THE promise of cheap, clean fusion energy is about to undergo an acid test as tritium fuel flows for the first time into America's most advanced fusion test reactor here.
A landmark series of experiments, scheduled to begin before Christmas and end next September, when the test reactor will be dismantled, could be either a giant step toward the dream of unlimited fusion energy or a blow that hobbles progress indefinitely. 
 The physicists supervising the experiment hope they have correctly predicted what will happen, and that the thorniest problems have been overcome. "But this is a time of great anxiety for all of us," said Dr. Ronald C. Davidson, director of the Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory. A successful run during the next few months could encourage significant financing for future fusion research, but major snags could obstruct financial support and thwart American participation in an ambitious international fusion program.
A hydrogen fusion reaction of the type scientists are hoping to create at the Princeton reactor yields immense amounts of energy and produces negligible amounts of radioactive waste; unlike a conventional nuclear fission reactor, a fusion reactor could not melt down or release dangerous fission products, nor would it produce highly radioactive spent fuel.
Over the last decade, supported by $1.4 billion in Federal funds, the Princeton laboratory has run many thousands of physics experiments with its big Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, but all were dry runs, using a heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium as the test fuel. To initiate a high-power reaction, a tokamak reactor needs tritium, a still heavier hydrogen isotope. (Tokamak is a Russian acronym for "toroidal magnetic chamber.") Trials with tritium were delayed until this essential testing phase was completed because once tritium enters the reactor the machine becomes radioactive and cannot be used again for deuterium experiments. Last month the moment of truth arrived as full-strength, tritium-laced reactor fuel began to replace the deuterium surrogate.
Tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen commonly used in minute quantities in luminous watch dials and exit signs, is essential to the high-power fusion reaction the scientists hope to achieve. After the tokamak has completed its tritium runs, it will be left to cool down for at least a year to allow its radioactivity to subside to levels safe enough for workers to dismantle it.
If all goes as planned, the five grams, or about one-sixth of an ounce, of tritium fuel now being trickled into the 50-foot-high reactor will produce a reaction temperature six times that of the Sun's core, which is about 27 million degrees, and will yield power of about 10 million watts. Although this will be somewhat less than half the power the machine consumes to produce it, the yield will be the best that any experimental fusion reactor has yet achieved, and it will provide vital information needed for the design and construction of future reactors.
In a fusion reaction, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms, including ordinary hydrogen as well as its deuterium or tritium isotopes, are forced to merge. The single proton in each hydrogen nucleus joins with the proton of another hydrogen nucleus to produce an element with two protons in its nucleus -- helium.
Although ordinary hydrogen atoms can be made to undergo fusion, the conditions needed to start a fusion reaction are much less demanding if deuterium atoms, which contain one neutron as well as a proton, are used. A mixture of tritium, with one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus, with deuterium, undergoes fusion even more easily.
If all goes well during the planned tests, and if Congress subsequently makes a long-term commitment to support a continuing fusion research program, scientists believe a commercial fusion power plant could begin operating by the year 2040. But much will depend on the willingness of many governments -- those of the United States, Japan, Russia and Western Europe -- to cooperate in financing an advanced fusion reactor prototype called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, which scientists like to abbreviate as ITER, pronounced "eat air." If it works, the project would demonstrate the feasibility of igniting fuel in a sustained fusion reaction at 100 million degrees and producing far more electric power than the machine consumes.
Estimates of the cost of this international machine range up to $11 billion, roughly the same as that of the superconducting supercollider, the huge proton accelerator that Congress voted to kill in October on the ground that it was too expensive. Although a source of vast fusion power would have much greater economic impact than the pure research the supercollider would have made possible, Congress has been wary of fusion research in recent years. In 1991 it killed Princeton's projected $1.8 billion Burning Plasma Experiment, which was intended to ignite a sustained fusion reaction.
"We ourselves may not live to see a commercial fusion reactor in operation," said Dr. Dale M. Meade, deputy director of the Princeton laboratory. "But we have a chance of leaving fusion energy technology to our grandchildren. It would be nice if they could inherit something besides deficits in energy and the Federal budget."
Scientists know that the principle of fusion is valid because they have applied it in thermonuclear explosions. But the principle is much harder to exploit when the goal is a controlled fusion reaction that goes on continuously in a tightly confined chamber in which the reactants are heated to about 180 million degrees. Scientists have spent billions of dollars since World War II trying to achieve controlled fusion.
For example, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., has long been trying to prove that microscopic glass capsules filled with hydrogen isotopes -- essentially, miniature hydrogen bombs -- could be fired by crushing the capsules with barrages of intense laser beams. But this method, known as inertial confinement, has so far failed to produce the desired result, partly because the imploding glass capsules mixed with the thermonuclear fuel instead of merely compressing it, and greatly impeded fusion.
An approach that most scientists now regard as more promising is called magnetic confinement fusion, the system embodied in the Princeton tokamak. The fuel, a half-and-half mixture of deuterium and tritium gas, is stripped of its electrons by heat, and each atom thereby acquires a positive electric charge. In this form, the gas is called a "plasma." By surrounding the electrically charged plasma with powerful interlocking magnetic fields, it can be confined and compressed at a high enough temperature to induce fusion.
 
Work Pioneered by Sakharov
 A magnetic "bottle" must be used to confine the plasma because the plasma's stellar heat would vaporize any material surface it touched; in a thermonuclear reactor, plasma fuel that accidentally came into contact with a metal wall would instantly cool down and squelch the fusion reaction, scientists say.
Most of the devices built to experiment with magnetic confinement are doughnut-shaped tokamaks, descendants of a design pioneered during the 1950's by the late Dr. Andrei Sakharov and Dr. Igor Tamm, both Russian physicists. Physicists have continued to develop the tokamak design because it is particularly suited to "bottling" plasma in a favorable shape as the plasma undergoes fusion.
The Princeton research tokamak operates in pulses lasting only a few seconds at a time, but a fusion-power reactor would presumably make the reaction continuous. Eighty percent of the energy produced in such a reactor would be carried out of the reaction vessel by neutrons released in the reaction. Those neutrons, lacking electric charges, could escape the magnetic confinement bottle, allowing them to hit a lithium "blanket" and heat it up. The hot blanket would in turn heat a gas, and the high-temperature gas could be used to drive a turbine and generate electricity.
As a byproduct, the fusion reaction would produce tritium, which would be re-used in helping to maintain the fusion cycle. (The commercial price of tritium, which is also an ingredient of hydrogen bombs, is about $30,000 per gram.)
But the reaction will also form alpha particles, nuclei of helium atoms, and one of the uncertainties in the forthcoming tests, scientists here say, is their behavior. Since these particles are electrically charged, they will remain trapped inside the tokamak's magnetic field, mixing with the deuterium-tritium plasma fuel. Roughly 20 percent of the fusion energy will be transferred to the alpha particles. Physicists hope that the alpha particles will perform an important service by transferring most of their energy back to the fuel, thereby maintaining the essential fusion temperature.
 
Unanswered Questions
 But the alpha particles could also pose a serious problem because they move at enormous speeds. Scientists are concerned that the impact of these particles on the magnetically confined plasma could destabilize its shape and make the plasma wiggle, spoiling the geometry needed for confinement and fusion. If this effect proves to be strong enough, it could be a serious obstacle to future fusion research.
"We have carried out many tests using deuterium alone," said Dr. Richard J. Hawryluk, manager of the Princeton tokamak, "and we believe that what we learned will more or less apply to deuterium-tritium plasma as well. But we can't be sure until we try it."
Another large research tokamak, the Joint European Torus, or JET, in Abingdon, England, ran a successful test two years ago using a plasma fuel containing tritium -- the first tritium fusion experiment ever attempted in a tokamak. But the tritium content was only about 10 percent of the deuterium-tritium mixture, and the much more potent 50-50 mixture in the Princeton tokamak is likely to behave somewhat differently.
Princeton physicists hope to persuade Congress to spend some $600 million on a new research reactor called the Tokamak Physics Experiment, designed to run continuously rather than in pulses. The experiments it could perform, the scientists believe, would be important steps toward the realization of the international ITER project.
A dozen smaller tokamaks in different countries are accumulating data vital to the working of future large machines. One of these is at Columbia University. "Dr. Michael Mauel and his team at Columbia are doing wonderful physics experiments with their smaller tokamak, and the results are shaping designs for future high-power tokamaks," Dr. Davidson said.
If thermonuclear fusion power is to become a reality, he believes, the talents, effort and money of many nations and many research organizations will be needed. "There's bound to be heated competition among nations -- and within nations -- in the selection of a site for ITER, a working fusion reactor," he said. "But ultimately, cooperation among everyone will be the key to realizing this great dream."

In a fusion reaction, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are forced to merge. The single protons from each nucleus join to produce helium, with two protons in its nucleus, and energy. A fusion reaction of the type scientists are hoping to create at the Princeton tokamak reactor, using deuterium and tritium, heavy isotopes of hydrogen, yields immense amounts of energy and negligible radioactive waste.

HEADLINE: Discount With a Vengeance;
A New Wrinkle in Retailing Hits the Metropolitan Region

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTBURY, L.I.

 BODY:
Patty Menges is the kind of shopper who makes mall retailers nervous.
"I don't like malls; I don't go to malls," she said, standing outside the Price Club, a floor-to-ceiling serve-yourself retailer of just about everything in bulk. Ms. Menges doesn't feel safe in the vast acreage of a mall parking lot and doesn't care for the prices either. "It's not discount," she said. 
 Shoppers like Ms. Menges are the driving force behind a new phenomenon for the New York metropolitan region, the "power mall," being developed here on a congested stretch of Old Country Road. It is discount with a vengeance, a place of brawny no-frills shopping, where the mantra is "value," and where the upscale shops and cinnamon-scented ambiance of the traditional mall are dismissed as frivolous affectations of a bygone era.
Certainly, discount shopping is nothing new. Smaller "power centers" -- usually two or three off-price stores like Home Depot or Price Club clustered together -- are increasingly common. What is new is a mall-sized conglomeration of such stores.
The $180 million project here, called the Source, a combination of enclosed mall and strip shopping center, is about one-third built, with a Kmart, a Sports Authority and a Marshalls open, in addition to Price Club. Groundbreaking for the mall section is months away and a list of tenants has yet to be announced.
But retailing and real-estate experts say the bottom line has already emerged: few traditional shopping malls are being built, their allure overtaken by changes in everything from land values to household budgets. Mall-sized properties in the new era might not all be like the Source, they say, but all will have to find a niche. For some, like the Mall of America, in a suburb of Minneapolis, that means emphasizing sheer size and entertainment. Others, like Short Hills Mall in Essex County, N.J., are pushing the outer edge of luxury shopping. But by far the most popular niche is discount shopping.
"The customer for whom they built malls 20 years ago is not the customer that comes today, and every retailer will have to face that fact," Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group, said, noting both a change in tastes and a decline in leisure time. "Malls have lost some of their luster, and virtually all of their entertainment value."
James W. Hughes, a professor of Urban Planning at Rutgers University who has studied malls, says flatly that if an ordinary shopping mall has not been built by now, it probably won't be. "For the most part, the regional mall infrastructure of the next century is in the ground," he said.
The recession revealed all this, experts say, and the unfolding story of Westbury's power mall underlined it.
As manufacturing declined and land prices fell, large swaths of land opened up at prices that could squeeze into the razor-thin profit margins of discounters like Kmart and the Sports Authority, both of which are anchor tenants here.
At the same time, many of the big-name department stores that usually anchor malls stumbled into bankruptcy or changed their names, eroding consumer loyalty. In Connecticut, for example, G. Fox & Company, the state's oldest retail name and one of its most trusted, which anchored malls throughout the state, was erased in a corporate reorganization to become Filene's.
Meanwhile, baby boomers who shopped through the 1980's had children and changed their priorities. Tighter economics meant more two-income households, with both earners looking for bargains and less likely to spend their time browsing in the mall. Perhaps most important, experts say, the malls became too familiar.
"There's just not a whole lot of people who spend two to three hours walking around a mall anymore," said Donald L. Hoffenkamp, development director for Homart Development Company, one of the nation's largest retail developers.
Four years ago, all of his company's capital spending was on malls. Now it's 50 percent malls, 50 percent power centers. "Homart is giving consumers what they want," he said.
 
'Almost a Rebellion'
 Although industrywide sales and traffic figures are unavailable to compare traditional malls with newer rivals, investors and developers are betting on the upstarts.
Since 1989, 14 power centers have opened in the tri-state region -- nearly doubling the total, according to figures from the National Research Bureau, a private research company. Of the 48 major enclosed malls in the 31-county metropolitan region, by contrast, all but two opened more than five years ago, and 30 were built before 1975. Only one is on the drawing board and approved for construction, the Westchester Mall in White Plains.
"Most of the malls have become so homogenized and the same that people are bored with it," said Peter N. Schaeffer, a partner at Johnson Redbook Service, a research firm that tracks retail trends for investors. "There's almost a rebellion."
Many malls, to be sure, are still profitable, and some developers have raised caution flags that discount shopping centers could cool off if consumer tastes turn again. In fact, some discounters have already stumbled badly. But the difference from ordinary mall retailing is also stark: Malls, with their emphasis on fashion, are becoming more and more dependent on the year-end holiday season, while power centers exist not for fashion, but price, with a year-round steady state business that appeals to many investors.
"The malls still will do the volume of business they need to do, but 70 to 80 percent of their business is in December," said Mr. Hoffenkamp, the shopping center builder. "It's spread out at power centers."
 
Concept Seen Around Country
 Already 401,000 square feet of the 1.2 million-square-foot project here is open, in one open-air strip. Inside at stores like the Sports Authority and Price Club, the feel is somewhere between a warehouse and an open-air bazaar, with aisles and sections laid out all on one level. The inventory is deep, with the Sports Authority, for instance, stocking one whole aisle of tennis rackets.
The next phase of the Source, about 816,000 square feet, is being assembled by Fortunoff, a department store that is promising to advance the spirit of Price Club into a previously unheard of scale of "value-oriented shopping." Tenants in that section are expected to be announced early next year.
The concept is echoed elsewhere around the region and the nation, from Scottsdale, Ariz., where a 1.2 million square foot power mall opened this year, to the power retailers clustering around Buckland Hills Mall in Manchester, Conn., to the new, sprawling "value malls" in Washington, Philadelphia and elsewhere.
Here in Nassau County, the trend has particular resonance. Nassau pioneered mall construction in the 1950's -- with three malls up and running by 1956, when the entire state of New Jersey had but one. It still has by far the biggest concentration of malls in the region, with 6.4 million square feet of malls in only 287 square miles, a density higher than even Bergen County, N.J., home of the cheek-by-jowl malls of Paramus.
 
Not the First Choice
 Not to give the deep thinkers at Fortunoff too much credit, they admit that a power mall was not their first choice. The company set out to build a traditional 1.6 million-square-foot mall called the Galleria in the late 1980's only to see residents object and the economy head south at the same time. Nearby Roosevelt Field, one of the region's oldest malls, also decided to pour millions of dollars into a redesign and upgrade. In the end, the opulent-sounding "Galleria" took on a punchier identity as "the Source."
"It is obvious that the revised formula was the correct one," said a spokesman for Fortunoff, Gary Lewi. "The Price Club and the Price Club Plaza are examples of what the public has come to demand."
Retailing industry experts, urban planners and real-estate professionals say that what happened to Fortunoff on the way to its mall illustrates the economic and demographic trends that are roiling retail shelves.
"The malls are under pressure because they're the highest cost operators, made technologically obsolete by discounters with lower costs," said George Rosenbaum, chief executive officer of Leo J. Shapiro and Associates, a Chicago-based market research company.
Still, retailers say the relationship between ordinary malls and power malls is interdependent, and ultimately, nurturing.
"Malls kind of have their own place and power centers can be compatible with malls," said Charles J. Miller, a group vice president at Kmart Corporation, which owns the Sports Authority and Borders Books, all three of which will be part of the Westbury project. "We tend to gravitate toward regional malls, and the better the mall, the more we like to be in the vicinity."
A spokesman for the corporate owners of Roosevelt Field, Kevin Ryan, said the mall would only benefit from the presence of a power mall nearby.
"The retail mix is not the same," Mr. Ryan said. "If the Fortunoff project attracts more people to the area, we'll get some fallout from that -- they complement each other."
The Nassau County Board of Supervisors tightened the relationship between the two this week, designating a circular area around the two sites as the county's transportation hub. The distinction will affect transportation decisions, county officials said, focusing things like bus routing and future Federal mass-transit grants on these properties.
 
Scale and Congestion
 Transportation and congestion are also considered the biggest risks for the Source. One of the main appeals of ordinary power centers, beyond the prices, is that shoppers can generally park in front of the store they want. At the size of a power mall, however, that immediacy may be lost.
Professor Hughes at Rutgers said he believed new questions about scale and congestion not encountered at smaller power centers will require new answers.
"This is more evolution that revolution," he said. "They are in the process of adapting and maybe mutating into this new form."

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Still Eludes Negotiators

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Tuesday, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The United States and the European Community struggled into the early morning hours today to bridge differences that are holding up a world trade agreement, now divided mainly by a bitter dispute over access for American movies and television programs in the European market.
Despite more than 19 hours of talks between the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and the European Community's chief negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, officials on both sides reported little progress. 
 "What we have up to now is unacceptable," the French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, said.
[An identified European Community official said an agreement was closer, Reuters reported early Tuesday. "They are not far off," the official was quoted as saying, referring to Sir Leon and Mr. Kantor. But the official added that there were "still some things to sort out" and did not elaborate.]
 
 
Meeting Postponed
 The community's foreign ministers postponed a meeting that had been scheduled on Monday to review and outline an agreement on trade issues that had been framed last week. Instead, they decided to meet after the talks between Mr. Kantor and Sir Leon ended.
"We hope that discussions through the night will bring some progress," Mr. Juppe said late Monday. "At the moment we cannot accept the position of the American side."
A trade agreement between the United States and the European Community is an essential prelude for completion of long-stalled world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs on Trade, which began seven years ago in Uruguay and now faces a Dec. 15 deadline agreed to by all sides.
If there is no accord by then, the attempt to update and broaden world trade rules, and so encourage international commerce, will be badly set back, perhaps abandoned for now.
 
 
Authority May Run Out
 What is more, President Clinton's special trade negotiating authority will expire and the Administration would have to ask Congress next year for an extension, something that could be politically ticklish after the bruising fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The special powers allow the President to sign a GATT agreement by next spring and submit it to Congress for a vote without amendments.
A failure would also dent world economic confidence and place new strains on an Atlantic alliance still seeking a new purpose with the end of the cold war.
It is possible that trade negotiators will dicker through this week and into next week, even up to the last hours, over difficult issues, and still make the Dec. 15 deadline.
The difficulties in the talks Monday stemmed from the complex variety of issues being confronted. Although the outline of an agreement has been reached on what had long been the most contentious issue, agricultural trade, neither side was prepared to ratify that while other questions still hung in the balance.
"Nobody wants to lose any negotiating leverage," a community official said. "There will be an agreement on everything or on nothing."
On farm-export issues, Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy emerged beaming from a meeting on Monday with the community's farm commissioner, Rene Steichen, and said his expression reflected the progress in the talks. Community officials said the outline of a farm accord -- under which the Europeans would cut back their subsidized food and grain exports more slowly than previously agreed to, while the United States gained improved access to the European market for a range of agricultural and industrial goods -- had relegated these issues to a secondary place in the negotiations.
"There is a farm agreement," Mr. Steichen said, "but it is a question of getting an overall agreement that is now a difficult task."
French officials contested this view, saying that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's Government wanted further concessions on farm trade. But it seemed clear that whatever differences remained on this issue were narrow.
At the forefront of the talks, a battle raged over demands by the American movie and entertainment industries. An exhausted European delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two sides had been negotiating solidly since Saturday in Geneva on this matter, and "neither side has budged an inch."
Mr. Kantor, who knows the American film industry intimately from his days as a lawyer representing the business, wants all European restrictions on American television programs removed and also wants assurances that American technologies now being developed -- involving interaction among cable, computers and entertainment -- will not be held back by European restrictions.
"If the audio-visual question is not settled to our satisfaction, there will be no GATT agreement," said Stuart E. Eizenstat, the American representative to the European Community.
A great deal is at stake here. American entertainment products are the nation's second-largest export area, behind aerospace. In 1992, sales in Europe totaled $3.7 billion.
 
Fear of American Culture
 But France and some other countries now restrict United States-made programs to a maximum of 50 percent of total television broadcasts. In addition, France wants the right to subsidize its movie industry, to protect it, it says, from an overwhelming Hollywood cultural onslaught.
Under GATT rules, subsidies are generally regarded as a form of unfair competitive practice, and their elimination is encouraged.
But a European official involved in the talks said: "Not only in France, but throughout the community, there is a feeling that we must have some protection" for the European entertainment industry, or, the official said, "it will simply disappear. This is not a question on which we can make many concessions."
French officials said differences also remained over the question of anti-dumping duties -- levies imposed when goods are found to have been exported at prices lower than those charged in domestic markets.
The United States insists that its right to impose such duties should not be limited by any GATT agreement.

HEADLINE: Former White House Aide Will Run Hill & Knowlton

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD LEVY

 BODY:
Hill & Knowlton Inc., the troubled public relations giant, yesterday named Howard Paster, who recently resigned as President Clinton's chief lobbyist on Capitol Hill, to be its new chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Paster, 48, will take over a firm that has been buffeted in recent years by declining billings, turmoil in senior management, staff cutbacks and criticism that it has shown poor judgment in its choice of clients. And its parent company, WPP Group P.L.C. of Britain, has struggled with heavy debt amassed during a takeover binge in the 1980's that included the purchase of Hill & Knowlton. 
 Hill & Knowlton has not had a chief executive since Thomas E. Eidson was stripped of that post in June by Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, who apparently stepped in after growing increasingly concerned about the public relation firm's financial performance.
Mr. Paster, a veteran Washington insider known for his no-nonsense style, came under fire in the early days of the Clinton Administration from some in Congress who contended that he had failed to reach out to Republicans and had fumbled the President's effort to pass an economic stimulus package.
But he earned plaudits in recent months, particularly for his role in the grueling, come-from-behind campaign that successfully navigated the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement by the House of Representatives.
Shortly after the accord passed the House on Nov. 17, Mr. Paster announced that he would leave the Government, saying that he had tired of the pace in a White House that seems to thrive on late-night, heavily caffeinated strategy sessions led by a President with a sweeping agenda.
When Mr. Paster resigned, he said he would not work as a lobbyist, and he reiterated yesterday that he would excuse himself from Hill & Knowlton business that involved lobbying the Government. But he pointed out that less than 5 percent of the firm's billings involved Washington lobbying.
President Clinton has barred top executive-branch officials from lobbying their old offices for five years after leaving the Government.
Hill & Knowlton -- whose clients include Boeing, Exxon, Pfizer and Mazda -- has 55 offices in 27 countries.
Mr. Paster, who worked briefly in 1992 as head of Hill & Knowlton's Washington office, acknowledged that the firm had been facing difficulties. In 1991, for example, it was assailed by abortion-rights advocates for directing an anti-abortion campaign for the National Council of Catholic Bishops, and by others for representing the Church of Scientology.
The firm was also accused of orchestrating testimony before Congress about allegations of Iraqi atrocities during the Persian Gulf war on behalf of its client, the Kuwaiti Government. Those disputes contributed to the abrupt departure of the firm's chief executive, Robert Dilenschneider, in September 1991 and the ascension of Mr. Eidson, then the firm's chief operating officer.
 
 
'A Difficult Run'
 "Everyone knows that the public relations industry has had a difficult run in the last several years," Mr. Paster said in an interview. "I want to re-establish Hill & Knowlton's primacy as the best in the business. It has a large number of very able people and I think it can again be at the top of the industry."
Jack O'Dwyer, editor of Jack O'Dwyer's Newsletter, which covers the public relations industry, said the appointment of Mr. Paster might give a much-needed boost to Hill & Knowlton's reputation.
"He could be the person who will reinvigorate Hill & Knowlton, which does need new leadership," Mr. O'Dwyer said. "Eidson was a little more introverted. He's a very intelligent person, but he does not have a big persona. Paster has a much bigger public persona and image. And maybe what they need is someone with more public stature. It attracts clients. Paster knows Clinton, is used to power and is out there in the public's eye."
 
 
Three Divisions
 When Mr. Sorrell reorganized Hill & Knowlton in June, he created three divisions -- in the United States, Europe and Asia. Mr. Eidson was essentially demoted to chairman and chief executive of the United States division and chairman of the executive committee overseeing the whole firm.
Mr. Paster, who is to take office on Jan. 1, would now become chairman of the executive committee, the firm said.
In addition to his previous stint at Hill & Knowlton, Mr. Paster worked for 12 years for Timmons & Company, a Washington lobbying and public relations concern also owned by WPP, rising to the post of chairman. He was also a lobbyist for the United Automobile Workers.
In his new job, he will live in Washington and maintain offices in both Washington and New York, where Hill & Knowlton is based.

HEADLINE: Stocks Gain Modestly, With Dow Up 6.14

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Optimism fueled by Friday's employment report, and the bond market's failure to wilt despite the report's contents, led to modest gains in stock prices yesterday.
The Labor Department report showed that unemployment fell to a three-year low in November, and led a number of analysts to raise their economic growth forecasts for the coming year. 
 But the bond market, which normally recoils from signs of stronger growth on fears it will generate higher inflation, shrugged off the news on Friday and prices rallied yesterday on a further softening in oil prices. The yield of the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.16 percent, from 6.23 percent Friday.
"As much psychologically as practically, bonds have been driving the market today," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., money management and equity research firm.
 
Computer-Generated Programs
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 6.14 to close at 3,710.21, one-half point below its record close of 3,710.77 set Nov. 16. A late round of computer-generated sell programs pushed the Dow off what had been a record intraday high of 3,721.39.
On the Big Board, volume was a healthy 292.4 million shares, compared with 268.9 million on Friday. Blue-chip issues led the advance. Of the Dow stocks, I.B.M. rose1/4, to 53 3/4; Merck was up 1/4, to 34 1/4, and Kodak was up 5/8, to 62 7/8.
The market is "pretty decent," said John Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest Inc., "and I'm looking for a pretty strong December. The economy is picking up steam and there seems to be sufficient slack in capacity to keep inflation under control."
For yesterday at least, the bond market's performance helped ease worries that the run-up in interest rates that has taken place since mid-November would not only raise borrowing costs for companies, but also possibly dampen the economic recovery.
Among other stock market averages, the S.& P. 500 index rose 1.54, to 466.43. But the Nasdaq's combined composite index, which has outperformed both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 this year, fell by 1.13, to 771.09.
Thomas Kurlak, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, had a good bit to do with the drop in the Nasdaq index, which is heavily represented with technology issues.
Investors dumped semiconductor shares after Mr. Kurlak said he had cut his 1994 earnings estimates on Intel and Motorola, two of the industry's giants, on concern about a projected slowdown in semiconductor sales.
Intel, one of the most active issues traded yesterday and one of the biggest Nasdaq issues, fell 4, to 59 1/2, on the news.
Motorola was down 2, at 94 1/8, while Applied Materials dropped 2, to 35 3/4, and Micron Technology lost 1 3/8, to 46 5/8.
"The slump in technology stocks has caused a bit of concern, because technology has been a big part of the economy's overall growth," said Joseph DeMarco, a managing director at Marinvest, a subsidiary of the HongKong and Shanghai Bank.
Other decliners included Mellon Bank, which fell 4 3/8, to 53, after it announced it had agreed to buy the Dreyfus Corporation for $1.85 billion. Some analysts said the deal could be dilutive to Mellon's earnings if the company does not buy back some of its shares after the merger.
Meanwhile, shares of the big mutual fund company rose 1 7/8, to 46 3/8, on the news.
Airline stocks were hammered on news of additional fare cuts, causing the Dow Jones transportation index to slump by more than 7 points, to 1,756.35.
The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, dropped 1 1/2, to 150 7/8, and American Airline's parent, AMR, fell 1 1/8, to 65 7/8.

HEADLINE: Once Dull, GATT Enters Realm of Pop Culture

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 2

 BODY:
In the days when the world focused on the number of warheads in East and West, rather than the number of tons of subsidized beef the European Community can export, the bureaucrats at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade labored in peaceful anonymity.
Asked how many calls he would receive a day when he became GATT's chief spokesman 10 years ago, David Woods replied: "A day? You must mean a week. A couple at most. The place was asleep -- depressed, actually." 
 But that was the time of Soviet-American surrogate wars, rather than French-American battles over the production of vegetable oil. Now, as nations have moved from military buildups to contretemps over commerce, GATT has moved to center stage -- at a time when NATO, an organization with a more famous four-letter acronym, casts around somewhat haplessly for a new role.
 
'An Amazing Evolution'
 "It has been an amazing evolution," said Tom Kay, a former Agriculture Department official who has long followed trade issues. "I am still somewhat taken aback by it."
GATT is also adjusting, scurrying to keep up with its booming fortunes. Its main meeting hall still looks more like a corporate board room than the gathering place for decisions the world hangs on. Security checks at the trade organization's headquarters here were introduced for the first time two months ago because, an official said, "it just seemed stupid to have people strolling in with no security when we'd become such a focus of international attention."
Cameras whirl without let-up in the entrance hall as dignitaries file in. Two calls a week to the press department have become several hundred a day. An ad displayed in the headquarters building for a T-shirt with the words "Uruguay Round" urges prospective buyers to "wear the letters that are making headlines." It refers not to a soccer tournament, but to the negotiations on updating and broadening world trade rules that began seven years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and will either be concluded or crash over the next several days.
Sales of the T-shirt, at $13 each, have been brisk, said Leslie Berkowitz, an American who helps run the store at the trade group's headquarters. Sweatshirts saying just "GATT" are also selling well. But other offerings -- studies on "The World Market for Dairy Products," for instance, or "Anti-Dumping And Countervailing Measures Legislation" -- attract a limited clientele.
As the relative appeal of the shirts and the publications suggest, GATT is trendy but also dispiritingly complicated. With the world trade talks facing a Dec. 15 deadline, and the hotly disputed North American Free Trade Agreement now approved, hordes of folks are traipsing into GATT headquarters to press their particular concerns and to try to unearth what is really at stake.
Recently, it was the turn of Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, propelled across the Atlantic by concerns that a GATT accord would limit American industry's ability to protect itself against unfair competition through anti-dumping duties. He was followed by Augusto Bocchini, president of the main European agricultural association, an Italian who quickly demolishes any notion that work on the farm and a Gucci look are incompatible.
Dignitaries are whisked into the headquarters and received by GATT's Director General, Peter Sutherland, an Irish lawyer who took office on July 1 and has managed to bludgeon the world's governments into serious negotiations with a much-repeated message: Failure could lead to anything from a prolonged world economic slump to a gradual unraveling of the Atlantic alliance.
 
Outraged Farmers
 Europe's nine million farmers, whose ability to off-load tons of subsidized food on the world market would be limited by an accord, naturally have a different view. Their representatives say that a GATT agreement, as now envisioned, would be disastrous for them.
The farmers' idea of cataclysm to come was described by Andre Herlitska, Mr. Bocchini's sidekick, a Belgian with a more typically rural air than his boss.
"One-third of full-time agricultural jobs would be lost," Mr. Herlitska declared. "Farm income would fall by about 50 percent. More than 11 million hectares of agricultural land would be idled. It would be an economic disaster for Europe."
All this, the farmers argue, would stem from what is known as the Blair House agreement, concluded late last year between representatives of the European Community and the United States at Blair House in Washington. They agreed to reduce subsidized grain and other food exports from the European Community by 21 percent over the next six years. This provision is supposed to be integrated into a final GATT accord.
How is this possible, Mr. Herlitska was asked. Well, he said, take European cheese.
Worldwide sales of cheese from European countries have been exceedingly good in recent years. But the Blair House agreement stipulates that the reference point for the 21 percent cutback would be average sales in the 1988-90 period. Therefore, Mr. Herlitska said, in the first year an overall GATT accord was in effect, European cheese sales would have to be reduced 22 percent -- 18.5 percent as a result of going back to the 1988-90 reference point from current sales levels, and 3.5 percent more as the first stage toward the 21 percent goal.
 
Cheese Is Harder to Handle
 Like much else in the growing lexicon of GATT data and interpretation, the validity of such an argument is not easy to determine. A few years ago, warheads were warheads, identifiable and limited in number -- but cheese is all over the place.
Might Brie and Camembert really disappear from the supermarkets of Singapore or Manila if the Blair House provision were not changed? Will $274 billion in fact be added to world economic output over the next decade as a result of an accord, as some economists estimate? Do Hollywood movies like "Jurassic Park" in fact threaten the future of the French cinema, necessitating subsidies from Paris for French movies and quotas for United States productions on French television?
No one can definitively answer questions like these. But as Mr. Sutherland continues to receive members of the United States Congress and European lobbyists over the next two weeks in his spacious office overlooking the lake and the distant Alps, he will have a basic message:
For 45 years, the 96-page set of basic rules for international commerce known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has underlay a huge increase in international commerce and wealth, while cutting average tariffs from 40 percent to less than 10 percent.
So, updating, broadening and clarifying those rules can only be beneficial for the world's nations, many of them now economically stagnant, and all of them threatened by dislocation into separate European, Asian and North American trading blocs.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
The economy may be improving, but Madison Avenue isn't ready to celebrate just yet.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
ASKEIN of recent statistics indicates the economy may finally be improving. But a leading forecaster is warning Madison Avenue not to break out the Champagne and confetti just yet.
Robert J. Coen, in his semiannual presentation of the outlook for ad spending worldwide, said yesterday that he had reduced his estimates for domestic results this year a third time in addition to trimming his expectations for 1994. 
 "People are skittish about being too optimistic," Mr. Coen, the senior vice president and director of forecasting at McCann-Erickson U.S.A., said after his remarks to the opening session of the 21st annual Paine Webber media conference in Manhattan.
"There are still areas of the country, like the West Coast and metropolitan New York, where retailers and consumers are still kind of traumatized," he added.
Mr. Coen, who has been tracking ad trends for 45 years, said that 1993 domestic spending would total $138.1 billion, up 5.2 percent from $131.3 billion in 1992. By comparison, in June 1992 he predicted 1993 at $143 billion, cut it to $141.2 billion last December and sliced it again to $139.3 billion in June.
And in looking ahead to 1994, he revised downward his June estimate of $149 billion, to $146.8 billion. That means ad spending next year will grow only 6.3 percent from 1993 instead of 7 percent.
"After being on the high side two, three years running," Mr. Coen said, "I'm getting nervous and going on the low side." Still, the 5.2 percent rise he now sees for 1993 would be the most since a 7.7 percent gain in 1988. And his estimates mean that ad spending growth should exceed inflation, because consensus forecasts expect the Consumer Price Index to rise 3 percent in 1993 and 1994.
Mr. Coen's predictions are more closely followed than, say, the correlation between hemlines and stock prices because the rise and fall of ad spending often predicts, and sometimes foretells, the direction of the American economy.
Yet while the overall economic outlook has been glowing more rosily, marketers' enthusiasm for growing ad budgets seems to be lagging.
"Caution suggests that instead of a boom next year," Mr. Coen wrote in a report that accompanied his forecast, "we should more realistically look for moderately better results than those of this year."
A primary reason ad spending apparently would rebound more slowly, he said, despite benefiting from the 1994 Winter Olympics and midterm elections, is "the downsizing process" at many consumer-product companies.
"To make sure profits keep moving up," he said, "they're not supporting marginal brands that in the past they were supporting heavily."
Zenith Media Worldwide, the media services company owned by Saatchi & Saatchi, made a similar point in a report it released yesterday with its own advertising spending forecasts.
"We have been hearing more and more industry leaders asking the formerly unthinkable," the Zenith report said. "Even when consumer confidence, employment and the economy in general improves, will advertising rebound?"
Zenith predicted that American advertising spending would end 1993 at $141.5 billion, up 3.9 percent from $136.2 billion in 1992. And Zenith's prognostication for 1994 is for only a 3.8 percent increase from this year, to $146.9 billion.
The advertising industry has been behaving for some time as if the hatches must remain battened. For instance, Saatchi & Saatchi said yesterday that it would take a $14.9 million charge for additional severance costs, beyond a previously expected charge of $7.45 million, because of reductions in client spending and the losses of its Jeep-Eagle and Helene Curtis accounts. It also plans to vacate its luxurious office in Berkeley Square in London to save an additional $1.8 million.
Outside the United States, Mr. Coen's estimates were slashed, too. Instead of the $169.6 billion he forecast in June, up 4 percent from $163.1 billion in 1992, he now expects, as a result of the stronger dollar, a decline of 1.5 percent, to $163 billion.
That would result in 1993 total worldwide ad spending of $301.1 billion, up 1.5 percent from last year -- a smaller gain than the minuscule 2.1 percent in the recession and war year of 1991. Zenith also reduced its worldwide estimate for 1993, to $312.6 billion, up 4.2 percent from $299.9 billion in 1992.
And Mr. Coen cut his estimate for ad spending overseas in 1994 to $171 billion, up 4.9 percent, from a forecast of $181 billion, up 6.5 percent, that he made in June. That would bring his 1994 total worldwide ad spending prediction to $317.8 billion, up 5.5 percent, compared with his June figure of $330 billion, up 6.7 percent. Zenith, likewise, pared its worldwide estimate for 1994 to $329.6 billion, up 5.4 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Its Decline As Gold Prices Turn Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against major currencies yesterday as investors extended a selloff that began Friday when the dollar ran out of stamina despite positive economic news.
Gold prices rose overseas and fell in the United States. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, fell 80 cents, to $377.80 an ounce. A late quote from the Republic National Bank put spot gold at $376.30 an ounce, down 65 cents from Friday. 
 Traders said the dollar continued its fall from Friday, when it was unable to maintain upward momentum despite a strong Labor Department report on employment for November.
"We're going through a position reversal," said Robert Ryan, a vice president at the Bank of New York. "People who have been trading long for a month have decided to take profits."
David Gilmore, an analyst at MCM Currencywatch, said that after the market had received a stream of positive numbers on the economy, it was no longer pushing up the dollar with each new figure.
He said the dollar's price had already taken account of a strong fourth quarter and that it was now "pricing in a slow first quarter."
 
Swiss Franc Is Beneficiary
 Traders said the Swiss franc was the main beneficiary of the dollar's fall. "The Swiss economy might be showing stronger signs of life than the German economy," Mr. Gilmore said, explaining the Swiss franc's appeal. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has suffered from the huge costs of reunification.
In Tokyo, where the trading day began, the dollar closed at 108.18 yen, down 0.67 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, it rose to 108.24 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 107.96 yen, down from 108.60 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4995, from $1.4905 late Friday. In New York, the pound ended at $1.5039, more expensive than $1.4905 on Friday.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $376.55 a troy ounce, from $375.90 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to a late bid of $377.10 vs. $377.00 late Friday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.65 to close at a bid $376.56.
On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery closed at $4.817 a troy ounce, up six-tenths of a cent from Friday.

HEADLINE: Market Place Commonwealth Edison Is Liked Despite Its Debt and High Rates

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
COMMONWEALTH EDISON has embraced nuclear power more fervently than any other electric utility in the nation, and it is best known on Wall Street for the resulting troubles with regulators, consumer groups and environmentalists.
So why then do many Wall Street analysts like the stock? 
 The Chicago-based utility has "some challenges that aren't going to go away but we don't see any significant downside," said Barry M. Abramson, who follows power companies for Prudential Securities in New York. "The difference of opinion on Wall Street now is over how much upside it has for the patient investor."
The heavy investments to build 12 nuclear plants piled up debts and saddled customers with some of the highest rates in the nation. The company also paid dearly for long-term coal contracts signed in the 1970's that linked prices to the general rate of inflation, leaving it with higher fuel bills than its neighbors when coal prices declined.
Because of its blunders, Commonwealth Edison found it difficult to persuade the Illinois Commerce Commission to approve rate increases. The increases won by the utility usually got tied up in court, where they were further whittled down. By last year, Commonwealth Edison had been forced to cut its dividend to $1.60, from $3, and six different rate cases were in various stages of dispute.
Still, the sense that the utility was undervalued began forming last spring. The utility had been cutting operating costs more aggressively. It also won praise for hiring a high-profile outsider, Samuel Skinner, a former chief of staff for President George Bush, as president.
The outlook became substantially clearer in September when the utility and its opponents in the rate cases reached a blanket compromise to settle all of the disputes. The cost to the company was a record $1.34 billion refund to be paid out over the next year, the equivalent of a temporary rate cut of more than 25 percent.
No one on Wall Street called the expensive settlement a victory, but analysts were glad to see the potential for even greater liabilities removed.
In addition, the settlement gave the utility the green light to file another rate increase request as early as the end of this month, which could lead to higher rates in late 1994. Now, the degree of bullishness among analysts stems mostly from how much they expect the company can get from that request.
"The commission really stiffed them in the last case," said Edward J. Tirello Jr. of NatWest Securities in New York. He rates it as one of the few buys in the group. "They should get the rest of their nuclear plants into the rate base this time if the commission follows its own guidelines."
Similarly, Kit Konolige at CS First Boston expects a "significant" rate increase to lift the stock to $38 in 12 to 18 months. The stock closed yesterday at $28.25, up 25 cents. Any increase would come with a safe dividend, currently yielding 5.66 percent, about average for the electric utility group.
Moreover, it would add little to costs to generate surplus power at the nuclear plants for sale to other utilities.
Skeptics say history makes it hard to be optimistic about the rate cases. They also wonder if the company can maintain the downward trend in maintenance spending it began this year, noting that six of the nuclear plants are about two decades old.
Continued operating savings are vital, especially if competition forces Commonwealth Edison to cut prices to major customers, because the fixed expenses stemming from past investments will be high for years to come.

HEADLINE: Latin Nations Set Trade Pact

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico have worked out details of a free trade pact, which will be signed in January, according to reports issued on Sunday.
The agreement, intended to create a $373 billion economic market encompassing some 145 million people is the latest in a series of trade pacts by Latin American countries seeking to open their once-protectionist economies. 
 After three days of intense negotiations, representatives agreed on Saturday that trade ministers of the three nations would sign the agreement the week of Jan. 10, the daily newspaper El Tiempo said. The agreement must also be signed by the presidents of the three countries.
Last month, lawmakers in the United States and Mexico gave final approval to the North American Free Trade Agreement, under which the United States, Canada and Mexico will lower barriers to trade with one another.

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
President Clinton was not the only out-of-town draw on the party circuit in Hollywood during the weekend: RUSH LIMBAUGH, the outspoken talk show host, did admirably considering that the cocktail party given by Pocket Books to celebrate the publication of his second book, "See, I Told You So," was held the same evening that the President was at an exclusive ($25,000 a couple) fund-raiser at the home of Marvin Davis. An eclectic and nonpaying crowd of more than 200 came to the Chateau Marmont on Saturday to congratulate Mr. Limbaugh. Among the guests: MARY MATALIN, the political director for President Bush's campaign and now a talk show host herself; Darryl F. Gates, the former Los Angeles police chief; Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, the movie producers; the writers Dominick Dunne, Michael Medved and Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington; Thomas Sowell, the conservative economist, and Brandon Tartikoff, the former chairman of NBC Entertainment and Paramount Pictures. 
 "It was one of the best parties I have ever been to," said Ms. Matalin, who was making her first public appearance since her Thanksgiving wedding to James Carville, President Clinton's political strategist. "Everyone was in a good humor, and people were having complete conversations."

HEADLINE: Italy's Great Red Hope?

 BODY:
In municipal elections on Sunday, voters in five major Italian cities chose the more moderate alternative -- the candidates backed by the former Communist Party, now known as the Democratic Party of the Left.
The former Communists now plausibly, though paradoxically, offer themselves as the strongest remaining champion of a unified, democratic and European-oriented Italy in the months leading up to next year's national parliamentary elections. 
 With the scandal-ridden centrist parties eliminated in first-round voting two weeks ago, coalition candidates backed by the former Communists stood head-to-head against neo-Fascists in Rome and Naples and regional separatists in Genoa, Venice and Trieste. Though the rightists and regionalists emerged as the largest parties in their respective strongholds, the left coalitions captured the mayors' jobs.
Italy's Communists were among the first anywhere to proclaim their full acceptance of parliamentary democracy. They have long held power at local and regional levels and their nationwide vote of between 20 and 30 percent made them a kind of silent partner in several national governments.
What's different now is that the seismic corruption scandals of the past few years have shattered all their main national competitors. That leaves the former Communists, at least for now, as the main standard-bearer against the radical right.
For years, Washington actively promoted Italy's Christian Democratic and Socialist parties and their smaller centrist allies as a strategic bulwark against the largest Communist Party in the West. On its own cold-war terms, American policy succeeded. Italy remained a member of NATO and enjoyed decades of impressive economic growth.
But Italians paid a price. Payoffs inflated the cost of local government and paralyzed the administration of impartial justice. And the centrist coalition became entrenched as a permanent government, stifling any realistic possibility of healthy democratic renewal.
The collapse of Soviet power theoretically opened the possibility of change. But it took the prosecution of top Christian Democratic and Socialist leaders and their business allies to smash the existing political system.
The post-Communists, as the only major national party not deeply implicated in the scandals, were one beneficiary. So were the previously marginal neo-Fascists of the Italian Social Movement and the regionalists of the recently organized Northern League. The democratic credentials of all three are open to suspicion. But the post-Communists have gone furthest to dispel the doubts.

HEADLINE: McCall Seeks Repayments For Pensions

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 6

 BODY:
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said today that he would give New York State and its local governments at least 12 years to make restitution for a $4 billion raid on the state pension system that was ruled illegal last month.
His reimbursement plan will allow the state and local governments to repay relatively small sums in the next few years, including the 1994 election year, and much larger sums near the turn of the century. 
 The plan, which could be challenged in court, brought sharp criticism today from Mr. McCall's political opponents, who asserted that the Comptroller was giving an election-year gift to his mentor, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. It also was condemned by the state employees' unions that challenged the pension raid in court.
 
Sopping Up Red Ink
 Mr. Cuomo and the State Legislature devised the pension gimmick in 1990 as a desperate measure to fill a $2 billion gap in the 1990-91 state budget. It was one of several fiscal maneuvers, including the sale of state roads and prisons to quasi-public authorities, that New York used to sop up red ink at the height of the recession.
By changing the pension system's actuarial requirements, Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature made possible a huge reduction in annual payments to the pension fund by employers, meaning the state and the hundreds of local governments and police and fire departments that use the state's retirement system. As a result of the change, the state's contributions to the pension system dropped to $3.1 million in 1991 from $470 million in 1990.
Last month the state's top court, the Court of Appeals, ruled that the change was illegal because it abrogated the Comptroller's authority as sole trustee of the pension fund. The 6-0 decision also said the actions of the Governor and the Legislature had impaired the fund's security. The court ordered that the pension system return to its old accounting method and be compensated for its losses, which will amount to $4 billion by March.
As the sole trustee of the $56 billion pension system, which includes 860,000 active members and retirees, Mr. McCall has the unilateral authority to devise a repayment schedule for the state and local governments. New York City has its own pension system and is not affected by Mr. McCall's decision.
 
Arbitrary Formula
 The plan Mr. McCall unveiled, which is based on an arbitrary formula, requires that small sums be paid back in the coming fiscal year. The state, which has a $60 billion budget, will pay $30 million above its previously anticipated pension payments.
Local governments and police and fire departments will be charged a total of $60 million above their anticipated payments. The town of Oyster Bay, L.I., for instance, will pay an additional $147,230, while the city of Yonkers will pay an additional $277,674.
The reimbursement amounts will increase gradually through the rest of the decade. But not until 1999 will the state and local governments have to make larger payments than they would have if the pension accounting change had not been struck down.
Mr. McCall defended his decision by saying it would help local governments avoid budgetary chaos. Although the state's fiscal year begins on April 1, many local governments already have adopted budgets for fiscal years that begin on Jan. 1.
"An immediate charge-back of the money owed would have severe financial ramifications on some local governments in the state, possibly forcing layoffs of the very employees I'm trying to help," Mr. McCall said. "A pension doesn't matter if you don't have a job."
 
Postponing Budgetary Pain
 But the repayment schedule also gives significant help to Mr. Cuomo by postponing most of the budgetary pain for the state until after the 1994 election. Mr. Cuomo may be running for a fourth four-year term then, leading a Democratic ticket that will almost certainly include Mr. McCall.
Mr. McCall was Mr. Cuomo's running-mate choice in his 1982 election as governor, but Mr. McCall lost in the Democratic primary. Mr. Cuomo supported the Legislature's selection of him as comptroller this year after Edward V. Regan resigned.
Mr. Cuomo, who will propose his 1994-95 budget next month, has said he hopes to enact tax cuts and reductions in various fees next year, and he already is committed to increasing spending on mental health and the environment. A significant new pension cost, like the extra $241 million the state will owe in 1999, would make it difficult to afford such politically popular initiatives.
A Republican legislator who may run against Mr. McCall next year harshly criticized the plan. "Sadly, it appears that the schedule to pay back the absconded pension money is dictated more by Governor Cuomo's political calendar than actuarial prudence," said Assemblyman John J. Faso, a Columbia County Republican who has announced his campaign for comptroller.
Mr. McCall said the plan's impact on Mr. Cuomo "was never a consideration."
 
Criticized by Union Leaders
 Leaders of the largest unions of state workers said today that they recognized that it would be irresponsible to require the state and local governments to repay the full $4 billion immediately.
But they said Mr. McCall's plan "doesn't go far enough fast enough," in the words of Joseph McDermott, president of the Civil Service Employees Association.
"He had an opportunity to show leadership but instead took the expedient route," Mr. McDermott said.
Spokesmen for Mr. McDermott and for Howard A. Shafer, president of the Public Employees Federation, said their unions would explore whether to return to court to challenge Mr. McCall's plan.
Mr. McCall said he "understood how union leaders have to make statements that impress their members."
He said the unions were trying to use the pension-repayment issue as leverage to persuade the Governor and Legislature to supplement pension payments with a cost-of-living adjustment or other increase.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 8, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about State Comptroller H. Carl McCall's plan for New York State to repay money that it diverted illegally from the state's pension system misstated one effect of the plan. Because the former accounting system for the pension fund is being phased back in, it will not be until the 1999 fiscal year that state and local governments' annual contributions to the fund are greater than if Mr. McCall had required a return to the former accounting method immediately. The 1999 comparison in the article was drawn, incorrectly, with a method struck down last month by the Court of Appeals. That new accounting method was approved by the Governor and Legislature in 1990 and enabled a $4 billion raid on the pension fund.

HEADLINE: Culture Dispute With Paris Now Snags World Accord

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 7

 BODY:
With arguments resolved over wheat and corn subsidies, as well as exports of pig meat and skimmed milk powder, the world trade talks came down to this today: Can the United States tolerate France's determination to go on protecting and subsidizing its movie industry in order to stave off a perceived Hollywood onslaught from the likes of "Jurassic Park" and "Terminator 2?"
After almost 23 hours of negotiations with the European Community's chief negotiator on Monday and today, the answer from Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, was no. 
 He then left Brussels to explain his views to world trade negotiators in Geneva, before returning to Washington. Mr. Kantor intended to continue talks in Europe, but it was not immediately clear when they would resume.
Although Mr. Kantor said there was still sufficient time to wrap up an accord, the former Hollywood lawyer said he would stand firm on trying to abolish France's box-office levies on foreign-made movies, which it uses to subsidize French film making.
His declaration came after the marathon negotiations with the Europeans had engineered a settlement on the long-divisive agriculture issues that the French, long intransigent on farm issues, had finally approved.
There was one clear victory for Mr. Kantor today. After years of a Japanese ban on rice imports, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said he would reluctantly open the market to foreign rice, removing a big stumbling block to the conclusion of the talks by the Dec. 15 deadline. [Page D1.]
 
Hopes Raised for Accord
 The agreement on farm trade had significantly raised hopes that the European Community and the United States would declare a trade peace, substantially clearing the way for successful completion of the seven-year-long world trade talks, which are intended to lift tariffs and revive the international economy. On Dec. 15, President Clinton's special authority to frame an accord and send it to Congress for an up-or-down, no-amendments vote expires.
But with the differences between Europeans and Americans persisting, uncertainty hovered around the negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, even though powerful momentum appeared to have gathered on both sides of the Atlantic to insure an accord by the deadline.
 
'So Much is at Stake'
 "We have made so much progress and so much is at stake, it simply can't be possible that a deal of this magnitude will not be finalized," Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's negotiator, said after briefing community foreign ministers on his talks with Mr. Kantor.
Long overshadowed by the fight over farm issues in the world trade talks, the simmering conflict over movies, television programs and musical recordings is gaining prominence here.
A variety of French resentments and doubts have coalesced around a dark vision of Hollywood's dinosaurs gobbling up the last vestiges of cultural independence in Europe.
The issue has contrived to channel old French convictions about the crassness of American movies and television, and new French economic and cultural insecurity, into a single crusade, the theme of which was bluntly expressed by the actor and singer Renaud: "It's 'Dallas' or French creativity."
The United States, in turn, has become increasingly angry at what it sees as France's attempt to provide unfair protection and financing for its film industry while indulging in a wave of anti-Americanism thinly disguised behind pious expressions of concern for European culture.
Daniel Toscan de Plantier, president of Unifrance, the association that promotes French films, acknowledged that Hollywood in effect supported the French movie industry, but he argued that this was justified.
"We receive 100 percent of the tax and U.S. movies account for 57 percent of the box-office return, so Hollywood supports us," he said. "What is good for France is good for France because it is not good for the United States and other countries."
However, he added, Hollywood effectively barred French movies from wide distribution in the United States. "When he have 10 percent of the U.S. market," he said, "we will suppress our taxes and levies."
 
American States the Essential
 Mr. Kantor was firm, as well. "No Uruguay Round of trade talks will be finalized," he insisted, "unless this issue is resolved." He referred specifically to the way that audio-visual material would be bought and sold under the new trade rules, on which negotiations began in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay.
Looking tired after the negotiating marathon, the American representative added that he was "disappointed but not discouraged, whatsoever" that a complete settlement of trade problems with Europe had proved elusive. And he said the outlines of "the most sweeping trade agreement in history" were visible. "There is absolutely and without a doubt enough time," Mr. Kantor said, to meet the Dec. 15 deadline.
Sir Leon, while declaring that he "repudiated entirely" the American arguments over the movie trade that led to the breakdown of talks, also said that an accord was within reach.
On the issue of the movie tax, Mr. Kantor argued that because 57 percent of box-office receipts in France came from American movies, money that was rightfully American was being diverted into French hands to pay for film subsidies. Similarly, the levies on television movies, most of them American, and on videocassettes, amounted to a way of milking American talent to support the French.
Resolving this dispute -- which has emerged because the current talks are aimed for the first time at extending GATT rules to services -- is certain to be arduous.
The conflict brings two very big things face to face: a huge American export industry -- the nation's second largest after aerospace with sales in Europe alone of $3.7 billion last year -- and a huge dose of Gallic pride, viscerally attached to the notion that France is the sanctuary of serious cinema.
"We have a formal commitment from Prime Minister Edouard Balladur not to yield on this issue," said Mr. Toscan de Plantier, the French movie-industry official. "The livelihoods of 70,000 people in the French film industry depend on this."
Besides the foreign film tax, which amounts to 11 percent on a ticket, American objections to current French practice have centered on a quota system used to limit the amount of American programming on television. The levies apply to TV movies and to videocassettes, and they raised about $350 million last year. This money, in turn, was distributed by a Government group to subsidized production of about 150 French films.
The quota system stems from a European Community directive adopted in 1989 that calls on television stations in the European Community's 12 countries to reserve a majority of air time for European-produced material. France has interpreted this directive the most assiduously, insisting that 60 percent of programs be reserved for European material, the bulk of it French.
The issue has become particularly thorny now that several United States media companies want to provide cable- or satellite-delivered services like cartoon channels that would clearly violate the quotas.
"These quotas will be a serious threat to the future of American movies and TV programs unless they are halted or phased out over a number of years," the American Motion Picture Association said in a statement. "Moreover, the new technology -- satellite-delivered programs, pay-per-view, premium subscription channels on cable, all the magic of new ways to hurl programs all over Europe at the speed of light -- this new technology cannot be restricted by artificial barriers planted by parliaments."
 
A Deal, but Not Any Deal
 Mr. Kantor indicated that a compromise on quotas could be found, but he was firm in rejecting the French system of taxes and other charges used to subsidize its movie industry, the most substantial film business left in Europe.
"We are willing to try to deal with broadcast quotas and to work on the question of subsidies," he said, "but we are not willing to sell out the rights of hard-working individuals to collect their royalties. American producers and actors are not getting their full royalties."
His tone suggested that President Clinton had drawn a line at this issue and that there would be little room for negotiation as the deadline for a GATT accord approached. The President has a vital electoral base in California and declared in October on the audio-visual products question that "this is a vital jobs issue as well as a fairness issue for America."
Alain Juppe, the French Foreign Minister, summed up national sentiment in declaring today that "America has shown intransigence over the audio-visual question."
He also listed other issues -- especially a need to toughen European trade legislation to make it as effective as American laws, and continuing differences over subsidies to the civil aircraft industry -- as standing in the way of a GATT agreement.

HEADLINE: After Stern Lecture, Man in Riot Beating Gets Maximum Term

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7

 BODY:
With a stern lecture and a final, silent showing of the brutal videotapes with which the case began, a judge today sentenced Damian M. Williams to a maximum 10-year term for a series of beatings that have come to symbolize the Los Angeles riots 19 months ago. Under California law he is likely to serve about three and a half years.
"Mr. Williams, it is intolerable in this society to attack and maim people because of their race," said Judge John Ouderkirk of Superior Court, referring to attacks by the black defendant that included the beating of three Hispanic victims, an Asian and a white truck driver, Reginald O. Denny. 
 Mr. Williams, who was acquitted in October of a series of charges that could have sent him to prison for life, was sentenced to eight years for felony mayhem on Mr. Denny and four consecutive six-month sentences for misdemeanor assault on the other victims.
Mr. Williams, who is now 20 years old, frowned as his sentence was pronounced, then smiled and gave a thumbs-up sign. His lawyer, Edi M. O. Faal, said later that Mr. Williams had expected the maximum sentence and that he was demonstrating feelings of relief at the end of the proceedings.
In an interview with the Wave Newspaper Group, a newspaper chain that mainly serves a black readership, Mr. Williams said of the riots, "People were just out of control like a pack of rats running after cheese." He added, "I was just caught up in the rapture."
"What we did was wrong," he went on in the interview. "It was unjustified, even though it was in the heat of the moment. Being in jail has caused me to mature a lot and I see that." The interview is to be published Wednesday.
The District Attorney's Office said that with good behavior, Mr. Williams was likely to spend only the next three years and eight months in prison given the time he has already spent in jail, 18 months, and a pattern in California in which prisoners normally serve half their terms. Mr. Faal said he would appeal the convictions and hoped that his client would be free sooner.
Judge Ouderkirk today also confirmed a plea bargain for Mr. Williams's co-defendant, Henry K. Watson, 29. He will remain free on probation following a conviction on one count of misdemeanor assault and a guilty plea to a felony assault on which the jury had been deadlocked.
 
Some See Bias in System
 Today's sentencing brought to a close more than two years of criminal proceedings that have created turmoil in Los Angeles following the videotaped beating of a black motorist, Rodney G. King, by white police officers in March 1991.
Mr. Williams's crimes were part of a storm of violence that swept the city on April 29, 1992, when four officers were acquitted of assault charges in a state trial. Two of the officers were later convicted in a Federal trial of violating Mr. King's civil rights; they are now serving 30-month sentences in prison.
Supporters of Mr. Williams say they believe he is being treated more harshly than the officers because of a racial bias in the criminal justice system.
The Rev. Cecil Murray of the First A.M.E. Church, one of the city's most influential black ministers, said: "Some say these cases are legally different, but contextually this says to blacks that the pattern of history continues. If you are going to have mercy, let's be consistent."
 
'He Represents Violence'
 Judge Ouderkirk made a point of explicating the legal bases of his sentencing today and of emphasizing the extent of Mr. Williams's violence, the helplessness of his victims and what he described as his lack of remorse. "It is hard to credit the statement of remorse given by Mr. Williams to his probation officer, given the defendant's spitting on Mr. Denny and his victory dance performed in the intersection within a few feet of Mr. Denny's bloody body," the judge said.
Deputy District Attorney Janet Moore, whose prosecution case was rejected almost entirely by the jury, told a news conference: "I hate what Mr. Williams did. I hate what Mr. Williams represents. He represents violence. He represents brutality."
Peter Arenella, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who has been following the case, said: "In any sentencing decision there's a balance drawn between the needs of the community and the culpability of the individual defendant. In this case, Judge Ouderkirk clearly focused almost exclusively on the needs of the community to send a stern message about what will happen to individuals who engage in violent criminal behavior during a riot."
Among those who disagreed with the judge was Carolyn Walters, the forewoman of the jury, who is an unemployed legal secretary. Outside the courtroom today, she said she believed that Mr. Williams should have received a sentence of two years, which would have allowed him to walk free because of the time he has already served.
"I'm sure politics had a lot to do with the sentence," she said. "I would have to say the procedures themselves were not fair. The charges were excessive, and I believe this sentence is not fair. It is too harsh."
Mr. Williams is the most visible of a dozen men tried in connection with the scores of beatings that were captured on videotape at the intersection of Florence and Normandie Avenues in South-Central Los Angeles during the first hours of the riots. The replaying of portions of videotapes in the courtroom were a reminder of the brutality of that day, during which crowds of men swept through the intersection, chasing down and attacking motorists. Most of the attackers have never been identified or brought to trial.
Though the trial was over and the sentence passed, debate continued in this divided city over race and judicial fairness. Melanie Lomax, a black lawyer and former member of the city's Police Commission, said, "My head tells me that there was something right in this sentence because the judge utterly rejected the notion that Damian Williams was not responsible for his actions."
But Roy Evans, who is black and the president of Bridge Back, a work furlough program for juvenile offenders, said of the sentencing, "This is an excellent example of the kind of dual justice we have in Southern California, one for blacks and one for whites."
Stephen Clark, president of the New Frontier Democratic Club, the oldest black political club in the city, said, "I'm just glad that the episode is over." Mr. Clark said he hoped that attention would now turn from court proceedings to the social and economic issues that underlie the city's divisions and violence.

HEADLINE: Japanese Reluctantly Agree to Open Rice Market

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 7

 BODY:
After decades of declarations that rice farmers hold a sacred place in Japan that must be protected from foreign incursions, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said today that Japan would reluctantly open its rice market to imports, removing a major stumbling block to the conclusion of world trade talks by the middle of next week.
In South Korea, which also has a highly protected rice market, farmers and politicians took to the streets today when it became clear that President Kim Young Sam had secretly agreed to a deal almost identical to Japan's. 
 More than 30,000 protesters gathered in front of the main railroad station in Seoul, and there were violent clashes as thousands surged toward the American Embassy carrying signs, condemning the United States for bringing ruin to the country's 5.7 million farmers.
 
Political Turmoil in Japan
 In Japan, the Socialist Party, the biggest component of the eight-party coalition Government that came to power this year, and the most steadfast defender of Japanese farmers, threatened to leave the coalition, an event that would likely cause the Government's collapse.
In addition, the opposition Liberal Democrats, who had long governed the country, were maneuvering to use the rice issue to derail Mr. Hosokawa's political reform efforts and bring an end to the 70 percent approval rating he has enjoyed.
California growers, who specialize in the short-grain rice favored in Japan, would benefit from an opening of the Japanese market. If Japan were to turn to California for just 5 percent of its annual rice consumption of about 10 million metric tons, it would absorb one-quarter of the state's maximum crop of about two million metric tons.
Gulf Coast growers, who raise long-grain rice, America's dominant rice crop, would be unlikely to win a big stake of the Japanese market, but would still benefit if the move had the effect of raising world rice prices.
"This is an extremely significant, very positive development for the California rice industry and for rice growers everywhere," said John W. Kenward of the Rice Growers Association in West Sacramento, Calif.
In Japan, Mr. Hosokawa is expected to make the landmark announcement, whose symbolism and political importance here outweigh its economic impact, in a speech to the nation on Friday, members of his Cabinet said today.
Given the obvious political sensitivities, Mr. Hosokawa's Government has carefully stage-managed the rice debate for months. It waited until the last moment to agree to the opening of the market so that it would appear that Japan was cornered by its trading partners who are struggling to complete a world accord by Dec. 15.
Government leaders publicly insisted that they would never open the market, but in private acknowledged that it was inevitable and said the real task was to prepare the groundwork so that they could keep the political backlash to a minimum.
The draft accord that was "sent" to Japan today by trade negotiators in Geneva, who are arguing over crucial late changes under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, was actually worked out by Japan and the United States several weeks ago and has been circulating in Tokyo for some time.
Even before Mr. Hosokawa's declaration, however, the political rebellion threatened many of the economic and anti-corruption reforms at the center of Japan's slow-burning political revolution.
While Mr. Hosokawa's political lieutenants seemed relatively sure that the Socialists' threat to walk out was a bluff, staged for the benefit of their farmer constituents, they were clearly concerned that whatever magic seemed to surround the first 100 days of his premiership was quickly wearing off.
In the last week, Mr. Hosokawa has issued contradictory statements on how and when he would announce an economic stimulus package to rescue Japan's troubled economy and all but abandoned his commitment to pass a political reform bill by the end of the year. He also dismissed his Defense Minister for speaking openly about amending the Japanese Constitution.
 
Face-Saving Formula
 "This has not been our finest few days," one of his political operatives said tonight. In the end Mr. Hosokawa worked out a face-saving formula that allowed him to claim at least the smallest victory. But Japanese industrialists, who have long called for dismantling the rice lobby, were ecstatic, saying they favored any move that would lead to freer world trade and expanded markets for their goods.
For years, Japan has resisted calls that every participant in GATT move to an "all tariffs" system that would have swept away rules like the one barring the import of foreign rice. Japan won agreement to a six-year moratorium on tariffs, in return for a formula in which foreign producers are given "minimum access" to the market, in this case 4 percent to 8 percent.
One year before the grace period ends, Japan is supposed to enter another negotiation over whether to extend the moratorium. Mr. Hosokawa's aides strongly denied today that the draft agreement required Japan to accept a tariff system after six years, but it appeared to do exactly that.
Given the fact that the rice agreement had been settled with the Japanese and GATT negotiators several weeks ago, Tsutomu Hata, Japan's Foreign Minister, made it clear that the Government would not press for further changes.
"This proposal is virtually the final one," Mr. Hata said, To ease the way, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii hinted today that the Government would compensate farmers hurt by the new trade rules.
For decades, Japan has cast its refusal to open the rice market as an issue of both national security and cultural identity. Though Japanese rice consumption has plummeted as the country has grown more affluent, the Government insisted for years that Japanese must be able to be self-sufficient rice producers, even if it meant that consumers had to pay six to eight times the world price.
Moreover, Japanese are taught from earliest youth that the crop is one with the national soul. Rice is harvested every year by the Emperor in a palace ritual, and offered to the gods at Shinto shrines. Each grain is regarded as a kami, or deity, in the Shinto religion. At one time, rice was the currency in which Japanese paid taxes.
But oddly enough it did not become a major part of Japanese cuisine until 150 years ago. And Japan has imported rice before, particularly from Korea when it was still Japanese territory from 1905 to the end of World War II.
The cultural aura surrounding rice has also served a critical political end: Sustaining the powerful rice farmers and assuring their prosperity. For years, as voters moved to the cities, farmers maintained a disproportionate share of the vote in Japanese elections. And although they are among the most inefficient producers of rice in the world, they became the symbol of how the interests of producers took precedence over those of urban consumers.
Rice's sacred standing in society here bred resentments, and fed into the calls for political change that Mr. Hosokawa capitalized on earlier this year when the long-dominant Liberal Democrats were swept from office. He was clearly delighted when a rice shortage this year forced Japan to set aside its rules and import limited quantities, and he suggested to foreign correspondents several months ago that those events would ease the way for permanent liberalization.

HEADLINE: Fed Official In Warning On Inflation

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
A top Federal Reserve official cautioned today that there were early signs that inflation might be picking up and that the central bank should make sure that did not happen.
"This is an important time for monetary policy," the Fed's vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr., told a forum sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute. "We're at an important crossroads." 
 But the Fed official told reporters after his speech that he was not arguing for a pre-emptive strike against inflation.
"There is no compelling evidence at this time that inflationary pressures are building," Mr. Mullins told the forum. But he added that "there are some other early warning signals that are twitching, or starting to twitch." Among them were higher gold and commodity prices and increasing bond yields, which often advance as expectations of inflation mount.
"The increase in long bond rates needs to be a special concern," Mr. Mullins said. "If inflation starts moving, and long rates move up, this hurts not only long-term growth prospects but it likely hurts near-term growth prospects."
He was generally upbeat, however, about the outlook for the economy.
"We're having a strong fourth quarter," he said. But it was unclear, he said, whether it would be as strong as the corresponding period of 1992, when the economy grew at a rate of 5.7 percent. He saw modest growth ahead, of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent.
 
Survey of Buyers
 A similar economic assessment came today from the National Association of Purchasing Management, an organization of the nation's wholesale buyers.
In its semiannual survey of its members, the group predicted 1994 economic growth of 4.7 percent, before adjusting for inflation of 2.1 percent.
The most upbeat industries were paper, electronics, jewelry, toys, sporting goods, musical instruments, food and beverages, printing and publishing, wood and apparel.
The trade group also said holiday retail sales this year promised to be the strongest in 10 years. But the survey warned that employment would decline next year because corporations would continue to lay off workers.
In the survey, 59 percent of the respondents said they thought President Clinton's health care plan would hurt their companies.

HEADLINE: 5 Research Teams to Hunt for New Drugs in Nature, Gently

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The Government today announced the first awards under a program to find and produce new drugs from plants and animals in the developing world while preserving endangered species.
Five groups, each representing unusual collaborations among university researchers, environmental organizations, pharmaceutical companies, museums and government agencies, will share $2.5 million a year for five years. 
 Developing new drugs from natural products not only may produce treatments for diseases like cancer and AIDS; it could also promote economic growth in emerging nations through sustainable harvesting instead of clearing forests for conventional farming or other land uses that can wipe out species, officials said.
Reversing conventional development trends requires solutions that will benefit not only the environment but also populations that need economic alternatives, said Dr. Philip E. Schambra, director of the Fogarty International Center. The center is the international arm of the National Institutes of Health, a sponsor of the program.
 
Counterparts in Six Nations
 The five awards under the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups Program unite American scientists and institutions with their counterparts in Argentina, Cameroon, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico and Suriname.
More than 20 research institutions and organizations worldwide are to be involved in the effort, which is sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development and the National Science Foundation, along with the health institutes.
Dr. Francesca Grifo, who manages the program for the Fogarty center, said each of the winning projects calls for gathering data on conventional medicines, prospecting for biological chemicals active against disease and testing them, training native people to do the work, and sharing the patents and royalties from any commercial products with people from the region where the material was found.
 
Five Teams Named
 Dr. David G. I. Kingston of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Va., leads a team that is studying rain forest plants in Suriname. Together with Conservation International, the Missouri Botanical Garden and Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, researchers are working with forest people to identify traditional plant medicines that have drug potential.
A team headed by Dr. Walter Lewis of Washington University in St. Louis, which included the Monsanto Company, is to look at medicinal plants used in the Andean rain forests of Peru.
Dr. Jerrold Meinwald of Cornell University, working with Bristol-Myers Squibb, leads a team that will go to Costa Rica and look at insects and related species as potential sources of drugs. In addition, Costa Rican scientists and students will train at Cornell on how to isolate potentially useful chemicals from insects.
Dr. Brian G. Schuster of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, working with the Smithsonian Institution and two drug companies, will study rain forest plants in Nigeria and Cameroon for treatments for parasitic diseases.
Researchers led by Dr. Barbara N. Timmermann of the University of Arizona is to look for drugs and crop-protection agents that might be found in plants from arid and semi-arid areas of Latin America. The American Cyanamid Company, along with Louisiana State University and Purdue University, will assist in looking at plants from Mexico, Chile and Argentina.

HEADLINE: Consumer Installment Debt Jumps

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Increasingly confident consumers took on an unexpectedly large $8.1 billion more of new installment debt in October than they paid off, a tally by the Federal Reserve showed today.
Even though previously published figures had shown hefty gains in sales of automotive and other retail goods during October, analysts said today that they were impressed by the degree to which consumers were willing to take on fresh debt. 
 "It's a barometer of consumer confidence," said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, calling the Fed's report a "very good precursor" for the holiday season. "The consumer's willing to borrow again -- and borrow confidently."
 
Mortgage Refinancings Help
 The October increase was believed to be the biggest gain since January 1988, except for a big jump a year later that reflected technical changes in compilation. A main reason for consumers' willingness to take on new debt, Mr. Platt said, is that many households have taken advantage of the lowest long-term interest rates in two decades to refinance mortgages, sometimes more than once, sharply lowering their monthly payments.
A second report today by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America showed mortgage delinquencies fell to a 19-year low during the third quarter. All geographic regions and all loan types and categories of delinquency showed improvement.
"With employment and incomes firming up across the board, fewer people are struggling to make their mortgage payments," Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the trade group, said.
Only 4.21 percent of homeowners were behind in making mortgage payments in the July-September period, a reversal following a second-quarter jump that carried the delinquency rate to 4.39 percent from 4.29 percent.
The Mortgage Bankers Association found that 30-day delinquencies fell 12 basis points, to 2.78 percent. The two more serious categories also declined. Sixty-day delinquencies were down 4 basis points, to 0.65 percent, while 90-day delinquencies improved 2 basis points, to 0.78 percent.
The Fed's report on installment debt was marked by a $3.9 billion rise in outstanding automotive credit and included a very substantial $3.2 billion advance for revolving credit, a widely watched component that includes credit cards.
The rest of the gain, $1 billion, was in the "other" category, which covers such things as loans for mobile homes, tuition, boats and travel.
"The ability to take on debt is still very favorable," said Susan M. Sterne, a student of consumer behavior and president of Economic Analysis Associates in Stowe, Vt., in reaction to today's report. "It's a big positive for the fourth quarter."
Ms. Sterne cautioned, however, that consumers might have reached the limits of their spending and borrowing and that some other source of strength would probably be needed if the economy is to keep moving smartly ahead in 1994, when upper-income taxpayers are faced with paying 1993 tax increases that took effect retroactively.
The $8.1 billion rise in October debt outstanding was well above the $5 billion that had been generally expected and also exceeded September's advance, which the Fed revised downward to $6.1 billion. The October rise was at a 12.7 percent annual rate, compared with a 9.6 percent rate of increase in September, to bring the seasonally adjusted total to $776.71 billion.
The installment debt figures are rougher than many provided by the Government because the breakdown of extensions and liquidations was dropped years ago for unreliability and because they do not include such fast-growing substitutes as automobile leasing and home equity loans.
"But still, the revolving credit component is important to watch from the standpoint of helping to boost consumption," said Michael P. Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York.
The Fed's report today also showed that interest rates charged by commercial banks on four-year new car loans averaged 7.63 percent in November, down from 7.98 percent in August. Two-year personal loans were 13.22 percent, down from 13.45 percent, and credit cards were 16.30 percent, down from 16.59 percent.

HEADLINE: Texas County Retreats Over Apple's Gay Policy

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Tex., Dec. 7

 BODY:
A Texas county beat a clear retreat today in its battle over Apple Computer's policy of granting health benefits to homosexual couples. Williamson County, eager to attract high-tech jobs, offered new tax breaks that the company quickly accepted, calling them equal to those the county commissioners turned down last week in protest of that policy.
As he did last week, Commissioner David Hays provided the swing vote at a jammed meeting at the courthouse in Georgetown, the county seat. After arm-twisting by Gov. Ann W. Richards, who had lobbied to keep Apple from going to another state, Mr. Hays joined two other commissioners to approve nearly $1 million in tax incentives to Apple in return for the company's agreeing to build an office complex in this suburban county a few miles north of Austin. Apple said it planned a ground-breaking next spring on the $80 million customer support center. 
 Explaining the difference between the package rejected last week and the one ratified today required a bit of semantic legerdemain. In the first case, Apple would have received a formal tax abatement; now, it will pay full taxes but receive a reimbursement from the county for the costs of road construction and other work it will undertake near the 128-acre site.
Apple Computer Inc. was delighted. "To us, it's essentially the same agreement we had before," said Lisa Byrne, a spokeswoman.
 
Different Bookkeeping
 Nonetheless, Mr. Hays insisted that the county was no longer giving public money to Apple, instead only returning Apple's own money to the company, and he said he stood by both of his votes.
"Last week I was asked to vote to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize, and therefore tacitly endorse, a benefits policy with which I disagree," he explained to the crowd at this morning's county meeting. "Today's vote does nothing of the kind."
Despite his explanation, gay-rights organizations hailed the vote as a victory and local opponents of gay rights denounced Mr. Hays as a traitor.
"Yesterday, David Hays was a statesman," said Mike East, a radio talk-show host in Austin who had helped lead the move to deny the tax breaks. "Today, he became a politician."
Mr. East and dozens of his fellow Williamson County residents wore tags pinned on their shirts that read: "Just Say, No! An Apple today will take family values away." A roughly equal number of others in the crowd had stickers proclaiming, "Keep Apple in Williamson County" or "Hate is not a family value."
One man circulated through the crowd, handing out a religious tract, "This Was Your Life!" about Judgment Day. He attached mimeographed pages of the Bible with verses pertaining to homosexuality highlighted in a yellow pen.
 
Unwanted Attention
 After achieving a moment of largely unexpected and unwanted national fame as the place willing to kick away 1,500 high-tech jobs by standing up against Apple over the benefits issue, community leaders here seemed relieved by today's vote and hoped the controversy was behind them.
"Lord, we confide to you that these last seven days have felt like seven years," said the Rev. Jim Chandler, pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Round Rock, in an invocation shortly before the commissioners' vote. "Lord, lift us above this controversy, out of this whirlwind."
Ever since the first vote last Tuesday, the county has become the focus of controversy around the nation, with many gay and lesbian groups vilifying it as a symbol of anti-gay bigotry while some conservative and religious leaders groups had praised the commissioners for taking such a clear stand in defense of "family values."
 
Subject for Campaign
 Even if Apple's relocation is now resolved with the reversal today, the earlier action may wind up as a political issue in next year's statewide elections. Over the weekend, for instance, the state Republican executive committee in Texas formally praised Williamson County for its courage in denying Apple the tax breaks.
With Governor Richards having acted so forcefully to help keep Apple in Texas, her views on the matter are clear enough. What is unclear is whether her likely Republican opponent, George W. Bush, son of the former President, will press the issue by staking out any differences with her.
Some gay-rights activists had argued that Apple should teach the county a lesson by taking its high-tech, high-wage jobs elsewhere. The company said it had been besieged by communities, in Texas and elsewhere, begging Apple to consider them for relocation.
But many more argued that the county was a good place to force a discussion of gay issues and that there would be a symbolic loss if Apple gave up on its plans to come there.
"Williamson County has gotten a good education in Gay 101," said David M. Smith, director of public education for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, standing on the county courthouse steps just after the vote. "The bottom line is, jobs triumphed over prejudice."
But many in the county, including Commissioner Hays and the two commissioners who voted against Apple for a second time today, said they were still offended by the company's policy. And each of the commissioners said they resented suggestions that the county was intolerant, one of them noting that the courthouse where everyone was watching today's vote was the same place where a local prosecutor had "broken the back of the Ku Klux Klan" in the area during the 1920's.
One commissioner, Jerry Mehevec, has questioned whether it might even be illegal to grant Apple a tax break, since Texas has a law prohibiting homosexual acts. The law has been declared unconstitutional by lower state courts, and an appeal is pending.
Perhaps the principal architect of the second vote was a pro-Apple commissioner, Mike Heiligenstein, who managed to get Mr. Hays and Apple officials back to the table over the weekend and who also met with Governor Richards. He noted that the tax breaks were roughly equal in value to those the county had granted another big company, the Dell Computer Corporation, to locate in Williamson County.
But the star of the show, willingly or not, was Mr. Hays, who said today that "until last Tuesday I never had to choose between economic development and traditional family values."
Mr. Hays, a father of four who resigned his position with his family-owned title company to become a $42,000-a-year commissioner, said he remained proud of the way the county had debated Apple's policy.
"We expressed to a national forum our views on values," he said in an interview after the vote this morning. "We made a very strong statement about what we felt on that issue."
