HEADLINE: Asian Markets Reap Benefits From Revalued Chinese Currency 

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
International investors are betting that Asia's economies will get a lift from China's move last month to revalue its currency, the yuan, perplexing those analysts and economists who had argued that the shift would not have much effect. 
 In the last month, foreign investors have poured almost $6 billion into Asia's stock markets, with $1.2 billion entering last week, according to Nomura International, which tracks foreign trading data from Taiwan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. That does not include the deluge of cash that analysts say is flowing into Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, which do not disclose data on foreign trading.
 According to Emerging Portfolio Fund Research in Cambridge, Mass., equity funds dedicated to Asia outside Japan received $370 million in new investments the week after China's revaluation and another $471 million the week after that. 
 Last week, foreign fund managers bought $519 million worth of stock in Taiwan, according to Nomura. They bought $244 million worth of stock in Indonesia, a market one-sixth the size of Taiwan's. 
 ''If China has a currency that is going to appreciate,'' said Chua Hak Bin, an economist at DBS Bank in Singapore, ''then your currency becomes more competitive relative to China and your exports should do better.'' 
 So Taiwan and Thailand, whose electronics exports compete with those from China, would seem poised to benefit from a higher yuan. The same goes for South Korea. 
 But there is another rationale. The higher yuan means that Asia's other currencies will rise, so foreign investors who buy stocks denominated in those currencies stand to see a return even if stock prices go nowhere. 
 Rising currencies would tend to cancel out any additional export competitiveness gained as a result of the yuan's rise, however. Indeed, most Asian currencies have appreciated since China's move, including the ringgit, which Malaysia allowed to float freely after having pegged its value to the dollar since 1998. 
 And higher currencies are only part of the reason for some to invest in Asian markets. Richard Duncan, the author of ''The Dollar Crisis,'' said that the surge in foreign investment was only a continued side effect of the imbalance in global funds caused by an overvalued dollar. So long as Asian currencies do not appreciate to correct the region's yawning trade surplus with the United States, its central banks will recycle dollar earnings by buying American debt, keeping interest rates in the United States artificially low and financing continued American purchases of Asian goods, perpetuating the region's export engine. 
 Many economists said that China's decision to move the yuan 2 percent higher against the dollar and to begin using a basket of currencies to determine its target value, in place of the dollar peg, would do little to reverse this cycle. And the inflows of foreign funds into Asia's stock markets are only part of a buying binge that has put more than $20 billion into the region's markets so far this year, the biggest influx since at least 2000. 
 As Mr. Duncan said, despite this huge influx of investment, many Asian stocks still look cheap relative to corporate earnings, because of growing exports and low interest rates. So in many markets, speculation about the effect of a higher yuan is by no means the only thing driving prices higher. And in some, analysts say, the higher yuan may have little impact, or even a negative one. 
 India, for example, does not compete with China for manufactured exports and so is unlikely to see much change to its competitiveness, yet it has seen a rise in foreign buying since China's revaluation.
 Indonesia competes with China in textiles and it exports raw materials to China, so a more expensive yuan could help Indonesia sell more clothes and enable China to buy even more wood, palm oil and natural gas. 
 But most of those benefits are likely to be a long way down the road. In the meantime, Indonesia's economy is under pressure as high oil prices force the government to lower subsidies on fuel, causing prices to rise, increasing unemployment and reducing consumer spending.

HEADLINE: Preseason Introduction Can Also Be a Farewell 

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
The task for Eli Manning in Saturday's preseason opener at Cleveland should be clear: log 12 to 15 quality plays against a defense that is not his own, continue getting used to his receivers and avoid injury.
 Jared Lorenzen, the fourth-string quarterback, will approach the game with a completely different mind-set. For starters, Lorenzen is simply hoping to get into the game.
Should that happen, he would walk onto the field with a sense of urgency, for he knows his time with the Giants could end at any moment. 
 Lorenzen is one of a handful of undrafted Giants who are well aware that they could be on the practice field at the University at Albany one day, but in the unemployment line the next. 
 They must treat the preseason like the regular season and use it to show they have the skills to make the 53-man roster, or at least the eight-player practice squad.
 ''For guys like myself and other guys that will be playing in the third, fourth quarters, it's make or break there,'' Lorenzen said, referring to the Cleveland game. ''It's whether or not you're going to have a job. We've got to go in a complete different mentality, knowing that we could not be here Sunday or Monday if we don't play well.''
 Adrian Awasom, the rookie defensive end from North Texas, said he was not nervous, but excited, for his first real taste of the pro game.
 ''It's basically our introduction to the N.F.L.,'' he said. ''It's a chance to put our name out there, just go out and prove you can play on this level.''
 But Awasom learned at practice Wednesday how difficult the fight for a roster spot was. The defensive coordinator Tim Lewis berated him loudly enough for the rest of the team and the fans to hear after he lined up incorrectly during a drill.
 Coach Tom Coughlin said that, to stand out, the players battling for those final spots needed to show several things: ''Can they make plays? How do they handle the opportunity to be in the National Football League? How do they compete? What kind of physical players are they? How will they fit on special teams?''
 Lorenzen is 6 foot 4 and said he reported to camp at 293 pounds -- big for a quarterback. He said he felt fortunate that Coughlin had given him a second chance. Lorenzen signed a free-agent contract as a rookie last season, but left the team shortly afterward for personal reasons.
 Manning is secure as the starter, and Jesse Palmer and Tim Hasselbeck are competing for the No. 2 spot. At best, Lorenzen appears bound for the practice squad.
 Still, he said he remained motivated to prove he could play.
 ''I don't want to be the dumb rookie that doesn't know what he's doing,'' he said. ''I just go in and I try and do as best as I possibly can and just try not to look too stupid doing it.''
 In his four years as a starter at Kentucky, Lorenzen set university records for passing yards (10,354), completions (862) and touchdown passes (78).
 Running back Ryan Grant also has solid credentials from his years at Notre Dame -- he has the 11th most rushing yards in university history. But Grant was not selected in this year's N.F.L. draft, and he, too, must prove himself the hard way. 
 The challenge does not scare him.
 ''I love the game; I know I can play,'' Grant said. 
 ''I felt like I was going to get drafted, but it's over with. To hold onto stuff that's in the past, that really has no bearing on what I'm doing now. That's not going to help me in any aspect. I've just got to keep moving forward, keep working.''
 Entering his second season and second stint with the Giants, the running back Luke Lawton has put in a lot of work, but he has yet to play a snap in the N.F.L. In addition to the Giants, he had stints with the Bills and the Falcons as a rookie free agent last season.
 As long as teams keep signing him, Lawton said, he would keep pursuing his N.F.L. dream.
 ''God has blessed me with the opportunity to do what I love,'' said Lawton, who played at McNeese State. 
 ''I'm not ever going to quit until I'm starting, because I know in my heart that I'm good enough to be a starter.''

HEADLINE: Research Scientist's $105 Million Is a Way to Give Back to N.Y.U.

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
A scientist who hid from the Nazis as a child, escaped a Communist regime, did pioneering medical research and made a fortune on a blockbuster drug will give $105 million to the New York University School of Medicine, his professional home for four decades, university officials said yesterday.
 The donation by the scientist, Jan T. Vilcek, 72, is one of the four or five largest ever given to a school or health care institution in New York City, and among the biggest in the nation, according to organizations that track such gifts. Dr. Vilcek, an immigrant who has no children, said he was giving most of his fortune to the medical school that has nurtured him and his work, and that cared for his wife, Marica, when she was seriously ill.
''I never expected that I would be in a position to have this kind of wealth,'' he said yesterday in a telephone interview from Santa Fe, N.M., where he is vacationing. ''Immigrants don't usually come with big checkbooks. I came to this country with two suitcases full of useless stuff.'' 
 As a longtime employee of the institution receiving the gift, Dr. Vilcek, a professor of microbiology, stands in marked contrast to most major donors to universities and hospitals, who are either charitable foundations or moguls from unrelated businesses, people like Sanford I. Weill, Carl C. Icahn and Maurice R. Greenberg. 
 ''I'm amazed by this gift,'' said Dr. Robert M. Glickman, dean of the medical school. ''For him to put his good fortune back into the medical school, into medical research, is not only wonderful but unusual. It's the largest gift in the history of the medical school, and I think the largest by any faculty member to any school anywhere.''
 Dr. Vilcek headed a research team whose discoveries led to the development of Remicade, a drug used to treat Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Scientists believe that the work also has implications for treating other diseases, like ulcerative colitis.
 More remarkable, perhaps, than Dr. Vilcek's work at N.Y.U. is that he ever got there at all.
 His Jewish family survived the long German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the Holocaust. Though they were forced from their comfortable apartment in Bratislava, and into a succession of smaller ones, they were, at first, passed over when many of Czechoslovakia's Jews were deported to concentration camps. When the campaign to round up and exterminate Jews intensified, they fled the city for the countryside.
 ''I spent the last year of the war with my mother in hiding, and my father somehow made his way through the front lines to the Russian Army,'' he said. ''I was 11 at the time, and it still seemed like an exciting game of some sort. I was aware of the seriousness of the situation, but not completely.''
 The people who hid him were strangers in a village. ''They were among those exceptional people who took great risks for others,'' he said. It was an experience, he added, that left a powerful impression about the value of helping people.
 Years later, when Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule, his parents -- his mother was an ophthalmologist and his father worked for a coal mining company -- wanted him to become a doctor.
 ''I resisted it at first,'' he said. ''I would have preferred another profession, but in a Communist country, the law was out of the question and economics was out of the question, because they were both too politicized.''
 After becoming a doctor and a research scientist, in 1964, when he was 31, Dr. Vilcek and his wife decided to escape.
 ''In those days you could not really leave, legally, so my wife and I received permission to visit Vienna for a weekend,'' he said. ''We were able to get out that way, and we did not go back.'' In 1965, they settled in Manhattan, where they have lived ever since, and he went to work at N.Y.U.
 Dr. Vilcek was one of the early researchers on interferon, one of the first immune system proteins discovered and manipulated by scientists. Since the early 1980's, he has worked with another immune protein, TNF-alpha, which is involved in fighting infections. Sometimes the immune system goes awry and produces too much TNF-alpha, causing the severe inflammation that inflicts pain and tissue damage in autoimmune diseases.
 Dr. Vilcek and his colleagues developed a chemical that blocked TNF-alpha. Centocor, a pharmaceutical company now part of Johnson & Johnson, and the N.Y.U. scientists turned that discovery into infliximab, which Centocor sells as Remicade.
 Remicade hit the market in 1998 and quickly became a major success. The resulting royalties made Dr. Vilcek a very rich man, as well as earning a large amount of money for the university. Sales of Remicade last year were close to $2 billion, according to IMS Health, a consulting company that tracks drug sales, making it one of the 25 best-selling prescription drugs in the country.
 N.Y.U. officials said Dr. Vilcek's gift was in three parts -- a lump sum of cash, the rights to some future royalties, and a trust. The school declined to state the value of each part, but estimated the combined worth at $105 million.
 Most of the money will go toward the sort of basic research on microbes that Dr. Vilcek has done.
 Dr. Glickman said it would be used to recruit scientists and upgrade laboratories. A portion of the money will go to the medical school's ear, nose and throat department.
 According to the Greater New York Hospital Association, the largest gift to any medical institution in the city was a $130 million bequest to Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, from Donald and Mildred Othmer, in 2000.
 Dr. Vilcek's may be the single biggest gift to a medical school in the city, according to both the hospital association and The Chronicle of Higher Education. Sanford and Joan Weill gave $100 million to Cornell University's medical school in 1998, and another $100 million in 2002. The school was renamed in their honor.
 The donation by Dr. Vilcek ranks among the 30 largest ever given to a single college or university anywhere in the country, of which only a handful were specifically for medical work, according to a ranking maintained by The Chronicle of Higher Education.

HEADLINE: Officials Defend Actions to Keep Goldman Sachs Downtown

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Just six months ago, Goldman Sachs, the big investment bank, appeared to be in a bind. It had committed to building its headquarters across the street from ground zero, but it did not like the city and state plans for traffic and security around the site.
 So Goldman's executives did what they were trained to do: They traded their way out of a bad situation and wound up with a much more favorable one.
 City and state officials said on Wednesday that they had agreed to grant the company at least $150 million in tax breaks and to provide a total of $1.6 billion in federally subsidized Liberty Bonds to revive Goldman's plan to build a $2 billion tower in Battery Park City. 
 Though the deal is not yet sealed, the sweetened package of incentives, served up to a company that made $4.5 billion in profit last year, appeared to defy Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's claim to have ''essentially ended corporate welfare.'' Some critics said they believed Goldman had simply bluffed its way into a much better hand by threatening to relocate to Midtown.
 ''It's probably the case that Goldman really was playing the city and had no intention of leaving Lower Manhattan,'' said Jonathan Bowles, research director for the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit group that analyzes economic development programs.
 Charles Brecher, research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-financed watchdog group, questioned the fairness of subsidizing a company's choice of one location in the city over another.
 ''If they moved to Midtown, so what?'' Mr. Brecher said. ''Our perspective in the past on these things has been that it's about the city's tax base, not about one part versus another, whether it's Brooklyn or downtown.''
 But city and state officials, who have endured years of criticism that they have allowed downtown to languish in the wake of the 2001 terror attack, said the deal was necessary to eliminate the prospect of Goldman's moving thousands of workers to Midtown, which the firm's executives started threatening to do in the spring. In March, Goldman said it had scrapped plans for the new building in part because it did not like the state's plan for a West Street tunnel ending outside it.
 By pulling out, Goldman seized the leverage in its negotiations with city and state officials. Immediately, virtually all talks with companies considering a presence at or near ground zero came to a halt, downtown officials said.
 ''Every financial-services firm said, 'We want Goldman here at any cost,''' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership, a business group. ''Not because Goldman's competitors all want Goldman to get a good deal, but because their commitment is going to be a magnet for re-tenanting downtown.''
 Nonetheless, Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker, whose district includes Lower Manhattan, said he had no doubt that Goldman had been serious about finding a different location.
 ''It wasn't a play,'' Mr. Silver said yesterday. ''Goldman was very concerned about the tunnel. Even if they weren't leaving downtown, this is a reaffirmation by a major international business that they were committed to downtown.''
 Mr. Silver said the package of incentives offered to Goldman included about $6 million in commercial rent tax breaks that were made available, by legislation he pushed through in Albany this year, to any company leasing space downtown. It would also include the elimination of city and state sales tax on all computers and furnishings for the new building and credits of about $3,000 for each job Goldman adds downtown, although Goldman is not pledging to bring more jobs to the city.
 Wrapping up a deal to bring Goldman downtown would be a political triumph for Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki, said Steven Cohen, a professor of public administration at Columbia University.
 ''Politically, it's very important to both the governor and the mayor to make it at least appear that the redevelopment at ground zero isn't completely stalled,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''Obviously, it took a lot of money to make this happen.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's opponents in the mayoral race would be unlikely to criticize either the offering of incentives to Goldman or their cost, Mr. Cohen said.
 ''I don't see a political force that's going to make an issue out of this,'' he said. ''It's only going to be a political benefit now.''
 Even Mr. Bowles, who said he had generally praised the mayor for using corporate tax breaks sparingly, said he was pleased that Goldman had been lured back to the site.
 ''I'm ecstatic that Goldman is going to remain in Lower Manhattan,'' he said. ''Everybody knows how important they are to the future of the World Trade Center area. I just think we've given away too much.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Likes Jet Plan To Share Giants Stadium

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
New Jersey officials on Thursday applauded a proposal for a huge new football stadium in the Meadowlands sports complex to house the Giants and the Jets, urging the teams to consider a retractable dome that would allow bigger events, including the Super Bowl, at the site.
 The Jets, apparently intent on staying in New Jersey, presented an ambitious plan on Wednesday that would expand the $800 million stadium that the Giants proposed just four months ago when the Jets were still planning a move to the West Side of Manhattan.
Under the Jets proposal, given to the Giants and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and first reported in The Star-Ledger, the two teams would evenly split the cost of a 90,000-seat stadium, said L. Jay Cross, the Jets president. It suggests changes in the site plan that would connect the stadium more closely with the Xanadu retail and entertainment complex now rising on the other side of the Meadowlands. 
 If built, the new stadium would be the second-largest in the National Football League, behind the Washington Redskins' home, the 92,000-seat FedEx Field stadium, which is also considered the league's most profitable. 
 The sports authority president, George R. Zoffinger, said in a statement that with the new megastadium, the Meadowlands ''will be transformed into the most attractive sports and entertainment destination in the country.''
 If the stadium has a retractable dome, Mr. Zoffinger said in an interview, ''you get Super Bowl, the Final Four, political conventions, all the things that can stimulate the New Jersey economy.'' 
 ''It's not in the proposal, but it's something we're going to push for,'' Mr. Zoffinger said. ''This is the one opportunity in the next 50 years to get it right.'' 
 The Jets are hesitant, however. ''If the state wants to explore funding a retractable roof, we will consider it,'' said Matthew Higgins, a team vice president. 
 For now, the team, which has been playing in the Meadowlands since 1984, has not ruled out a move to New York. Mr. Cross said team officials had accepted an invitation from the Queens borough president, Helen Marshall, to look at a site at Willets Point. 
 The Giants' chief executive, John Mara, declined to discuss the proposal. ''We've been in discussions with the Jets for quite a while now,'' he said, ''and our agreement with them is that we would keep these discussions private.'' 
 The Jets and Giants have been negotiating since the Jets' plan to move to the West Side of Manhattan fell through in June. While the Giants had always wanted the Jets to remain in New Jersey as a partner in the privately financed new stadium, the prospect has complicated talks involving the Giants, the Sports Authority and the Xanadu developers. 
 The sports complex's future has been rewritten many times in the last few years, and James E. McGreevey, then the governor, charged the sports authority with getting the state out of the sports business. To revitalize the site, on prime real estate within sight of Manhattan, the authority approved the five-million-square-foot Xanadu project, surrounding the Continental Airlines Arena, home of the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils. 
 The Giants' plans for a new stadium raised even more questions, now under negotiation, about how the sports complex would accommodate the construction and the additional traffic generated by Xanadu. 
 Mr. Cross said the Jets proposal would retain the 75,000 seats now available in general seating at the Giants Stadium, expand luxury suites and add 8,000 club seats, while there are only a handful now. He said he had no estimate of the total cost.
 Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the football league, said it would contribute $150 million to construction costs, provided the stadium meets certain criteria, but that is the maximum even if two teams play there.

HEADLINE: Safe As Houses

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN; Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I used to live next door to a Russian emigre. One day he asked me to explain something that puzzled him about his new country. ''This place seems very rich,'' he said, ''but I never see anyone making anything. How does the country earn its money?''
 The answer, these days, is that we make a living by selling each other houses. Since December 2000 employment in U.S. manufacturing has fallen 17 percent, but membership in the National Association of Realtors has risen 58 percent. 
The housing boom has created jobs in two ways. Many jobs have been created, directly and indirectly, by a surge in housing construction. And rising home values have fueled a simultaneous surge in consumer spending.
 Let's start with home building. Between 1980 and 2000, which was before the housing boom, spending on the construction of new homes averaged 4.25 percent of G.D.P. In the most recent quarter, however, the figure was 5.98 percent. That difference is equivalent to about $200 billion a year in additional spending, generating roughly two million extra jobs.
 Then there's the jump in house prices. Over the past five years housing prices have grown much faster than the overall cost of living, adding about $5 trillion to the public's wealth. Typical estimates say that each additional dollar of housing wealth adds about 3 cents to annual consumer spending, as families reduce their savings and borrow against their newly valuable homes. So we're talking about an additional $150 billion in spending, and roughly 1.5 million more jobs. 
 Does anything else in the U.S. economy rival housing as a source of job creation? Well, there's also the military buildup. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that increased military spending over the past four years has created 1.3 million private-sector jobs.
 And, yes, there are the Bush tax cuts, which the administration insists are the source of everything good in the economy. And it's true that some portion of the tax cuts, which amounted to $225 billion this year, must have been spent in ways that created jobs. Given reasonable estimates of the effect of tax cuts on spending, however, they were probably a smaller force for job creation than the military buildup, and dwarfed by the housing boom.
 So it's an economy driven by real estate. What's wrong with that?
 One answer is that it has been a pretty disappointing recovery. Two new reports, one from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and one from the Congressional Budget Office, compare the current economic expansion with other postwar recoveries. By any measure except corporate profits, which have done very well, this one comes up short. 
 Even the good months would have been considered subpar in the past: the administration hailed last month's job growth as something wondrous to behold, yet there were 68 months during the Clinton years when employment grew faster.
 Still, the economy is expanding. But because that expansion depends so much on real estate -- without the housing boom, the economic picture would look dismal indeed -- you have to wonder how much to trust it.
 I've written before about the reasons to believe that current house prices in much of the country represent a bubble. When that bubble begins to deflate, so will housing-related employment.
 Beyond that, there's the disturbing point that we're paying for the housing boom (and the military buildup and tax cuts) with money borrowed from foreigners. 
 Now, any economics textbook will tell you that it's fine to borrow from abroad if the money is used to expand the economy's productive capacity. When 19th-century America borrowed from Europe to build railroads, it was also enhancing its ability to repay its debts later. But we aren't borrowing to build productive capacity. As a share of G.D.P., investment other than housing construction is below its average between 1980 and 2000, and way below its level at the end of the 1990's.
 In other words, a fuller answer to my former neighbor would be that these days, Americans make a living selling each other houses, paid for with money borrowed from the Chinese. Somehow, that doesn't seem like a sustainable lifestyle.
 How solid, then, is America's economic recovery? The British have a phrase that applies: ''safe as houses.'' Our economy is as safe as houses. Unfortunately, given current prices and our dependence on foreign lenders, houses aren't safe at all.

HEADLINE: Oil Touches $66 a Barrel, Another High 

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
For the third time this week, oil prices raced to a new high.
 Crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange hit $66 a barrel in trading yesterday. Oil first touched $64 a barrel on Monday and $65 a barrel on Wednesday. Contracts for September delivery closed yesterday at $65.80 a barrel, up 90 cents, or 1.4 percent. 
 ''The market is so bullish that it's in accelerator mode,'' said Thomas Bentz, an analyst with BNP Paribas in New York. ''It's feeding on itself; $70 looks like an achievable target without too much difficulty.''
 The latest run has come on news of more refineries unexpectedly shutting down in the United States. Refiners, which produce more gasoline in the summer to meet higher demand from motorists, have been operating at 95 percent utilization rates lately -- a strain that has led to a string of shutdowns, accidents and fires in recent weeks.
 Also, new data suggesting that oil output from Russia, one of the world's top producers, might slow added to concerns that global supplies were stretched. Most members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are already producing at maximum capacity.
 ''There is no shortage of actual physical supplies; what there is is a shortage of spare capacity,'' said Doug Leggate, an analyst at Citigroup. He does not expect global spare capacity to return to a normal level until 2008 at the earliest. 
 Over all, the oil picture has not been significantly altered in recent months. Little new production is expected this year because it takes years to put new fields on line. Demand continues to grow as the economies of the United States and China keep expanding. And because there is little spare capacity left, oil markets become nervous whenever an oil producer experiences a period of political tension. The latest such worry for oil markets is Iran. 
 ''There's a combination of strong economic statistics, an increase in geopolitical concerns regarding a variety of oil-producing countries, and bad refining news, and the market has been very spooked,'' said Antoine Halff, an oil analyst at the Eurasia Group in New York. ''It's a long laundry list of problems.''
 Global oil demand is expected to reach 83.7 million barrels a day this year, up 1.6 million barrels a day over 2004, according to the latest estimates published yesterday by the International Energy Agency. In 2006, the energy agency sees demand growing another 2.1 percent, or 1.8 million barrels, to 85.5 million barrels a day.
 So what would it take to bring prices down in the short run? Short of a global recession that would significantly push demand down, analysts and traders see no end to the exceptional price rally that began nearly two years ago. 
 ''The only event that is going to stop this cycle is something that will cause a downturn in demand, with prices so high that they will hurt the economy,'' Mr. Bentz of BNP said.

HEADLINE: Officials Warn of Possibility Of Attack Around Sept. 11

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
A group of F.B.I. counterterrorism analysts warned this week of possible terrorist attacks in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago around Sept. 11, but officials cautioned on Thursday that they were skeptical about the seriousness of the threat. 
 The warning grew out of intelligence developed from an overseas source indicating that terrorists might seek to steal fuel tanker trucks in order to inflict ''mass casualties'' by staging an anniversary attack, officials said.
The information led F.B.I. joint terrorism task forces in Los Angeles and Newark to alert other government and law enforcement officials privately this week about the threat, law enforcement officials said. Several government officials in Washington who were briefed on the threat said it was described as credible and specific enough to warrant attention. 
 But other law enforcement officials in Washington and New York said that while they were aware of the warnings and were concerned about the Sept. 11 anniversary, they remained somewhat skeptical about the latest threat. 
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation was planning to send out another confidential law enforcement bulletin on Thursday to qualify the earlier one and emphasize that the threat of a possible tanker attack had not been verified. 
 ''The information is uncorroborated, and the source is of questionable reliability,'' said Brian Roehrkasse, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. ''This information continues to be evaluated by the intelligence community.''
 There were no immediate plans to raise the national threat level, although urban transit systems remain on higher alert after last month's subway attacks in London. 
 Domestic security officials have long thought that tanker trucks could be used in terrorist attacks. New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are considered at the top of potential targets, along with Washington and Las Vegas, because of their size, high profiles, symbolic value and past plots by Al Qaeda.
 New York City's police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said in a statement that the department was aware of the threat.
 ''The New York City Police Department already has measures in place to protect against truck bombs and other threats,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''We are expanding those measures, not in response to this latest information, but as part of ongoing refinements to our overall counter terrorism posture.''
 Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, said that for the last three and a half years the department had had a high-profile program for stopping trucks in the financial district in Lower Manhattan, which was intensified after the London attacks. ''And you can expect to see even more throughout the city in the months ahead,'' Mr. Browne said.
 Another law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the matter, called the information in the advisory ''a generic threat,'' adding, ''There is no great level of confidence in the credibility of the source.''
 The official noted that the New York Police Department had long been concerned about the use of trucks as weapons, and that while little credence was given to the advisory it prompted officials to re-examine the threat posed by trucks. 
 ''There is nothing that would cause us to react to the particular threat,'' the official said. ''What we are reacting to is the generic nature of the threat.''
 ''Trucks have been talked about by Al Qaeda all the time,'' the official said. ''They used that tactic around the world, so we're using this as an opportunity to fine-tune our strategy.''
 In 2002, Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for killing 21 people in a suicide attack on a Tunisian synagogue by a man driving a fuel truck. 
 The Los Angeles police chief, William J. Bratton, said his department had been made aware of the information several days ago.
 ''Our counterterrorism bureau already looks at any reports of stolen or missing trucks that carry anything hazardous,'' Mr. Bratton said. ''The L.A.P.D.'s traffic coordination section has stepped up random checks of large vehicles. This stream of reporting is similar to others we've seen since 9/11.'' 
 The original alert, issued by an F.B.I. terrorism task force in Los Angeles on Wednesday, warned that ''Al Qaeda leaders plan to employ various types of fuel trucks as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices in an effort to cause mass casualties in the U.S. prior to the 19th of Sept,'' according to a law enforcement official who had read it. ''Attacks are planned specifically for New York ,Chicago and Los Angeles. It is unclear whether the attacks will occur simultaneously or be spread out over a period of time, and the goal of the attack is to collapse the U.S. economy,'' it said.
 It also warned that terrorists would seek to hijack gasoline tankers or trucks hauling oxygen and ram them into a gasoline station to cause major explosions. Although F.B.I. officials have previously said that they have no conclusive evidence that Al Qaeda has sleeper cells in the United States, the alert asserted that ''the attackers will be members of small Al Qaeda cells which are spread throughout the U.S.''
 In interviews, law enforcement officials acknowledged concern about possible attacks timed with the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
 ''There's always that possibility, and it's something we always look at very closely because it is such a symbolic day,'' said a senior Justice Department official in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about disclosing classified material.
 The significance of the Sept. 19 date mentioned in the F.B.I. alert was not made clear. Officials said they were also concerned that attacks might be timed around the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts on Oct. 4. 
 The split in opinion about how seriously to treat the latest report reflected the continued uncertainty in the federal government over how far it should go in responding to what may be unclear threats -- at the risk of alarming an already skittish public. 
 The Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. have stepped up their ability to collect and analyze information on possible threats and spread it quickly to federal, state and local officials. 
 But some local law enforcement officials say they are still not getting all of the information they need from the federal government, leading some police departments to form their own informal intelligence network to share terrorist information. Federal officials have also had several false alarms that became public, and the elevation of the threat level last summer after reports about possible attacks on financial centers in New York and Washington led to accusations that the move was politically motivated in advance of the presidential election. 
 ''We get threat information all the time, and this comes in the normal course of doing business,'' said an F.B.I. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the threat assessments publicly. 
 As for the analysts' report of a possible September attack, he said, ''We consider this unsubstantiated, uncorroborated information.''

The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.
'BAGHDAD BURNING' Opens Tuesday. A dramatization of the blog of a 25-year-old Iraqi who goes by the name Riverbend. Perhaps the first blog-play ever. Part of Women Center Stage 2005 (1:30). Below Theater at the Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101.

Broadway

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)
'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)
'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)
'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)
'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)
'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schreiber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)
'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)
'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). The Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)
'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)
'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)
'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)
'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)
'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)
'THE DEAR BOY' An uptight English teacher learns to cut loose, at least a bit, when he's confronted with an unflattering portrait written by a gifted but troubled student. Capably acted, but lacking in real substance (1:40). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)
'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty at Dodger Stages is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)
'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)
'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)
'IVANOV' Jonathan Banks's staging of the Chekhov classic ''Ivanov'' with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of that of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jonathan Kalb)
'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)
'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)
'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' The hand of fate reaches all the way into a steaming hot tub filled with cranky women in this seriocomic lesbian soap opera from the Five Lesbian Brothers. A richly funny Sapphic sex comedy, it is also a serious inquiry into the unforeseen extremities of despair that can attend the search for a lasting love (1:30). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)460-5475. (Isherwood)
'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)
'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cell phones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)
'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful and funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful emotional crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)
'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)
'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)
'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. ( Zinoman)

Off Off Broadway

'BROTHER' Nothing is quite what it seems at first in ''Brother,'' Lisa Ebersole's confrontational one-act play about a pair of sisters who taunt each other, and a black man who suddenly joins them in the middle of the night in an East Village apartment. The audience is uncomfortably close to the action in this theater-in-the-round production, which starts with an ambiguous tension that quickly escalates (55 minutes). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban)
'THE PERSIANS' Though he himself fought with the victorious Greeks, Aeschylus wrote the tragedy of ''The Persians'' entirely from the perspective of the vanquished. This imaginative musical production by a young company called Waterwell extends that act of empathy, while also managing to be wildly funny and entertaining (1:15). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)

Last Chance

'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)
'PRIMO' In his crystalline adaptation of ''If This Is a Man,'' Primo Levi's memoir of the Holocaust, Antony Sher creates a portrait in which brutal memory penetrates the very marrow of existence. His great accomplishment is in doing so in an expressly theatrical language that never sensationalizes, lectures or begs for pity (1:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)
'THE SKIN GAME' A powerful performance by James Gale propels the Mint Theater's revival of ''The Skin Game.'' The Nobel laureate John Galsworthy's drama about two English families whose differences escalate into destructive conflict provides provocative and entertaining theater (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231, closing on Sunday. (Van Gelder)
'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)
'WALK TWO MOONS' Theaterworks/NYC, the new ''stationary'' arm of the traveling group Theaterworks/USA, starts things off with an appealing adaptation of the tweener novel by Sharon Creech, a Newbery Medal winner. A 13-year-old girl travels cross-country with her nutty grandparents in search of her mother, telling a tallish tale about her friend Phoebe along the way, to hilarious effect (1:10). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)
'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of the 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Manohla Dargis)
'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his own novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the early 1970's, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)
'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)
'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)
* 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers -- including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange -- and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)
'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)
'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)
'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)
'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renee Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)
'THE CONFORMIST' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Italian) Bertolucci's 1970's look at the soul man under Fascism returns to take us back not only to the Mussolini years, but also, more dramatically, to the time of its own making, a cinematic era of stylistic daring and aesthetic bravura. (Scott)
'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)
'DARK WATER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Make that dark, stagnant water.(Dargis)
* 'DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English, Russian and Swahili) A harrowing, unblinking look at the consequences of globalization, as seen from the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Not easy viewing, but indispensable for just that reason. Through Aug. 16. (Scott)
'THE DUKES OF HAZZARD' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Yeee-haw? Naw. (Scott)
'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)
'HAPPY ENDINGS' (R, 130 minutes) An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, Don Roos's slyly subversive new movie is a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, and a road map to the way we live now. With Lisa Kudrow and the sublime Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Dargis)
'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)
'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy, about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home, envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of his pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)
'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is, in many ways, less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation and about how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)
'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)
'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)
'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)
'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)
'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)
'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of the exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)
'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)
*'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)
'9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)
'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)
'OYSTER FARMER' (not rated, 93 minutes) ''Oyster Farmer,'' the Australian writer-director Anna Reeves's debut feature, soaks up the lush scenery of the Hawkesbury River in New South Wales, a setting that often takes precedence over the underdeveloped story and characters, including Jack, a 24-year-old petty thief who's a newcomer to the unglamorous but strangely fascinating world of oyster farming. An uneven but ultimately endearing film that manages to portray ordinary life in a refreshingly authentic way. (Laura Kern)
'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring. (Scott)
'SAINT RALPH' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This story of a 14-year-old Canadian schoolboy in the early 1950's who believes in miracles is pure treacle. (Holden) 'SARABAND' (R, 107, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden)
*'SECUESTRO EXPRESS' (R, 86 minutes, in Spanish) ''Secuestro Express'' is a relentless assault on the senses about a trio of hoodlums who kidnap an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul Leroux), who then must face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the ransom money's arrival. This perfectly cast film is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief; it also raises awareness of frightening real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in Caracas, Venezuela. (Kern)
'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question, ''Is there life after high school?,'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)
'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)
'STEALTH' (PG-13, 117 minutes) A preposterous hash of ''Top Gun'' and ''Behind Enemy Lines,'' topped with a soupcon of ''2001,'' this crypto-video game about three stealth pilots has the makings of a kitsch classic; too bad it's not remotely funny. (Dargis)
'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) A delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, ''Tony Takitani'' tells the story of a lonely man who at 37 awakens to life for the first time during a brief idyll. The film was directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)
'2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)
' WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)
'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)

Film Series

DIVAS! (through Aug. 30). This summer festival, presented by Thalia Film Classics, honors great women in classical movies, with dramas about very different protagonists.

DESERT ISLAND FILM FESTIVAL (through Aug. 20). Makor, a program of the 92nd Street Y, begins a six-day, five-film festival of movies that its audiences voted most desirable to have around if they were trapped on a desert island.

Robinson and Marlene Dietrich, is to be shown tomorrow. ''Pursued'' (1947), a noirish western starring Robert Mitchum and Teresa Wright, is scheduled for tomorrow and Sunday.

(Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

YOLANDA ADAMS (Tomorrow) Blending gospel and R&B, Yolanda Adams has an undeniably powerful voice, though it is used more for purposes of warm inspiration and uplifting solace than quasi-sexual shudders of praise. 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777; free. (Laura Sinagra)
TORI AMOS, THE LIKE (Wednesday) The piano-grinding sensualist Tori Amos spent the 1990's rendering stormy emotional experience via alt-rock drama, pounded out on a well-worn Bosendorfer piano and sung in a shamanic, childlike voice. Lately, she's been seeking the Goddess in biblical lore and reflecting on the nuances of married sexuality. The Like, from Los Angeles, is an all-female trio of pleasingly jaded Tori acolytes. 7:30 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000; $20 to $50. (Sinagra)
ANTIBALAS (Thursday) Antibalas delivers a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afrobeat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. Rocks Off Boat Cruise, World Yacht Marina, 41st Street, at the Hudson River, Clinton, (212)571-3304; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles)
BEACH BOYS (Tonight and tomorrow) Scores of young rock bands continue to tap into Brian Wilson's harmonically rich melancholic whimsy, updating the most influential sound in American rock. The singer Mike Love owns the Beach Boys name and clings to a Six Flags version of the band's earliest suburban utopianism. Mr. Wilson won't be here, but he's performing in town this week, too. (See below.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y.,(516)334-0800; $53. (Sinagra)
CODY CHESNUTT (Tomorrow) An aesthetic acolyte of Prince, among others, the eccentric do-it-yourself neo-soul singer and multi-instrumentalist Mr. Chesnutt wears his machismo prominently, blending funky spiritual questing with tomcat instincts. The fevered enthusiasm that surrounded his ambitious two-disc debut has cooled a bit, but we expect that he's still groovy and unpredictable. 7 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $15. (Sinagra)
KIMYA DAWSON (Monday) Ms. Dawson's band, the Moldy Peaches, featured adorable dirty-kid rambles that created an indie splash in 2001. But this former youth counselor endures on her own as a slant comedian and poignant poet of geek love and underdog resilience. 7 p.m., Scenic, 25 Avenue B, between Second and Third Streets, East Village, $8. (Sinagra)
DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE, THE DECEMBERISTS, STARS (Thursday) Death Cab is a decorous diarist-rock band whose sound gets added alternative-rock heft on the forthcoming ''Plans'' (Atlantic). The Decemberists' leader, Colin Melloy, writes literary songs about child queens, heartsick spies and vengeful seafarers. The Canadian band the Stars' achingly pretty boy-girl vocal pop makes a dreamy soundtrack for a quarter-life crisis. 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777; $30 in advance, $35 on the day; sold out. (Sinagra)
NEIL DIAMOND (Thursday) After four decades, during which his initial kicky folk-rock evolved into high-gloss Vegas pop, the singer-songwriter Neil Diamond has recently been working with the rock and rap producer Rick Rubin, who famously helped Johnny Cash garner an alt-rock audience in the 90's. Spare new songs reportedly rely on acoustic guitar and aim for a lonesome vibe. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $70 to $100. (Sinagra)
DIPSET NYC VS. PIRATE SESSIONS UK (Tomorrow) Inspired by the seminal hip-hop film ''Wild Style,'' in which uptown music is taken downtown for a good-will concert in East River Park, this show aims to catalyze interplay between the purveyors of British grime and the gritty but playful stateside hip-hop of the Dipset crew in Harlem. Performers include Def Jam's Juelz Santana and Britain's Kano, who also performs tomorrow evening. (See below.) 2 p.m., East River Park Amphitheater, Grand Street at the East River, Lower East Side, (212)560-0951; free. (Sinagra)
DR. JOHN, MARCIA BALL BLUES BAND (Tomorrow) Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and florid piano playing to jazz standards and songs with a conscience. Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, knowing voice about all the trouble men and women can get into on the way to a good time. 7:30 p.m., Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center; free. (Pareles).
HIEROGLYPHICS, FEATURING DEL THE FUNKY HOMOSAPIEN (Sunday) This Bay Area hip-hop crew has been together since the mid-90's heyday of tricky, frequently self-deprecating backpack hip-hop. Fans of Del who lament this eccentric rhyme-spitter's absence from the new Gorillaz album can check out his solo bounce. His crew members Casual, Pep Love, Domino and Souls of Mischief also play. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, 8 p.m.; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)
HOLLY GOLIGHTLY, TOM HEINL (Tuesday and Thursday) The British retro garage-country Holly Golightly writes and sings twangy ditties with Nancy Sinatra sass. The Oregonian Tom Heinl performs indie pop to a karaoke machine, calling what he does ''stereoke.'' Tuesday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103; $12. Thursday at 8:30 p.m. (with Tralala, who play ironic surf-rock topped with girl-group vocals), Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $19. (Sinagra)
KARSH KALE (Sunday) Karsh Kale is a tabla player, disc jockey and producer who layers East and West into his own version of the Asian underground blend of dance beats and South Asian rhythms and melodies. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)239-6200; $20. (Pareles)
KANO, DIPLO (Tomorrow) Kano is Kane Robinson, a 20-year-old M.C. from the Bow neighborhood of London, who rhymes with an easy flow and a bit less slang than fellow purveyors of the sometimes insular British grime rap. He also plays in the afternoon with members of the New York rap crew Dipset. (See above.) The Philadelphia D.J. Diplo has taken the crate-digging white kid routine global, weaving hip-hop and new wave with dancehall and Brazilian baille funk. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132; $12. (Sinagra)
BARRINGTON LEVY, TOKYO SKA PARADISE ORCHESTRA (Sunday) The crooner Barrington Levy headlines this free concert of well-known reggae performers. Mr. Levy arrived with the hit ''Shine Eye Girl'' in 1979 and showed Jamaican singers how to ride a choppy digital beat; he has periodically revitalized his career by roughing up his songs with raps from top dancehall toasters and Snoop Dogg. The high-energy Japanese ska band Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra opens. 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, free. (Pareles)
METHOD MAN, STREET LIFE (Tomorrow) Method Man's unlikely combination of a gravelly M.C. voice, menacing grimace and impeccable comic timing has garnered this member of Wu Tang Clan fame as both the ominous rapper on scary cuts like ''Bring the Pain'' and, with his fellow rapper Redman, as one-half of an affably stoned slapstick screen duo. His pal Street Life also performs. Midnight, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $28 in advance, 30 at the door. (Sinagra)
THE MISFITS (Tonight) This New Jersey institution has remained dedicated to its campy, horror-flick punk rock over two decades after the departure of the singer Glen Danzig. The current lineup, led by the original member Jerry Only, includes the former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena and Marky Ramone on drums. At 7, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052; $30.
(Sinagra)
MOTLEY CRUE, SUM 41 (Sunday and Tuesday) Motley Crue's 80's hits -- ''Shout at the Devil,'' ''Girls, Girls, Girls,'' ''Dr. Feelgood'' -- defined 80's hair metal at its most inane and often most effective. They've been reclaimed with an ironic enthusiasm impassioned enough to feel almost like sincerity. The members of the energetic pop-metal Sum 41, of the hit ''Fat Lip,'' are still young enough to do that thing where they jump in the air at once and land hard on a power chord. Sunday at 6 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400; $20 to $75. Tuesday at 6 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000; $20 to $75. (Sinagra)
NEW YORK DOLLS (Tonight) Once called the world's most dangerous band, the glammy, proto-punk New York Dolls continue a reunion that began last year, before the death of its original bassist, Arthur Kane. The still charismatically campy David Johansen and the guitarist Sylvain Sylvain plan on putting out a record with their new band next year. Doors open at 7 p.m., Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732)238-5500; $20. (Sinagra)
OXFORD COLLAPSE (Tomorrow) The Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls acerbic mid-American forebears like the Embarrassment. 9 p.m., Glass House Gallery, 38 South First Street, between Wythe & Kent, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 917-607-1017, suggested donation $5. (Sinagra) DOLLY PARTON (Thursday) Science has kept her young, but Dolly Parton is naturally likable. As of late, this legendary country warbler has moved from the classic tear-jerkers like ''Coat of Many Colors'' and ''Jolene'' toward the bluegrass-inflected music of her Tennessee mountain home. She's also currently recording with guests from Keith Urban to Norah Jones. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212)632-4000; $40 to $75. (Sinagra)
PERNICE BROTHERS (Tomorrow) Possessed of one of the sexiest regular-guy voices in indie rock, Joe Pernice has been making charmingly dark, low-key pop for over a decade. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)
PUFFY AMIYUMI (Thursday) Hugely popular in Japan since the late 90's, this two-girl anime tie-in duo, Ami Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura, sing spunky tunes that make J-pop ersatz of even the most prefab 60's and 70's American rock. Think Partridge Family with superpowers, Shonen Knife without the edge, or a kiddie cocktail version of sophisto lounge acts like Pizzicato Five. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)
RAY, GOODMAN AND BROWN (Thursday) Ray, Goodman and Brown, who recorded as the Moments until 1979, carried smooth soul into the 1980's with hits like ''Special Lady.'' 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17, South and Fulton Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212)732-7678; free. (Pareles)
KENNY ROGERS (Sunday) You assume that the man who wrote the countrified radio smash ''The Gambler'' knows when to fold 'em, and evidently that time has yet to come. Other hits to be trotted out here will surely include the sing-along recrimination ''Lucille'' and the casually rendered tale of gnarly violence ''Coward of the County.'' 7 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800; $52. (Sinagra)
ROLL DEEP CREW (Tonight) Roll Deep is the gritty East London grime crew that includes the clever, angular rapper Dizzee Rascal and tonight's headliner, Wiley. Recently they have been branching out sonically beyond the stripped-down beats and willfully impenetrable patois of the genre to reach a wider audience. At 11:30, Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $12. (Sinagra) SAW DOCTORS (Tonight) The Saw Doctors sing earnest, folk-rocking anthems of small-town life ''for those who feel they've been mistreated/discriminated, robbed or cheated.'' In Ireland, their populism brought them a huge national following. At 8, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $30 in advance, $32. (Pareles)
SMOG (Tonight) The lo-fi rock icon Bill Callahan has been living in Austin, Tex., for a few years now, and it seems to have mellowed him. His latest album, ''A River Ain't Too Much to Love'' (Drag City), is a pensive, acoustic guitar-pickin' affair, more reflective and even wistful than knowing and sardonic. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)
VANS WARPED TOUR 2005 (Tomorrow) Buzz pop-punk and pop-metal bands like Atreyu, Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance join elder statesmen like the Offspring and corpuscular outfits like Bleeding Through, Bleed the Dream and the Bled to provide enough soft-loud guitar and emo-tinged howls to validate more adolescent angst than the forthcoming school year may even contain. 12 p.m., Randall's Island Golf Center, 1 Randall's Island, (212)427-5689; $34 in advance, $38 at the door. (Sinagra)
BRIAN WILSON (Tonight and tomorrow night) Last year, the shaky Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson finally finished ''Smile'' (Nonesuch), the quintessential American record of 1966. Its sweeping crackpot Gershwin homages and baroque Van Dyke Parks lyrics cast a dark shadow over burnished American iconography from Plymouth Rock to Blue Hawaii to Mrs. O'Leary's cow. His former bandmate Mike Love leads a reconstituted Beach Boys show this week as well (see above), but his renditions are far less relevant. Tonight at 8, PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400; $20 to $65. Tomorrow night at 8, Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000; $20 to $65. (Sinagra)

AL FOSTER QUARTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Foster has a lithe touch as a drummer, ideal for modern jazz and more than suitable for funk; his band consists of the tenor saxophonist Eli Degibri, the pianist Kevin Hayes and the bassist Doug Weiss. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Wednesday through Aug. 20) Mr. Rosenwinkel's electric guitar has a beguilingly airy tone that offsets the cerebral twinge of his compositions; his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic.

Opera

AFTERNOON ARIAS (Today) A new summer series of free concerts features opera arias, with piano, performed by singers from the New York City Opera's roster in the somewhat bucolic if not acoustically ideal surroundings of Bryant Park. Today's program consists of excerpts from ''The Barber of Seville'' and ''Madama Butterfly'' and leans heavily on the considerable talents of the baritone Michael Corvino. 12:30 p.m., Bryant Park, Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street, (212)870-7787. (Anne Midgette)
GLIMMERGLASS (Tonight through Thursday) Is it a leading opera company or an experimental theater, a proving ground for young artists or a showcase for stars? Glimmerglass aspires to be all these things with a summer season that ranges from an austere production of Britten's valedictory ''Death in Venice'' to ''Lucie de Lammermoor,'' a French-language version of Donizetti's classic that verges, inadvertently, on comic relief. But through ups and downs there's a lot to like: take the American tenor William Burden, incandescent in the Britten as the writer Gustav von Aschenbach. Also on the summer program are Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and an unusual double bill consisting of ''Portrait de Manon,'' Jules Massenet's one-act sequel to his most famous opera, paired with Poulenc's one-acter ''La Voix Humaine,'' which depicts a woman on the phone. ''Portrait'' and ''Voix,'' tonight and Thursday night at 8; ''Lucie,'' tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 2 p.m.; ''Death in Venice,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m.; ''Cosi,'' Sunday and Tuesday at 2 p.m. Alice Busch Theater, Route 80, eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607)547-2255; sold out.

BARD MUSIC FESTIVAL (Today through Sunday) Each year, this festival chooses a single composer and places him in a rich cultural context through concerts, lectures and panel discussions. The theme this summer is ''Copland and His World,'' with programs beginning today (at 10 a.m.), with screenings of a series of documentaries, and a performance (at 8:30 p.m.) led by Leon Botstein. Tomorrow morning, panels start at 10 with ''Memory and History,'' featuring two Copland biographers. The festival also aims for broader connections, and in that spirit a concert tomorrow (at 1:30 p.m.) is titled ''Paris, Boulanger and Jazz.'' Performers include the American Symphony Orchestra, Music From Copland House and others. Programs run through Sunday evening, and then again from Aug. 19 to 21. Details at www.bard.edu/bmf. At Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900; $20 to $55. (Jeremy Eichler)
BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Thursday) There are few cozier places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall (a former coffee barge) on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Tonight the Amelia Trio plays piano trios by Haydn, Brahms and John Harbison (a new work, ''Short Stories''). The focus shifts to France tomorrow and Sunday, when Eugenia Zukerman, a flutist, is joined by the pianist Jeffrey Biegel, the bassist Pablo Aslan and the percussionist John Hollenbeck in works by Rameau, Debussy, Poulenc and Claude Bolling, whose ''Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano'' was a crossover hit in the late 1970's. On Thursday an ensemble that includes Rupert Boyd, a guitarist; Hector Del Curto, a bandoneon player; and Katya Mihailova, a pianist, play an eclectic program: Tchaikovsky, Mozart and Piazzolla.

BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight through Thursday) The flutist Marya Martin did not want to spend summers trekking to far-flung festivals, so she and her husband, Ken Davidson, founded a festival of their own, now in its 22nd season.

Tomorrow the Orchestra of St. Luke's, with Michael Barrett conducting, celebrates the festival's 60th anniversary with an enticing and unusual program. Audra McDonald will sing excerpts from Gershwin's ''Porgy and Bess.'' (Will she use amplification? It would be great if she didn't.) Lydia Kavina will be the soloist in Joseph Schillinger's ''First Airphonic Suite'' for theremin (the electronic instrument favored by film composers for warbling, spooky effects). Tchaikovsky's stunning Symphony No. 4 closes out the program and the season. At 8, Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1252; $17.50 to $75. (Anthony Tommasini)
MARLBORO MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Traditionally the programs for the weekend concerts at this festival in Vermont have not been announced in advance. But this summer Marlboro has been alerting the public to what works will be played on the concerts, and the three programs this weekend, the final weekend of the festival's 55th season, look very enticing. Tonight brings Strauss's seldom heard Suite in B flat for winds, Brahms's String Quintet in F and Mendelssohn's rhapsodic Piano Trio in D minor. Tomorrow Mozart's Quintet in E flat for piano and winds, Elliott Carter's String Quartet No. 2 and Brahms's Horn Trio can be heard. And Sunday afternoon's program offers works by Schubert and, following Marlboro tradition, Beethoven's ''Choral'' Fantasy for piano, chorus and orchestra, with the pianist Richard Goode, a co-director of the festival, as soloist. As always, the ensembles bring together emerging young artists and veteran masters.

Tonight and tomorrow night you can take in the orchestra, with Louis Langree conducting a program of J.C. Bach, Haydn (the ''London'' Symphony), Mozart and Beethoven (the First Piano Concerto, with Garrick Ohlsson), then report to the penthouse, where on each night Mr. Ohlsson will play 60-minute programs of Beethoven sonatas.

Tuesday and Wednesday feature a preview of Ed Schmidt and Jed Distler's ''Gold Standard,'' described as a theater work about ''one helluva disgruntled piano player.'' Thursday brings spoken monologues and new works by Gerald Busby. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212)663-1967; $20 each concert. (Eichler)
TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Thursday) The cellist Truls Mork was to join the Boston Symphony Orchestra tonight for Strauss's ''Don Quixote,'' but canceled due to illness; he will be replaced by Jian Wang. Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos conducts, in a program that also includes ''Master Peter's Puppet Show'' by Falla, featuring the Bob Brown Puppets. The singers for the Falla include Awet Andemicael, soprano; Peter Bronder, tenor; and David Wilson-Johnson, baritone. Tomorrow Sir Andrew Davis leads the orchestra in the Shostakovich Symphony No. 10 and the Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4, with Gil Shaham as the soloist. Sir Andrew also leads an all-Mozart program, with Sir James Galway, the flutist, and Ann Hobson Pilot, a harpist, on Sunday afternoon. On Monday the students of the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra play works by Beethoven (the ''Pastoral'' Symphony) and Strauss under Mr. Fruhbeck de Burgos's baton. And there are two chamber concerts: Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax, playing an all-Beethoven program on Tuesday, and the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio performing Mozart, Brahms and Joan Tower on Thursday. All at 8:30 p.m., except Sunday, which is at 2:30 p.m.; Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200; $16 (lawn) to $85, except $11 (lawn) to $26 on Monday. (Kozinn)
'TRANSIENT GLORY' (Today and tomorrow) Writing music for children's chorus doesn't have the cachet of, say, writing for a symphony orchestra. But Francisco J. Nunez, founder of the Young People's Chorus of New York City, has set out to change that by commissioning major composers -- Ned Rorem, David Del Tredici, Judith Weir, Bright Sheng -- to write works for his ensemble. The project, inaugurated in 2001, has become an energetic endeavor, with the collaboration of a number of music publishers. The group's weeklong series of concerts concludes with performances this afternoon at 12:30 and tomorrow evening at 7:30. Frederick Loewe Theater, New York University, 35 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)289-7779; $25 for the series. (Midgette)

Museums

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)
AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)
COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)
GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 28. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Smith)
GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM,' through Aug. 24. With the goal of paring down sculpture to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's, creating the right containers. Experimenting with a number of different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. When, at the end of the 1950's, he felt he had met his goal, Oteiza turned to Basque political and social causes. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) (Glueck)
INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)
MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith)
MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,' through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400.(Michael Kimmelman)
MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. (See above.) (Johnson)
MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CEZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cezanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)
THE NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HELION, through Oct. 9. Helion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans both before and after World War II and presaged aspects of Pop Art and Neo-Expressionism. This meager show does not give a full account of either his strengths or his weaknesses, but it is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)
NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)
NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)
P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)
QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Oct. 9. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)
STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENSLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23. Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)
UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)
WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck) WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)
WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)

Galleries: Uptown

'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook in which he recorded his visual impressions, this show of some 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of spired churches, sailboats and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)
IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)
Galleries: 57th Street
'INTRODUCTIONS' Three one-person mini-shows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)
'REPEAT PERFORMANCE' More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

'BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD' This big, hot group show of the summer pays homage to Robert Smithson and casually retools countercultural languages of yesteryear for the 21st century. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Aug. 19. (Cotter)
WILLIAM EGGLESTON 'THE NIGHTCLUB PORTRAITS' The photographer known for his jewel-like color photographs of scenes of Southern decrepitude made these powerfully lucid black-and-white portraits of customers in bars around Memphis in 1973. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Sept. 2 (Johnson)
GEERT GOIRIS, Among the most striking of the sumptuous and magical color photographs by this Belgian artist are pictures of an albino wallaby and of a mysterious explosion in a peaceful, parklike setting. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, (212)989-7700, through Aug. 23. (Johnson)
DAVID LEVINTHAL: 'XXX SEX DOLLS' Mr. Levinthal is known for his provocatively ironic photographs of war toys, racist kitsch and pornographic dolls. Here, along with faux-pornographic photographs, he presents 30 female miniatures from his collection; they are kitschy marvels of sexist fetishism. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212)627-4819, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)
JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of the store itself, but to round out a long, hot city summer, the artist Justin Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)
LIU ZHENG: 'THE CHINESE' Under the influence of Sander, Frank and Arbus, this Chinese photographer set out to document his own society with a focus on the dark and wild side. His pictures of miners, prisoners, strippers, transsexuals, hospital patients and corpses have an almost surrealistic intensity. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212)414-0370, through Aug. 26. (Johnson)
'MEDITATIVE' The mellow but disciplined vibes emanating from this group show are partly attributable to its theme: all the work was inspired by the artists' experiences of meditation. Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212)675-7772, through Sept. 17. (Cotter)
BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20- inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)
'REMARKABLE HANDS' Three Japanese make art by hand: Yayoi Deki creates gently psychedelic floral patterns with a finely pointed brush; Yoko Kawamoto paints small, photo-based pictures of junked cars and industrial sites with a dry but sensuous touch; and Tomoo Gokita, using chameleonlike skill and mischievous humor, draws many different kinds of pop culture imagery. ATM, 511 West 20th Street, (212)375-0349, through Aug. 26. (Johnson)
'WORDPLAY' Twenty-three artists toy with words and letters. The show includes comical, professional-looking signs by Steve Powers; sign letters arranged to spell ''Me'' in a photograph by Jack Pierson; a neon sign that says ''Just Wait,'' by Bill Rowe; an alphabet of letters made of little water puddles photographed by Abelardo Morell; and layered, hand-painted letters spelling the hidden phrase ''Weapons of Mass Destruction'' by Joe Amrhein. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)
JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalismand utilitarianism; a tall aqua box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)
MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft-drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)
'CAPTURING A MOMENT-ITO' Highlights of this varied exhibition of works by nine Latino artists include Karina Aguilera Skvirsky's eerie video of vaguely menacing figures in Mideastern-style robes approaching in a peaceful park; portraits by Gabriel de la Mora in which the apparently finely drawn lines are actually made of hair from the people depicted; Gino Rubert's Surrealistic paintings of dreamy erotic encounters; and Alfonso Cantu's drawings of people viewed through marbled glass. Jamaica Center for Arts & Learning, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, (718)658-7400, through Aug. 20. (Johnson)
'A. B. NORMAL' Seven artists, including John Bock, Tim Hawkinson and Rirkrit Tiravanija, mostly deal in eccentric machinery. Best is a life-size hyper-realistic zamboni made of rigid pale green insulation foam by Chris Hanson & Hendrika Sonnenberg. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)473-4447, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)
JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)

'BEBE LE STRANGE' This tense, lively group show devoted to images of the figure includes strong work by a bunch of strong young artists, including Benjamin Degen, William Jones and Eileen Quinlan, and fascinating photographic work of documentary fiction by Zoe Crosher and Leslie Grant. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-9460, closing today. (Cotter)
'GREY FLAGS' Organized by the artist Seth Price, this coolest of summer group shows puts New York art on an interesting track and looks to the future. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)680-9467, closing today. (Cotter)
'STICKS & STONES' Images of skulls dominate this group show of mostly drawings by John White Cerasulo, Santiago Cucullu and Andrew Guenther, with an ambitious, multipart marker-on-photocopy piece by Jay Heikes. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 527 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)627-8000, closing today. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Rumors of a Shortage of Dump SpaceWere Greatly Exaggerated

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

 BODY:
Workers at a landfill in Orange County, Calif. -- as if tamping down the contents of a wastebasket -- regularly pile one million cubic yards of dirt atop a football field-size section of the giant dump. Six months later, the workers scrape the dirt aside and the dump's surface has fallen 30 to 40 feet, making space for yet more trash. 
 ''It's just amazing,'' said Mike Giancola, deputy director of the county's waste agency.
Orange County's method is part of a remarkable productivity story playing out in the trash business, quietly saving consumers, businesses and municipalities billions of dollars a year. It is an unlikely industry for such a leap in efficiency. 
 Simply put, operators of garbage dumps are stuffing more waste than anyone expected into the giant plastic-lined holes, keeping disposal prices down and making the construction of new landfills largely unnecessary.
 The clearest winner in this development is the City of New York, which exports 25,000 tons of trash a day to other cities and states, making it the waste industry's biggest customer. But the benefits stretch coast to coast and will continue for years to come.
 The productivity leap is the second major economic surprise from the trash business in the last 20 years. First, it became clear in the early 1990's that there was a glut of disposal space, not the widely believed shortage that had drawn headlines in the 1980's. Although many town dumps had closed, they were replaced by fewer, but huge, regional ones. That sent dumping prices plunging in many areas in the early 1990's and led to a long slump in the waste industry.
 Since then, the industry and its followers have been relying on time -- about 330 million tons of trash went into landfills in the United States last year alone, according to Solid Waste Digest, a trade publication -- to fill up some of those holes, erase the glut and send disposal prices skyward again. Instead, dump capacity has kept growing, and rapidly, even as only a few new dumps were built.
 How could that be? Waste companies and municipalities have fit much bigger dumps than originally permitted onto existing acreage, piling trash deeper and steeper, and vastly expanding permitted capacity. They are burying trash more tightly, so that each ton takes up less space, increasingly using giant 59-ton compacting machines guided by global positioning systems that show the operator when he has rolled over a section of the dump enough times. They cover trash at the end of the day, to keep it from blowing away, with tarps or foam or lawn clippings instead of the thick layers of soil that formerly ate up dump capacity.
 Some operators are blowing water and air into landfills to hasten rotting and thus the shrinkage of buried garbage piles, creating more capacity.
 Each practice is fairly prosaic, and many operators have yet to adopt the improved methods, but taken together the waste industry is in the early stages of the kind of increase in efficiency more typically seen in technologies like computer chips and turbines that generate electricity. 
 A well-run dump, tightly packed and using minimal dirt as cover, can hold 30 percent or so more trash than a poorly run site, said Thomas M. Yanoschak, a senior project manager at Camp Dresser & McKee, an engineering firm that advises waste sites. ''Operators are much better now,'' he said.
 The change is shown in the published disposal records of the three largest waste haulers -- Waste Management, Allied Waste Industries and Republic Services -- which combined handle more than half the nation's trash. In the last four years, they buried 882 million tons of waste. But the remaining permitted capacity of their combined 410 dumps did not shrink. It expanded over those four years by more than one billion tons. The three companies now expect expansions of another 1.8 billion tons. At that level, their combined capacity could handle the nation's trash sent to dumps for about 26 years. 
 Smaller companies and municipalities possess huge capacity, too. Taken together, the oversupply is a damper on prices. The nation's average gate rate, the price dumps post publicly, has lagged inflation, rising just 21 percent from 1992, when the original disposal glut first became widely known, to last year, climbing to $35 a ton from $29, according to Solid Waste Digest. Most businesses pay haulers directly for disposal. Many consumers pay through property taxes.
 At $35 a ton, the 330 million tons buried nationally cost $11.6 billion. (Actual prices are typically lower than gate rates.) Had rates merely kept pace with inflation, disposal in dumps would average $39 a ton, or a collective $12.9 billion a year. And the annual cost would be $16.5 billion had prices, as widely predicted years ago based on an expected shortage, hit $50 a ton. 
 Dennis Pantano, chief operating officer at Regus Industries, a regional waste company based in West Seneca, N.Y., and a former executive at a national waste company, said he had expected ''at least $45 to $50'' by now. Instead, he said, ''In Ohio we're still beating our heads against each other to get $18, $20 a ton -- $25 in western New York. It really hasn't gone up in 10 years. That's obviously because of capacity.''
 Environmental regulations, which many feared would cause a disposal shortage, actually helped encourage the glut. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, passed in 1976 but put into effect over more than a decade, requires that liners be used to protect groundwater and that systems to extract water and methane be installed. The cost of all that forced thousands of small dumps to close and encouraged huge new landfills that could pile trash hundreds of feet deep to maximize the return on investment. 
 A 10,000-ton-a-year dump would cost $83 a ton to operate, estimates Solid Waste Digest, while a 300,000-ton-a-year site's cost would be $14 a ton. Dumps taking a million or more tons a year have even lower per-ton costs.
 So, new replacement landfills were on average 25 times the size of the small ones that were closing, according to Solid Waste Digest. And even though the 8,000 dumps in 1988 fell to fewer than 1,800 today, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, capacity ballooned. Transfer stations, where trash is emptied from local collection trucks and reloaded onto bigger long-haul trucks or onto trains for transport to a dump, now number 3,700 nationally, a vast network extending the reach of giant disposal sites.
 The nation's 25 biggest dumps, which are beginning to resemble operations in other more efficient and consolidated industries, account for about 24 percent of total capacity, Solid Waste Digest estimates, and that concentration will probably continue. Already, the Republic Services landfill in Las Vegas has more than 200 million tons of space, as does Waste Management's site in Arlington, Ore. And a desert site yet to begin accepting trash, owned by the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, can hold more than 600 million tons, or enough to take 20,000 tons a day for 100 years.
 Also, investment in railroad cars and containers for trash, still in its infancy, could further reduce transport costs and smooth out pricing disparities among regions. At present, disposal prices in the Northeast average about 2.5 times the cost to dump in the arid and little-populated Western states. 
 Owners of a recently built 210 million-ton-capacity landfill in Idaho are proposing to use barges to ship much of Hawaii's trash to the West Coast and transport it by rail the remaining distance. Idaho Waste System's gate rate is just $16.50 a ton, said Grant Gauthier, a vice president, and its permit has no daily limit. The company is seeking to expand its permit to 420 million tons, even though it currently takes in just 800 tons a day.
 If the glut depresses prices, why do waste companies keep expanding their dumps? One reason, for the companies with publicly traded stock, is an accounting rule. Companies must write off, or depreciate, their landfill investments based on the percentage of a site's capacity filled up each year. A dump costing $100 million to build, filled 10 percent, would require $10 million of depreciation, reducing pretax profit by that amount. They set aside funds for post-closing environmental monitoring on a similar as-used schedule.
 So, the more capacity that can be permitted at each dump, the less depreciation and other costs recorded per ton, lifting reported profits. Waste Management, of course, suffered an accounting scandal in the late 1990's, in part over landfill accounting, and was forced to take a $3.5 billion charge against earnings to clean up its books.
 Once glamour stocks, waste companies have mostly been mediocre performers in recent years and the growing glut could prolong their problems, especially as municipalities and other major customers become more aware of the oversupply.
 Indeed, the City of New York does not have a disposal problem. Initial bids to handle the trash hauled by the city for 20 years include per-ton prices at dumps in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia of the mid-$20's to the mid-$30's, said Harry Szarpanski, assistant sanitation commissioner.
 The problem is transportation. Shifting from trucks to rail and barges to reduce traffic, New York is taking on huge costs to develop a network of new transfer stations. That could increase prices to $90 a ton or so, Mr. Szarpanski said.

HEADLINE: Growth Stirs a Battle to Draw More Water From the Great Lakes

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WAUKESHA, Wis. 

 BODY:
Time was when Waukesha's mineral-rich water was coveted by Milwaukeeans and Chicagoans, who scorned the Lake Michigan water lapping at their shores. In 1892, one speculator even tried to pipe the city's water to Chicago for the coming World's Columbia Exposition, until aroused Waukeshans trained pistols, pitchforks and fire hoses on the pipe layers, who retreated.
 What a difference a century makes. Waukesha has sucked so much water from its deep aquifer that it is now looking to the vast blue expanse of Lake Michigan, just as Chicagoans once eyed its water.
But the authorities who control some of the largest bodies of fresh water in the world are not sure that any of it should go to communities like Waukesha, which is 15 miles from the lake's shore but outside of its watershed. 
 Their fear is that without strict rules on who gets Great Lakes water and who does not, water-starved western cities will eventually knock at the door.
 ''Today the economics are not there to say we're going to take all the water in the Great Lakes and ship it to Phoenix and Vegas,'' said Todd Ambs, the water division director of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. ''But water's not getting cheaper. Twenty-five, 30, 40 years from now, the economics are going to be different. We've got to have a system in place to deal with that.''
 Fights over who owns and who deserves water have long been a part of life in arid states like California and Nevada. But as the spread of exurbia has more than consumed the savings of a generation's worth of technological improvements like low-flush toilets, even places not perennially in danger of running dry have become jealous of their water.
 Akron, Ohio, had to ask for Great Lakes water in the late 1990's. It received permission, but Lowell, Ind., was turned down.
 And Michigan has told a Nestle subsidiary that if it wants to increase production of its Ice Mountain bottled water in Mecosta Township, Mich., all of the additional water pumped out of the ground must be ''delivered and sold within the Great Lakes basin.'' The company is fighting the requirement in federal court.
 In the last 25 years, ideas have been suggested to build a slurry pipe that would send Great Lakes water to help Wyoming mines and to build a 400-mile canal between the Missouri River in South Dakota and Lake Superior. New York City has raised the possibility of using Lake Erie water to ease droughts. 
 The Great Lakes basin has ''more and more demands for water and certainly more and more development,'' Mr. Ambs said. ''One of the reasons we're looking to have a water management strategy is preparation for the future.''
 In 2001, the eight states that border the Great Lakes, along with Ontario and Quebec, two provinces within the lakes' watershed, pledged to develop a plan to manage access to the lakes' water. 
 By the end of this year, that plan may include an agreement -- requiring ratification by the states' governments -- that the water does not leave the Great Lakes basin except under rare circumstances, based on the applicant's proximity to the basin and whether the wastewater could be returned to the Great Lakes system. 
 The basin's western boundary is a barely perceptible rise in the land called the subcontinental divide; the water west of the divide flows into the Mississippi River system, and to the east it drains into the Great Lakes.
 Waukesha's problem is that it is west of the line. Less than five miles west, but it might as well be 500 miles.
 The city's mineral springs and hotels made Waukesha (pronounced WAW-keh-shaw) the ''Saratoga of the West'' in the late 19th century, and the water and the railroad that once brought in resort tourists later nourished a healthy mix of factories and agribusiness. The cityscape is now a mosaic of old industry and new subdivisions; a small downtown offers an eclectic tableau of stores, with a tattoo parlor, fish store and law office side by side near a modern town clock.
 The draw-down of water from the deep aquifer was gradual at first, accelerating in the late 1980's and throughout the next 15 years. In recent measurements, the water level had dropped about 600 feet. And the deeper the water source, the more likely that it would be contaminated with too much radium, a naturally occurring radioactive element. 
 The city water's radium content is now more than double the acceptable level set by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2000. In setting the standard, the agency said that a person exposed over a lifetime to radium levels twice as high as Waukesha's ''is projected to have a significantly increased chance of developing fatal cancer.''
 More than 50 Wisconsin communities, mostly in the southeastern part of the state, and up to six times that many nationally are in violation of the radium standard. 
 The Waukesha Water Utility is seeking 20 million gallons a day to be piped from Lake Michigan. ''Water is the No. 1 need and the No. 1 issue for all Waukesha County communities,'' said Carol J. Lombardi, the city's mayor. 
 The county has grown nearly 35 percent in the last 25 years to an estimated 377,000 people in 2004. Other communities in Waukesha County also draw from the same deep aquifer as the city.
 The deeper water also comes with high concentrations of the minerals that initially made Waukesha famous. Steve Korthoff, who has lived in the city for 28 years, said his family uses a water softener for household uses like showering because of a concentration of calcium. They drink the water freely. Asked about its taste, Mr. Korthoff said, ''You get used to things.'' But, he added, ''I'm not sure you would like it.''
 If the city does not get access to Lake Michigan water, it will face bills of perhaps tens of millions of dollars to lower the radium levels by either cleaning up the existing water or finding a new, uncontaminated source. But some politicians in Milwaukee, where the population fell by 8.9 percent in the 1990's, are loath to sell the city's Lake Michigan water to suburbs that have been draining away their businesses and wealthier residents, and their tax base. 
 Waukesha County ''supports widening roads to allow for more transportation on the roadways to get more access out to that community, rather than try to limit the sprawl out there,'' said Michael Murphy, a Milwaukee alderman. ''Their solution to the problem is not the conservation of their limited resources, but looking to Lake Michigan.''
 But Dan Duchniak, the general manager of the Waukesha Water Utility, said a diversion of 20 million gallons a day from Lake Michigan would be sufficient, and ''70 million gallons a day would be enough to correct all the problems of southeastern Wisconsin.'' 
 Chicago, Mr. Duchniak noted, is eligible under a Supreme Court ruling to draw as much as 2.1 billion gallons a day from Lake Michigan, even though the vast majority of Chicago's land is outside the basin.
 And, he said, Waukesha has more of a claim on Lake Michigan water than other cities outside of the subcontinental divide. 
 The argument requires an excursion into hydrology. Once, the deep aquifer the city tapped into was high enough that it tended to flow into Lake Michigan. Now, so much has been drawn from the aquifer that some geologists believe the flow has reversed. 
 ''Our argument is that we're different,'' said Mr. Duchniak -- a claim his critics contest. ''We're not Las Vegas, we're not even Madison, Wis. We're using Great Lakes water today. What we'd like to do is take Great Lakes surface water rather than ground water.''
 ''I want to take a straw sucking up ground water andchange it from being a vertical straw to a horizontal straw,'' he said. 
 For critics like Emily Green, who oversees Great Lakes issues for the Sierra Club, Mr. Duchniak's arguments are a dodge. Her complaint, like that of Mr. Murphy, the Milwaukee alderman, is the absence of conservation as the growth spurt of the western exurbs, in towns like Oconomowoc, has accelerated.
 ''Yes, people need a place to live,'' Ms. Green said. ''But do they need McMansions on five-acre lots?''
 Mr. Duchniak said his city was working on a conservation plan that could reduce water use by 20 percent in the next 15 years. It is short on specifics, but hints at the likelihood of price increases. 
 The city has already embarked on a $12 million project to blend water from a shallow aquifer with the radium-laced water from farther down.
 But that will not solve the ultimate problem of Waukesha's water supply. If the surface water from Lake Michigan is not available, Mr. Duchniak said, the city will have to spend $87 million bringing in underground water from areas west of the city -- more than double what the Lake Michigan water would cost.
 ''Have we done things wrong in the past?'' he asked. ''Yes. Unequivocally, yes. But we have to move forward.''

 in need of water.

The Great Lakes basin compact, signed by eight states and two Canadian provinces, is being amended and may soon prevent communities outside the Great Lakes basin, like Waukesha, from drawing on Great Lakes water.

HEADLINE: Japan Posts Slower Growth Than Expected

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Aug 12 

 BODY:
Japan's economy expanded at a slower-than-expected 1.1 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, a report released on Friday showed. But economists said healthy capital spending and consumption, along with a brighter picture for exports, suggested that a sustained recovery was finally under way. 
 Gross domestic product grew 0.3 percent, adjusted for inflation, in the April-June period compared to the previous quarter, government data showed, less than economists' forecasts for a 0.5 percent rise.
 That translates into 1.1 percent annualized growth, below a consensus forecast by economists of 2.0 percent growth, and 3.4 percent annualized growth in the United States in the same period. 
 ''It's weaker than expected due to the decline of inventories, but final demand is quite strong. Basically, it's a strong report despite the weak headline number,'' said Takehiro Sato, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley Japan. ''Consumption and all domestic demand is firm. Exports are also strong, showing that demand is quite balanced.'' 
 Both the government and the Bank of Japan upgraded their economic assessments on Tuesday, declaring that the economy had almost emerged from a soft patch. That, coupled with strong machinery orders data suggesting sustained capital spending growth, has raised optimism about Japan's economic outlook.
 Private-sector consumption, the biggest component of Japan's economy and accounting for 55 percent of G.D.P., rose 0.7 percent in the April-June quarter, outperforming a consensus forecast for a 0.4 percent gain, supported by an improving job market and incomes.
 Capital spending rose 2.2 percent, compared with forecasts for a 1.6 percent increase, as cash-rich firms channelled profits into strategic investments.
 Chotaro Morita, chief bond strategist at Deutsche Securities, said, ''The figures confirm that the Japanese economy continues to recover moderately and suggest the July-September figures will likely show further growth.''

HEADLINE: China Says Trade Surplus Widened Further in July

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
China's trade surplus with the rest of the world widened further in July, to $10.4 billion, the government said Thursday, in a shift that is likely to increase pressures from the United States and the European Union for China to let its currency appreciate faster.
 The trade surplus occurred as growth in imports faltered even as exports kept rising at a torrid pace. Economists said the weakness in imports -- up 12.7 percent in July from a year earlier after being up 15.1 percent in June -- could be troubling for Chinese policy makers. 
 Slower growth in imports is likely to mean in part that importers are delaying deals or underpaying foreign suppliers in the hope that the Chinese currency will appreciate further, making it cheaper to pay bills later, said Liang Hong, an economist at Goldman Sachs. China has tried with little success to discourage this and other forms of currency speculation.
 But this explanation for the widening deficit is unlikely to mollify foreign critics of China's surpluses, Ms. Liang added. ''That is a technical factor -- I think the politicians in Washington will not look at that.''
 The central bank announced on July 21 that it would allow the currency, known as the yuan or the renminbi, to appreciate by 2 percent. But that shift took place too late to have much effect on trade in July, as orders for imports and exports are placed months in advance, economists said.
 China allowed its currency to appreciate to 8.11 to the dollar from 8.277, the level it had maintained for nearly eight years. The central bank also said that it would start letting the currency fluctuate with some other currencies, which Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank governor, identified on Wednesday as being mainly the dollar, euro, yen and won.
 The trade figures pushed up the value of the yuan somewhat on Thursday, with the currency closing at 8.1002 to the dollar, compared with 8.1062 on Wednesday. But the total appreciation of the yuan since the revaluation has been slightly over a tenth of a percent.
 China had whetted foreign appetites for a faster pace of change when it announced the revaluation, noting that it would allow the currency's value to vary by up to three-tenths of a percent a day.
 Chinese exports climbed 28.7 percent in July from levels a year earlier, nearly matching a year-on-year increase of 30.6 percent in June. The July trade surplus was the second-largest monthly surplus ever for China, narrowly trailing a surplus of $11.1 billion last December. But because China's statisticians sometimes toss stray shipments and other data into the December figures at the end of each year, many economists view Chinese monthly records set in December with some suspicion. 
 China's trade surplus was just $1.97 billion in July of last year. In June of this year, the surplus was $9.68 billion.
 Chinese inflation unexpectedly accelerated slightly in July, the government also announced on Thursday, as consumer prices were 1.8 percent higher than a year earlier, after an increase of 1.6 percent in June. The government decision to allow a gradual strengthening of the yuan may help control inflation, however, by making imported goods cheaper for Chinese buyers.

HEADLINE: Waiter! There's a Service Fee in My Soup!

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Steven A. Shaw is right to challenge the simplistic ''reward good service, punish bad service'' rationale for making restaurant servers rely on tips for much of their income. 
 The system benefits owners more than workers, and the servers' earnings may end up depending on the tables they're assigned, the kitchen's efficiency, the customer's mood and other factors beyond their control.
 What appears to be an exercise in economic rationality often turns out to be unfair. It's more likely to promote resentment and rivalry than excellence. To that extent, tipping is no different from incentive plans, bonuses and ''pay for performance'' schemes in other workplaces.

HEADLINE: Economic Expansion Grows As Unemployment Shrinks

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Emboldened by rising wages and better job prospects, American consumers headed to car dealers by the thousands last month to take advantage of Detroit's deep discounts, and helped empty bulging warehouses.
 A series of economic reports released yesterday showed rising retail sales, lower initial unemployment claims and continuing low inventory levels. Economists say the three reports confirm what many of them have been saying: the economic expansion is picking up its pace.
Retail sales rose 1.8 percent in July, with most of the gain attributable to car and auto parts sales, which increased by 6.7 percent during the month, according to the Commerce Department. Excluding the auto sector, sales rose just 0.3 percent, half of what economists were expecting. 
 July was the second consecutive month that General Motors offered consumers the same prices it regularly offers employees and their families. Ford and Chrysler joined G.M. in offering similar promotions.
 Those sales incentives worked so well that they appear to have diverted consumer spending from other goods. For instance, sales at furniture and home furnishings stores fell 1.3 percent in July, after rising 2.2 percent in June. Clothing store sales dipped 0.5 percent, after a 1.1 percent increase in June, and department store sales fell 1 percent, after a 1.4 percent increase in the previous month.
 ''It's largely reflecting the time constraints on the part of shoppers,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio. ''Doing all the test-driving and research at auto dealers means that they are not at malls and department stores and restaurants.''
 Compared with a year earlier, however, retail sales in July showed strong gains: up 10.3 percent in total and 8.1 percent excluding vehicles and parts. Auto sales were up 17.9 percent in the 12-month period.
 Economists said the strong consumer spending was most directly related to falling joblessness. The Labor Department reported yesterday that initial unemployment claims fell by 6,000 last week, to 308,000. The four-week average of jobless claims, considered a more reliable measure, fell 7,250, to 309,250.
 ''We are seeing on one side fewer layoffs, and on the other side we are seeing a pickup in hiring,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America's investment strategies group.
 The economy has added 190,000 jobs a month on average so far this year, up from 180,000 jobs a month last year. The unemployment rate was at 5 percent in June and July.
 Unlike in the last three years, when businesses were focused almost exclusively on cutting costs, Ms. Reaser said, companies are now ''becoming more confident about the sustainability of the recovery.''
 Ms. Reaser and other economists predict that business will act on that confidence in the coming months and increase production. In part, companies will be replacing inventories they have spent several months whittling down.
 A Commerce Department report showed business inventories were unchanged in June, after climbing just 0.1 percent in May. That is welcome news because companies, automakers chief among them, had to idle or slow production this spring to clear out overstuffed warehouses and car lots. 
 The flattening of inventories should also signal that businesses are likely to raise production in the second half of the year to meet the strong consumer demand indicated by the retail data.
 Economists noted that retail sales may well fall for at least one month later this year when automakers end their promotions, probably after Labor Day.
 ''Auto sales at these monstrous levels, these gargantuan levels, cannot be sustained,'' Mr. Mayland said. ''They will come back to normal levels.''
 Another concern in an otherwise bright economic picture remains rising energy prices. 
 Gasoline sales climbed 2.4 percent in June from July and 20.3 percent from a year earlier, according to the retail report. The price of a barrel of crude oil, the main ingredient in gasoline, closed at a record high of $65.80 yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Ms. Reaser said the rising prices had had only a small impact because gasoline accounts for only about 4 percent of consumer spending.

For Aging Baby Boomers, Paperbacks Easier on the Eyes
As baby boomers near retirement, they are finding it harder and harder to read the small type of mass-market paperbacks. Faced with declining sales, two publishers of mass-market titles, the Penguin Group and Simon & Schuster, have begun issuing new paperbacks in a bigger size that allows larger type and more space between lines.

Scott D. Sullivan, the former chief financial officer of WorldCom who acknowledged his leading role in the company's $11 billion accounting fraud, was sentenced by a federal judge to five years in prison. The sentence was a fifth of what sentencing guidelines suggested and a striking example of the benefit of working with government prosecutors. [C1.]

An Extended Run for 'The Sopranos'
In a deal that will extend the run of the most successful series in the history of cable television, HBO announced that ''The Sopranos'' will not end with its next season starting in March, but will continue with eight more episodes starting in January 2007. James Gandolfini, left, plays Tony Soprano in the drama about a New Jersey mob family, which has won more Emmy awards than any other cable TV show. [C5.]

Economy Shows Signs of Picking Up Its Pace
A series of economic reports showed rising retail sales, lower initial unemployment claims and continuing low inventory levels. Economists say the three reports confirm what many of them have been saying: the economic expansion is picking up its pace. [C3.]

For the third time this week, oil prices raced to a new high. Crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange hit $66 a barrel before closing at $65.80 a barrel, up 90 cents. [C7.]

Investors put aside concerns about rising oil prices, with generally positive economic news contributing to a late-day market rally. The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 91.48 points, or 0.86 percent, at 10,685.89. The Nasdaq rose 16.74 points, or 0.78 percent, to 2,174.55. [C7.]

DreamWorks said it had a net loss of $3.7 million, or 4 cents a share, for the quarter that ended June 30. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected a loss of 7 cents per share. DreamWorks announced earlier that it had overestimated DVD sales for ''Shrek 2,'' which caused its share price to tumble. [C6.]

HEADLINE: U.N. Agency Urges Iran To Halt Its Nuclear Activity 

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER and NAZILA FATHI; Thomas Fuller reported from Vienna for this article, and Nazila Fathi from Tehran. Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington

DATELINE: VIENNA, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
The United Nations nuclear agency expressed ''serious concern'' on Thursday about Iran's nuclear program, and Iran responded that it would not curtail its activities. 
 After two days of discussions, the 35 countries represented on the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency, agreed by consensus on a resolution that ''urges Iran to re-establish full suspension of all enrichment related activities.''
The board also set a Sept. 3 deadline for the agency's director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, to report on whether Iran was carrying out the terms of the resolution.
 Taken together, the elements in the board's statement fell short of what the United States and its European partners had hoped for only a week or so ago. 
 At that time, Britain, France and Germany joined in warning Iran that if it resumed uranium enrichment activities, they would seek immediate support at the nuclear agency's board for referring the issue to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions.
 Western diplomats said, however, that they were unable to get board approval for such an action after Iran resumed its uranium conversion, but invited international inspections to prove that it was not making fuel for weapons.
 In effect, these diplomats said, asking not to be identified by name or by country because that was the only way they felt comfortable discussing the internal politics of the situation, they did not have the votes to get a consensus for a Security Council referral and had to settle for yet another warning to Iran and yet another deadline by which to comply.
 Despite this disappointment, President Bush said in Crawford, Tex., that the board of the atomic agency had taken a positive first step. 
 ''As you know, there will be a report back after a period of time and we look forward to hearing what the report says,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that ''the world is coalescing'' around the demand that Iran not have ''the means and the wherewithal'' to make nuclear weapons.
 It was only shortly after the agency's board issued its statement that Iran responded negatively. 
 The Iranian representative at the talks, Cyrus Nasseri, called the resolution ''absurd.''
 He told the board members gathered in the United Nations complex that Iran would not suspend its uranium converting activities and that it questioned the authority of the agency to tell it to stop.
 ''Iran will not bend,'' Mr. Nasseri said. ''Iran will be a nuclear fuel producer and supplier within a decade.''
 He referred to American suspicions that Iran planned to make nuclear arms as a sense of ''deja vu.''
 ''Iran is not Iraq,'' he said. ''And the United States is not that self-appointed policeman of the world anymore.''
 Iran contends that its nuclear activities are solely for energy purposes, not for nuclear arms. Iran had agreed to suspend its nuclear activities temporarily while it engaged in negotiations with Britain, France and Germany. 
 In early August, the European nations offered Iran a package of assistance in return for the permanent suspension of its nuclear program. Iran rejected the offer, saying it did not meet even minimum expectations and said it would remove seals and resume uranium conversion at its Isfahan plant, the first step in the nuclear fuel production process. 
 The American envoy to the talks on Thursday, Greg Schulte, did not directly address the comments from Mr. Nasseri. But Mr. Schulte appeared at a news conference brandishing a copper seal used by the United Nations agency to monitor equipment and praised the action of the governing board.
 The resolution on Thursday ''shows that the international community is united in its determination that Iran move off the dangerous course that it is on,'' he said, holding up the seal.
 Under the international rules that govern nuclear materials, Iran has the right to process uranium for peaceful purposes. But the leaders of Europe and the United States say they are concerned about Iran's nuclear program because Iran kept certain facilities hidden for 18 years before they were revealed by an Iranian dissident group in 2002. 
 The resolution noted that outstanding issues relating to Iran's nuclear program had yet to be resolved and that the agency was not yet in a position to conclude that there were no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran.
 Diplomats said that on Sept. 3 the agency's board could take up the question of whether the case should be referred to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions if Iran ignored the resolution. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nonprofit organization that researches nuclear issues, said he believed that Britain, France and Germany were proceeding cautiously because they needed to build their case.
 ''Those who want to respond firmly recognize that they need to pace their action appropriately,'' Mr. Kimball said. ''If they overreach and assert that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons and that it must be hauled before the Security Council, they are going to lose support.''
 Mr. Nasseri said Iran was willing to continue discussions. ''We will be prepared, despite this hoopla, for negotiations, free of preconditions and with manifest good will,'' he said.
 Mr. ElBaradei said he believed negotiations could still succeed. ''I can see only one way to move forward and that is through negotiation,'' he said. ''We still have a window of opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rally Late in Day, Buoyed by Economic Data 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Investors put aside concerns about rising oil prices yesterday, with generally positive economic news contributing to a late-day market rally.
 The major stock indexes gained ground during the final two hours of the trading session, even after the price of oil momentarily crossed $66 a barrel. It finished at a record high close of $65.80 a barrel, up 90 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 But the ups and downs in stock prices yesterday, after a sell-off Wednesday, reflect persistent worries by investors that despite strong corporate earnings and upbeat economic reports, oil prices will eventually exact a toll. 
 ''Ordinarily you would expect the stock market to rise or do better, but it's not, and I think the reason it's not is it's being held in check by high oil prices,'' said Hugh Johnson, chairman of Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany.
 Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn., said, ''Oil prices will continue to be a nagging concern.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 91.48 points, or 0.86 percent, at 10,685.89.
 Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.68, or 0.71 percent, to 1,237.81, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 16.74, or 0.78 percent, to 2,174.55.
 Investors were also examining data from the Commerce Department showing retail sales rose 1.8 percent in July, less than analysts had expected. The increase came despite weak demand at department stores. Almost all the increase derived from auto sales, which jumped 6.7 percent. Excluding autos, retail sales rose just 0.3 percent, half the gain forecast by economists.
 The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits declined last week by 6,000 -- the first drop in three weeks -- to 308,000.
 In another Commerce Department report yesterday, inventories held by businesses were unchanged in June, the first time that levels had failed to increase in nine months. That subtracted significantly from overall economic growth in the second quarter but set the stage for much stronger growth in coming months.
 Stocks that traded heavily yesterday included Intel, which fell 6 cents, or 0.22 percent, to $26.82, after it was downgraded by Goldman Sachs.
 Target, the discount retailer, rose 11 cents, or 0.20 percent, to $55.65, after it posted strong sales that beat Wall Street estimates.
 Trading was also active in Whirlpool, which on Wednesday raised its bid for Maytag to $1.79 billion, or $2.7 billion including the assumption of debt. Whirlpool's stock fell 83 cents, or 1.02 percent, to $80.70. Maytag's shares declined 21 cents, or 1.11 percent, to $18.79.
 The News Corporation, the media conglomerate, gained 58 cents, or 3.53 percent, to $17.00 after it reported Wednesday that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 67 percent.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.47 billion shares, down from 1.75 billion shares traded at the same point Wednesday.

10-Year Treasuries Rise
(By Bloomberg News)
 United States 10-year Treasury notes rose the most in seven weeks after demand from international investors, who hold almost half of all the nation's government debt, increased at auction.
 Foreign central banks and investors that bid through so-called primary dealers bought 46.9 percent of the $13 billion of 10-year notes sold, the most since June 2003. 
 The price of the 10-year note rose 18/32, to 98 14/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 4.35 percent, down from 4.39 percent on Wednesday. 
 Here are the results of the auction of 10-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.196
High Yield: 4.350
Low Yield: 4.290
Median Yield: 4.337
Total applied for: $35,166,216

HEADLINE: The View From Crawford

 BODY:
The most surprising thing about the public's dissatisfaction with President Bush's handling of the economy, as expressed in recent polls, is the administration's apparent astonishment at Mr. Bush's low marks. His advisers have offered various explanations. Treasury Secretary John Snow says that strong consumer spending indicates that people don't feel as bad about the economy as they tell pollsters. He also suggests that part of the problem is that ''less educated people have seen their incomes and wages grow more slowly.'' Before a meeting with top economic advisers in Crawford this week, the president cited the high cost of energy and health care as weighing on ''the future of economic growth.'' 
 There may be some truth to that. But the overarching explanation is that people are feeling insecure because they understand that today's economy is built on shaky fundamentals. Average Americans may not sit around fretting about America's outsized budget and trade deficits, and its unprecedented foreign indebtedness. But many of them -- as buyers, borrowers and employees -- are concerned about the increasingly bubbly housing sector. 
 The economy's shortcomings are nowhere more obvious than in the job market. Nearly four years into an economic expansion, job growth is still substantially slower than in previous recoveries. Wages for 80 percent of the work force are barely keeping pace with inflation, and aid for the workers hurt by global trade is paltry. Because Mr. Bush fails to acknowledge the lackluster job and wage growth, he fails to respond appropriately. The administration's insistence that the economy is getting better all the time -- a stance that is based on statistical aggregates that are often divorced from individuals' actual experience -- only intensifies the anxiety that people feel.
 After the meeting in Crawford, participants said health care costs had been a major topic of discussion, though they wouldn't say what, if any, policies the president might pursue. Instead, they crowed about the administration's postvacation plans: to redouble efforts to privatize Social Security and to embark on ''tax reform,'' which is premised, in part, on permanent tax cuts for the wealthy and would therefore mean bigger deficits, drastic cuts in government services or higher taxes for everyone else. 
 At his vacation home, Mr. Bush told reporters that ''the economy of the United States is strong and the foundation for sustained growth is in place.'' The view from Crawford is clearly rosier than from where most Americans sit.

Liability Lawsuit Against Stun Gun Maker Is Dismissed by Court in Arizona
Taser International said yesterday that an Arizona court dismissed a wrongful death and product liability lawsuit against the company. The ruling, in the third wrongful death suit against Taser to be dismissed in the last month, sent the company's shares up about 11 percent. In the latest legal action, Taser, which makes stun guns, said the court in Maricopa County ordered a suit against it to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff would not be able to refile the suit. The suit cited Taser for wrongful death, negligent infliction of emotional distress and product liability. Shares of Taser rose 91 cents, to $9.35. (Reuters)

Red Robin Burgers Shares Fall After Executives Quit
Shares of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers fell 24 percent as two executives quit after an internal investigation of travel and entertainment expenses. The company also said that profit for the third quarter and year would miss analysts' estimates. Michael J. Snyder, the chief executive, retired, and James P.

A man who owned an e-mail marketing company was convicted yesterday of stealing information from the data broker Acxiom in what prosecutors said was the largest federal computer theft case ever. The jury convicted Scott Levine, the owner of the defunct e-mail marketing contractor Snipermail.com, on 120 counts of unauthorized access to data, two counts of access device fraud and one count of obstruction of justice. Mr. Levine and his company were accused of stealing 1.6 billion customer records. (AP)

French Economy Grew Only 0.1% in Last Quarter
The French economy fared worse than expected in the second quarter, growing just 0.1 percent, according to the French statistics agency. Economists had expected growth of 0.3 percent. The first-quarter figure, however, was revised to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent previously. The second-quarter result showed the French economy was not growing fast enough to deliver the government's growth target for this year of close to 2 percent. (AP)

Overstock.com President Says S.E.C. Has Begun Inquiry
The president of Overstock.com, Patrick M. Byrne, left, said in a conference call yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission began an informal inquiry into the company in February. Mr. Byrne was discussing a lawsuit filed Thursday by Overstock.com against Rocker Partners and Gradient Analytics. Overstock said that Rocker Partners, a hedge fund, drove down Overstock's stock price to reap a profit on a bet the shares would fall. It said that Gradient issued negative reports on Overstock based on information supplied by Rocker. Mr. Byrne said that the S.E.C. was pushed into starting an inquiry into his company. He did not give details about the nature of the inquiry. (Dow Jones)

Movie Gallery Posts Quarterly Loss After Acquisition
Movie Gallery the video-rental chain, said yesterday that it had a second-quarter loss of $12.2 million, its first in 10 quarters, because of costs to acquire Hollywood Entertainment and a slump in movie rentals. The net loss was 39 cents a share, in contrast to net income of $10.6 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier, Movie Gallery said. Sales in the period that ended July 3 almost tripled, to $504.7 million, after the purchase of Hollywood Entertainment. Expenses related to the acquisition, including accounting changes, financing fees and bonuses, cut profit by $16.4 million. (Bloomberg News)

 Tyson Foods Sued After Bias Complaints at Plant
Tyson Foods was sued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for reportedly retaliating against black workers who complained that a ''whites only'' sign had been posted outside a restroom. Two black employees at Tyson's plant in Ashland, Ala., were suspended and given ''disciplinary write-ups'' after making their complaints, the commission said. Sometimes the restroom was locked and an out-of-order sign was posted, with keys distributed only to white workers, the commission said. Tyson Foods is ''surprised and disappointed'' by the lawsuit, Gary Mickelson, a company spokesman, said. The restroom was being remodeled and was padlocked, with an out-of-order sign posted, he said. A company investigation was not able to verify that a ''whites only'' sign was posted or whether any of the 300 employees at the poultry processing plant had been restricted from using the restroom, he said.

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Shows a Decline 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Rising oil prices over the last few months depressed consumer sentiment as August began, an economic report showed yesterday.
 In a sign that higher energy prices are affecting consumers, the University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for August slipped to 92.7, from 96.5 in July. 
The consensus forecast of economists had been for a smaller decline, to 96.
 ''These numbers are coming in line with other confidence figures, which shot ahead in May and June with oil prices falling, and now with oil prices soaring, we are seeing the effect from higher prices at the pump,'' said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colo.
 Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, has been contained because the increase in energy prices has not filtered into prices of other goods and services.

HEADLINE: Do Try This at Home: Assess Your Area's Real Estate Bubble

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
For the first time since the residential real estate marathon began 13 years ago, parts of the country are showing signs of exhaustion. But if you rely on the experts to declare that a particular area's bubble has popped, you may have waited too long.
 So how can a homeowner tell if a market is about to go bust? This may be one of those rare occasions when professionals parsing data are at a disadvantage to regular people watching the market. That's because the main driver of today's market is consumer psychology. Home prices go up as long as people expect them to go up.
When they stop believing, prices fall -- and no economist in Washington can get wind of that faster than someone chatting over knockwurst at a neighborhood block party. ''Economists looking at the macrodata will be the last to know,'' said Richard A. Brown, chief economist at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 What you will learn from the professionals who are dutifully crunching numbers is that prices are not falling significantly in any of the hot markets, but in a dozen or so cities in the Northeast and in California, they are near the peak. In Boston, for example, the time that homes are sitting on the market has stretched to 46 days from 39 days a year ago. 
 An analysis of price appreciation, done for The New York Times by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, shows that the price appreciation in cities including New York City; Austin, Tex.; Philadelphia; and Providence, R.I., are decelerating. Appreciation in Detroit and Denver has already slowed to a crawl.
 ''It's taking a lot longer to sell a home,'' says Karl A. Martone, a Re/Max Properties agent in Providence, where homes now sit on the market an average of 65 days, up from 14 days a year ago. The region has almost six months of inventory, which is up 35 percent from a year ago.
 Vicki Doran, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker in Providence, says: ''It's switching to a buyer's market. Last year buyers had to snap things up. Now they can shop around.''
 Even a few markets in hard-charging California -- San Diego, Orange County and Santa Cruz -- are part of the trend, according to data from the first three months of the year. Data for the second quarter to be released by the government on Sept. 1 may confirm the trend. But already Christopher Thornberg, senior forecaster at UCLA Anderson Forecast, a service of the University of California, Los Angeles, says California has ''peaked and is already coming down the back side.''
 On Tuesday, David A. Lereah, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said that the housing market was ''probably close to a peak right now.'' 
 Take a look at the hot San Diego condo market. In Park Place, one of the many sleek towers of condominiums recently slung up around Petco Park, a one-bedroom condo is offered for $719,000. Someone buying it would expect to make mortgage payments of about $3,775 a month, plus monthly maintenance fees. 
 But someone really wanting to live in the high-rise, with hardwood floors, granite countertops and city views for a lot less, could rent a nearly identical unit in the same building for $2,400 a month. That is clear evidence prices have to move down. You are more apt to see that the price of residential property no longer is connected to its underlying value than a person looking only at spreadsheets of sales data.
 Prices in overheated markets must, by definition, come back down to the mean. Knowing which way the market is headed before buying or selling is extremely important to anyone who wants to protect the wealth tied up in a house. And it certainly matters to anyone who is thinking of buying because it never makes much sense to buy at the top of the market. ''The turning point is pretty important,'' Mr. Brown said, ''because the trend will play out for years.''
 The trouble is, economists have been wrong before when they try to call the market. Three years ago, Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, said that it would be only a matter of months before prices began to fall. Prognosticators at the research firm Economy.com declared that the peak was last summer. Celia Chen, the firm's director for housing economics, is now saying that it will come this year.
 ''The timing is always difficult with these things,'' admits Ian Morris, chief United States economist at HSBC Securities U.S.A., who made the same call, repeatedly.
 John Karevoll, an analyst with DataQuick Information Systems, which provides real estate data to lenders, said: ''We've been told for years that the peak is just around the corner. The economists have so much egg on their faces.''
 Don't be too hard on them. It's the nature of their science. N. Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard University professor and former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, made one of the most famous miscalls. In 1989 he wrote a paper arguing that the aging of the baby boomers was going to undermine the housing market in the 1990's and 2000's. Whoops.
 Though it appears the shift is now at hand, the end of the bubble will not look anything like the crash in the stock market after the technology bubble. The stock market turns frenetic when investors scramble to get out and prices fall sharply. In housing, however, a collapse is signaled by a sharp drop in activity as people hold off buying. Houses stay on the market longer. Inventories grow. Only then will prices fall, slowly. Economists say prices will lag a slowdown in the market by four to six months.
 Some of the data on where a local market is headed is available on the Internet (links are at nytimes.com/business). In other cases, your real estate agent is your best friend. He or she has access to a storehouse of raw data from the local Multiple Listing Service. Here are some indicators to look at: 

MARKET ACTIVITY -- How many homes are sold compared with the month before is the earliest indicator, but it is notorious for false positives. But if the number of homes sold starts to drop, perk up. Every county tracks this and makes it available to the public.

INVENTORY -- Some of the most crucial pieces of information are held closely by real estate agents. The number of houses on the market is one of them. The national average is 4.3 months; 6 months is closer to normal, the National Association of Realtors says. When it grows, there is trouble coming.

TIME ON THE MARKET -- Agents control access to this information, and be warned: they know how to manipulate it. A house that has been languishing can be taken off and put back to look like a fresh listing. But you'll still be able to see the average time stretching as a clear signal of cooling.

PRICES -- It's what you care about most. But month-to-month comparisons are nearly useless as an indicator because sales of a few houses on either end of the market can skew the figures. DataQuick at www.dqnews.com has some data and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight issues quarterly reports.

FAILED TO SELL -- The super-secret indicator among agents is the number of houses that are quietly taken off the market -- usually because they are priced too high. Wheedle the number out of them and you'll have a strong indicator of market health.

PRICE-TO-RENT RATIO -- This is a wonderful measure that gets at the intrinsic value of a property, but it's a tricky tool for the layman. Rent data include everything from studios to four-bedroom penthouses, making a comparison with single-family homes difficult. Some of the rent data can be found at www.realfacts.com.

LOAN QUALITY -- The popularity of interest-only mortgages could become one of the best indicators of a fragile market, several economists say. Mr. Thornberg of UCLA Anderson says it's a sign that lenders are scraping the bottom of the barrel. ''We are close to running out of shills,'' he says.

RISK -- The PMI Group of Walnut Creek, Calif., a provider of data to the mortgage industry, estimates how much prices could drop using an econometric model. It publishes the list of at-risk cities at www.pmigroup.com.

POPULAR SENTIMENT -- To judge from the media, the housing bubble may have peaked in June. According to a Nexis search of magazines and newspapers, that month was the peak, with 312 references to ''housing bubble,'' almost six times that of a year earlier. It fell 24 percent in July.
 Of course, there is one constant: real estate agent sentiment. Most of them will never tire of saying it's a great time to buy. Despite the signs of a slowdown, Mr. Martone, the Providence real estate agent, says prices are holding and he still does not have enough properties to sell. He says, ''I am the eternal optimist.''

HEADLINE: As Gasoline Prices Soar, Drivers Seek More Ways to Save at Pump

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Reporting for this article was contributed by Terry Aguayo in Miami; Janon Fisher in Hackensack, N.J.; Carolyn Marshall in San Francisco; Gretchen Ruethling in Chicago; Chelsea J. Samuel in Atlanta; and Katie Zezima in Plymouth, Mass.

DATELINE: DENVER, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
By day, Ken Colaizzi logs a lot of miles for his family's home-improvement business, and as he drives, he likes to note the price of gasoline at local stations. 
 At night he becomes a kind of Walter Winchell of pump-and-pay, dishing the dirt about whose prices are hot and whose are not, as a volunteer price spotter for denvergasprices.com, a comparative fuel shopping Web site.
''I like to expose the ones who are charging outrageous amounts,'' Mr. Colaizzi said. ''People work hard for their money, and the last thing you want to do is spend an extra 50 cents a gallon that you didn't have to.'' 
 For millions of Americans, filling up the tank has become an eye-popping experience this summer as prices reached levels that, after adjusting for inflation, have been seen only once on any sustained basis since World War II -- in the late 1970's and early 1980's, when the Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war disrupted global oil supplies. 
 Through last Monday, the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded had risen nearly 26 percent in 12 months, according to the Federal Energy Information Administration, with the sharpest rise -- 17 percent in just the last two months.
 The price continued to rise this week, reaching $2.41 on Friday, a record, the American Automobile Association's daily survey found.
 But as Mr. Colaizzi's adventures in cyberspace illustrate, the United States is in a very different place today from where it was in the late 1970's.
 The tools to fight back have changed, for one thing. From the Internet to the alternative fuel choices of ethanol and electricity hybrid technology -- and more adventurous forays, like a school district in Georgia that is experimenting with chicken-fat-laced fuel for its bus fleet -- options abound. 
 Countering that development almost completely, energy experts and economists say, is that people drive more than they did a generation ago, with longer commuting trips from sprawling suburbs, and are more likely to be driving big sport utility vehicles or light trucks when they do. 
 ''This gas and vehicle thing is tied up with the entire way we lead our lives now,'' said Steve Hoch, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. The bigger vehicles that are getting slammed by the surge in gasoline prices, Professor Hoch said, are all part of the supersized demographic shift to bigger everything in the last decade, like the sizes of an average home and of the average big-box discount retail store.
 ''But just imagine if everybody had to get to Costco in a Prius,'' Professor Hoch added, referring to the Toyota gas-electric hybrid that gets about 50 miles to the gallon. ''How would they bring the 43 rolls of toilet paper home? This shift to higher prices is not going to be easy.''
 Some pathways to a cheaper tank remain unchanged -- as tried and true as the early bird and the worm. Garrie Baldwin, a schoolteacher who lives in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, got up at 4 a.m. on Wednesday to drive 25 miles to Hackensack, N.J., for a gasoline giveaway to the first 100 customers, paid for by a shopping complex in Pennsylvania. He was the first in line.
 ''Any time you can get some free gas, you've got to take it these days,'' Mr. Baldwin said. 
 Mr. Baldwin's fiancee, Andrea Rouse, said she thought the same way. She was third in line.
 Jose Blanco, a gasoline station attendant at the Bird Road Chevron in Miami, said many of his customers no longer filled up their tanks, because they could not afford to or they could not bear to watch the numbers turn over.
 ''They're trying to not spend too much at once, so you see them pumping $5, and two or three days later you'll see the same person pumping another $5,'' Mr. Blanco said. 
 Some people are fighting back in more overt ways. Hundreds of truck drivers choked southern Florida highways on Wednesday in a protest convoy in support of price breaks for independent commercial haulers. Reports of gasoline ''driveoff'' thefts have risen around the country.
 But the more common response, expressed in dozens of interviews around the nation this week, owed much more to Rodney Dangerfield -- an eye-rolling shrug of what-can-you-do resignation. It was embodied by Tim McNulty, a 54-year-old house painter. Gasoline, Mr. McNulty said, is not optional. It is like tobacco, he added, dragging on a cigarette as he spoke to a reporter at the Kean Oil Company, a station on Chicago's South Side.
 ''If you have a job and you've got to drive, then you're going to buy the gas,'' he said.
 In Georgia, Terry Simpson, transportation director of the Floyd County School District, said he was testing biodiesel fuel to see whether blends of 5 percent to 20 percent chicken fat were more efficient. 
 Economists say that prices have been driven up by oldest equation of all -- global demand outpacing the supply, compounded by unease in the Middle East and a lack of new refineries for processing oil into gasoline. The contract price of crude oil reached $67.10 a barrel in trading on Friday, a record.
 Economists also say the context of the energy surge is crucial to how people are responding. In the 70's, they say, higher gasoline prices were seen by many people as part of a fabric of woes like inflation, high interest rates and cold war tensions with the Soviet Union. In the 40's, with the nation at war, high gasoline prices -- not to mention gasoline rationing -- were the least of many people's worries. 
 Today, with low interest rates and easy credit card access, many people can absorb, or at least postpone, the pain without changing their behavior all that much. Surveys by AAA suggest that many summer travelers are doing just that, taking the family vacation no matter what and worrying about the costs later.
 ''They only have a certain number of paid days off from work, the kids are out of school, and they're just very reluctant to give it up,'' said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for AAA.
 But at least one economist -- though there may be others out there hiding under their desks -- said he thought that gasoline prices were still not high enough and that Americans in a time of war should be making greater sacrifices for their country through higher gasoline taxes.
 ''I think it would be a good thing if gasoline prices were twice as high as they are now, though I know that won't make me popular,'' said George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. 
 Professor Loewenstein said a gradual increase in the gasoline tax, as opposed to market-driven price increases that he said benefited mainly oil producers, would help the federal budget deficit and decrease dependence on foreign oil by encouraging conservation.
 At the Pinewood Lodge Campground in Plymouth, Mass., companies that deliver supplies to the campground grocery store and ice cream shop have begun passing along higher fuel costs with surcharges, said the campground owner, Jim Saunders. The good news, he said, is that some campers are staying longer to save money on gasoline themselves.
 Bruce Blair, 54, a teacher from Celina, Ohio, who drove 14 hours to the campground with his family to see his son in a marching band competition, canceled plans to drive to Seattle for a week.
 ''We didn't want to spend $1,000 on gas to get there,'' Mr. Blair said as he fixed the rearview mirror on his Chevy Astrovan. The family was sleeping in a white pop-up trailer parked behind the car. ''It makes you think twice about where you're going.''
 Some people are seeing opportunities in the price spiral to help others. Members of the Gateway Pentecostal Fellowship in Cranston, R.I., raised $1,000 last month to subsidize the price of gasoline at a service station to help working-class residents. The church's members pumped 2,000 gallons, trimmed by a 50-cent-a-gallon subsidy, down to $1.89.
 The Gateway pastor, Russell Farmer explained, ''We just wanted to be there as representatives of the Lord and show that he cares about everyday problems.'' 
 People who study consumer behavior say the next threshold to watch for in reaction to rising prices is the number ''3,'' as in $3 a gallon. 
 This week, drivers in San Francisco officially saw a ''3.'' A Chevron station near the Golden Gate Bridge sold regular unleaded for $3.09 a gallon on Thursday morning. At 11 a.m., a clerk strolled over to the price-per-gallon placard and added 6 cents, putting the price at $3.15.

HEADLINE: The Terrorist And the Grid

BYLINE: By Gregory S. McNeal. 
Gregory S. McNeal is a research fellow at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law's Institute for Global Security Law and Policy.

DATELINE: Cleveland 

 BODY:
AFTER the blackout of 2003, addressing the vulnerabilities of America's electrical grid was a top priority. Not only was the creaky system going to be repaired and restructured, its key facilities were going to be reinforced to guard against terrorism. After all, Al Qaeda documents suggest that terrorists have considered attacking the grid, which would cause chaos, wreak economic havoc, and possibly cost lives. 
 So here we are, nearly two years later, and is the grid safer? Sadly, no. Terrorists could still send a nation as powerful and modernized as the United States into the dark ages for weeks.
Here's why. Our electrical grid distributes energy throughout the nation on an as-needed basis. Generators transmit power over high-voltage lines using electrical substations. These substations are controlled by an enormous computerized switching system. This system uses sophisticated and difficult-to-replace solid-state and electro-mechanical relays. The relays prevent overloads and other failures from crippling the grid's electrical equipment and transmission facilities. Herein lies the vulnerability. 
 The relays are housed in lightly protected buildings next to substations. While barbed-wire fences protect the substations themselves, there is little to safeguard the switching stations. In most cases only aluminum prefabricated buildings house and protect the switching computers and relays. (There are hundreds of these stations in the United States, but some are more important than others because of the amount of energy they handle.)
 To attack the grid, a terrorist need only study publicly available trade journals, which explain where new facilities are constructed. These journals document both the transmission capacity of switching stations and the geographic areas for which they are responsible. A terrorist could then disable a particular system by destroying the computers and relays housed in the poorly protected building.
 An attack on one facility would likely plunge the served area into immediate darkness and, depending on the size of the substation, would cause a significant strain on the rest of the electrical grid, particularly in summer, when usage is at its peak. A coordinated attack on four or five critical sites could send much of the nation into darkness for weeks. 
 Consider this: it takes days to make repairs during even small-scale outages because each station has customized equipment. Faced with the damage from a coordinated attack, technicians would need weeks to find the components necessary to repair these specialized computer systems. After acquiring these components, the technicians would then face the laborious task of properly programming and rewiring the systems. 
 What can we do? It's not complicated: government and industry need to harden security at these lightly guarded facilities -- starting with the ones that control the most power and working down from there. The energy industry is well aware of our vulnerability, but it simply hasn't done enough to bolster security because of the enormous cost of protecting critical substations. 
 True, security doesn't come cheap. Safeguarding federal buildings following the Oklahoma City bombings cost more than $1 billion. Securing electrical substations would cost at least as much. But the price of a nationwide outage would dwarf that figure. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Energy must pass regulations to ensure that the energy industry protects critical substations. We must act before our enemies do.

HEADLINE: U.S. Donors to Pay Departing Jews for Gaza Greenhouses

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
A consortium of wealthy Americans has put up $14 million to compensate Jewish settlers for their Gaza Strip greenhouses, and the facilities will be handed over to the Palestinians as soon as the Israelis leave, participants in the deal said Friday.
 The unusual arrangement was put together by James D. Wolfensohn, the former World Bank president and the current Middle East envoy for the Bush administration. Mr. Wolfensohn also contributed $500,000 of his own money.
 ''The arrangement gives a real opportunity for the Palestinians and makes the departure of Israelis from Gaza much easier,'' Mr. Wolfensohn said Friday in an interview. He added that he believed ''the Palestinians are trying to make this a peaceful transition -- at least the Palestinian Authority is.'' 
 The agreement, just four days before Israel is to begin evacuating settlers from Gaza, is intended keep valuable agricultural properties intact for Palestinian use.
 Although Palestinians are eager to see the Israeli settlers go, the withdrawal could leave the Palestinians in even more dire economic straits, at least in the short term. About 3,500 Palestinians have worked in the greenhouses as employees of the Israeli settlers and would lose their jobs if the greenhouses are torn down. The greenhouses grow vegetables, spices, flowers and other produce that have become a major source of Israeli export income.
 In addition, the Erez industrial zone on Gaza's northern border with Israel has been closed or limping along at partial capacity for the past couple years. It is not clear whether thousands of Palestinians will be able to continue working at factories there after the pullout.
 Israel and Palestinian officials discussed the fate of greenhouses for months, but could not reach a solution. Even without an agreement, Palestinians would end up with the greenhouses. But Jewish settlers have complained that the Israeli government was not offering sufficient compensation, and they have threatened to dismantle or destroy computerized irrigation systems and other valuable equipment needed to keep the greenhouses running.
 The Palestinians, meanwhile, were adamant that they would not allow official United States government assistance or international aid designated for the Palestinians to be used to compensate settlers.
 Mr. Wolfensohn said that with the danger of the greenhouses being torn down, he turned to private donors to raise the money for the greenhouses -- specifically about a half dozen wealthy individuals whom he declined to identify.
 The donors are giving the money to the Aspen Institute, a private business and public policy advocacy group that set up a program to ease investments in Gaza and the West Bank about a year ago. Mr. Wolfensohn said that former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, a chairwoman of the institute's Middle East strategy group, and Walter Isaacson, the institute's president, helped assess the project and ''gave comfort to donors who were concerned about giving to something they didn't know anything about.''
 ''This is a win-win situation,'' said Boaz Karni, the treasurer of the Economic Cooperation Foundation, a private Israeli group that also helped broker the deal. ''On the Israeli side, the farmers will get more compensation. And the Palestinians will get something that could be a cornerstone of their economy in Gaza.''
 The American consortium worked through the Economic Cooperation Foundation, which signed an agreement with representatives of the Jewish settlers on Thursday, Mr. Karni said.
 According to Mr. Karni, the agreement covers about 90 percent of the more than 1,000 acres of greenhouses in Gush Katif, the main settlement cluster in Gaza. However, some journalists who have been to the area recently say a good number of the greenhouses have already been at least partly dismantled.
 Some Gaza farmers hope to rebuild them in Israel, while others say they oppose leaving them for Palestinians. It is unclear what percentage of the greenhouses are in working order, though some estimate it at around 50 percent.
 The Palestinians say they have received limited information about the greenhouses and have some doubts about their economic viability.
 The greenhouses were heavily subsidized by the Israeli government and may be beyond the means of the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinians say. The greenhouses consume large amounts of water in a territory where it is scarce.
 Still, the Jewish farmers in Gaza, numbering several hundred, have been selling tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, spices and flowers, earning about $75 million annually, Mr. Karni said. The produce is sold in Israel and is also exported to Europe.
 Farming was the largest single industry for the nearly 9,000 Jewish settlers who are to be removed, beginning next week, under Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's withdrawal plan.
 In an interview published Friday in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot, Mr. Sharon said Israel might eventually have to relinquish additional Jewish settlements in the West Bank, where the vast majority of settlers live. Mr. Sharon said that in the West Bank, the large settlement clusters would remain under Israeli control. But Israeli has more than 120 settlements there, many of them small and isolated.
 Asked about the fate of several remote settlements, he said, ''The question will arise at the last stage of negotiations with the Palestinians.''
 The Israeli leader also said he had no regrets about his decision to uproot the Gaza settlers, despite the fierce criticism it had generated among many right-wing Israelis. ''It was clear to me that the initiative would not be accepted easily,'' Mr. Sharon said. ''But the presence in Gaza with everything it entails, the price we are paying, had to end.''
 In Gaza City, meanwhile, the militant group Hamas reaffirmed that it would not surrender its weapons to the Palestinian Authority after Israel's withdrawal.
 ''This army will continue to defend our homeland as long as one inch of Palestine remains occupied,'' Dr. Mahmoud Zahar, a top Hamas leader, told reporters.
 Hamas has pledged to refrain from attacks against Israelis in Gaza during the pullout, but Dr. Zahar said he had rejected the call by the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, for ''one authority, one weapon.''

HEADLINE: June Trade Deficit Surged As Oil Price Resumed Climb 

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit surged in June to its highest level in four months, pushed up by the rising cost of imported oil and the reluctance of foreigners to purchase more of what America produces.
 The $58.8 billion deficit in the trade of goods and services was $3.4 billion above the slightly revised May level, the government reported yesterday. Imported crude oil and petroleum products accounted for roughly half of the increase, and with oil prices continuing to rise since June, the promise is for even larger trade deficits in coming reports.
 ''There's not a lot of relief in sight,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a forecasting and data gathering firm. ''I would not be surprised to see the monthly deficit go above $60 billion by fall, and stay there.'' 
 The trade deficit narrowed in the late winter and early spring, getting as low as $53.6 billion in March, and the Commerce Department had assumed that the June number would continue that trend. That assumption was incorporated into the department's initial estimate of economic growth for the second quarter, which ended in June. 
 The initial estimate was for a 3.4 percent rise in the gross domestic product. That was published in late July, before the June trade numbers were available. Now the June deficit is likely to shave one- or two-tenths of a percentage point off the G.D.P. estimate, some economists say. The reason is that the extra outlay for imports represents money diverted from spending for domestically produced goods and services. Domestic production is the source of economic growth. 
 ''We had expected an upward revision in the second-quarter G.D.P. estimate on the basis of other recently released data,'' said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, ''but trade kind of goes in the opposite direction.''
 No country played a bigger role than China in swelling the June trade deficit. China's purchases in the United States rose by a meager $96 million, to $3.4 billion, but its exports to this country jumped by $1.9 billion, to a total of $21 billion. Textiles, apparel and electronics products played significant roles in the surge, which produced a $17.6 billion trade deficit with China -- eclipsing the $12.8 billion June deficit with Europe, in second place.
 China's lopsided imbalance captures headlines, overshadowing the role of United States exports, which almost always rise. Indeed, they were a record $106.8 billion in June. But they have been stuck at nearly that level since April, despite a 15 percent decline in the value of the dollar over the last three years vis-a-vis the currencies of America's most important trading partners. A cheaper dollar should stimulate exports by making them less expensive in foreign currencies, and stimulate production at home by making imports more expensive.
 Mr. Behravesh counts on this to happen, but first ''the dollar must fall a minimum of at least an additional 20 percent, including at least that much against the Chinese yuan.'' The yuan so far is down 2.1 percent, a result of the Chinese government's announcement last month that it would allow the yuan to appreciate gradually. 
 Some economists argue that faith in exchange rates is misplaced. They say that consumption and economic growth are much stronger in the United States than in other countries and that Americans, as a result, suck in imports at a greater pace than people abroad. 
 ''The trade deficit is much more responsive to the growth and consumption differential than to exchange rates,'' said David Malpass, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, representing this view.
 Other economists are concerned, however, that some of the products once exported from the United States are no longer made here. They note that while the trade surplus in services -- particularly financial services -- is rising, the amounts involved are too small to offset the swelling imbalance in goods.
 Television sets and VCR's, for example, are either no longer made in the United States or are made in small numbers. But demand is strong and imports of these items totaled $8.7 billion in June, overwhelming exports of $1.9 billion. Vehicles hew to a similar pattern -- $16.4 billion in imports versus $6.2 billion in exports -- and so does machinery, at a moment when investment by business is rising.
 ''There is a question now whether we can go back to making the stuff in the United States that Americans want,'' said Catherine L. Mann, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics. ''I don't know.''

HEADLINE: Corporate Boards to Investors: Let Them Eat Doughnuts

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
CORPORATE directors can rest easy. If the decision in the Disney shareholders' suit and the results of an internal investigation at Krispy Kreme are any indication, board members are not going to be held as accountable as they once worried they might be. Oversight, such as it is, will be mostly up to senior executives, and the judge in the Disney case suggested that their duties as fiduciaries are pretty narrowly defined. 
Still, out-and-out fraud continues to pose the risk of an extended stay in prison, at least for company officers who admit it or for those unlucky enough to have underlings who testify against them. Three more executives from WorldCom were sentenced to jail.

GOOD FAITH -- Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, ''enthroned himself as the omnipotent and infallible monarch of his personal Magic Kingdom,'' Chancellor William B. Chandler III of Delaware Chancery Court said in a decision. ''His lapses were many,'' he added, and ''he failed to keep the board as informed as he should have.''
 Disney's board, meanwhile, ''fell significantly short of the best practices of ideal corporate governance,'' the judge said. ''Many lessons of what not to do can be learned from defendants' conduct here.''
 Despite such chiding, Chancellor Chandler decided that Mr. Eisner and his board acted in ''good faith'' when they sent Michael S. Ovitz packing with a $140 million severance package after serving 14 months as company president. And so the judge dismissed a shareholder lawsuit that had sought to force Disney's directors to reimburse shareholders out of their own pockets.
 The ruling eases some concerns that board members had about the extent of their personal liabilities for decisions they make about how much to pay executives during and after their tenure, lawyers said.

'VERY TROUBLING' -- As Krispy Kreme's stock soared and its shops multiplied in 2000 and 2001, analysts and journalists ascribed the company's success to its gimmick of selling hot glazed doughnuts straight from the kitchen. Turns out that cooking the books may have played a role, too.
 A two-man committee of the company's board, supported by forensic accountants and lawyers, reached that conclusion after having interviewed more than 100 employees and scouring the books to reconstruct why the company's profits and stock plummeted. In a 24-page summary of its findings, the committee said it had found $25.6 million in ''egregious accounting errors'' that might have been an attempt to ''manage earnings.''
 Joseph Allerhand, one of the lawyers, said, ''We didn't catch anyone red-handed, but we did uncover facts that are very troubling.''
 The report cited two former officers -- the chief executive, Scott A. Livengood, and the chief operating officer, John W. Tate -- for various failures, but did not single out any member of the board for lax oversight. Mr. Livengood, through his lawyer, denied any wrongdoing.
 The company has sent a longer version of the report to investigators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States attorney's office in New York. Civil or criminal charges may follow.

LOOSE ENDS -- With WorldCom's former chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers, convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison, the time was ripe to close the books on the lower-level executives who admitted to having abetted the company's accounting fraud, the largest in history.
 Scott D. Sullivan, the chief financial officer, was the most senior underling sentenced. After considering prosecutors' descriptions of how Mr. Sullivan assisted in their pursuit of Mr. Ebbers, Judge Barbara S. Jones of Federal District Court in Manhattan sentenced him to five years in prison. That was just a fifth of what federal sentencing guidelines suggested.
 Earlier in the week, Judge Jones ordered David F. Myers, WorldCom's former controller, and Buford Yates Jr., the former director of accounting, to spend a year and a day in prison. Last week, she sentenced one WorldCom accountant, Betty L. Vinson, to five months in jail and five months of home detention. Another accountant, Troy M. Normand, received probation.
 The relatively short sentence handed down to Mr. Sullivan should encourage executives to cooperate with the authorities in future investigations of corporate wrongdoing. Mr. Sullivan, for example, will get out of jail when he is still in his 40's rather than almost 70. ''That's a big difference,'' said Kirby D. Behre, a former prosecutor who is now a partner with Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker.

HIGHER AND HIGHER -- With consumers spending more, despite surging energy prices, Federal Reserve policy makers continued their upward march in interest rates, stepping up the benchmark short-term rate to 3.5 percent from 3.25 percent. It was the 10th increase since last summer.
 The change in the benchmark federal funds rate, which had been expected, will directly affect many credit card and business loans. Higher rates are designed to keep inflation in check while still allowing the economy to grow. The inflation rate -- the pace at which prices are rising -- is 2.5 percent. The economy grew at an annual rate of about 3.4 percent in the second quarter.
 Based on the price of a futures contract that tracks Federal Reserve actions, investors expect the so-called fed funds rate to reach 4.25 percent by the end of the year. That would require the Fed to lift the rate at each of its three remaining meetings in 2005.

HEADLINE: British Airways Strike Strands Thousands 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and GRAHAM BOWLEY; Micheline Maynard reported from Detroit for this article and Graham Bowley from London.

 BODY:
A strike at British Airways that stranded tens of thousands of travelers at Heathrow Airport in London ended yesterday, but it may be several days before the airline can get all of its angry and frustrated passengers to their destinations. 
 ''We are just waiting to see what's coming next, and no one seems to really know anything,'' Chuck Weinstein, 77, from Boston told the BBC. He was trying to return to the United States with his partner, Janet Gorham, after a trip to Prague.
Nor are international airline passengers the only ones facing the potential of disruptions. 
 Northwest Airlines is facing a deadline of one week from today in its dispute with its mechanics union. If no deal is reached by 12:01 a.m. next Saturday, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association could strike the airline. Should that happen, Northwest is vowing to operate its schedule using replacement workers; it has spent $10 million to hire and train substitutes. 
 In turn, the union said yesterday that mechanics it represents at other airlines would support their Northwest counterparts in any way necessary, although sympathy strikes are illegal in the United States when contracts are in place. This week's strike by British Airways ground workers at Heathrow was in sympathy with workers striking a caterer at the London airport. Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, could be the next major airline company to seek bankruptcy protection. It is taking steps to find financing in case it has to file for Chapter 11, officials with direct knowledge of the airline's plans said yesterday. 
 Many people in the industry, from analysts to executives at competing companies, are predicting that could happen as soon as next month, because the airline may not have enough cash to cover its obligations.
 And while a possible bankruptcy filing would not disrupt Delta's operations, at least in the short term, it is one more worry for passengers who have seen bankruptcies, cutbacks in routes and flights and layoffs among airline employees in the last few years.
 ''It is a mess in the offing,'' said Tim Winship, editor of Frequentflier.com, an industry Web site that tracks frequent-flier programs at the major airlines. ''The whole situation is coming apart at the seams. From a consumer standpoint, it has to be very, very troubling. '' 
 Passengers, he said, must be ultra-aware of potential problems, especially those flying on tickets obtained with frequent-flier miles. In the event of cancellations, he said, airlines accommodate paying passengers first. Holders of other tickets ''are absolutely going to be at the bottom of the list,'' he said.
 The combination of bad news for the industry is an unhappy note in a summer travel season that until now had been relatively sunny for airlines overseas and in the United States. Airlines have been enjoying strong traffic during the last few months, especially on routes across the Atlantic Ocean, allowing them to raise ticket prices and help offset the escalating price of oil.
 The airlines were counting on the summer business to help lift them back to profitability, after five years of losses topping $30 billion. In fact, American, Continental and several low-fare airlines including Southwest, AirTran and JetBlue made money during the second quarter. 
 ''I thought a month ago that the industry had reached a plateau, and we would finally see what the direction would be,'' said Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ''Instead, it's just gone from bad to worse.'' 
 The International Air Transport Association, a trade group that represents nearly all of the world's airlines, is predicting industry losses of $6 billion this year, most of it coming from carriers in the United States, where low-fare competition and record jet fuel prices are hampering the industry's recovery.
 By contrast, until this week, British Airways was seen as an industry success story, having turned itself around by cutting both its costs and thousands of jobs. This month, it said it had doubled its second-quarter profit, to $160.8 million, and it managed to raise ticket revenue for the first time since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 But that success was damaged by this week's events, which began when workers at British Airways walked out in support of catering employees at Gate Gourmet, which handles the airline's food service. The unofficial strike followed labor disruptions over the last two summers at Heathrow, which handles about half of British Airways' worldwide passengers each day.
 Flights bound for Heathrow on Thursday were diverted to other airports across Britain and Europe, leaving more than 100 British Airways planes in cities where they were not supposed to be, and 1,000 crew members stranded.
 In a statement late yesterday, British Airways said that its ground workers had returned to their jobs and about 72 flights were scheduled to resume, but it warned that a huge backlog of flights remained. The union representing the caterers and Gate Gourmet continued talks last night in hopes of finding a solution to the dispute. 
 About 70,000 passengers across the world were affected by the labor dispute, on top of an estimated 40,000 stranded on Thursday. Thousands of passengers slept in the seats and on the floors of Heathrow's terminals during one of the busiest periods for the airlines.
 Passengers stared at airport arrival and departure screens and sprawled near check-in desks, some under blankets. British Airways was rebooking some passengers on alternative flights, and offering to reimburse others for hotel rooms, up to about $160 a night, 
 ''This is an unprecedented situation,'' the airline said in a statement on its Web site yesterday. Its chief executive, Roderick I. Eddington, who is scheduled to retire this year, said Thursday that the chaos was ''a huge disappointment.''
 The dispute escalated on Thursday after Gate Gourmet, the world's second-largest airline caterer, fired more than 650 of its 2,000 catering staff at Heathrow in a long-simmering battle over restructuring, pay and work rules. Some of the those workers used to work for British Airways, which stopped doing its own catering in the 1990's and farmed it out to Gate Gourmet. That helped explain why British Airways baggage handlers, shuttle bus drivers and other employees staged the sympathy strike.
 Across the Atlantic, the airlines' mechanics union is threatening to take similar actions if Northwest's mechanics walk out. The union represents workers at Southwest, ATA and United, where the union has its largest group of members. A United spokeswoman, Jean Medina, said last night that any sympathy strike would be illegal.
 The disruptions at Heathrow and the threat of walkouts in the United States reflect the frustration felt by union workers in the airline industry, who have had to accept billions of dollars in wage and benefit cuts since the 2001 attacks, Professor Chaison said. ''They're being asked to bankroll the companies through bad times without any feeling for when it might end,'' he said.
 Yesterday, pilots at Spirit Airlines, a low-fare carrier, expressed a lack of confidence in the airline's management. And flight attendants at United, where workers have granted two rounds of wage and benefit cuts since it sought bankruptcy protection in 2002, have threatened unannounced strikes in a protest over the airline's plan to terminate their pension plan.
 But airlines cannot guarantee the cuts will end while oil prices remain at record levels. That is particularly true at Delta, which last year announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs, and where workers have seen wages and benefits cut by $1.4 billion.
 Unable to purchase fuel contracts in advance because of its sagging financial situation, Delta's cost for jet fuel have risen by 35 cents a gallon this year. Every penny increase costs the airline $25 million -- or $875 million more this year than it paid in 2004.
 Healthy carriers like Southwest have locked in the price of fuel through 2009, for at least some of their needs. Referring to big airlines like Delta, Jan K. Brueckner, professor of economics at the University of California, Irvine, said, ''How are these guys supposed to operate when the price keeps going up? They're just in the jaws of this vise.''

MIGRATION
New and Selected Poems.
By W. S. Merwin.
543 pp. Copper Canyon Press. $40.
 The poetry of W. S. Merwin offers an escape from what Whitman called ''the pulling and hauling'' of American life, a scrimshaw poetics of small bafflements shaded by the primal dark. Like most ascetics, Merwin is a seducer: his poems invite submission to a pared-down, essences-only view of the world, suggesting that any other way would be square, or, given Merwin's disdain for the human ''species-ego,'' bad for the planet. Merwin has long lived on a pineapple farm in Hawaii, meticulously restoring his acres to their ancient beauty and, one imagines, opening his mail: from his distant vista he's watched nearly every honor of the poetry world flutter his way.
 Half a century of Merwin can be had from ''Migration.'' His first poems were written in the early 50's under the sponsorship of John Berryman, himself still green enough to be courting his elders. If you want the taste of that era in poetry, its elaborate triangulations of affect, its economies of gift and tribute, these are the poems to read. (They sound like the sort of Yeats poem Berryman would have written to impress R. P. Blackmur.) These poems are archaic, alliterative and narrative, with an atmosphere of Gawain and Arthur. Like the old stories they evoke, they are little allegories of captured and held attention. 
 But the elements of these capital-E enchanting poems weren't actually very enchanting. Merwin's leviathans and shipwrecks stood for, rather than stirred, wonder. What replaced them, beginning with his 1963 volume ''The Moving Target,'' were distilled lyrics, unpunctuated, employing a new set of stripped integers: bees, larks, dust, streams. There's something 60's-flavored about these poems, but when they work, they carry a sibylline authority: ''In an hour it will be summer / I dreamed that the heavens were eating the earth / Waking it is not so / Not the heavens.''
 Heaven, earth, dreaming, waking: Merwin's work from this period speaks only to the primary acts and experiences. The lack of punctuation implies something above or below ordinary speech: the hum of deep interiority, a chorus of ancestral voices, the music of the spheres. At the very moment the culture of poetry was tacking hard toward civilization and its spectacular discontents (Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath), Merwin was writing poems that sounded as though they had been discovered on papyri preserved in earthenware jars. 
 Merwin is determined, in these poems from the 60's, to take any point of view but that of the individual, modern human, rendering only what is too small or too vast for any one set of eyes. The results can be arresting. ''In Autumn'' moves from pinprick to panorama and back again in an instant, from herds of extinct beasts to eye sockets to stars: 
 The extinct animals are still looking for home
 Their eyes full of cotton
 Now they will
 Never arrive
 The stars are like that. 
 In ''For the Anniversary of My Death'' he steps eerily out of linear time, looking forward to looking back at a day he might well be experiencing right now, and inhabiting every point in time with equal vigor. It is remarkable that nobody had thought of this idea before, and it's a direct result of Merwin's stylistic austerity that he happened upon it. By winnowing the formal and rhetorical possibilities down so far, Merwin was asking his poems to be vehicles for wisdom or nothing at all. To be sure, you felt as though if you coughed in their presence, a trapdoor would open under your feet and plunge you into the dungeon. But how many works of art compel such total solemnity? 
 No poet in the last 50 years has written this sort of poem -- the secular prophecy grounded on perceptual fineness -- as well as Merwin, and the best poems from this period are authentic and permanent. But while the mode was soon exhausted, its signature open form has been preserved whatever the occasion. What began as stylistic necessity has become a mannerism: while Merwin's poems have turned more sociable and didactic, they still seek the consolidated authority of the flowing and the deep. These attributes represent ''wisdom'' -- even if, as too often now, the person speaking to you isn't saying anything particularly wise. 
 Merwin's open style, because so uniform, immediately factors out: it's more like an eccentric font than an inventive form. It's easy to supply punctuation mentally to poems whose inflections are identical to spoken English. The best of Merwin's later work succeeds in spite of his style, and the worst wouldn't be helped by all the punctuation in the world. I like ''The Vixen'' (1996), his book-length linked sequence about southwestern France, full of beautiful Wordsworthian walks and ruined walls. But very few ambitious poets have written poems so complacent as Merwin's late, convivial elegies ''Testimony'' and ''Lament for the Makers.'' Their titles invoke Francois Villon and William Dunbar, but the poems themselves are full of Merwin's A-list bonhommes: Ben Sonnenberg, Richard Howard, Grace Schulman. You feel zero poignancy reading these poems. Instead you feel, ''What a weird party: why was I invited?''
 One need only mention the names of Merwin's exact contemporaries, all born in 1926-27, to suggest the restless, protean, dynamic energy we expect of our greatest poets: A. R. Ammons, John Ashbery, James Merrill. ''It is myself that I remake,'' Yeats writes. But a book like ''Migration,'' over 500 pages in length, suggests instead an exquisite self preserved at mounting cost, an ''open'' style shuttered against the punishing weather of being a modern person.

HEADLINE: Under Pressure

BYLINE: By Amanda Hesser. 
Amanda Hesser is the magazine's food editor and the editor of T: Living.

 BODY:
A few weeks ago at Per Se, Thomas Keller's four-star restaurant in New York City, a waiter set a salad of diced watermelon and hearts of peach palm in front of me. ''This is watermelon that has been Cryovacked,'' he explained. ''It's something new we're doing. I think you will like it.''
 This was a watershed moment on two accounts. First, because Keller had indeed managed to make something as mundane as watermelon taste different -- it had the crisp density of a McIntosh apple. But also because American dining has reached the level of sophistication at which a waiter will assume that a diner knows what ''Cryovacked'' is, and that this knowledge will enhance the experience of tasting diced watermelon.
 That won't be assumed here. ''Cryovacking'' is an industry term for putting food in a plastic bag and vacuum-packing it. Sometimes the food is then cooked in the bag. Other times, the pressure of the packing process is used to infuse flavors into ingredients. The watermelon, for instance, was vacuum-packed with 20 pounds of pressure per square centimeter, to compact the fruit's cells and concentrate its flavor. It had the texture of meat. Just the thing for backyard picnics. 
 Cryovacking, which is more often called sous vide (French for ''under vacuum''), is poised to change the way restaurant chefs cook -- and like the Wolf stove and the immersion blender, it will probably trickle down to the home kitchen someday. Cryovacking has also given great momentum to the scientific cooking revolution of the last five years. Chefs have begun using techniques developed for industrial food production and advances in science to manipulate the chemical make-up of proteins, starches and fats to create new textures and flavors -- everything from fried mayonnaise to hot gelatins.
 Ferran Adria is often seen as the hero of this movement. From his tiny restaurant, El Bulli, in Rosas, Spain, Adria has sought to reform diners' expectations of ingredients like caviar (his might look just like osetra but is made of squid ink and calcium chloride) and to invent new flavors and textures (carrot juice frothed to a texture he calls ''air''). But the man who helped Keller master the technique that would compress watermelon and poach lobster with exquisite results, who taught Wylie Dufresne how to ''flash pickle'' water chestnuts with honey and sherry vinegar and who is having a greater impact on how people cook than anyone since Escoffier is not even a chef. 
 Bruno Goussault, 63, is both a scientist and an economist. He has been training chefs like Fabio Trabocchi at the Ritz-Carlton and Michel Richard at Citronelle, both in Washington, Dan Barber at Blue Hill in New York and Daniel Boulud at Daniel, also in New York, not only how to use sous vide but also to understand the science behind it. Where Escoffier organized the way chefs cook, dividing the professional kitchen into stations (sauces, cold foods, sauteing, pastry), Goussault has reprogrammed their approach to temperature, technique and taste -- their fundamental understanding of cooking. At Charlie Trotter's in Chicago, the intense heat and scrape of pans against the stove is giving way to an almost placid atmosphere, the barely audible hum of water baths that run 24 hours a day. 
 Dufresne, the chef at the innovative Manhattan restaurant WD-50, calls Goussault's contribution to cooking ''monumental.'' The advancements he has made are on par with the invention of the food processor and the gas stove, Thomas Keller says, and they will be around forever. ''With the Cuisinart,'' Keller says, ''there was no one that came with it. You got the book inside. With sous vide, the technology is so complex and there are so many variables. The thing that comes with sous vide is Bruno.''
When I met Goussault this past June, he was working at the American office of Cuisine Solutions, a food manufacturer in Alexandria, Va. He had on a blue checked shirt and a tie dotted with tiny bunnies. Goussault wanted to show me around the Cuisine Solutions plant, so we dressed in lab coats, booties, shower caps and masks, as if we were preparing for surgery, then headed into the damp, cold world of a food factory. In one room, a row of square steel vats was set on a platform. Inside one of the vats, hundreds of lamb shanks, sealed in vacuum-packed plastic bags, were submerged in water, cooking. There was no scent of food, nor the kind of steam and heat we normally associate with cooking. ''When you cook at home, you have a lot of flavor in your apartment,'' Goussault explained. ''And when you cook sous vide, all that flavor is inside the bag.'' The sous vide bag works as a hermetic seal, keeping in both juices and aroma; and by cooking in water, you get better heat transfer than you would in, say, an oven.
 Goussault began working more intensively with Cuisine Solutions' American operations in 1998. The company, which now grosses $50 million a year, prepares food for the Super Bowl, Costco, the first-class cabins on Air France and American Airlines, the MGM Grand in Las Vegas and large hotel chains like Westin and Hyatt. Much of that food is cooked sous vide. When you order braised short ribs at the Hyatt Regency in Phoenix, what you are served was actually cooked for 42 hours in Virginia and then simply reheated in the bag and garnished in Phoenix. 
 Until recently, Goussault's most significant work had been on this scale. He developed the sous vide process for a number of hotels and food companies in France, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and the U.S., enabling them to produce higher quality foods without preservatives. And in Norway, Chile and Africa, he designed fish-processing factories, where line-caught fish are cleaned and cooked (some of them before the fish can go into rigor mortis, and therefore before enzymes begin breaking down the flesh), yielding better quality fish with a longer shelf life.
 Goussault, who logged more than 120,000 miles on airplanes last year, has more plans yet: he hopes to take sous vide to the Niger River basin between Mali and Niger, where farmers from surrounding regions take their cattle. He would build feedlots, using the local abundance of cottonseed for feed. After slaughtering, the meat could be cooked, sous vide of course, using solar power.
 Goussault designed the production line at Cuisine Solutions for 130,000 meals a day. Like most food factories, it is very cold, with large refrigerated rooms that decrease the risk of bacteria. Long conveyor grills sear hundreds of chicken breasts at a time; steel tumblers the size of jet engines are filled with ingredients, then pressurized, a process that forces seasonings to penetrate the foods more deeply. This is Goussault's real domain. He is as much an engineer as a scientist -- as pleased with his invention of nonslip doilies for French train tables as he is with his cooking techniques.
 For decades, food was poached in sturdy plastic bags at traditional temperatures, simmering or boiling. Goussault discovered that keeping the temperature as low as possible and later cooling the food in several stages yielded a wildly different -- and tastier -- result. A piece of fish, for instance, can be cooked at about 130 degrees -- a hot bath, essentially -- for 30 minutes, then cooled, successively, at room temperature, in cold water, then in ice water, before being reheated and served. Cooking in bags at such low temperatures was long considered a recipe for botulism, but Goussault has debunked this fear, proving that the long cooking times followed by proper cooling kill bacteria with the same effectiveness as higher temperatures, also stabilizing the food so it can be stored longer before serving.
 Higher temperatures, Goussault argues, do irreparable damage to food. The cell walls in the food burst, making it impossible for the food to reabsorb the liquid it loses. Roasting a chicken at 350 degrees until its internal temperature reaches 180 degrees (as the U.S.D.A. recommends) causes the breast meat to dry out and juices to accumulate in the bottom of the pan. Tradition has it that cooks use those lost juices to make a gravy, which is later reapplied to the dry meat. All of which, come to think of it, doesn't make much sense.
 Low temperatures make for extremely succulent food because there is virtually no loss of natural juices. All of the gravy is reabsorbed by the meat, intensifying its flavor and allowing it to retain its structural integrity. As Goussault explains, ''You have the expansion, you have a little purge and during the chilling system -- if you have a good chilling system -- you can absorb this exudation.'' There's nothing more romantic to a chef than absorbing exudation.
 Vacuum-packing foods provides a number of other advantages. The hermetic seal created in a sous vide bag traps flavor that would otherwise be lost. Carrots simmered in water, for instance, bleed off much of their flavor. As Yannick Alleno, the chef at Le Meurice, a two-star restaurant in Paris, points out, ''You would almost be better off drinking the water.'' The atmospheric pressure created during the vacuum-packing process also promotes osmosis among the contents of the bag, so sous vide has become an important tool for marinating and curing foods and infusing oils with spices and herbs. As a result, chefs don't need to use as much seasoning, either. When they are marinating a food with an expensive aromatic like truffles, this can make all the difference.
 After the tour, we sat down in a small test kitchen above the factory floor to taste some of the company's products -- a lamb shank that had been cooked for 36 hours, scallops and the like. Goussault ate with relish, washing it down with red wine. When he is at home in Paris, he likes to grill steaks and roast lamb, but for now those primitive techniques were far from view. Goussault instructed the chef in the kitchen to drop an egg into a thermal circulator, sous vide's ''oven'' -- a circulating water bath whose temperature can be adjusted to within a tenth of a degree. It was set at 64.5 degrees Celsius (about 148 degrees Fahrenheit), which he calculated as the perfect egg-cooking temperature.
 Chefs, Goussault said, ''need people like me to regulate and to push the creativity to the next place.'' He quantifies what chefs aim to do intuitively. Some need less help than others. ''I was in Joel's kitchen,'' Goussault said, referring to Joel Robuchon, one of France's most revered chefs, ''and he was cooking eggs, so I tested the temperature; I put in my probe, and it was 64.5. I asked him how he knew this, and he just said that was how he liked it best.''
 After 45 minutes, the chef removed the egg from the water and Goussault cracked it over his plate. I had never seen an egg like this: the whites and yolk, cooked to precisely the same consistency, spilled out like a wobbly custard, and Goussault, using a spoon, began pulling the whites from the yolk. The yolk was bright and creamy and stood up like a marshmallow. ''You see, you see!'' Goussault said. ''It's all about the temperature.''
Sous Vide has been around since the late 1960's, when food-grade plastic films and vacuum packing were mastered by French and American engineers and later manufactured under the aegis of the Cryovac division of the W. R. Grace Company. Originally, vacuum-packing was used to seal and pasteurize industrial foods for a longer shelf life. In 1974, Pierre Troisgros, a three-star chef in Roanne, France, decided to look for a new way to cook his foie gras, which shed 30 to 50 percent of its original weight in cooking. He enlisted Georges Pralus, a chef, to help. Pralus had the idea of wrapping the foie gras in layers of plastic before they cooked it and, after a number of experiments, they had their breakthrough: the foie gras lost only 5 percent of its weight -- an enormous savings. Pralus, now widely known as the father of sous vide, eventually worked with Cryovac to open his own school, Culinary Innovation, where he taught the technique. Over the years, thousands of chefs from around the world have come to study with him.
 Goussault, as it happens, was working along the same lines, but at an industrial level. In 1974, Goussault worked on a study that was presented on the sous vide cooking of beef shoulder at an international frozen-foods conference in Strasbourg, France. They found that cooking the beef sous vide extended its shelf life to 60 days. France, however, would not change its food-safety laws regarding perishability until the 1990's.
 ''The thing I write today is the same thing I wrote 34 years ago,'' Goussault says, laughing, ''but nobody listened. Now, a few people listen.'' Today Goussault is friends with Pralus and even invests in his school, although they teach different approaches (Pralus cooks sous vide at higher temperatures), and they continue to subtly disparage each other's work. ''He might have done the research,'' Pralus said of Goussault, ''but I was the first one who did sous vide for restaurants, who made it a culinary endeavor.'' Without Pralus, sous vide might never have reached the temples of cuisine.
 Smiling, Goussault said: ''Pralus calls himself the pope of sous vide. He tells people he invented sous vide, but it's not true. But I let him say that because it makes him feel better. So after he said he was the pope, I said I was the sous-pope.'' Chefs say that Pralus is the artist, Goussault the scientist. It just happens that the artistry in sous vide can be extremely dangerous from a food-safety perspective, which is why the two began collaborating in 1980, when executives at Cryovac asked Goussault to add a scientific basis to Pralus's training. ''They asked me to give it the right system because Georges Pralus is completely undisciplined,'' Goussault explained. He has been the man behind the curtain all along.
 Goussault became a scientist almost as a last resort. He had previously studied in a seminary (an experiment that ended, he said, ''because I was not able to respect the vow of chastity''), lived in a commune, earned degrees in economics, agriculture and psychology and spent time in Niger before settling in Paris in 1970 as a scientist in food-safety laboratories.
 In the 1980's, a project with SNCF, France's national train system, gave him the opportunity to work with Joel Robuchon to create a menu for its first-class service between Paris and Strasbourg. Robuchon, concerned about the fragility of high-quality food, knew there was no way to assemble fresh ingredients at 100 miles per hour. With Goussault, he developed a menu based on foods that could be prepared sous vide and simply reheated on the train. 
 In 1991, Goussault started his own consulting company, the Centre de Recherche et d'Etudes Pour l'Alimentation, where he now trains chefs like Michel Bras and Alain Ducasse in everything from the use of carrageenan and seaweed extracts to sous vide. Goussault's team of seven engineers also develops products for companies like Nestle, and it tests equipment for manufacturers, like a new oven that can go from 200 degrees Fahrenheit to 500 degrees in less than three minutes.
 Even though many chefs in France use sous vide in their restaurants, it had long been considered a technique suitable only to chains and factories. The fact that some old-guard French chefs like Alain Senderens, Paul Bocuse and Joel Robuchon have signature lines of sous vide convenience foods in supermarkets has not helped to remove the stigma. A television news report in the mid-90's revealed that the French restaurant chain Chez Margot was cooking some of its entrees sous vide; it went bankrupt soon after.
 ''Joel Robuchon is the only chef who openly admits he uses it,'' Goussault said. ''One member of Le Club des Cents'' -- an esteemed gastronomy club -- ''said that any chef who uses sous vide is a fraud.''
 Indeed, when I interviewed Senderens recently, he initially denied using sous vide in his kitchen at Lucas Carton, his three-star restaurant in Paris. But when I mentioned that the cooks at Le Meurice, a nearby up-and-coming restaurant, were using sous vide to prepare more than 50 items on the menu, Senderens suddenly remembered that he does use sous vide at Lucas Carton -- but only for the chicken with truffles.
 Even in America, where there are fewer such prejudices, sous vide has taken more than two decades to gain acceptance. In 1988, just when Cuisine Solutions, then called Vie de France, and a few chain restaurants were gearing up their sous vide operations, The Washington Post published an article questioning the safety of sous vide and other food-storage techniques like modified-atmosphere packaging, which were new at the time. Although sous vide was legal to use, the Food and Drug Administration has always warned of its potential dangers in restaurants. Still, sous vide is part of the F.D.A.'s Food Code, and any manufacturer who wants to use it can get permission by applying to the U.S.D.A. Chipotle, a burrito chain backed by McDonald's, now cooks all its braised pork sous vide. There may be hope for airline food yet.
In high-end restaurants, sous vide began as a rarefied curiosity. Sous vide machines cost $3,000 to $6,000; thermal circulators start at $1,200; and staff training by Goussault runs $2,000 a day for a minimum of four days. David Bouley, who learned from Pralus, was one of the first American chefs to use sous vide at his restaurant, then called Bouley Bakery. Shea Gallante, the chef at Cru in New York City, who then worked for Bouley, admitted, ''At the time, no one was really sure how it worked.'' 
 Thomas Keller, who has done work with Cuisine Solutions for a sous vide product line, has had Goussault train the kitchen staff at both the French Laundry, his signature restaurant in Yountville, Calif., and Per Se, in New York. Two years ago, Michael Anthony at Blue Hill contacted Goussault to learn more about the technique. Since then, word about Goussault has spread among American chefs. Recently, Fabio Trabocchi invited Goussault to spend four days training his team at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington.
 Sous vide has reached the stage where the art must now catch up to the science. While industrial food companies use sous vide primarily for braising -- where all of the ingredients are in the bag -- chefs are beginning to see it as a way to prepare and manipulate individual ingredients, sometimes without even cooking them. And, naturally, they are using much higher quality ingredients, so the results are quite different from what you might get, say, on American Airlines. If you go to Cru and order Gallante's Wagyu beef, it will be unlike any piece of beef from a saute pan or broiler. Instead of a brownish rim and increasing redness toward the center, it will be evenly rare from the outer edge all the way through. At Per Se and the French Laundry, cooks are using sous vide to compress peaches, cucumbers and tomatoes. They've found that compressing celery has the same effect as blanching it and therefore saves them a step. ''Pineapple is extraordinary,'' Keller says. They're also using it to infuse oils and slow-cook pig's head.
 Chefs have found less lofty ways to employ the technique as well. At CityZen, in the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington, they make ice cream bases in sous vide. ''There's no putting your sugar and egg and cream in a pan and stirring,'' says Eric Ziebold, the chef. His pastry chef blends the ingredients, seals them in a bag and cooks it in water.
 ''More than anything, the vegetables and the proteins taste remarkably more like themselves,'' Dan Barber, the chef and owner of Blue Hill, wrote in an e-mail message. ''When it comes to things like artichokes, steaming and boiling and braising are fine, but there's a great loss of liquid as it cooks -- which is another way of saying a great loss of flavor because the juice of the artichoke itself, while mostly water, is very flavorful. Sous vide eliminates this loss, and hence the sensation that you're tasting a true artichoke -- not just a delicious artichoke, but an artichoke the way it was intended to taste.''
 Much is made of the artistry of chefs, but running a restaurant kitchen well often has more to do with control and consistency. And in large kitchens or multiple restaurants, those things can get out of hand pretty quickly. Alleno, the chef at Le Meurice, oversees 72 cooks; Daniel Boulud has a staff of 65 to 70 among his three New York restaurants. Most cooking relies on the cook's ability to judge doneness based on sight and feel. With sous vide, it is all about precise times and temperatures. ''You can have your restaurant 6,000 miles away,'' Ziebold says, ''and you don't have to worry about the cooks at your restaurant in D.C. getting the duck right because they're cooking it sous vide and they know the temperature.'' Every year, Janos Kiss, the corporate executive chef for Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, prepares a dinner for more than 5,000 people on Super Bowl weekend. It used to take 20 chefs four days to cook the dinner. Now, with sous vide, they do it with six chefs in two days. 
 In the long run, sous vide's great contribution may well be this consistency. A chef with a restaurant empire, like Nobuyuki Matsuhisa, may finally be able to guarantee that the lobster with wasabi-pepper sauce at Nobu in London is every bit as good as the one at Nobu in New York. It may spell the end to bad wedding food. And if it catches on at companies from Stouffer's to Whole Foods, it could forever alter the state of convenience food. 
 In the meantime, all the attention being paid to temperature and laboratory precision has pushed chefs in more creative directions. When Grant Achatz built his new restaurant Alinea in Chicago, thermal circulators from PolyScience, a laboratory-equipment manufacturer, were part of the kitchen design. To these, he has added a 40,000-r.p.m. homogenizer (what Philip Preston, the president of PolyScience, calls a ''coffee grinder on steroids'') -- for making the world's most emulsified vinaigrettes and confections like carrot pudding made with carrot juice, cocoa butter and grapeseed oil -- and an entirely new mechanism they're calling the Antigriddle, which has a surface that chills to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), allowing you to freeze food in the same way you would saute it. A dollop of sour cream becomes brittle on the bottom and stays at room temperature on top.
 For all chefs' forward thinking, though, top kitchens still run on frat-house principles. So sous vide also comes in handy for hazing new cooks. At WD-50, Dufresne said, ''I've seen virtually every kind of personal belonging end up in one of these bags.'' Veteran cooks are known to take a new cook's clothing from his locker and put it through the sous vide machine, compressing his jeans and shirt to the size of hockey pucks.
In late July, Goussault went to Citronelle in Washington for a follow-up training session with Michel Richard's head cooks, David Deshaies and Cedric Maupillier. They were having trouble with the salmon and sweetbreads done sous vide. The salmon had a perfect silky texture but was too fragile and, they worried, undercooked. And the sweetbreads were losing too much liquid.
 Goussault is often called in to help chefs perfect their technique. ''My job is to repeat, repeat, repeat,'' he says. He unpacked his briefcase, removing a laptop, a box of batteries, a jumble of wires and a number of handheld monitors that, when hooked up to the foods with probes, can record their minute-to-minute temperature arc during the cooking process. The large stoves around the kitchen were mostly unoccupied. Two thermal circulators sat poised on a steel countertop, humming like Jacuzzis. Deshaies dropped two pieces of salmon in ice water that contained 10 percent salt, then set a timer for 10 minutes. Salt, according to Goussault, ''modifies the osmotic pressure in the cells,'' meaning it prevents the albumen, that white substance, ghastly to chefs, that gathers on the surface of fish, from leaching out of the salmon when it cooks. They sealed the salmon in sous vide and inserted probes. It now looked as if the salmon had a heart monitor. 
 For meats and fish, there is a window of doneness between 52 degrees Celsius (about 125 degrees Fahrenheit) and 62 degrees Celsius (about 144 degrees Fahrenheit). Below 52, you risk bacteria. Above 62, you begin denaturing proteins. Goussault then put one piece of salmon in a thermal circulator set at 56 degrees Celsius and one set at 53 degrees Celsius to see if they could raise the final internal temperature to 54 and 50 degrees respectively without changing the texture they had achieved in the piece they had cooked to 47 degrees. Food cooking in a thermal circulator looks a bit like an animated version of a Damien Hirst sculpture -- abstract animal parts suspended in a vibrating liquid.
 Standing over his cutting board, Deshaies said, ''Some chefs the other day, they said to me: 'What? So you put it in the plastic and put it in the water and that's it?' '' He shook his head. ''It's not so easy.'' It takes practice to get the sous vide machine to seal correctly. Foods must be chilled before sealing, otherwise the pressure inside the machine will cause them to cook during the sealing process. The pressure must also be calibrated for every type of food, so the food stays compact but firm. Once the food is sealed, its proper cooking temperature and internal temperature must be determined. Citronelle's lamb loin, for instance, is first infused with garlic in a sous vide pouch, then it is sauteed, chilled, resealed in sous vide and cooked in a thermal circulator at 60 degrees Celsius until its internal temperature reaches 56 degrees. It is then cooled at room temperature, in cold water, then further cooled in ice water, then chilled until an order comes in, at which point it is reheated in a warm water bath, still in its sous vide bag.
 As Barber at Blue Hill explained: ''If you're patient, and you try different temperatures and different times, at some point you'll achieve a taste from the product that's better than it's ever tasted before. I'm not exaggerating. That's happened to me with nearly everything, almost never the first time I try it, but over time and with experimentation, that's the reward.''
 After 40 minutes or so, the pieces of salmon registered at 50 degrees and 54 degrees. Each was removed from the hot water, and cooled systematically. It was time to taste. On three plates, Deshaies lined up the pieces of salmon, including the one cooked the day before to 47 degrees. All three pieces were pink all the way through and glistening with moisture, a consistency unlike that of any piece of salmon cooked in an oven.
 The piece cooked to 54 degrees was dismissed as ''airplane food.'' Deshaies and Maupillier preferred the fish they had cooked to 47 degrees, a temperature that Goussault insisted was unsafe. The salmon cooked to 50 degrees was a good compromise, moist and delicate, but without any signs of rawness. Goussault seemed tense. He had recently done a similar experiment with Thomas Keller's team at the French Laundry, and he now explained that Keller had also preferred the 47 degree salmon.
 ''Like us!'' Deshaies said.
 ''But his sous-chef feels the difference between 47 and 50 is too little and 50 is safer,'' Goussault said. He then added: ''His is different. He does it with olive oil. Delicious.''
 For Deshaies, it was suddenly no longer about science. He shot a concerned look at Richard. ''We can do that, too,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Other Army

BYLINE: By Daniel Bergner. 
Daniel Bergner, a contributing writer, is the author of ''In the Land of Magic Soldiers: A Story of White and Black in West Africa.''

 BODY:
When Matt Mann needed to buy armored vehicles, he phoned his brother-in-law, Ken Rooke. Rooke didn't know the first thing about bullet-resistant windows or grenade-resistant floors, but he wasn't 100 percent unqualified to do the buying. At least he knew something about cars. At a speedway in North Carolina, he once called races for a local radio station. He was the closest Mann could come to an expert.
 Mann, a retired U.S. Army Special Operations master sergeant in his late 40's, needed the vehicles quickly. And he needed guns. It was early last year, and the company he and two partners created, Triple Canopy, had just won government contracts to guard 13 Coalition Provisional Authority headquarters throughout Iraq. (The renewable six-month deals were worth, in all, about $90 million.) The C.P.A. was the governing body of the American-led military occupation. Triple Canopy -- not the American military -- would be protecting it. So would other companies. With the insurgency spiking, the job of keeping C.P.A. compounds from being overrun, and of keeping the architects of the occupation from being killed, had been privatized. 
 Yet when Triple Canopy was hired, it scarcely existed. Mann and one of his partners, Tom Katis, an old friend from Special Forces, talked after 9/11 about starting a business that might somehow address the threat of terrorism. They thought they might use their military backgrounds to train government agencies in anti-terrorism techniques. On a Special Forces exercise in Central America (both men were, at that point, in the National Guard, Mann having moved on from the regular Army to work as a civil engineer and Katis having graduated from Yale and begun a career in banking), they dreamed of their unborn enterprise under the jungle foliage -- the layered jungle canopy from which they took their name. 
 They didn't have much else. They were a name, a notion, when they heard about the C.P.A. security work and started bidding for the contracts. With money borrowed from family and friends, they began hiring former Army colleagues on the chance that the company might somehow succeed. They had little but resumes to give them hope. The resumes, though, were impressive. Mann spent six years with the Army's Delta Force, its most selective, most keenly trained and most secretive unit, and he recruited retired Delta operators. He is an irrepressible man with full, close-cropped gray hair, blue eyes and a radiant smile, and as he told me about Triple Canopy's early days, he recalled his disbelief at the men who were drawn to the company. ''He wants to work for me?'' he said he thought, over and over. But his modesty went only so far. ''Rock stars like to work with rock stars,'' he said. The ex-Delta soldiers, heavily decorated and with all kinds of combat and clandestine experience, kept signing on.
 ''We were the squirrel trying to get a nut,'' Al Buford, an early employee and Delta veteran, remembered about the company's initial prospects for work. And when they were hired to protect well over half of the C.P.A.'s sites in Iraq, and to escort C.P.A. officials along the country's lethal roads, ''we had a whole truckload of nuts dumped down on us.''
 So the call went out to Mann's brother-in-law, Ken Rooke. ''I'm a gearhead,'' Rooke told me. ''But we were shooting from the hip on this thing. I never felt competent in what I was doing.'' 
 ''With the war going,'' he continued, there were no new armored vehicles to be had. He searched the Internet, made countless calls and bought a set of armored Mercedes sedans that once belonged to the sultan of Brunei before they were rented out to rappers. He replaced the stylish spoke wheels, and he put on run-flat tires, so the vehicles could be driven out of ambushes even after the tires had been blasted by gunfire. He learned how to ship his makeshift fleet to Iraq.
 For guns, too, Triple Canopy had to make do. Transporting firearms from the United States required legal documents that the company couldn't wait for; instead, in Iraq, it got Department of Defense permission to visit the dumping grounds of captured enemy munitions. The company took mounds of AK-47's and culled all that were operable. 
 So Triple Canopy had vehicles and it had assault rifles, and when it needed cash in Iraq, to pay employees or buy equipment or build camps, it dispatched someone from Chicago, the company's home, with a rucksack filled with bricks of hundred-dollar bills. ''All the people in Iraq had to say is, 'We need a backpack,''' Mann said. ''Or, 'We need two backpacks.''' Each pack held half a million dollars.
 And in this way, one of the largest private security companies in Iraq was born. In this way, Triple Canopy went off to war. Plenty of other companies have done the same, some that were more established before the American invasion, some less. The firms employ, in Iraq, a great number of armed men. No one knows the number exactly. In Baghdad in June, in a privately guarded coalition compound in the Green Zone, I talked with Lawrence Peter, a paid advocate for the industry and -- in what he called a ''private-public partnership'' -- a consultant to the Department of Defense on outsourced security. He put the number of armed men around 25,000. (This figure is in addition to some 50,000 to 70,000 unarmed civilians working for American interests in Iraq, the largest percentage by way of Halliburton and its subsidiaries, doing everything from servicing warplanes to driving food trucks to washing dishes.) But the estimates, from industry representatives and the tiny sector of academics who study the issues of privatized war, are so vague that they serve only to confirm the chaos of Iraq and the fact that -- despite an attempt at licensing the firms by the fledgling Iraqi Interior Ministry -- no one is really keeping track of all the businesses that provide squads of soldiers equipped with assault rifles and belt-fed light machine guns. Peter's best guess was that there are 60 companies in all. ''Maybe 80,'' he added quickly, mentioning that there were any number of miniature start-ups. He continued: ''Is it a hundred? Possibly.'' 
 Triple Canopy now has about 1,000 men in Iraq, about 200 of them American and almost all the rest from Chile and Fiji. Its rivals include British firms that draw from the elite units of the U.K. military and outfits that draw from South African veterans of the wars to save apartheid. Australians and Ukrainians and Romanians and Iraqis are all making their livings in the business. Many have experience as soldiers; some have been in law enforcement. The firms guard the huge American corporations struggling to carry out Iraq's reconstruction. The private gunmen try to hold the insurgents at bay so that supplies can be delivered and power stations can be built. And companies like Triple Canopy shield American government compounds from attack. With guns poking out from sport utility vehicles, they usher American officials from meeting to meeting. They defend the buildings and people whom the insurgency would most like to reach. 
 Throughout his time as head of the C.P.A., L. Paul Bremer III, whom the insurgency may well have viewed as its highest-value target, was protected by a Triple Canopy competitor, Blackwater USA. Private gunmen, according to Lawrence Peter, are now guarding four U.S. generals. Triple Canopy protects a large military base. And throughout Iraq, the defense of essential military sites like depots of captured munitions has been informally shared by private soldiers and U.S. troops. If the 25,000 figure is accurate, the businesses add about 16 percent to the coalition's total forces. 
 Yet it is hard to discern who authorized this particular outsourcing as military policy. No open policy debate took place; no executive order was publicly issued. And who is in charge of overseeing these armed men? One thing is sure: they are crucial to the war effort. In April 2004, within a few months of Triple Canopy's arrival in Iraq, its men were waging a desperate firefight to defend a C.P.A. headquarters in the city of Kut. The Mahdi Army had launched an onslaught.
In the world of companies like Triple Canopy, a great deal of importance is attached to a very few words. The word ''mercenaries'' is despised. The phrase ''private military company'' is heatedly dismissed as inaccurate. ''Private security company'' (or P.S.C.) is the term of art. 
 Semantics aside, private soldiers have been on the battlefield for thousands of years. As P.W. Singer, a scholar of privatized warfare at the Brookings Institution, recounts in his book ''Corporate Warriors,'' mercenaries served in the army of the King of Ur two millennia before Christ; the ancient Greeks supplemented their forces by contracting out for cavalry and for specialists in the slingshot; and private bands of Swiss pikemen, infantry with 18-foot-long weapons, proved themselves superior to cavalry in the late 13th century and made themselves a necessary expense to the warring rulers of Europe for hundreds of years. 
 But mercenaries began to fade from the battlefield around the Age of Enlightenment. Partly this was because of breakthroughs in the science of warfare. Better weapons demanded less skill from the fighter. The experience of the mercenary was needed less. With a decently designed musket, a fresh soldier could be trained fairly swiftly and dispatched to the front. And then, too, the 18th and 19th centuries brought new ideas about the sanctity of the nation and the honor of the citizen in soldiering for it. ''Those who fought for profit, rather than patriotism,'' Singer writes, ''were completely delegitimated.'' Still, the British hired 30,000 German Hessians to help them battle the revolutionaries in the American War of Independence. Yet gradually the work of the mercenary grew more and more marginalized and disdained, and in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 it was essentially outlawed, at least in wars between nations.
 Mercenaries carried on in the ignored and anarchic places of the world; through much of the second half of the 20th century, they played notorious roles in the insurrections of Africa. But then, in 1995, in the tiny West African country of Sierra Leone, private soldiering made a morality-twisting appearance. A rebel army was burning villagers alive and starting to develop its signature atrocity: hacking off the hands of civilians and letting them live as reminders of rebel power. Desperate, the country's ruler hired a South African firm, Executive Outcomes, that was run by a former apartheid-era military commander. It presented itself as something other than a violent, shadowy employment agency for apartheid-era veterans. It had glossy brochures outlining its military services. Its leader called himself a chairman. Its work wasn't that of ''mercenaries'' or ''dogs of war''; it would soon adopt the term ''private military company.'' 
 In Sierra Leone, using a few aircraft and about 200 men, Executive Outcomes rapidly drove the rebel army of perhaps 10,000 back to the country's hinterlands. Brutality erupted again as soon as Executive Outcomes left, but the world had seen that a small, well-trained private force could accomplish immeasurable good.
 Not long afterward, a London company led by a former British lieutenant colonel, Tim Spicer -- whose latest firm now has a nearly $300 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense in Iraq -- tried again to rescue the West African country. Spicer failed but emerged as a kind of spokesman for the moral value of private military companies. ''The word 'mercenary,' '' he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 1999, ''conjures up a picture in people's minds of a rather ruthless, unaligned individual, who may have criminal, psychotic tendencies. We are not like that at all. All we really do is help friendly, reasonable governments solve military problems.'' (No matter that Spicer had once considered providing his help to Mobutu Sese Seko, the tyrannical dictator of Zaire, for a price.) Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, and a former United Nations under secretary general, Brian Urquhart, were soon talking about the possible use of private military companies to aid the U.N. in stabilizing the world's conflict zones. The U.N. wasn't remotely ready to hire private armies to end civil wars, but a subtle shift in perception had started to take place.
 In 2002, the U.S. government hired about 40 private gunmen, from the American company DynCorp, to keep President Hamid Karzai alive in Afghanistan. And in the spring of 2003, as Gen. Jay Garner, retired, established the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, the short-lived precursor to the C.P.A., as the occupation's governing body in Iraq, the Pentagon put a small contingent of South Africans and Nepalese Gurkhas from the British firm Global Risk Strategies in charge of protecting him and his staff. ''That,'' Garner told me when we spoke last month, ''was the genesis'' of the rise of private security companies in Iraq. 
 The numbers, at the start of the occupation, were not large. Then, in the second half of 2003, as the C.P.A. expanded its presence across the country in its attempt to rule and rebuild, and as the insurgency mounted, the C.P.A. turned away from the coalition forces, which had been providing a measure of protection, and looked to the companies for safety. Andrew Bearpark, the C.P.A.'s director of operations during that period, explained to me that he was closely and strongly advised by the U.S. military in Iraq -- and financed by the Department of Defense -- to make this move. 
 Major contracts were put out for bidding. Triple Canopy was awarded its work in January 2004. Other companies received, or already had, their portions. (Meanwhile, the corporations actually doing the rebuilding, the hearts-and-minds element of the American occupation's campaign, were spending up to 25 percent of their U.S. government money on hired protection.) The deployment of private gunmen grew and grew into a profusion that may be explained partly by the subtle shift in perception that had removed some of the old mercenary stigma, and partly by the emphasis on outsourcing that had been gathering momentum in the U.S. military since the early 1990's (but that had been focused on logistical, unarmed support). Most immediately, though, the explosive growth may be explained by the strength of the insurgency in Iraq and by the apparent fact that there weren't enough troops on the ground to fight it. 
 ''Sure, they are performing a military role,'' Garner said of the companies. Then, while noting that he wasn't criticizing the Department of Defense, he added, ''The gut problem is the force'' -- that is, the U.S. fighting force -''is too small.'' And Bearpark, who has lately become a consultant to a large security firm, maintained that private protection might sometimes be better than what a regular army could offer. The private teams are more streamlined and flexible, he argued; they are often better trained for the job; and they may be willing to take more risks, allowing officials to move more freely. But about the fundamental reason for the C.P.A.'s hiring of the companies, he said: ''The military just hadn't provided enough numbers. It was stretched to the limit.'' 
 The Department of Defense is reluctant to discuss the role of security companies in Iraq and precisely how it got so big. Over several weeks I called the Pentagon repeatedly, asking whether the secretary of defense or one of his under secretaries had, at any point, deliberated about the presence of some 25,000 armed men or perhaps authorized it in one way or another, piecemeal or in its entirety. These questions -- which no one I spoke to was able to answer -- elicited from departmental press officers a series of unfulfilled promises to help me get an answer. In the end, they sent an officially approved written statement, which detoured fully around the questions but included the key line, ''P.S.C.'s are not being used to perform inherently military functions.''
 The Pentagon's reticence on the issue may be due to uneasiness over the now-common accusation that it didn't adequately plan for battling an insurgency. (It may view questions about private gunmen as leading inevitably to questions about troop numbers.) But there is most likely an additional discomfort, a lingering problem with the companies' public image. For the shift in perception hasn't been complete; the hated word ''mercenaries'' still hovers near. With this problem, the firms are doing their best to help. Many of them have tried to rechristen themselves again, to further separate themselves from the past, from the old infamy of ruthless, insurrection-stirring white freelancers in Africa, to make their work palatable to all. 
 When I met with Lawrence Peter, a short man with a fiery voice, he raged that the press refused to accept the companies' newly chosen term: ''We are not private military companies! We are private security companies! Private security!'' He justified the distinction by saying: ''The work is defensive. We protect.'' Sometimes, though, the distinction seems secondary. No matter what you want to call Triple Canopy and its men, when the Mahdi Army -- a radical Shiite force loyal to the militant cleric Moktada al-Sadr -- attacked at Kut, the primary truth was that the company was fighting a war.
Current training adviser for Triple Canopy was, in early April 2004, in charge of defending the occupation's Kut headquarters. (For security reasons, it is Triple Canopy policy that employees now in Iraq or likely to return not be identified by their full names.) John, a tall spike of a man of 50, with a graying brush mustache, spent 26 years in the U.S. Army, much of that time with Delta. He was on the first invading helicopter into Grenada in 1983; his helicopter and the others behind him were riddled and ravaged by bullets, and three soldiers sitting near him were shot. ''I've never taken so much fire again till Kut,'' he told me in May. ''Kut was like stepping out into the air -- you know you might not exist any longer.''
 Facing a river and enwrapped on three sides by the small, mostly Shiite city, the C.P.A. compound in Kut consisted of several one- and two-story concrete structures. The buildings had been Baathist offices and a hotel. There the coalition's regional ruler, known as the governorate coordinator, worked and lived with a crew of reconstruction officials and contractors, surrounded by 12-foot-high blast walls at the compound's perimeter -- except along the river, where, John told me, the governorate coordinator, a Brit, preferred that nothing obstruct the view. The city had been fairly peaceful. It was a ''sleepy hollow,'' John recalled his Triple Canopy boss telling him, joking that it was a suitable post for an old, graying man to guard.
 The first sign of siege was the massing of more than a thousand demonstrators in a few clusters around the city and around the compound, demanding that the C.P.A. leave Kut. Many in the crowds carried assault rifles and grenade launchers. John sensed, he said, that the protest at the compound might be a ruse, a cover for casing the site. Word came that the coalition-trained Iraqi police had abandoned their stations and checkpoints throughout the town, that the Mahdi fighters had claimed their weapons and uniforms. John had a core team of three Triple Canopy gunmen. There were about 40 Ukrainian coalition troops posted at the compound. The Iraqi guards employed by Triple Canopy were already starting to quit and to flee. 
 John declared ''lockdown'' and waited for whatever would come. Civilians strapped on their flak jackets and bulletproof vests. They prepared to retreat to a central spot within the hotel, a last point of defense, if the compound's perimeter was overrun. Warnings filtered in of car bombs set to strike. Through the night, two cars seemed to be casing the gates. Morning brought the sound of gunshots around the town -- and the ominous realization that the area just outside the compound was now desolate. Gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades started to hit around noon. The assault came from nearby, as close as the buildings across the street. It came from all sides. Mortars crashed in. A grenade exploded into a C.P.A. Suburban; the vehicle was consumed in flames. ''1740: Mortar fire has increased from across the river,'' reads a minute-by-minute account kept by a civilian contractor. Windows shattered; large fragments cracked from building walls; vehicles were ripped apart.
 The enemy barrage of artillery and small arms surged and slackened and surged again. ''Throughout the battle, the commander of compound perimeter defense by de facto is John,'' states another contractor's hour-by-hour report. John climbed to the hotel roof to direct return fire. The three Triple Canopy gunmen manned the towers. Successive shifts of Iraqi guards had by now flooded out the gates after one was slightly wounded and a translator spread the rumor that the Americans planned to abandon them all to their deaths. Just two local soldiers remained; John put them on a machine gun. For hours the Ukrainians battled relentlessly; when they ran low on ammunition, John resupplied them with Triple Canopy rounds, the minute-by-minute account relates. He sent a fourth Triple Canopy soldier, a young dog handler who'd never seen a moment of combat, to race from tower to tower, taking bullets and water to the other T.C. fighters, who, John said, ''slung lead like you wouldn't believe,'' 2,500 rounds, he guessed. Triple Canopy's bomb-sniffing dog was left tied in the hotel and howled every time a mortar exploded.
 On the roof and rushing through the compound between blasts, John juggled three radios and a satellite phone between his hands and combat vest pockets. None of the contingents he needed to speak with -- Triple Canopy; the separate company that handled the governorate coordinator's personal security (and that had pulled back to protect him within the compound); the civilian contractors; the U.S. military liaison in another town -- used the same communication system. He implored the military to send attack aircraft to scatter al-Sadr's men, who probably numbered 200 to 400.
 The battle flared through the night. Heavy machine guns opened up from across the river. ''2200: There is an air-lift evacuation plan being put together.'' Two hours later: ''We were advised by T.C. that the air evacuation was scrubbed'' -- the odds of a helicopter being shot down while landing or lifting off were too high. An American plane at last arrived, its canons spewing shells. The militia went quiet, but then: ''0100: The hotel is hit several times and the building shakes from the impact. This fire seems to be the worst yet of the engagement.'' 
 There appeared to be no escape; John figured the defense might be finished; on his radios and satellite phone he tried to keep his voice controlled, to keep his words, as he recounted, ''on the level of an information exchange.'' U.S. helicopter gunships then flew overhead. They held fire, but the enemy took cover again. And near dawn, in the lull, John and the Ukrainians carried out an order from the main C.P.A. headquarters in Baghdad that everyone should drive out of the compound, no matter what the risk in exposing themselves. They went in a mix of armored cars and open-sided trucks. ''Every turn you made, you didn't know,'' John said. He waited for mortars and R.P.G.'s to annihilate them. But the gunships tracked their route. No enemy fire came; they reached the closest coalition base; the civilians and soldiers of the compound had survived the battle without a serious wound.
 The same week, a hundred miles to the west in the town of Najaf, eight private soldiers from the Blackwater company fought al-Sadr's Mahdi Army, stopping them from overrunning the C.P.A. headquarters there. The Blackwater men went unscathed. But just across town from John during the Kut fighting, the Mahdi Army attacked a building that housed five gunmen from the Hart Group, a British firm protecting the reconstruction of Iraq's electrical grid. The five were wounded, and one, pinned down on the building's roof in a firefight, bled to death. 
 A week earlier, four Blackwater soldiers, escorting a kitchen-supply truck to a U.S. military base, were ambushed and shot by insurgents in Fallujah -- their bodies roped to the back of a car and dragged through the streets, set on fire, torn apart and put on display, dangling from a Fallujah bridge. At the time, the Fallujah killings seemed notable not only for their brutality but also for the fact that private security men had been the victims. 
 Yet private security men in Iraq are embattled constantly. Between January and August 2004 (the last period for which the company has compiled figures), Triple Canopy teams came under attack 40 times, in incidents ranging from incoming rounds of rocket-propelled grenades to assaults lasting at least 24 hours. And the count of 40, I was told by the company's director of operations, represented only attacks in which Triple Canopy fired back. Six to eight times that number of assaults -- from sprays of enemy bullets to mortar fire -- had gone unrecorded, a company spokesman estimated. The frequency of attacks remains about the same now. The style has shifted away from assaults like the one at Kut, but guerrilla ambushes are on the rise.
 It is impossible to say exactly how many private security men have been killed in Iraq. Deaths go unreported. But the figure, according to Lawrence Peter, is probably between 160 and 200. That's more deaths than any one of America's coalition partners have suffered. 
''Some people will tell you they're here for Mom and apple pie,'' a private security man with another company told me. (He didn't want his or his company's name printed, he said, because neither his colleagues nor the industry in general think kindly of conversations with the media.) ''That's bull. It's the money.'' 
 We sat between low concrete buildings at Triple Canopy's Baghdad base. The roofs are four feet thick and specially layered to absorb major blasts. The base sits within the Green Zone, behind high walls that divide the coalition's vast self-delineated borough from the severe danger of the rest of Baghdad. But the zone, as the people living and working there like to say, is these days less green than almost red: mortars rain in. 
 The man's company put him up at Triple Canopy's freshly built complex, with its pristine dining hall and ramshackle gym, its guard towers and long shipping container full of ammunition. The base is large enough that other outfits can rent rooms. Triple Canopy has come a long way from its haphazard beginnings. Its current contracts in Iraq, mostly with the U.S. Department of Defense and the State Department, are worth almost $250 million yearly. And having succeeded in Iraq -- Triple Canopy hasn't had a single worker or client killed -- it has just been named one of three companies that will divide up $1 billion annually in newly created protection work with the State Department in high-risk countries around the world.
 But the private security man I sat with wasn't talking about windfalls on that level. He was talking about his own income. ''I'm richer than I've ever been,'' he said. ''I'm not in debt to nobody.''
 He had jowls and loose swells of flesh beneath his T-shirt. ''Don't let the package fool you,'' the ex-Delta colonel who introduced us had told me. ''He's a commando from way back.'' After a career in Special Forces, the man said, he hadn't seemed able to survive in the civilian world. Work in construction fell apart. He drank heavily. He took a job as a cashier in a convenience store -- ''till I found out I had to smile at the customers.'' He laughed ruefully at his inability to adapt. But now, when his 16-year-old son sent him an e-mail message from back home in South Carolina, with a picture to prove that he'd mowed the lawn the way his mother had asked, he could buy the boy some tech equipment as a gift. ''I'll stay until this is over,'' he said. ''The money's too good.''
 He didn't specify his salary, but Americans and other Westerners in the business tend to make between $400 and $700 a day, sometimes a good deal more. (The non-Westerners earn far less. Triple Canopy's Fijians and Chileans make between $40 and $150 dollars each week and sleep in crowded barracks at the Baghdad base, while the Americans sleep in their own dorm rooms. The company explained the difference in salaries in terms of the Americans' far superior military backgrounds and their higher-risk assignments.) Americans with Triple Canopy stay in Iraq for three-month rotations, working straight through. Then they're sent on leave for a month, returning if they wish. Depending on how much time they spend in the States over the course of a year, most of their income can be tax-free.
 Yet it wasn't all about the pay, not for everyone. ''The money, sure,'' Al, a Triple Canopy manager in Baghdad, said. Like plenty of others with the company, he was middle-aged and had retired from the rarefied world of Delta. ''But it's the excitement, the camaraderie.'' 
 And back in the Chicago suburb where I visited the company in May, in its new, sprawling offices (which Triple Canopy would soon be exchanging for a similar setup outside Washington, in order to be closer to its main source of income, the U.S. government), I heard Matt Mann talk exuberantly about ''creating a national asset.'' It would have been easy to be exuberant merely because of the profits he was taking in; it would have been easy to be downright giddy. 
 But his enthusiasm seemed to come, as well, from other things. He spoke about the waste of Special Operations stars, ''men whose intelligence is equal to the best attorneys, the best doctors,'' men who had survived the harshest training, who had learned to operate on their own in alien cultures, who ''don't know how to fail.'' Their talents, he said, were going unrecognized and unused when they left the military and entered civilian society. A long window beside him looked out on a perfectly manicured office park, its pond rippling delicately. Wearing jeans and a short-sleeved sport shirt with a summery print, he leaned back behind his blond wood desk, hands behind his head, strong, tanned arms on display. In a sense, he might have been any renegade businessman who had conjured a new product and found himself in a spot of corporate comfort. But a map of Iraq, its yellow tones in quiet contrast to the blond of the wood, was posted on the wall. He didn't care to talk about his personal thoughts on the war but saw himself as creating a collection of talent that was driven less by the '' 'me' mind frame,'' he said, than by patriotism. 
 In an office near Mann's sat Al Buford, the company's manager of recruiting, wearing sharply pressed khakis and a pale blue dress shirt. On a bookshelf behind him, a framed photograph showed him in jungle camouflage, on an Army Special Operations mission in Panama. Facing him on his desk, his computer was loaded with scores from the psychometric exam Triple Canopy gives its potential employees. The company's three-week training and selection course includes multiple-choice word analogy and number pattern questions between the high-speed driving drills and target tests at the firing range. And there are hundreds of questions designed to catch personality problems before the company gives a candidate a gun and sends him off to Iraq.
Other firms take a different approach. One morning, at a military base near the Baghdad airport, a Triple Canopy soldier I was with ran into a friend who had just been fired by the company. The friend had been drunk repeatedly; he'd been caught drinking right up to the hour he was slated for armed escort of a client. The previous day, the friend told us, he went to talk with another American company. Today he was signing a contract.
 There is no effective regulation in Iraq of whom the firms hire or how the men are trained or how they conduct themselves. ''At best you've got professionals doing their best in a chaotic and aggressive environment,'' Lyle Hendrick said in an e-mail from Iraq in July, describing his colleagues in private security there. He had spent six months with one company in the country's north and is now with another down in Basra. ''At worst you've got cowboys running almost unchecked, shooting at will and just plain O.T.F. (Out There Flappin').''
 I had come to know Hendrick, a tall, soft-spoken, part Blackfoot Native American from South Carolina, while he was on leave in the States. He had been a Special Forces captain, then a private detective; he eventually ran out of money as he let work slip to care for his stepfather, who had had a severe stroke. When he signed on with his first company and, in June of last year, flew into Mosul, a hotbed of the insurgency, a convoy of pickup trucks arrived at the airport to meet the new hires. To his uninitiated eyes, the men in the vehicles ''looked like extras in Mel Gibson's Road Warriors,'' he said. They told him to climb in and to stay ready to shoot while they drove, to watch his sector. ''There was no instruction, no sit-down, no here's how we operate; it was, throw your stuff on the truck and let's go.''
 A few months later, he was riding in a convoy, in the back seat of a pickup's cab, escorting an Army Corps of Engineers team to a spot out in the desert, where they would blow up captured munitions. Across the desolate terrain, according to Hendrick and a colleague who was present that day, a white S.U.V. appeared from behind a berm. It was on Hendrick's side, 200 yards away. Hendrick wore a black helmet, tinted goggles and a black shirt, with a kaffiyeh wrapped around his neck and taupe-colored shooting gloves. He leaned out his window clutching a belt-fed light machine gun. The distance kept closing. ''He's coming in! He's coming at us!'' he heard someone on his team call out. He thought, Idiot farmer. He had the best angle; he fired warning shots. He could see the driver dressed all in white. The distance shrank to less than 30 yards. He aimed into the wheels. ''Idiot farmer turned to No, this isn't happening in a fraction of a second,'' he said. All was instinct. He riddled the driver's door and shot into the driver's window. The S.U.V. jerked to the side -- it exploded, ''went from white to a ball of bright orange,'' so close that the blast demolished a vehicle in the convoy, though the men inside weren't hurt. The S.U.V. all but vaporized. It had been packed with explosives -- a suicide bomber. The largest trace left was a scrap of tire. A bit of the bomber's scalp clung to one of the vehicles in the convoy.
 Hendrick showed me photographs of the smoky aftermath. He wanted to be sure I understood the kind of circumstances he and his colleagues were dealing with. But he also said, ''This whole thing has brought out some pretty scary characters.'' He mentioned a newspaper article about one of the men he'd worked alongside. The man was arrested when he went on leave back to the States. Apparently the security company hadn't done much of a background check, if it had done one at all; it turned out the man was a fugitive in Massachusetts. He had been charged with embezzlement. He had also violated the terms of a suspended sentence in a separate case, a local paper in Lowell, Mass., explained: he'd been convicted of assault ''for nearly blowing a friend's jaw off during a game of Russian Roulette.'' 
Mark raised his strong forearms and performed a pantomime of washing his hands and flicking off the water. A manager with Triple Canopy in Baghdad, Mark was sitting behind his desk at T.C.'s base, demonstrating the Department of Defense's attitude about overseeing and policing the private security companies. ''D.O.D. doesn't want anything to do with it,'' he said. ''They don't have time. They don't have the numbers. And State can't investigate incidents. They don't have the investigators. So there's Iraqi law. Not that Iraqi law really exists. Am I going to give up my weapons to Iraqi police? I don't think so. That could get me killed.''
 No one knows how many times gunfire from a private security team has wounded a bystander or killed an innocent driver who ventured too close to a convoy, not realizing that mere proximity would be taken for a threat. When they fire their weapons in defense or warning, the teams rarely concern themselves with checking for casualties -- it would be too dangerous; they are in the middle of a war. Besides, no one in power is watching too closely. 
 And what rules exist seem to be ignored. A C.P.A. decree, which has now evolved into Iraqi law, limits the caliber and type of weapons that private security personnel employ. But I was told by several people in the business that, especially outside Baghdad, weapons like heavy machine guns and grenades are -- perhaps by necessity -- sometimes part of the arsenal. 
 A few of the major American and British firms, Triple Canopy among them, advocate careful supervision of their business by their governments and possibly, in the future, by the United Nations. They'd like checks on everything from adequate training to human rights violations. They'd like to see their more rash competitors lose their contracts. They'd like to legitimize the work, to remove the remaining stigma that their own men are rogues, mercenaries.
 Back in October of last year, a Congressional bill demanded that the Department of Defense come up with a plan to manage the security companies -- to investigate individual backgrounds and inculcate rules of engagement and enforce compliance. Until then, according to a Pentagon official with knowledge of the process who asked not to be named because the Pentagon plan is still being finalized, the department had been at work, for many months, on doctrine dealing in a general way with all types of private contractors in Iraq but not specifically addressing the huge sector of gunmen. It seems that only the October bill drove the Pentagon to formally account for the most vital, and potentially most troubling, part of its outsourcing. Congress gave the department six months to produce its plan. Nine months have passed. The Pentagon has now promised the document any day; there's no telling whether it will change anything -- what guidelines it will give, what level of commitment will be behind them. When I asked the Pentagon official about who would enforce the rules in Iraq, I was told that the country's new sovereignty would be ''the context.'' It was hard not to think that the infant government of Iraq would be left mostly on its own to control the thousands of private gunmen that the American-led occupation has introduced to the country. It was hard not to think that the companies would be left to govern themselves. 
Fourteen armed security men, traveling in a convoy through Fallujah in May, were detained by U.S. Marines, the first and only time, it appears, that the military has made such a detention. A Marine memo, quoted in The Washington Post, accused the men, who worked for a company called Zapata Engineering, of ''repeatedly firing weapons at civilians and marines, erratic driving and possession of illegal weapons'' -- six anti-tank weapons, the Zapata men later explained, kept for defense and condoned, they claimed, by the U.S. military. The security men (eight of them former marines) said they had fired only typical warning shots at civilians. They insisted that their bullets had never struck close to any servicemen. They suggested that their detention -- which lasted three days before they were released, without charges so far -- was driven by jealousy over their pay. They told of being roughed up and taunted, of being asked, ''How does it feel to be a rich contractor now?''
 This kind of resentment may be deepening. What Matt Mann called a ''national asset'' may be corrosive. And the private security companies are, almost surely, eroding elite sectors of the military; the best-qualified troops, the men most desirable to the companies, are lured by private salaries that can be well more than twice their own. The Special Forces have lately responded with re-enlistment bonuses of up to $150,000. It's not enough. One Triple Canopy man in his mid-30's, with about 15 years of Special Operations experience, told me that his commander had begged him to stay in the service. ''But there was no way,'' he said. ''Here I get to be with the best and make so much more money.'' Triple Canopy, Mann had said to me, has a policy of never recruiting directly from the military. But when this man quit the Army, he knew exactly where he wanted to go. And plenty of his old friends from ''the unit'' -- a Delta soldier's oblique way of referring to his exclusive caste -- were poised to follow.
 There may be a danger that something else could erode eventually, if there is a drift toward using more private gunmen -- in yet more military ways -- to compensate for the inevitable reduction of troops in Iraq or to wage other wars. There may be the loss of a particular understanding, a sense of ourselves as a society, that we hold almost sacred. Soldiering for profit was taken for granted for thousands of years, but the United States has thrived in an age when soldiering for the state -- serving your country -- has taken on an exalted status. We often question the reasons for making war, but we tend to revere the soldiers who are sent off to fight. We honor their sacrifice, we raise it up and in it we see the value of our society reflected back to us. In it we feel our special worth. We may not know what to think of ourselves if service and sacrifice are increasingly mixed with the wish for profit. We may know less and less how to feel about a state that is no longer defended by men and women we can perceive as pure.
 But that is an abstract and perhaps a distant worry. To wonder what will happen when the private work in Iraq finally winds down is a more concrete concern. What will happen to these companies, these men, without these thousands of jobs? Some will get contracts protecting U.S. departments and agencies around the world. Some will do the same for other governments. Doug Brooks, whose Washington industry organization, the International Peace Operations Association, represents several of the largest firms, says he believes the United Nations will soon hire the companies to guard refugee camps in war zones. But some of the firms and some of the men will no doubt be offered work by dictators or terrible insurgencies -- or by the kind of oil speculators who reportedly backed a recent mercenary-led coup plot in Equatorial Guinea (a plot involving former members of Executive Outcomes), in an attempt to install a ruler to facilitate their enterprise. And with so many newly created private soldiers unemployed when the market of Iraq finally crashes, aren't some of them likely to accept such jobs -- the work of mercenaries in the chaotic territories of the earth? 
At their Baghdad base, eight Triple Canopy gunmen and I got into an S.U.V. and a sedan, the armored doors heavy enough that opening them felt like pulling them against water. The men, in T-shirts and bulletproof vests stuffed with ammunition clips, were ready to make the morning's run. I was the person they would be escorting. They figured that would be a decent way to give me a sense of how they work. I had to get to the airport, anyway.
 At a pre-run meeting, their team leader told them that the loud blasts we all heard a few hours earlier had been a series of V.B.I.E.D.'s -- vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices -- in a neighborhood adjacent to the Green Zone. He told them that optimal speed for the run would be 100 miles per hour. They didn't need to be told that the five-mile strip of highway between the Green Zone and the airport is known as the most dangerous road in the world. The insurgents plant remote-controlled bombs on the shoulders or sit on the access roads in cars packed with explosives, and they wait. They look for sets of vehicles that appear to belong to security teams -- teams that are their enemy and that shield enemy officials.
 The armor on the S.U.V. and the sedan wasn't going to do enough against bombs; it might not do enough against rocket-propelled grenades. Each vehicle held a rucksack full of ammunition in case an attack crippled the cars and left the men in a long firefight. A medic goes on every run. Sitting on my left in the back seat of the S.U.V., twisted to the side to peer through his window with rifle in hand, the medic pointed out to me an extra transfusion kit. ''You'll need to try and use that if I'm bleeding to death,'' he said. 
 We didn't get far from the Green Zone gate. Traffic was thick on the highway, and slow speeds allow the insurgents to better strike their targets, timing the detonations of their roadside bombs or driving close with their suicide cars. A white fuel truck appeared alongside us, its tank ready to erupt with the launching of a grenade. We veered onto the dirt median and fled back to base. ''We're a boring company,'' Al, one of the managers, had told me. ''We mitigate risk.'' 
 An hour later the team leader decided to give it one more try. We sped away from the Green Zone, accelerating hard onto the highway. ''White van tracking us!'' a gunman called. On the access road, the suspicious van kept pace. 
 Then, suddenly, we were braking. Traffic crawled and doors were ''cracked.'' That is the company term: doors are opened as little as possible, and rifles are pointed out -- the response when other vehicles get too near. The windows on armored vehicles are so heavy that they don't reliably roll up once they're rolled down, so Triple Canopy's men don't use the windows to point their guns. The door-cracking is rehearsed procedure; they can ride this way at top speed, leaning out to aim their guns in warning, or to put bullets into the engine of an oncoming car. They did it now at almost no speed at all. Traffic was barely creeping. ''Watch this guy on the right!''
 To the right and behind, the threat edged closer. I couldn't help thinking of Lyle Hendrick, of the suicide bomber he'd shot at the last instant. But now, instead of firing, the gunman to my right lifted a hand off his barrel and raised bunched fingers in the air, an Iraqi signal, telling the driver to stop, to back off. Whether by luck or instinct, it was a good call. The driver quit inching forward, his attention caught by the fingers or the muzzle.
 We steered onto the shoulder, passing a dozen cars to reach the head of the stalled traffic. ''Big Army'' was there -- the companies' name for the regular forces. The troops waved us down. They told us they'd found a bomb on the road a few hundred yards ahead, and we waited for their explosives crew to set it off. A concussive wave surged through our chests; smoke billowed over the pavement. 
 Then the way to the airport was clear. The military gate grew visible. Just outside it, another company's convoy was ambushed earlier in the week. But already, around me in the S.U.V., the men relaxed slightly as we approached the checkpoint. And once we were through it, muscles -- around eyes, across backs -- slackened perceptibly. For the moment, risk seemed all behind us.

HEADLINE: An Islamic Alienation

BYLINE: By David Rieff. 
David Rieff, a contributing writer, is the author, most recently, of ''At the Point of a Gun: Democratic Dreams and Armed Intervention.''

 BODY:
Even if they produced no other positive result, the attacks on the London Underground have compelled Europeans of all faiths to think with new urgency about the Continent's Muslim minority. Such a reckoning was long overdue. Some left-wing politicians, like London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, have chosen to emphasize the proximate causes of Muslim anger, focusing on the outrage widely felt in Islamic immigrant communities over the war in Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the harsh reality is that the crisis in relations between the European mainstream and the Islamic diaspora has far deeper roots, consoling as it might be to pretend otherwise. 
 Indeed, the news could scarcely be worse. What Europeans are waking up to is a difficult truth: the immigrants who perform the Continent's menial jobs, and, as is often forgotten, began coming to Europe in the 1950's because European governments and businesses encouraged their mass migration, are profoundly alienated from European society for reasons that have little to do with the Middle East and everything to do with Europe. This alienation is cultural, historical and above all religious, as much if not more than it is political. Immigrants who were drawn to Europe because of the Continent's economic success are in rebellion against the cultural, social and even psychological sources of that success. 
 In a sense, Europe's bad fortune is that Islam is in crisis. Imagine that Mexican Catholicism was in a similar state, and that a powerful, well-financed minority of anti-modern purists was doing its most successful proselytizing among Mexican immigrants in places like Los Angeles, Phoenix and Chicago, above all among the discontented, underemployed youth of the barrios. The predictable, perhaps even the inevitable, result would be the same sort of estrangement between Hispanics and the American mainstream. 
 Whatever the roots of the present troubles, what is undeniable is that many immigrant Muslims and their children remain unreconciled to their situation in Europe. Some find their traditional religious values scorned, while others find themselves alienated by the independence of women, with all its implications for the future of the ''traditional'' Muslim family. In response, many have turned to the most obscurantist interpretation of the Islamic faith as a salve. At the fringes of the diaspora, some have turned to violence. 
 So far, at least, neither the carrot nor the stick has worked. Politicians talk of tighter immigration controls. Yet the reality is that a Europe in demographic freefall needs more, not fewer, immigrants if it is to maintain its prosperity. Tony Blair just proposed new laws allowing the deportation of radical mullahs and the shutting of mosques and other sites associated with Islamic extremism. But given the sheer size of the Muslim population in England and throughout the rest of Europe, the security services are always going to be playing catch-up. Working together, and in a much more favorable political and security context, French and Spanish authorities have, after more than 20 years, been unable to put an end to the terrorism of the Basque separatist group ETA. And there are at least twice as many Muslims in France as there are Basques in Spain. 
 At the same time, it is difficult to see how the extremists' grievances can ever be placated by conciliatory gestures. It is doubtful that the British government's proposed ban on blasphemy against Islam and other religions will have a demonstrable effect. (What would have happened to Salman Rushdie had such a ban been in force when ''The Satanic Verses'' was published?) Meanwhile, the French government has tried to create an ''official'' state-sanctioned French Islam. This approach may be worth the effort, but the chances of success are uncertain. It will require the enthusiastic participation of an Islamic religious establishment whose influence over disaffected youth is unclear. What seems clearer is that European governments have very little time and nowhere near enough knowledge about which members of the Islamic community really are ''preachers of hate'' and which, however unpalatable their views, are part of the immigrant mainstream. 
 The multicultural fantasy in Europe -- its eclipse can be seen most poignantly in Holland, that most self-definedly liberal of all European countries -- was that, in due course, assuming that the proper resources were committed and benevolence deployed, Islamic and other immigrants would eventually become liberals. As it's said, they would come to ''accept'' the values of their new countries. It was never clear how this vision was supposed to coexist with multiculturalism's other main assumption, which was that group identity should be maintained. But by now that question is largely academic: the European vision of multiculturalism, in all its simultaneous good will and self-congratulation, is no longer sustainable. And most Europeans know it. What they don't know is what to do next. If the broad-brush anti-Muslim discourse of Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France or the Vlaams Belang Party in Belgium entered the political mainstream, it would only turn the Islamic diaspora in Europe into the fifth column that, for the moment, it certainly is not. But Europeans can hardly accept an immigrant veto over their own mores, whether those mores involve women's rights or, for that matter, the right to blaspheme, which the Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh so bravely asserted -- and died for. 
 Figuring out how to prevent Europe's multicultural reality from becoming a war of all against all is the challenge that confronts the Continent. It makes all of Europe's other problems, from the economy to the euro to the sclerosis of social democracy, seem trivial by comparison. Unfortunately, unlike those challenges, this one is existential and urgent and has no obvious answer.

LENGTH: 1362 words

HEADLINE: Out of the Darkness, A Flash of Color

BYLINE: By DAN CARNEY

 BODY:
AN eclipse occurs when one celestial body obscures the view of another, just as the redesigned 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse has begun to overshadow the previous-generation car, a coupe that some sporting enthusiasts never fully embraced.
 Mitsubishi hopes the new Eclipse will also obscure the company's troubled reputation, a result of dismal financial results, corporate scandals in Japan and the United States and an exodus of top executives.
 In a summer when bad auto industry news has been as thick as a freshly poured Slurpee, Mitsubishi finally has a fresh model in its showrooms. It has also found a positive example that it hopes to emulate as it plots a recovery: the remarkable rebound of Nissan, over just a few years, from near insolvency. Nissan built its turnaround on a basic but stylish S.U.V., the Xterra, that became a hit with young buyers and propped up the company until other new products were developed. Mitsubishi sees the arrival of the Eclipse as a similar turning point. 
 ''I point at Nissan as an example of the situation that is most similar to ours,'' Dave Schembri, executive vice president of Mitsubishi Motors North America, said in a recent interview. ''We are at that point now with our new Eclipse.''
 The company needs this redesigned car to keep customers coming to showrooms while ir prepares the rest of its parade of new models. ''We'll have six new products in 26 months,'' Mr. Schembri said. Actually, the company is bringing out four new vehicles, along with two variations of them, including a convertible version of the Eclipse that is due to arrive, inexplicably, in January. There are two new sport utilities and a redesigned Lancer economy sedan. The next ultra-high-performance variation on the Lancer, the Evolution X, comes in 2007.
 In the United States, Mitsubishi paid a steep price for having bolstered its sales with interest-free financing and deferred-payment plans, often extended to customers with substandard credit. When the payments finally came due, many buyers just walked away from their cars.
 Also, in its darkest hours, the company dumped nearly half of its production into car-rental fleets. When those marked-down vehicles eventually arrived in the used-car market, resale values plunged.
 Now, Mr. Schembri said, the company is selling only 15 percent of its production to fleet operators, and much of that is strategically planned: the aim is to expose potential customers to Mitsubishi's cars by offering them as rentals. Wholesale auction prices have climbed as a result, Mr. Schembri said.
 While the new Eclipse may give Mitsubishi a foundation for a turnaround, it should be noted that this fourth-generation coupe, like the one that came before it, is not a pocket rocket intended for the hard-core performance crowd, as the first two generations were. Instead, it is a plush, smooth, stylish and nicely equipped sporty coupe that will appeal to the young fashionistas who still gravitate toward two-door cars. 
 The curvaceous body is more daring and should age better than the slab-sided third-generation car. Indeed, the design is a fairly faithful reproduction of the smart Concept-E design study unveiled at the 2004 Detroit auto show, with a few concessions for production and practicality.
 Fender arches are drawn taut over the 17-inch wheels (18-inch wheels are optional), emphasizing the muscular design. Inside, color choices include an adventurous orange that highlights the modern-look instrument panel. Buyers will not have to fret much about whether their friends will hate the loud interior color, since the back seat is utterly useless for carrying passengers.
 The target audience ought to be pleased by the optional 650-watt Rockford Fosgate audio system. But young audiophiles will not like this: the curved center section of the dashboard will not easily accept aftermarket stereo units, a significant accessory in the modern youth culture.
 The base Eclipse GS comes with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 162 horsepower. Paired with the standard five-speed manual transmission, the GS is plenty quick and has the added benefit of being less expensive and more economical than the available V-6. Young drivers are likely to find, too, that the insurance bills will be lower for the four-cylinder car.
 A four-speed automatic transmission is available with the four-cylinder engine, extracting a penalty in both mileage and performance.
 The Eclipse GS should compete solidly in head-to-head comparisons with youth-oriented economy coupes like the Scion tC and Saturn Ion. If looks count for much -- and among the intended base of customers they surely do -- the Eclipse should easily overshadow such comparatively plain-looking alternatives.
 The Eclipse GT has a responsive 3.8-liter V-6. With 263 horsepower, the GT scoots quickly off the line -- Car and Driver magazine clocked it at 6.1 seconds to 60 miles an hour. Do-it-yourselfers will enjoy the easy-shifting six-speed manual gearbox; with the V-6, the automatic transmission has five gears.
 Enthusiasts have long grumbled that the last, departing Eclipse dropped the performance torch that had been passed to it by the first two generations. But the company is quick to point out that while those previous turbocharged, all-wheel-drive models had their fans, the boy racers who liked them most are not the sort who buy a lot of new cars.
 Hence the shift in the third generation to V-6 power and front drive, a combination more appealing to young grownups with jobs and house payments. Although the Eclipse's strong new V-6 appears to have them outgunned on paper, competitors like the Acura RSX and Mini Cooper, which are more agile and fun to drive, will remain the choice of true enthusiasts.
 The Eclipse has already been the subject of two recalls, both related to its brakes. The first involved a problem with the vacuum brake booster that could cause brake failure. Last month, the car was recalled to fix improperly installed brake-cylinder seals that could cause the brakes to feel spongy.
 The Eclipse GT is built in Illinois and shares its underlying architecture with two vehicles that might seem like unlikely bedfellows, the Endeavor utility wagon and Galant midsize sedan.
 As a consequence, the Eclipse GT weighs in at a porky 3,538 pounds with the automatic transmission, with 63 percent of the weight over the front wheels. That front-heaviness and the suspension's bias toward a comfortable ride extracts a penalty in handling, which can get strange when the car is pressed hard. 
 The most disconcerting effect comes over crests and rises, or even when changing lanes on a crowned road -- one that is highest at the center. When you pull out to pass, the car's front tires struggle for grip so they can put the car's substantial power to the pavement. Suddenly, the course turns as unpredictable as the track of a hurricane, the car veering in the opposite direction from the tire with the most traction.
 The company is considering the addition of a Ralliart performance version of the Eclipse, and one can only hope such a car would have a better-sorted suspension for back-road handling. 
 Meanwhile, performance enthusiasts, especially those who long for turbo power and all-wheel drive, need only cast their eyes toward the seriously fearsome Lancer Evolution IX, a four-door beast based on Mitsubishi's rally-racing cars.
 By shunning such exotic hardware for the Eclipse, Mitsubishi has kept the focus on affordability, an essential aspect of sport coupes aimed at young people. 
 Prices start just below $20,000 for the GS. Throw in the trendy orange (''sunset pearlescent'') paint job and the Sun and Sound package (a sunroof and the thumping Rockford Fosgate stereo), and the list price is reasonable $21,029 before you start bargaining. The GT, with its smooth V-6, starts at $24,294.
 A hotter, lighter, crisper Eclipse would certainly be nice, but Mitsubishi stands a better chance of scoring a much-needed sales success by making the car look fast while keeping it within reach of its intended customer base.

INSIDE TRACK: Not a street racer, but a hot-looking street cruiser.

HEADLINE: The Queens Dodgers?

BYLINE: By Henry D. Fetter. 
Henry D. Fetter is the author of ''Taking on the Yankees: Winning and Losing in the Business of Baseball.''

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
TUESDAY is the 50th anniversary of a critically important, if little remembered, date in the history of New York City baseball. 
 On Aug. 16, 1955, Brooklyn Dodger president Walter O'Malley set in motion the chain of events that two years later would uproot the team from its historic home and move it to Los Angeles. Now, there's an effort under way, backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in state and city money, to build an arena for the Nets. Oddly enough, the arena is planned for the same Downtown Brooklyn location that O'Malley unsuccessfully pursued as the site for a Dodger ballpark half a century ago. And new insight into O'Malley's thinking, based on previously unavailable documents, suggests an intriguing scenario of where the Brooklyn Dodgers might be today had things worked out a little differently back then. 
On that mid-August day in 1955, O'Malley stunned Dodgers fans by announcing that ''our days at Ebbets Field are numbered,'' and that the team would have to replace its historic ballpark by 1958. Within a week, O'Malley went public with plans for a new stadium at the intersection of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues and insisted that this was the only ''practical site for a ballpark in Brooklyn.'' 
 ''This is not a threat,'' O'Malley said, but ''we're down to what we believe is our last chance'' to keep the team in Brooklyn. And he even warned that if his proposal was not implemented, the New York Giants, who were facing sharply declining ticket sales, as well as the Dodgers were likely to move out of the city. 
 That is, of course, what happened. When the 1958 baseball season opened, the Dodgers were in Los Angeles and the Giants in San Francisco, a move that triggered a blame game that has been remarkable in its intensity and endurance. Although the Dodger owner was the original villain of the story -- the journalist Jack Newfield wrote that O'Malley '' killed a generation's innocence'' -- current fashion is to hold Robert Moses responsible for forcing the Dodgers out of town. As the city's parks commissioner who dominated city planning, Moses is said to have single-handedly blocked O'Malley's Downtown Brooklyn plan while trying to bludgeon him into accepting a municipally owned stadium in Flushing Meadows -- the eventual site of Shea Stadium -- as the only solution to the Dodgers' quest for a new stadium. 
 Finger-pointing aside, the Dodgers' Brooklyn plan failed for one simple reason. It required an enormous redevelopment of the area and relocation of the Long Island Rail Road terminal and other facilities. City officials -- extending well beyond Moses and embracing many of Brooklyn's leading politicians -- backed by a consensus of newspaper and public opinion, opposed the huge amount of public financing (about $300 million by today's calculations) needed to implement O'Malley's plan.
 As the Brooklyn project unraveled, O'Malley increasingly turned his attention to Los Angeles. But the new documents show that O'Malley was also pursuing a new home for the Dodgers, not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in Queens.
 O'Malley had been thinking about relocating the Dodgers to Queens for some time. Even as he was zeroing in on Brooklyn, O'Malley had considered acquiring a recently vacated veterans' housing project near the intersection of the Horace Harding Expressway and Queens Boulevard in Rego Park. 
 When O'Malley met with Moses in April 1957, it was O'Malley, and not Moses, who first proposed Flushing Meadows as a ballpark site. ''I then brought up the question of Flushing Meadow Park,'' O'Malley wrote in a memorandum. ''To my surprise Bob showed some interest.'' When the two men visited the area a few days later, O'Malley was heartened by Moses's embrace of his vision of a domed stadium and told the commissioner that, although he preferred to keep the Dodgers in Brooklyn, he ''would be willing to lean in favor of a location adjacent to Brooklyn.'' 
 Moses quickly worked up plans and a construction schedule for a Flushing Meadows stadium. However, O'Malley's interest in the Flushing Meadows proposal soon waned as negotiations in Los Angeles moved to fruition. In May, he obtained Los Angeles's agreement to his terms for a stadium deal and National League approval to move to the West Coast. A few weeks later, O'Malley dismissed the Flushing Meadows site, saying that the Dodgers are not the Brooklyn Dodgers if they are not in Brooklyn. If the Dodgers have to leave Brooklyn, he said, ''whether it is 5 miles or 5,000 miles, they are no longer the Brooklyn Dodgers.'' 
 But if Los Angeles had not come along with an extraordinarily favorable offer, Flushing Meadows is probably where the Dodgers would have gone, especially given that O'Malley had suggested it as a stadium site. And with New York government now prepared to provide the kind of financing for sports-oriented development in Downtown Brooklyn that was not available 50 years ago, and with Shea Stadium due for replacement, perhaps the Dodgers might now be heading home to Brooklyn after nothing more than a temporary detour through Queens.

READY for your morning quiz? All right, let's guess the safest town in America. Here's a hint: It's on Long Island.
 Great Neck? Nope. Syosset? Wrong again. How about East Hampton? Sorry, thanks for playing.
No, the correct answer is Islip. 
 O.K., we'll pause a moment while you clean up the spewed coffee.
 Don't believe it? Just ask around.
 ''I haven't locked my door since moving here in 1986,'' said one resident, a man who, it might be added, was wise enough to ask that his name and address not be printed. 
 This eyebrow-raising fact was duly established after a study of national crime statistics by Money magazine, which recently declared Islip the safest town in the country. Specifically, the designation applies to the 11751 area code, a tongue-shaped section of land extending into the bay that makes up the hamlet.
 Wait a minute, you're saying. A New York burg a little over an hour's drive from the mayhem of Manhattan is safer than Mayberry R.F.D., or even Mount Airy, N.C., which was the inspiration for Mayberry on ''The Andy Griffith Show?'' Safer than the two Hawaiian towns also listed among the top 10 safe locations? Even Craig Matters, an executive editor of Money magazine, began scratching his head when questioned about the research. ''You know,'' he said, ''let me just check those numbers once more.'' 
 He called back the next day. Lo and behold, they held up.
 The honor is something of an adjunct in the magazine's ''100 Best Places to Live'' edition. Islip isn't actually mentioned in the print version of the publication, but can be found on its Web site. According to Mr. Matters, the conclusion came from a study of uniform crime reports from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 Now you're thinking, hey, they skewed the data. Did they leave something out? Or, sneeze when they put in the decimal point? No, the tallied figures took into account murder, rape, robbery and assault as well as property crimes including larceny, burglary and motor vehicle theft. In other words, the whole criminal spectrum.
 Even residents were slightly shocked by the news.
 ''Really?'' said Mirissa Napolitano, who has worked at Kleiber's Historic Country Store for the last 16 years. She thought about it for a second and then pointed out that the deli has never been robbed and she's never been hassled.
 ''I agree,'' she said. ''The door is open here all year round, and I feel just as safe when the sun goes down at 4:30 in winter as when it goes down at 9 in the summer.''
 What's behind this phenomenon? Dominick Varrone, assistant chief of patrol for the Suffolk County Police Department, thinks its the professionalism of Long Island's finest. His boys do a good job, he says. In fact, Forbes magazine in its May 23 issue determined that the Nassau Suffolk area overall had the lowest crime rate of any of the 150 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. It turns out that the top four places with low crime were also among the most expensive in the country. Which could mean that criminals just can't afford to live on Long Island. And chances are they hate the commute. 
 A chief reason cited by Islip townspeople is its watch-block mixture of the young, the middle-aged and the elderly. Whether it's children hanging out late at night or grandmothers peeking from behind a curtain in the morning, chances are somebody in the neighborhood is always keeping an eye on things.
 ''It's a close-knit community,'' said Tom Jaklitsch, who stops to chat while pedaling along a back street with his 6-year-old son. ''My neighbors look after us and call if they see anything wrong. And we do the same for them.''
 Town supervisor Pete McGowan, a former Islip pub owner, went along with that assessment.
 ''It's a very friendly town. People are born here, they don't leave and they work hard to keep the old ways going even though the times are changing.''
 But it appears that safe only counts for so much. Despite the hamlet's blue-ribbon award, it did not make the magazine's best places to live tally. Mr. Matters said this probably is because crime was only one factor in that determination, which also included economic opportunity, income levels, cost of living, schools and jobs.
 ''Maybe the fact that living in Islip is a tad expensive knocked us out,'' Mr. McGowan said.
 Even so, publicity like this isn't bad considering the area's last brush with national fame.
 Mr. McGowan laughed remembering back in 1987 when the increasingly pungent Islip garbage barge attracted talk-show ridicule for two months while cruising the coast and a few Latin American countries searching for a place to land. It's always better to be safe than slurry.
 ''We've come a long way,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Lessons From China

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Don't Worry About China. Learn From It.'' (Everybody's Business, July 31):
 As an investor in Unocal, I watched with interest the battle between Chevron and Cnooc, the Chinese oil concern, to acquire the company. Now, after Cnooc has withdrawn its bid and Chevron has won, I still disagree with the column's assessment of the message to be learned from competition with China.
 While globalization has leveled the playing field and improved the world's standard of living, the global competition for finite strategic resources will soon become a central theme of United States foreign policy. The era is ending when the United States represents such a huge share of the world's economy, based on its population. The addition of several billion new consumers anxious to raise their standards of living in China and in India has pre-eminent economic and political implications for a finite globe.
 I agree with the column that we should learn from our friends, not fear and envy them. But I also recognize that global competition on some playing fields will be a zero-sum game, and that allowing a foreign state-funded company to buy access to those commodities will almost certainly not be in our best interest. We need to learn from our friends where our own self-interests lie.

HEADLINE: Many on Base-Closings Panel Question Estimate of Savings 

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
A majority of the members of the independent commission assessing the Pentagon's proposed list of domestic base closings say that the Defense Department probably overstated the nearly $50 billion in savings projected over 20 years, perhaps by nearly 50 percent. 
 In interviews this week, eight of the nine members expressed varying degrees of concern about the accuracy of the Pentagon figures, and said they had directed the commission's staff to conduct a separate savings analysis before the commission's final votes on the military's recommendations later this month.
After scores of base visits and public hearings, most of the commission members interviewed said they now agreed with a report issued this summer by federal investigators that concluded that nearly half of the Pentagon's projected savings came from cuts in military jobs that, in many cases, would simply be reassigned to other installations. 
 ''I fail to see at this point how you could arrive at the figures they arrived at,'' said Anthony J. Principi, a former secretary of veterans affairs who is the commission chairman. ''We're going through this effort to save money from excess capacity to modernize forces. If the savings aren't there, and it costs money to do this on top of all the economic upheaval, why are we doing this?'' 
 A Pentagon spokesman, Glenn Flood, defended the Defense Department's analysis and said it was preparing a detailed explanation of the projected savings for the commission. ''We stand by what we said,'' Mr. Flood said. 
 Other defense officials said the Pentagon's projected savings in military personnel cuts would probably be reallocated to new types of military jobs that were more relevant to today's security environment, like operating remotely piloted Predator aircraft. 
 The commission, whose members include retired military officers and former cabinet members or members of Congress, must submit its findings to President Bush by Sept. 8. The president and Congress have until Nov. 7 to reject or accept the entire package.
 Projected savings will be an important factor in the commission's deliberations, although the military value of the proposed changes is the paramount consideration. Nonetheless, 80 percent of the Pentagon's proposed savings come from just 10 percent of the recommendations, including such contentious changes as the proposed closings of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, the Navy's submarine base in Groton, Conn., and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine. 
 Commission members say that if they determine that the Pentagon proposals yield smaller savings than projected, or even cost money over time, that may tip the balance in some of the panel's final votes. 
 ''It will have an impact,'' said Philip E. Coyle III, a commission member who was the Pentagon's top weapons evaluator for much of the 1990's. ''It may be that closures or realignments that were proposed, in part because they would save money, may actually cost money. The whole idea is to save taxpayers money, and if it costs the taxpayers money, I think that would cause the commissioners to have a second look.'' 
 Commissioners say it is too early to predict what decisions will emerge from four days of public deliberations that are scheduled to begin on Aug. 24 in Crystal City, Va., just outside Washington. But the panel is nearing the end of a process that could shut, consolidate or realign more than 800 military facilities in all 50 states. Some are well known in military history, including Fort McPherson in Georgia.
 The commission said Friday that it had invited Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to testify in a rare Saturday session next week to provide the Pentagon's final comments before the panel begins final deliberations. 
 Earlier this month, Mr. Bush signaled he would accept the panel's recommendations without objection and send them on to Congress for approval. ''In order for the process to be nonpolitical, it's very important to make it clear that the decision of the BRAC will stand, as far as I am concerned,'' Mr. Bush told reporters, using the acronym for the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. 
 By law, the commission must give priority to the military value of the proposed changes -- that is, what would improve the readiness and combat effectiveness of the armed forces. That could include more spacious training areas and the ability to move forces quickly in a crisis. 
 ''The first goal of the BRAC is to improve the war-fighting capability,'' Maj. Gen. Gary Heckman, co-director of the Air Force's base-closing analysis team, told the commission on July 18.
 But cost savings have always been an important selling point for the politically divisive base-closing process, which had previous rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld said the proposed changes under review would save about $5.5 billion a year, after initial closing costs of $24 billion were paid, and $48.8 billion over 20 years. The previous four rounds of base closings saved a total of $29 billion through 2003, according to the Government Accountability Office. ''By making these changes, the American taxpayer benefits,'' Mr. Rumsfeld told the commission on May 16. 
 But in a report issued in early July, the accountability office, an investigative arm of Congress, challenged the Pentagon's findings, saying that 47 percent of the projected savings were from cuts in members of the military who in many cases would simply be reassigned to other installations. ''This could create a false sense of savings available for other purposes,'' the report said. 
 In testimony to the commission on July 18, the head of the office, David M. Walker, the comptroller general, said, ''Unless you end up reducing overall head count or the average compensation levels for the applicable positions, there are no net dollar savings for military personnel.'' 
 This assessment combined with the commission's own review to this point have left some commission members shaking their heads. ''I have a hard time picturing this as a savings unless we're reducing the size of the force, and we're not,'' said Gen. James T. Hill, a retired Army officer on the panel. 
 Brig. Gen. Sue E. Turner, a retired Air Force officer and commission member, said, ''I think there's still a lot of questions.'' 
 Another commissioner, James Hansen, a former Utah congressman, said he was skeptical of both the Pentagon and G.A.O. analyses. ''It's extremely hard to project savings,'' he said. 
 The G.A.O.'s analysis and the public skepticism voiced by many commission members have given many states and communities with bases on the chopping block renewed hope they can save their installations. 
 Massachusetts lawmakers argued this week that it would actually cost nearly $163 million over the next 20 years to close Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod, not save $336 million over that time, as the Pentagon claims. The new figures, offered by the Massachusetts National Guard, contend that the Pentagon counted savings from jobs that would not be eliminated and did not take into account retraining costs. 
 Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina, a Democrat, expressed concern this month about whether the proposal to turn Pope Air Force Base over to the Army would yield the projected $197 million in annual savings. 
 The Pentagon's savings estimates have come under such fire that some commissioners say they will not rely on them. ''The final decisions won't be unduly influenced by the Defense Department estimates because we'll do our own,'' said Samuel K. Skinner, a commission member who is a former chief of staff to the first President Bush. 
 In the end, commission members say they will have to carefully balance the military necessity of the proposed changes against other considerations, including savings. 
 ''Military value trumps everything,'' said Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., a retired Navy officer on the panel. ''It's very likely that we'll support a Defense Department recommendation even if it couldn't demonstrate the payback, if we were absolutely convinced the military value was significant. But the burden of proof would be on them.''

 Nearly half of the Defense Department's $5.5 billion anticipated annual savings from proposed base closings are attributed to reductions in military jobs, though many positions may be reassigned instead of eliminated.

HEADLINE: The 30-Year Bond Is Back, and So Is Romance

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH HARRIS

 BODY:
FOR money managers on Wall Street more than for investors on Main Street, the return of the 30-year bond is like the rekindling of a close relationship. 
 ''It's like having an old friend back,'' says Clifford A. Gladson, a senior vice president for fixed-income investments at USAA Investment Management. And David R. Glocke, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Vanguard, says that while he has no special feelings for the 30-year-bond, many colleagues do. ''I've heard people refer to the 30-year in various tones,'' he said. ''There's a love affair out there for some people.''
Clearly, many fixed-income specialists have been strangely moved by the recent announcement from the Treasury that, after a four-year gap, it will begin to reissue the 30-year bond early next year. Before that pause, the bond had long served as the world's benchmark fixed-income instrument. 
 For Wall Street asset managers, the literal meaning of the bond's return is less portentous but still important: in pension funds, mutual funds and other large portfolios, managers will again be able to lock in yields of fully backed government debt for 30 years. Individual investors will be indirectly affected by these developments, but for their own portfolios, the availability of the 30-year bond will probably be much less significant. Bonds of shorter maturities may make more sense because they are less sensitive to changes in interest rates -- and because few individuals are likely to buy and hold a bond for a full 30 years.
 William F. Hummel, 82, a retired aerospace engineer from Los Angeles and an avid investor, says he holds nothing longer than two-, three- and five-year Treasuries in his portfolio.
 Mr. Hummel, who writes about financial topics on his Web site, wfhummel.net, says that 30-year bonds provide little growth potential and that their average return is much lower than what a typical broad-based stock fund is likely to deliver.
 ''No doubt there are many individuals who like to roll the dice on long maturities,'' he said, ''but I am not one of them.'' 
 At the moment, investors aren't being rewarded much for buying longer securities and taking on extra risk. Two-year Treasury notes are earning 4.03 percent, while 10-year bonds yield only slightly more, at 4.24 percent. Using Wall Street jargon, the yield curve -- a graph tracing the yield of bonds of different maturities -- is relatively flat. 
 Pension funds are a likely home for the new 30-year bonds. Many companies with traditional pension plans haven't invested adequately to pay for their future retirees' benefits, and there is a growing urgency to correct the problem. Companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index with such defined-benefit plans faced an average shortfall of 11.5 percent in their pension funds in 2004, according to S.&P.
 The Senate Finance Committee approved legislation last month that would require companies to fully fund their pension plans. Similar legislation is pending in the House. 
 ''They're so grossly underfunded,'' said Sharon L. Stark, chief fixed-income strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. ''It's not that there aren't any long maturity assets out there, but they haven't been able to get the yield that they need.'' 
 Daniel S. Vandivort, chief investment officer at Weiss, Peck & Greer, a subsidiary of Robeco Investment Management, said pension accounting-rule proposals being debated in Congress might lead pensions to increase the duration of the bonds in their portfolios. ''Pension funds could say, 'Let's move our duration from five years to eight years,''' he said.
 Heavy buying by pension funds could easily drive up the cost of the bonds, leading many bond mutual funds to hold off on purchases. Prices move in the opposite direction from yields, and high prices could lower an investor's absolute return.
 That poses a quandary for many bond fund managers as they ponder whether to embrace the revived long bond, which was first issued regularly in 1977. ''It does become part of my benchmark, so I'm certainly going to be interested,'' Mr. Glocke of Vanguard said, ''although since it's been out of circulation, there's going to be a strong premium -- so I may be reluctant'' to buy it.
 Even if many fund managers don't buy the 30-year bond at first, its mere existence may cause some to tilt their funds' durations longer, which could increase risk for investors. The reason for this possible shift is that most bond fund managers rely on the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond index as a guideline for duration, a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes. When the new 30-year bonds enter the market, the index is expected to lengthen its duration. That may drive some bond funds to do the same. 
 In a time of rising interest rates, longer maturities carry the risk of losing more value. So investors with a long government bond fund in their portfolios should examine its duration, said Scott M. Kahan, a certified financial planner and principal of the Financial Asset Management Corporation in New York. ''Now that managers can buy 30-year bonds, they may be forced to do that, and all of a sudden you're getting more risk than you've gotten before,'' Mr. Kahan said.
 Longer-term government bond funds have an average duration of 8.8 years, according to Morningstar, which tracks mutual funds. But some funds exceed that figure widely: the Wasatch-Hoisington United States Treasury bond fund, for example, has a duration of 15.4 years, according to Morningstar. 
 Even if investors stay in a fund, Mr. Kahan said, they may want to make sure they hold a separate short-term bond fund to balance the long-term investment.
 If demand is high for longer Treasuries, higher-yielding alternatives like corporate or mortgage-backed bonds may be even more appealing, said Brian D. Lowder, a certified financial planner and president of Brian D. Lowder Inc. in San Diego.
 ''You can always get a bit higher return on those alternate bonds,'' he said.
 During the absence of the 30-year bond, investors turned to other securities, so the long bond may not be able to regain its old place at the center of the bond universe, some managers said. 
 The 10-year note is now pre-eminent, partly because the market for mortgage-backed securities revolves around it, Mr. Gladson said. 
 Ms. Stark at Legg Mason Wood Walker said, ''There may be those who find the 30-year more appropriate than the 10-year, but since the market has adjusted, it's not likely that you will see the kind of sponsorship that you have in the past.'' 
 In volume alone, the 10-year note is unlikely to be supplanted soon. Last year, the Treasury issued about $108 billion worth of 10-year notes. By contrast, it announced that it expects to sell only $20 billion to $30 billion worth of 30-year bonds for all of next year, in semiannual sales.
 In the end, though, many managers said, the return of the 30-year bond will probably have less impact on the market than other factors. Continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve, as well as historically low yields on longer-term bonds, will probably play a bigger role in investors' portfolios, said Brian J. Brennan, a vice president and portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price United States Treasury Long-Term fund.
 ''The overall dynamics and movement of the yield curve will be more powerful than the reissuance of the 30-year,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Two Steps Toward a Sensible Immigration Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

DATELINE: San Antonio 

 BODY:
What do you say to the working-class guy from the south side of San Antonio? He feels his wages are stagnating because he has to compete against illegal immigrants. He watches thousands of people streaming across the border, bankrupting his schools and health care system, while he plays by the rules. 
 He's no racist. Many of his favorite neighbors are kind, neat and hard-working Latinos. But his neighborhood now has homes with five cars rotting in the front yard and 12 single men living in one house. Now there are loud parties until 2 a.m. and gang graffiti on the walls. He read in the local paper last week that Anglos are now a minority in Texas and wonders if anybody is in charge of this social experiment. 
 What do you tell him about the immigration system?
 Here's what you tell him: You're right. The system is out of control. But we can't just act like lunkheads and think we can solve this problem with brute force. Tough enforcement laws make us feel good but they don't do the job. Since 1986, we've tripled the number of Border Patrol agents and increased the enforcement budget 10 times over, but we haven't made a dent in the number of illegals who make it here. We've got agents chasing busboys while who knows what kind of terrorists are trying to sneak into this country.
 The problem is that we make it nearly impossible for the immigrants to come here legally. We issue about 5,000 visas for unskilled year-round labor annually, but the economy requires hundreds of thousands of new workers to clean hotel rooms and process food. We need these workers but we force them underground with our self-delusional immigration policies. As Tamar Jacoby of the Manhattan Institute says, ''It's very hard to enforce unrealistic rules.''
 So it doesn't matter how many beer-swilling good old boys appoint themselves citizen border guards, we're not going to get this situation under control until we understand this paradox: The more we simply crack down, the more disorder we get. The only way to re-establish order is to open up legal, controllable channels through which labor can flow in an aboveground, orderly way. We can't build a wall to stop this flood; we need sluice gates to regulate the flow.
 Smart people understand this, and there has been an important change in the immigration debate. Among practical people, it's no longer pro-immigrant folks against anti-immigrant folks. It's no longer law-and-order hawks versus amnesty doves. Practical people understand the only way to establish law and order is to create a temporary-worker program and step up enforcement to make sure people use it.
 In the Senate there are two bills, which if combined would get us a long way toward a solution. The McCain-Kennedy bill has an effective temporary worker program. The Kyl-Cornyn bill has tough border security provisions. As Jacoby notes, the sponsors of both may come to realize the two bills are not rivals. They complement each other. 
 This reform won't satisfy people who want immigrants to disappear. But most Americans just want to know the system is under control, and this will do it.
 That still leaves the transitional problem of what to do with the 11 million illegals who are already here. We can't build an aboveground immigration system if we've still got millions living in a criminal swamp below.
 We're not going to deport 11 million people, many of whom own homes and businesses. But normalizing their status is a question of balance. If we treat them too punitively, we'll just push them further underground. On the other hand, they broke the law, and they have to pay. McCain-Kennedy would lure them into the sunlight with the prospect of normalization, but would make them pay all back taxes and a $2,000 fine to become regularized, and they'd have to get in the back of the line. That's a start, but the penalties will probably have to be a bit tougher to be politically palatable.
 So here's the bottom line for the guy in San Antonio: Everybody's expecting a big blowup on this issue, but we've got a great chance of enacting serious immigration reform. It won't solve all problems. There will still be wage pressures and late-night parties. But right now immigration chaos is spreading a subculture of criminality across America. What we can do is re-establish law and order, so immigrants can bring their energy to this country without destroying the social fabric while they're here.

WHILE the Yankees scour the scrap heap for a live arm -- forget the rest of the body, an arm is what they need -- two last-place teams have mined gems, the Pittsburgh Pirates with Zach Duke and the Seattle Mariners with Felix Hernandez. If these pitchers were with contenders, they could go a long way toward helping secure playoff spots.
 Duke and Hernandez are second-half arrivals in the major leagues who should stay for years. They have quickly demonstrated that level of talent.
Duke, 22, ran up a 5-0 record with a sterling 1.54 earned run average in his first seven starts, pitching at least seven innings each time except for a rain-reduced two-inning outing. In two of the starts, he allowed no runs; in another he gave up only an unearned run, and in a fourth game he gave up one run. 
 Proving he is only human, Duke gave up four runs in four innings in Houston in his eighth start Friday night, though he was not the losing pitcher in the 6-5 loss. Duke's, whose E.R.A. rose to 2.13, is scheduled to make his next start against the Mets at Shea Stadium Thursday. 
 Hernandez, 19, has started two games, winning one and losing one but permitting only one earned run (two runs total) in 13 innings for a 0.69 E.R.A.
 The Mariners signed Hernandez as a free agent in Venezuela. The Pirates plucked Duke, a left-hander from Texas, in the 2001 draft. But they selected him in the 20th round, meaning he was available to every other team in the first 19 rounds. How does a 20th-round pick win his first five decisions in the majors after dazzling five minor leagues in the previous three and a half seasons?
 The answer is Duke wasn't really a 20th-rounder. He wasn't projected as a first-round pick, but he would most likely have gone within the first five rounds.
 ''He would have gone higher in the draft,'' Dave Littlefield, the Pirates' general manager said, ''but there was word that he wanted a lot more dollars than he was worth. Since people deemed him unsignable, he was headed to college.''
 The Pirates, moving belatedly but boldly, intercepted Duke before he matriculated. It was one of the best moves they had made since drafting Roberto Clemente in 1954. ''Our scout'' -- Grant Brittain -- ''did a nice job with him and was able to get him signed,'' Littlefield said.
 In each level of the minor leagues, Duke showed that he was special. In his first season, 2002, he won the first eight games he pitched. In his three and a half seasons in the minors, he compiled a 43-17 record, including 12-3 at Class AAA Indianapolis this season. He allowed two or fewer runs in 59 of his 79 minor league starts. 
 What he has done for the Pirates seems like a natural progression.
 ''Duke has a good fastball, a good breaking ball, a curveball and a good changeup,'' Littlefield said. ''He has three very strong pitches, and he throws a lot of pitches for strikes. He has very good command. He has a foundation for being good for a while.''
 In addition, Littlefield said, Duke is ''very composed, mature beyond his years. He is poised in trying times on the mound and in how he handles his life.'' 
 The only question about Duke is how long he will pitch for the economically challenged Pirates, who have a recent history of trading their best players. They have traded, among others, Aramis Ramirez, Brian Giles, Jason Kendall, Jason Schmidt and Kris Benson. Littlefield, however, said times were changing.
 ''We obviously were going through rough times,'' he said. ''We had to get our house in order and needed to do some financial things. We don't have bad contracts anymore. We're in position to keep our players, but we have to keep the right guys. In the past, we gave contracts to players who turned out not to be productive.''
 Duke is one of a group of rookies the Pirates have added to their struggling team. They also have put Ryan Doumit behind the plate, Brad Eldred at first base and Chris Duffy in center field.
 The Mariners have added the right-handed Hernandez to their starting rotation, and he will most likely be there a long time. They signed him in July 2002 as a 16-year-old upon his graduation from high school in Valencia, Venezuela. 
 ''We didn't have to protect him until the year after this,'' Bill Bavasi, the Mariners' general manager, said, meaning on the 40-man roster. This wasn't a case, he explained, of rushing a youngster because the team needed pitching.
 ''Young or not, we needed to get him to a level where he could learn,'' Bavasi said. ''Fortunately or unfortunately, that's the major leagues.''
 Hernandez, Bavasi said, had reached the point, after only two and a half minor league seasons, where he could get away with making mistakes and not learn from them.
 ''He could make mistakes at Triple A and still get out of an inning because he has good stuff,'' Bavasi said. ''He's a very mature kid. Any setbacks he has here, he'll handle well mentally and emotionally. He wants to learn. By any standard, he's ahead.''
 The Mariners recently added a rookie, Yuniesky Betancourt, to play in the middle infield. He is a 23-year-old Cuban defector. 
 ''We agreed with him last year,'' Bavasi said, ''but because of his difficulty getting Mexican residency, we couldn't get him on the field until this year in spring training.''

Fountain of Youth
 The Pirates and the Mariners have especially notable rookie pitchers, but these two last-place teams together have 10 rookies on their rosters, while the first-place Braves have 10 on their roster. 
 The Braves have used 15 rookies during the season. Four are back in the minors (Frank Brooks, Matt Childers, Andy Marte and Jorge Vasquez) and one was traded (Roman Colon). The remaining 10, or 40 percent of the active roster, are: outfielders Ryan Langerhans, Jeff Francoeur and Kelly Johnson; infielders Wilson Betemit and Pete Orr; catchers Brian McCann and Brayan Pena; and pitchers Kyle Davies, Macay McBride and Blaine Boyer.
 ''I never thought it would be this much fun,'' John Smoltz, a team elder, said of playing with the rookies. ''In the middle part of my career, the rookies who came up -- you were just so sick and tired of their attitude, to be blunt about it. They knew everything. These guys are so respectful, so willing to learn. 
 ''I think it's a product of the organization drafting them, the product of the managers we have below teaching them how to treat the game right. It's been a joy; it's given me energy I never thought I had.'' 

Men on the Move
 If they had known what the season would bring, Jody Gerut, Eric Byrnes and Jose Cruz Jr. would have kept their bags packed. Each has played for three teams this season, living through two trades and having no time to send out his laundry.
 Gerut was traded July 18 from the Indians to the Cubs for Jason Dubois, then again July 31 from the Cubs to the Pirates for Matt Lawton. Byrnes went from the Athletics to the Rockies on July 13 for Joe Kennedy and Jay Witasick, then to the Orioles on July 29 for Larry Bigbie. Cruz moved from the Diamondbacks to the Red Sox on July 30 for two minor leaguers, then kept going to the Dodgers on Aug. 9 for a player to be named. 

A Painful Parting
 David Eckstein won a game for St. Louis with a grand slam last week. Not that the Cardinals needed that victory, given their large division lead, but the blow gave Eckstein reason to feel good that he was continuing to do his part in achieving his goal.
 ''You play this game to win a ring,'' he said. ''Anything short of that is tough. Last year, losing the first round was very difficult.''
 The Cardinals went to the World Series last year, but Eckstein was not their shortstop. Edgar Renteria was. This year, Renteria plays short for the Red Sox, the team that beat Eckstein's team, the Angels, in the first round last year.
 Eckstein, Renteria and Orlando Cabrera, who played short for the Red Sox in the World Series but now plays for the Angels, played a game of musical shortstops last winter. Eckstein signed with the Cardinals after the Angels went for Cabrera.
 ''I know it's business and I understand that,'' Eckstein said. ''I was fine with the whole situation. But I was a little disappointed with how it was handled in terms of how it actually went down. Just tell me. I'm going to keep my mouth shut, not say anything.
 ''Every year in Anaheim they always talked about how they were going to get a new shortstop, so it was nothing new to me. It definitely hurts a little bit. You give an organization everything you have for the four years I was there, and to have it end the way it ended was a little disappointing.''

HEADLINE: Coming Home

BYLINE: By John Crawford. 
John Crawford is the author of ''The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell: An Accidental Soldier's Account of the War in Iraq.''

DATELINE: Tallahassee, Fla. 

 BODY:
IT was raining when I stepped off the plane and into a chilly Georgia morning. The line of soldiers, heads down, struggled underneath the weight of their gear across the tarmac and into a long, low building full of Red Cross coffee and doughnuts. Along the way a general stood shaking hands and exchanging salutes with the returning soldiers. Next to him, a young lieutenant shivered as he held an umbrella out at arm's length over the general. Neither had combat patches on their uniforms, and I splashed by without saluting or shaking hands. It gave little satisfaction. 
 It had been just over a year since I had last been at that airport; that first time there had been banners and flags, family members waving fervently at the departing plane. This time the weather, I guess, had kept them home and the gray sky was the only real witness to our return. Clouds or no, the ''freedom bird'' had landed and our war was over, we were home. 
I left for Iraq on Feb. 12, 2003. The war hadn't started yet. The Florida National Guard in which I was serving as a specialist was partly made up of former active-service infantrymen from the Rangers, the 82nd Airborne, the 10th Mountain and (in my case) the 101st Airborne. The rest were ''straight Guard,'' as we called them: college students, small-business owners, police officers, contractors, painters or unemployed. They had signed up for the fabled ''one weekend a month, two weeks a year'' and gotten very much more than they bargained for. 
 Still, things started fairly well. There were no complaints as March waned and we crossed from Kuwait into Iraq; only thinly veiled excitement. As the weeks turned to months, however, and we watched active-duty units return to their families, our stoicism was replaced with mounting frustration. Our Vietnam-era flak vests, retooled M-16's more than two decades old and a general absence of supplies added to an irrefutable feeling that we had been abandoned in the lion's den. 
 When the tour ended a year later, our uniforms were in tatters, night vision goggles had been packed away seven months earlier when all our replacement parts ran out, and the ragged men who stepped off the plane in Hinesville, Ga., scarcely resembled the ''shock-and-awe'' troops seen on television. Nevertheless, we were soldiers returned homevictorious, at least in a sense.
 That night, in the same dilapidated World War II barracks that we had deployed from an eternity before, I didn't sleep. I thought it was because of the Christmas-morning-like tremble in the air. In reality, I had become addicted to Valium in Baghdad and was going through withdrawal. Sitting alone on my bunk in the darkness, I felt a wave of nausea approaching. That sick feeling hasn't entirely gone away yet. 
 A week later someone gave a speech, and bags full of coupons for free double cheeseburgers and oil changes were handed out. (Most of the good freebies had already been plundered by 17-year-old trainees who hadn't yet been to basic training.) And with a wave goodbye and a pat on the back, we were civilians again. I heard there was a parade a few months later, but I was too drunk to go and it wasn't on television.
 Even the best laid plans go awry, and that is what happened with me. While many in my platoon had relatively easy transitions, I found myself within days kept from homelessness only by the hospitality of a friend with a sofa. It was like being at a party and going to the restroom for 15 months and then trying to rejoin the conversation. Everyone and everything had changed without asking me first.
 I took solace in becoming the kind of self-deprecating drunk who shows up at parties naked and wonders why everyone reacts the way they do. The sequence of events that followed culminated in my waking up on the dingy bathroom floor of an even dingier one-bedroom apartment devoid of furniture, except for a couch pulled from a dumpster early one rainy morning before the garbage man could claim it. In that bathroom, fighting off sickness from the year's excess, I did some soul-searching.
 I didn't find a whole lot. I don't have nightmares, or see faces. When there is a flash outside my window at night I know it's just lightning and not a flare or explosion. I can even drive without cringing at the slightest pile of rubble along the roadside in anticipation of an ear-rending explosion and shrapnel tearing through my flesh. I rarely get into fights with people who I imagined are ''eyeballing me.'' I actually adjusted quite well. 
 It certainly could have been worse. One of my buddies got locked up in an institution by the police for being a danger to himself. Another woke up in the hospital with no memory of the beating he received from those same police -- not for being a danger to himself, but to everyone else. One guy got a brain infection and wakes up every morning expecting to be in Iraq. Two more are in Afghanistan, having re-upped rather than deal with being home. Five more went back to Baghdad as private security guards. Their consensus on how it is a second time around: still hot and nasty. 
 The ones who are still around here I don't see as much as I used to; that doesn't come as much of a surprise. Too many things have happened since we got back a little over a year ago. Busy schedules and girls have gotten in the way. Classes have to be attended, jobs worked; life goes on. 
 War stories end when the battle is over or when the soldier comes home. That's one way to tell it's a story. In real life, there are no moments amid smoldering hilltops for tranquil introspection. When the war is over, you pick up your gear, walk down the hill and back into the world, where people smile, congratulate you, and secretly hope you won't be a burden on society now that you've done the dirty work they shun.
 Lying there on that bathroom floor, with my dog eyeing me and wondering if a coup d'etat would be necessary to ensure his continued food supply, I did figure out one thing: My problem was, I had the wrong definition of home. All my life I learned it was ''where the heart is.'' Things are much easier now that I've figured out that home is just a place where you receive mail.

HEADLINE: When The Bulldozers Never Arrive

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN and APRIL RABKIN

 BODY:
LAUREL HOULE still chokes up when she sees her old home, the plain two-story gray clapboard house in Andover where she raised two boys next door to their grandparents and cousins. She remembers how the boys used to sled down the long hill to the river before school and how they cared for the cows and horses.
 Ms. Houle and her family moved from that house in 1989. But it was not her idea. The Connecticut Department of Transportation wanted to build a highway, and her homestead was in the way.
Having to move was bad enough, but Ms. Houle has another reason to complain: 16 years later, the highway has not been built, and it is doubtful that it ever will. 
 In the last five decades, hundreds of families and business owners in Connecticut have been displaced for roads, retail developments or industrial parks that were never built. By the time the projects fall through, there is seldom any way to return the properties to their original owners or to bring back the neighborhoods that were lost.
 ''It's such a waste,'' said Lenny Margolis, who grew up in the Oak Street neighborhood of New Haven, which was bulldozed 40 years ago for another highway that was never finished.
 Eminent domain, the government's power to buy property to make way for new private or public projects, has faced new scrutiny since the United States Supreme Court ruled in June against a group of New London homeowners who sued to keep the city from taking their homes for private development.
 State legislators have been debating whether to ban the use of eminent domain for such private projects. But they have also talked about cases like those of Mr. Margolis and Ms. Houle, in which the developments never lived up to their promise, leaving weeds and vacant lots. In public statements and private conversations, lawmakers have said the state needs to prevent the wasteful use of eminent domain, and to ensure accountability when development projects go awry.
 One of the largest of those unfinished projects led to the destruction of the Oak Street neighborhood in New Haven. The 42-acre neighborhood was designated as an urban renewal zone in the 1950's, and was systematically leveled to make way for a proposed highway, along with commercial and residential developments. The highway was supposed to ferry commuters from Interstate 95 to the city's western suburbs, bypassing downtown New Haven. The project was seen as a solution to two problems: the blight that had overtaken the neighborhood, and the traffic that blocked city streets.
 The city eventually relocated 886 households, affecting about 3,000 people. Many of the families were moved into public housing in other parts of the city.
 The Oak Street Connector, a milelong expressway that routed cars off the interstate just south of downtown New Haven, was completed in 1959, but the rest of the project stalled. People involved in it give numerous reasons, from the lack of state money to environmental concerns about extending the highway through a swampy park at one end of the neighborhood. As time went on, the city's plans became less and less ambitious.
 State Representative Patricia Dillon, a Democrat whose New Haven district was redrawn to exclude the old Oak Street neighborhood, said she went to many groundbreakings there.
 ''I still have my shovel from when Ella Grasso came down and said we would finish 34,'' Ms. Dillon said, referring to the former governor and the section of Route 34 that was never built. ''She said, 'Dirt will fly.' I went to about five Route 34 groundbreakings.''
 Now, much of the neighborhood is made up of an enormous city parking lot and a series of undeveloped fields. But Oak Street still exists in the minds of old men who meet for weekly lunches to reminisce.
 Bob Silverman, 75, grew up in the neighborhood and said it was a densely populated immigrant enclave, the kind where Jewish and Italian bakeries faced one another on opposite sides of the street. On a recent visit, he pointed to where he used to live, which is now part of the parking lot for a high school. On the spot where his old house sat, a sea gull perched on a light pole.
 ''This was a great place to live,'' he said.
 Mr. Silverman became a New Haven alderman in the 1970's and tried to get the project going again, but competing visions and a lack of support from the state killed it, he said.
 ''This could have been a whole big shopping area,'' he said. ''It could have been a beautiful area.''
 Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven said there were still plans for commercial and residential development at the site of the old Oak Street neighborhood. Pfizer recently opened a research center there. But some past residents said they could not forgive the people who destroyed the old neighborhood.
 ''My feeling is, it's a betrayal,'' Mr. Silverman said.

Abandoned in Bridgeport
 In Bridgeport, another troubled development project has caused similar bitter feelings in the Steel Point neighborhood, on a peninsula just south of I-95. 
 Edward Lavernoich, who is directing the Steel Point project for the city's Office of Planning and Economic Development, called it the most important strategic property in the city.
 But thousands of drivers pass the 50-acre neighborhood every day and see nothing but a huge abandoned lot with one decrepit old house.
 State Senator Ernest E. Newton II grew up near Steel Point in the east end of Bridgeport. ''This was a thriving middle-class neighborhood,'' he said, standing in the middle of what is now a fenced-in lot overgrown with weeds.
 The city considered buying the houses in the 1980's, when developers expressed interest, but that interest faded. In the mid-1990's, Bridgeport had another chance to redevelop the area when another developer approached the city with ideas for a mall at Steel Point.
 By that time, the neighborhood had seen better days, Mr. Lavernoich said. The area was contaminated with toxic materials and the sewage system was inadequate, he said.
 He disagreed with Mr. Newton's characterization that the neighborhood had been thriving. ''It was in very tough shape,'' he said.
 But while the city was moving more than 200 people from Steel Point, the financing for the mall began to fall apart, and the developer pulled out. The public's taste for malls had dissipated, Mr. Lavernoich said. ''We found out that that mall plan no longer had any legs in the fall of 2000,'' he said.
 The city has since found another developer, who plans to build a mixed-use development, with housing, retail and office space.
 Mr. Lavernoich said that he hopes that construction at Steel Point will begin next year, but environmental issues could delay it further.
 Mr. Newton still has hopes for Steel Point, too, but said that new eminent domain laws should guard against failures like the mall project. Cities are too quick to condemn property, particularly in poor black neighborhoods, he said. 
 ''It's sad because companies come in with all these great plans and take housing from the neighborhood and leave it vacant,'' he said.

Forgotten Highway Projects
 Incomplete or failed eminent domain projects have scarred suburban and rural areas, too. Decades ago, transportation officials pushed a plan to build a highway from Hartford to Providence, R.I. For part of the highway -- a Route 6 bypass through Bolton, Andover and Coventry -- the state needed to demolish 30 homes and threatened to condemn them. 
 The Houles, who had built their gray four-square colonial in Andover, and their neighbors lost a legal battle to keep their houses in 1988. The Houles ended up moving to a subdivision in Hebron.
 But even after the state displaced the families, environmental officials refused to grant permits to build the highway, which came to be known as Super Six. The plan for the highway has not progressed since 1989.
 Laurel Houle, a medical technologist, said she and her husband, Mark, an accountant, would like to buy back their house, one of the five still standing. But the Transportation Department will not sell back the houses unless the project is formally abandoned.
 Meanwhile, the money set aside for the bypass has gone to other projects. The official position of the Transportation Department is that the project is in abeyance. 
 ''Route 6 is on hold, and no one knows what the future will be,'' said Michael Marzi, who represented the Transportation Department in negotiating the buyouts of the Route 6 homeowners.
 Prof. Jeremy Paul, an expert on eminent domain with the University of Connecticut School of Law, said there was little the families could do to regain their houses.
 ''Let's say they have good-faith plans to build a highway and condemn all the houses and then change their mind,'' he said. ''There is no constitutional requirement that they must turn around and sell the land back. It's very unusual for the government to sell the property back to the original owners.''
 In the meantime, the state has renovated the Houles' house, after letting it deteriorate for 16 years. In the coming months, it plans to rent it. 
 Mark Houle said the state should not have been so hasty to take land without the environmental permits.
 ''I told them up front, 'Why don't you just let me live here until you put the shovel in the ground?''' he said. ''They said, 'This is the process.' They divide and conquer. They buy a few houses at a time. Really, if everybody knew exactly what they were doing, everybody would be marching in the street. But it's just one family at a time, so they don't make the news.''
 The Super Seven bypass, another troubled project, would have connected Interstates 95 and 84 through Norwalk, Wilton, Ridgefield and Danbury. To make room for it, the Transportation Department bought or condemned about 80 houses starting in the 1970's, said Marilyn Gould, the director of the Wilton Historical Society. Transportation officials said the department had taken 1,800 acres but said they lacked an exact count of houses.
 Many of the houses that were taken were historic, with at least a dozen built in the 18th or 19th centuries. There was also a landmark furniture mill, a Girl Scout camp, a dog kennel, plumbing and antique shops and an auction barn, Ms. Gould said.
 Judy Yates, one of the homeowners in the path of Super Seven, said she remembered the anxious period before she had to leave.
 ''We all knew at one point that we were moving,'' she said. ''People would say: 'They came to us today. They came to us today.'''
 Now the Transportation Department has dropped plans to bypass Route 7, and some doubt that the bypass will ever be built because of political and environmental challenges. 
 ''Super Seven will not happen in our lifetime,'' Ms. Gould said.
 The state is now renting out 18 houses sold to the state for the Super Seven project. The Legislature in 1993 prevented the state from selling those houses, though lawmakers have discussed amending that law.
 State Senator Antoinetta Boucher, Republican of Wilton, proposed a bill in January to sell some of the property and use the money to improve the Danbury-Norwalk railway and mass transit in Fairfield County, and to widen the existing Route 7. Under her proposal, which never made it to a vote, 10 percent of the land would have become a greenway.

A Growing Call for Change
 Legislation dealing with eminent domain may get a new hearing as the Legislature deals with the fallout of the New London case. Economic development officials like Mr. Lavernoich have urged caution in changing the laws, saying the state is already strict about where and when it allows condemnation.
 But some lawmakers want to limit condemnation powers to avoid debacles like those that have occurred. Other states are considering laws that would make the government sell property back to people whose houses were purchased through eminent domain if the projects are not started, said Dana Berliner, a lawyer at the Institute for Justice, the Washington law firm that represented the homeowners in the New London case. Maine has already passed such a law, she said.
 Mr. Newton, the state senator, said that developers should face penalties when they do not come through with their projects, possibly paying a fine.
 Ms. Dillon, the state representative, said the state might need to make the entire eminent domain process more difficult. And, she added, a developer who removes affordable housing should be required to replace it.
 ''There isn't enough incentive to be creative,'' she said. ''It's often a bunch of guys looking at a piece of paper on a table, and they say, 'Let's move it over there,' and it's done. The people on the ground are kind of forgotten.''

HEADLINE: The Promise and the Pitfalls Of Health Savings Accounts

BYLINE: By MICHELLE ANDREWS

 BODY:
HEALTH savings accounts, a sort of I.R.A. for health care, let people set aside money tax-free to pay for medical expenses, both now and later. But the accounts have been controversial since their introduction in January 2004. 
 Depending on whom you ask, they are either a wonderful tool to help Americans become wiser, more price-conscious health care consumers, or just another way for employers to pass along more health care expenses to their workers. Critics also contend that the accounts are basically a tax-shelter gimmick for people who are healthy and wealthy enough to invest in them but don't have to rely on them to cover their care costs.
Most businesses have not yet offered the accounts as an option in their insurance plans. But as health costs continue to climb, some businesses and individuals are more curious to try the idea. Since they were established under the 2003 law that set up a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, more than 425,000 accounts have been established, according to a survey of administrators by Inside Consumer-Directed Care, a newsletter based in Washington, and more than 50,000 are being opened each month. 
 Nearly a year and a half into the experience, however, it is becoming clear that while the accounts may be a reasonable option for some people, there are potential drawbacks. 
 A health savings account must be paired with a health plan that meets certain criteria, including a deductible of at least $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for families. Some employers offer them, although individuals can also apply for a qualifying health plan and open one of these accounts on their own.
 Individuals can deposit money into their accounts to cover the deductible and other medical expenses, and employers can also deposit money for employees. Generally, the account balance earns interest, though some accounts allow holders to invest the money in mutual funds or other vehicles. 
 If an employee leaves his job, the money in his health savings account stays with him. And these accounts, unlike flexible spending arrangements, have no ''use it or lose it'' rule, so the funds roll over from one year to the next. An account holder pays no tax on withdrawn funds as long as they are used to pay for qualified medical expenses. If the money is used for any other expenses, it is subject to income tax and, for those under 65, to a 10 percent penalty. 
 Some people are discovering downsides to the accounts. Ric Joyner, president of the National Association of Professional Benefits Administrators, says he has received frequent calls from companies and individuals interested in setting up the accounts. But lately, Mr. Joyner, who is also president of eflexgroup.com, a benefits administration company in Madison, Wis., says he has been getting calls from people complaining that their account balances are shrinking even though they have not used the money.
 ''The money they're setting aside for health care is being eaten up by fees,'' he said. 
 Typically, the companies that administer the accounts charge a set-up fee of around $20, plus a monthly fee of about $2 or $3. They may also charge an annual fee, as well as a transaction fee every time a customer writes a check or uses the account's debit card. Some charge a fee to close an account. 
 American Health Value, an administrator of health savings accounts, charges a one-time, $15 fee to open an account, and $36 annually to administer it. There is also a $2.50 monthly service charge, which is waived if the balance is more than $2,500. 
 In the early years of an account, when the balance is typically low, fees can take a relatively big bite out of the total. A new customer with American Health Value who deposited $1,000 during the first year, for example, could expect to pay $45 in fees ($15 to set up the account and $30 for 12 months of service charges at $2.50 each). That $45 far exceeds the $7.50 that the customer would have earned in an interest-bearing account, based on the 0.75 percent now being paid on balances of up to $1,000. 
 ''Unless employers are putting a bunch of money in, I really don't see how these balances are going to get much bigger,'' said Gary Claxton, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research and education company in Menlo Park, Calif. Some companies permit an account holder to invest the balance in stocks or mutual funds, though a certain minimum balance -- say, a few thousand dollars -- may be required to do so. Such investments, of course, offer a chance for greater returns -- but also the risk of losing money. 
 There are also ceilings, indexed to inflation, on annual contributions: in 2005, it is the lower of the deductible or $2,650 for individuals and $5,250 for families. Account holders who are 55 or over can also make catch-up deposits. In 2005, the ceiling is $600; it rises gradually to $1,000 in 2009. 
 But even if you deposit the maximum amounts and don't touch the money to pay for health care before you are 65, you won't accumulate enough to cover medical expenses in old age, according to an analysis by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington. In a model created by the institute, a 55-year-old who set aside the annual maximum -- as well as catch-up contributions -- starting in 2004 would save $44,000 in 10 years, assuming a 5 percent return. If that person lived to 80 and had retiree health coverage, he would need anywhere from $137,000 to $337,000 to cover premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses, according to the institute's analysis.
 Investing in a health savings account at an earlier age won't solve the problem, said Paul Fronstin, the institute's director of health research and education and a co-author of the report. 
 ''The gap is only going to get larger,'' he said, ''because of the way that health care costs are increasing compared to how much you can put in.'' 
 THE amount saved is not the only concern. There are other wrinkles that can trip up consumers. For example, health savings accounts cannot be used with many flexible spending arrangements offered by employers. 
 In addition, some states have laws that conflict with health savings accounts. Those laws may require, for example, that certain types of medical care be covered under plans before the deductible is applied. States have until Jan. 1 to bring their laws into line with the federal law, and many have done so already. 
 Prescription drug coverage poses a problem for many people who are considering whether to open health savings accounts. Starting in January, many prescription drug expenses in qualified plans will be subject to the deductible. Now, consumers typically pay only a portion of the drug costs from the outset. 
 Mr. Joyner said the idea of paying more out of pocket for prescription drugs made his employees reject the idea of health savings accounts. ''They didn't like it that there wasn't going to be a drug card,'' he said.
 Many major insurers and banks now offer the accounts to individuals and companies. But details like fees and investment options vary widely, as do the basics of the accompanying health plans. ''The biggest drawback about H.S.A.'s is that they can be very confusing,'' said Martha Priddy Patterson, a director for Deloitte Consulting. 
 Because these accounts are still relatively new, and changing fast, the best advice may be to read the fine print before opening one. 

QUICK READ
Here are some considerations when deciding whether to open a health savings account:

Make sure your health plan is compatible with a health savings account. For example, deductibles and out-of-pocket spending limits must conform to the law.
Ask about set-up, monthly or annual fees, as well as transaction or account closing charges.
Check your investment options. Will your money be deposited into an interest-only account, or can you invest in stocks and mutual funds as well? Ask whether there are any minimum-balance requirements before you can invest.
Find out how you gain access to your money - whether through checks or a debit card, for example.
Ask about customer service. Can you call a toll-free number at any hour if you have questions? Is help available online? Are there other extras, like drug cost calculators?

HEADLINE: Nassau Hopes an Empire Zone Will Draw New Businesses, and Jobs 

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
NASSAU COUNTY is beginning a new state Empire Zone program to increase the incentives it can offer new businesses and add jobs to existing businesses. 
 Suffolk County already has Empire Zones in the towns of Islip and Brookhaven, and the county and the town of Riverhead jointly run a third.
The zones offer a host of state tax credits and benefits. There are 69 other Empire Zones in the state, and earlier this year the State Legislature voted to create Empire Zones in Nassau and 10 other counties and in Chinatown in Manhattan. 
 But some people have questions about the companies on the receiving end of this largesse. ''Do they really fulfill their end of the bargain and produce more jobs?'' said Steve Levy, Suffolk's county executive. ''We've been trying to get some oversight regarding whether these firms actually live up to their promises. They get discounts on interest rates and sometimes on property and sales taxes, and I'm not convinced that there is a thorough monitoring after the fact.'' 
 Mr. Levy said he did not know of any Long Island companies that had not fulfilled their commitments, but he said he had heard ''anecdotal stories of some companies that get the benefits and then move out of the Island or move a good part of their business'' when the incentives end.
 Mr. Levy said he was pushing for state legislation that would place a lien on such businesses.
 ''There should be fines if these companies are deliberately not fulfilling their obligations,'' he said. ''By putting a lien on the property, the county and state could recoup some of the investment upon the sale of the assets.''
 But Bruce Ferguson, the administrative director of Suffolk's Industrial Development Agency, which provides financial incentives to encourage businesses to move to or expand in the county, questioned the wisdom of such a law.
 ''I don't see how you can penalize a company if you get a good 8- or 10-year run out of it,'' he said. ''It's like found money. I've been doing this over 20 years, and I can't think of one company that intentionally took benefits with the idea of packing up and leaving.
 ''If you put this kind of punitive language in your agreement, I can't think of any business person who would be willing to accept it,'' he said. ''If a company went to Pennsylvania or New Jersey, it would not have that language, and it may want to think twice about moving here. It's hard to imagine a company making millions of an investment in one location and then packing up and leaving in a couple of years.''
 Jim Morgo, the commissioner of the Suffolk County Department of Economic Development and Workforce Housing, said he had heard of companies upstate doing just that. He said that imposing liens was just one idea under consideration. Another proposal would require companies to put money into an escrow account that would be forfeited if they left. But he added that such penalties should be handled gingerly.
 ''We don't want to create a disincentive for them coming here,'' he said. ''We want to make sure they create the jobs, make the investment and stay a reasonable period of time. What if they stayed 10 years? It's a delicate balance, especially when you consider the high cost of doing business on Long Island.''
 Michael T. Schaffield, the executive director of Nassau County's Office of Economic Development, said his main focus was completing the application for the Empire Zone by the Sept. 29 deadline. Although the Legislature authorized Nassau to establish such a zone, it directed that the 12 new zones be phased in over a four-year period, three each year, beginning in 2006. Mr. Schaffield said that Nassau hoped to persuade the state to allow it to create its zone next year.
 But he said the idea of imposing penalties on companies that don't live up to their agreement was ''something that should be kept in mind.''
 ''Whether it is practical to do remains to be seen,'' he said. ''If it can be done, it would be worthwhile to try.''
 Although there are no such penalties in the Empire Zone program, they are built into assistance contracts provided by county and municipal industrial development agencies and by the Empire State Development Corporation, the state economic development authority.
 ''The I.D.A. can recapture benefits if a company leaves before the time we required them to stay or before they added the jobs'' that were promised, said Cara A. Longworth, executive director of Glen Cove's Industrial Development Agency. She said she favored penalties for companies that failed to honor their Empire Zone commitments ''as a way to make sure they did not abuse the system.''
 Grants made to companies by the Empire State Development Corporation contain a clause that allows the state to recoup at least part of the grant.
 ''We specify that employment must take place at the project location, and if they move, it would trigger an employment default and a potential recapture per the terms of the relevant contract,'' a spokesman for the agency said. ''The case would then be referred to the workout committee, which determines responses to defaults on a case-by-case basis, using guidelines.''
 In the last 10 years, the corporation has given assistance to 933 projects on Long Island, handing out $61 million in grants and approving $34 million in low-interest loans for construction, renovations and employee training.
 Last year, 200 companies around the state failed to meet obligations as set forth by their grants, the spokesman said, and 170 had done so this year. The largest such grant was for $400,000; it was reclaimed last year in Rochester. 
 Mr. Schaffield, who was hired earlier this year by Nassau County to bring in more jobs, said the Empire Zone added ''to the toolbox of things that are available'' to attract businesses. He said that for too long ''nobody really paid much attention to what was happening to the economy of Nassau County because for many years it just grew and grew.''
 ''But some years ago -- 12 or 15 years ago -- it started flattening out, and basically we have had no growth,'' he said. ''So the idea now is to see what can be done on a unified and focused basis to highlight areas of attraction and expansion.'' 
 Mr. Schaffield said that while reviewing programs to help businesses expand or relocate to the county, ''it dawned on us that there were gaps in the programs that needed to be expanded to reach other businesses.''
 He said the Empire Zone would help fill some of those gaps. ''A number of businesses don't have the size to come up to what would be practical'' for Industrial Development Agency financing, he said. 
 He explained that, because of fees and underwriting costs, it would be financially unfeasible for a company to ask the agency to issue tax-exempt bonds to finance a project unless it needed at least $1 million. That is just one of the reasons, Mr. Schaffield said, to convince the state that Nassau's Empire Zone should begin next year. 
 The waterfront in Glen Cove is one of the places the Empire Zone would prove helpful, Mr. Schaffield said. Ms. Longworth, the Glen Cove Industrial Development Agency executive, said her office could offer sales tax exemptions and real estate tax abatements to businesses that move to the waterfront, where industrial contamination is being cleaned up in stages.
 But the Empire Zone, she said, could offer important additional inducements: reducing a company's electric bill by up to 40 percent and its natural gas bill by up to 15 percent.
 ''That would be a huge benefit because that is something we can't offer,'' she said. ''The price of energy is what really discourages a lot of industry in the area.''

HEADLINE: A Rat Visits the Hamptons On Business, Not Pleasure

BYLINE: By JULIA C. MEAD

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON 

 BODY:
AS perhaps most New Yorkers know, a certain ubiquitous 15-foot inflatable rat typically marks the spot where union members gather to chant, wave picket signs and tell the world that they're angry and they're not going to take it anymore. This time, however, the rat was inflated not on a busy city street but on a back road in what seemed, by comparison, the middle of nowhere.
 A woman shouting into a megaphone next to a huge rat is hardly a common sight in the Hamptons. In fact, this was the first time that the famous rat -- borrowed from a musicians' union by the Writers Guild of America East -- had appeared so far east of Manhattan. 
The writers walked off a children's television program, ''It's a Big, Big World,'' which is in production in a hangarlike studio on Industrial Road, far from any main route. Off to one side was an evangelical church housed in a former factory. At the far end of the road was a drug rehabilitation center.
 The few cars that did pass by -- one or two every 15 minutes -- slowed to a crawl, some drivers stopping to ask questions but most just looking perplexed. 
 On Monday, the writers guild president, the Tony-winning playwright Warren Leight, along with some sympathetic Teamsters and representatives of the Long Island Federation of Labor, increased the number of pickets to 23. By Tuesday afternoon, fewer than 10 were still behind the barricades.
 The program's creator, Mitchell Kriegman, who lives nearby in Water Mill, has a $10 million contract with PBS and Sony for 40 episodes of ''It's a Big, Big World.'' Using a combination of live-action puppets and computer animation, the program will teach science lessons using a group of animals living in a tree. It was scheduled to go on the air in January.
 But the union placed the production company on its strike list on July 14, asserting that Mr. Kriegman had refused to budge from an offer of one-third the minimum union wage.
 What really aggravated the writers, union members said, was that Mr. Kriegman, a former head writer for ''Rugrats'' and a writer for ''Saturday Night Live,'' has belonged to the union for more than 25 years.
 Mr. Kriegman, who has produced popular programs like ''Bear in the Big Blue House'' and ''The Book of Pooh,'' said the union's demands were unreasonable and would have resulted in wages higher than those that ''Sesame Street'' writers earn. He said that the economy has left many union writers out of work for more than two years and that he was offering a fair package under the circumstances.
 ''This is a case of the union being unwilling to extend to an independent company the same agreement it's given to big corporations,'' he said. ''It's a contrivance, a fabrication.''
 While Mr. Kriegman insisted he was continuing to negotiate, the pickets said that their resolve was bolstered when two deliverymen refused to cross their picket line to enter the studio parking lot. The pickets said they would return every day until Mr. Kriegman increased his offer.
 ''We're going to camp out here if we have to,'' said one writer, Raye Lankford.

HEADLINE: They're Hungry and Thriving Where They Don't Belong 

BYLINE: By MORGAN LYLE

 BODY:
IT took seven years to put the Paumanok wetland in Huntington into public hands so that it could serve as an environmental classroom for students at Walt Whitman High School next door.
 But the wooded, marshy 10.6-acre tract may have escaped development only to face a new threat -- infestation by a European strain of reed, called phragmites, that could wipe out the wetland's native plants and ruin it as a habitat for waterfowl.
''It looks to me like it's threatening to destroy this wetland that we worked so hard to preserve,'' said William T. Walter, a leader in the preservation effort that ended this spring when Huntington and Suffolk County jointly bought the property from a developer.
 A 38-acre fishing lake along the Peconic River is also in jeopardy. It is so choked with a runaway aquarium plant called cabomba weed that the site's owner, the Peconic River Sportsman's Club, has had to buy a big floating weed harvester, cutting up to six feet deep, and has run it every day all summer for six years to keep part of the lake open for fishing. 
 ''There is absolutely no open water,'' said John H. Hall, the club president. ''The harvester is the only way we can stay ahead of it. We have spent over $100,000 just trying to control it, and we're losing the battle.''
 The plight of the wetland and the fishing lake are among hundreds of examples of damage caused by invasive species of plants, insects, animals and diseases on Long Island and across the state. Invasive plants and bacteria, for example, can destroy crops and devastate trees. Invasive fish can threaten native fish and amphibians. Ailments like chronic wasting disease can wipe out deer herds.
 The problems have become so serious that the state Legislature created a task force last year to recommend ways of dealing with it.
 The task force will advise the Legislature in November on writing a plan for dealing with invasive species, provide money to put the plan into action and set up a research center, according to the draft report of the task force. The report makes 14 recommendations in all and is available for public review from the Department of Environmental Conservation, at www.dec.state.ny.us. The agency will accept public comment on the report through Sept. 14.
 ''The scope of the problem is huge,'' State Senator Carl Marcellino, Republican of Syosset, the chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee, said at a hearing on invasive species earlier this month. ''This is a first step, an opening gambit to get a handle on the problem.''
 Invasive species -- defined as non-native species that cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health -- cause damages and losses totaling $138 billion a year in the United States, according to a 1999 Cornell University study. The study did not have a damage estimate for New York.
 Close to half of the 958 plants and animals listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act when the study was written were ''at risk primarily because of nonindigenous species.'' The study was conducted by faculty members from Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
 The long list of unwelcome immigrants includes disease-spreading black and Norway rats; water chestnut, which can take over bodies of water; chestnut blight, which damages trees; and zebra mussels, which clog intake pipes.
 The arrival of Asian long-horned beetles in 1996 caused thousands of prized shade trees in and around New York City to be felled. Purple loosestrife overtakes a million acres a year nationwide, some of them in central New York. 
 The problems are hardly new. Centuries before Europeans arrived in North America, invasive species probably came to the continent along with maize from Central Asia. But the rate of invasions has increased rapidly in the last half-century, the Cornell study says.
 In fact, the Invasive Species Task Force's draft report says that at least seven new invaders have arrived in New York since the task force first met in April 2004: Swede midge, which it said threatens broccoli and cabbage crops; the European wood wasp, which can damage trees; the European crane fly, which can damage lawns; Southern bacterial wilt from Africa, which is said to threaten tomato, potato, eggplant and pepper crops; two from China -- the brown fir long-horned beetle, another tree pest, and the northern snakehead fish, which preys upon native fish; and one from the American West -- chronic wasting disease, a neurological disorder found in deer in Oneida County in central New York this year.
 So far, invasive species have been battled case by case, often by nongovernmental groups. The Nature Conservancy, for example, set up a network of public officials and private environmentalists called the Long Island Weed Management Area in 2002 to deal with threats like phragmites, the reed that is poised to infest the Paumanok wetland. Sea Grant, a joint project of Cornell and the state, manages a database that tracks nuisance fish and other aquatic invaders.
 Another example is the work of Bernd Blossey, an associate professor of natural resources at Cornell, who has found insects that eat purple loosestrife and deployed them in several locations around the country.
 Professor Blossey, a contributor to the task force's draft report, said he hopes the state government heeds its call for an organized and well-financed attack on invasive species.
 ''New York is a gateway to much of the continent,'' Professor Blossey said. ''It's a major point or node where all the travel comes together from all over the world. So there's a large role for New York and New York City to play here, but up to now nothing coordinated has happened.''
 Professor Blossey is now working on biological control of phragmites, by finding an insect that will eat them. ''I would love to create a new invasive species that runs wild through phragmites and doesn't eat anything else,'' he said. 
 Such a countermeasure could prevent the infestation at the Paumanok wetland, although Mr. Walter raised the possibility of leaving a small, controlled stand of phragmites in place for educational value.
 The Peconic River Sportsman's Club, meanwhile, is pretty much on its own in dealing with the cabomba weed, which it has battled for a decade. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the pet-supply industry plan an education campaign called Habitattitude to keep aquarium fish and plants, like cabomba weed, out of public waters.
 But as a candidate for eradication, the cabomba weed that is fouling Peconic anglers' hooks is ''lower down on the totem pole, because it's well established,'' said Steven E. Clemants, vice president for science at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and a contributor to the task force. 
 The sportsmen's club is applying for permission from the Department of Environmental Conservation to kill cabomba weed with Sonar, a herbicide, said Mr. Hall, the president. Meantime, he said, the club will run the harvester on the pond 12 hours a day until the frosts of autumn.

HEADLINE: Terry Gilliam's Feel-Good Endings

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
TERRY GILLIAM filmed his newest movie, ''Tideland,'' in Saskatchewan last fall, racing to complete the location shots before winter set in. The Mitch Cullin novel on which the film is based is mostly set in West Texas, but Mr. Gilliam had substituted the Canadian prairie instead. The evening after he wrapped, it started to snow, and the cast, crew and director all saw this as an omen.
 If this had been a Gilliam production beset by the kind of bad fortune that has sometimes clung to his movies, the snow would have blown in much sooner, five or six feet of it; the cameras would have frozen, turning the fingers of the cinematographer, Nicola Pecorini, black with frostbite; the stars would have been evacuated by chopper -- or rather, the budget having most likely run out, by dog sled.
''Tideland'' went on to be finished on schedule, moreover, and will have its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival next month. Meanwhile, the director has another movie, ''The Brothers Grimm,'' starring Matt Damon (with 19th-century bad hair) and Heath Ledger, opening in this country next week after more than a year of disputes and postponements. Together, the two films mark the end of the longest dry spell in Mr. Gilliam's 31-year career. 
 In the years since he left the Monty Python troupe, Mr. Gilliam has acquired a reputation for being both a visionary and -- in Hollywood it amounts to the same thing -- a bit of a madman, and has therefore done more than his share of stints in development hell. Unless you count his starring role in Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe's 2002 documentary ''Lost in La Mancha,'' he has been absent from the screen since 1998, when his ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' came out. And the documentary, about the Job-like streak of bad luck Mr. Gilliam endured while trying to work on a film version of ''Don Quixote,'' almost makes you wonder why he ever wanted to make a movie again.
 Mr. Gilliam's critics believe that he brings some of his bad luck upon himself -- by wishfully imagining that he can make movies for less than they cost and by seldom holding his tongue -- and there is probably something to this. Mr. Gilliam admits to being combative, and he can be a little childish. (His production company is called Poo Poo Pictures.) And he takes an even dimmer view of Hollywood than Hollywood takes of him. 
 ''It's an abominable place,'' he said over lunch recently in London, where he lives with his wife and three children. ''If there was an Old Testamental God, he would do his job and wipe the place out. The only bad thing is that some really good restaurants would go up as well.'' 
 Chortling and warming to the theme, he added: ''Hollywood dominates the world so much it's scary. And it's just a village with a few people. It's very small and very provincial.'' He threw in some obscene imagery for good measure. ''And there's always this accepted knowledge: 'Oh, we can't make a movie with him, because his last movie tanked.' There's no long-term plan or view -- nothing.'' He sighed, then added: ''But I need their money.''
 Mr. Gilliam's first brush with Hollywood came in 1985, with the dystopian fantasy ''Brazil,'' which Sidney Sheinberg, then the head of Universal, insisted was too long. Gilliam refused to cut it and after months of stalemate purchased an advertisement in Variety that said, ''Dear Sid Sheinberg, When are you going to release my movie, Brazil?''
 Mr. Gilliam's next picture, ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,'' cost $40 million. By current standards, that seems like peanuts. But it was a lot more than the $24 million that he and his producer had convinced themselves it would cost. They wound up blowing their budget in the first six weeks. His subsequent movies, Mr. Gilliam likes to point out, all came in on budget, and ''The Fisher King'' and ''Twelve Monkeys'' both made money. ''But it's all perception,'' he said last fall. ''Once you become the rebel, the enfant terrible, the troublemaker, it just sticks.'' 
 Over the course of a couple of days on the ''Tideland'' set last fall (after the shooting had moved to an indoor sound stage in Regina), Mr. Gilliam the rebel, the enfant terrible, the troublemaker was almost nowhere in evidence. He is 64, though you would never know it except when he's tired and slumps into a bent-over old man's walk. He wears cargo pants, bowling shoes, and Hawaiian shirts, and perhaps in homage to the 60's, when he was a pioneer longhair, he has a narrow little plait that dangles like a rat tail down the back of his neck. During shooting he was all business, chomping cinnamon-flavored gum as he hunched over a video monitor, but between takes he bounded around the set, greeting and joking with the crew and occasionally even asking for advice. Morale was high, the shooting was going well. ''The world would be a better place if it was directed by Terry Gilliam,'' a crew member said to me in complete sincerity. 
 ''Tideland'' combines elements of ''Psycho,'' ''Lolita,'' ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and Faulkner's ''Rose for Emily'' to tell the story of a little girl who takes refuge from her dope-addict father in a world of imaginary companions, and who has a sexual relationship of sorts with an older retarded man. 
 The movie has a tiny cast featuring Jeff Bridges and an almost freakishly talented 10-year-old Canadian actress named Jodelle Ferland, who likes to boast that she has already appeared in more movies and television shows -- 25 by her count -- than Terry Gilliam has ever made. The production had an almost laughably small budget and was reduced to economies like requiring the first and second units to share a single set of camera lenses. Mr. Gilliam told me that he found the smallness of the production liberating in a way, because it meant no one from a studio was looking over his shoulder, but it was clear that he was also frustrated at times. 
 One morning the script called for a shot in which the camera pulled back from a close-up of a menacing doll's head, and then lifted up, turning as it went, to take in an entire room. It would have been a simple shot if the camera had been equipped with a motorized remote-control arm, but there wasn't enough in the budget for that, and so the operator had to lift and turn the camera manually. He tried it several times, and each time Mr. Gilliam, watching on the monitor, detected either a pause or a lurch in the motion. ''It's jerky, jerky, jerky,'' he said, a little impatiently. ''Try it again.'' Finally, after the fifth attempt, he stood up and said: ''Time to get out of this. That's the best we're going to do, I guess. We have to move on.''
 Later, in a little room that had been set aside as his office and hideout, he said: ''My problem is I worry too much sometimes about the time things are taking. And I keep pushing to get it done. So I say, O.K., we'll live with that, and keep moving forward. And it's always been like that, and I hate it. I hate being the one that's worried about the time.''
 I said that wasn't his reputation.
 He looked at me and said, ''My reputation has nothing to do with me.''
 What Mr. Gilliam wouldn't talk about then, because he was legally obliged not to, was that the whole time he was working on ''Tideland,'' he was also engaged in an epic stare-down with Bob Weinstein, head of Dimension Films, over the final shape of ''The Brothers Grimm,'' which at that point had been finished for months. ''Usually my battles are when I finish a film, but this one got off to some very bad beginnings,'' he said later, and he explained that Dimension took ''The Brothers Grimm'' over from MGM when the production was already on location in Prague. Before shooting began, Mr. Weinstein insisted that Samantha Morton be replaced as the female lead (the part eventually went to Lena Headey), and not long afterward he replaced the director of photography, Nicola Pecorini, with whom Mr. Gilliam has had a long and trusting relationship.
 ''He just had a different view of the film,'' Mr. Gilliam said of Mr. Weinstein. And by the time the movie was completed, ''the division was so extreme we're talking about two different films.''
 ''The powers that be kept talking about 'another film,' and I said, 'I don't think there is another film,''' he explained. He declined to mention any specifics, except to remark that at one point his movie had been unfavorably compared with ''Spy Kids.''
 With no resolution in sight, Mr. Gilliam and Dimension agreed, in effect, that each side would temporarily walk away from the film and see if things didn't cool down.
 ''It happens with every film,'' he explained to me recently. ''There comes a part where the money and the creative elements all come crashing together. Everybody's under a lot of pressure, and everybody is panicking about what works and what doesn't. And the studios and the money always have one perspective and the creative people have another one, and usually what happens is a lot of compromises get made. I decided not to. I walked off and did 'Tideland' and came back six months later.''
 It seems to have worked: as a result of the hiatus, he says, he was able to correct some mistakes he might not have seen otherwise. ''I always dreamed of being able to finish a film, walk away from it, and then come back a few months later,'' he said, ''and this time the circumstances sort of allowed it to happen.''
 On the ''Tideland'' set he spent a certain amount of time both bonding with and coaching young Jodelle, not that she needed much coaching. ''Look at that,'' he said to me once when we were looking at a close-up on the monitor. ''She can even do eye-acting -- that's something you can't teach.'' 
 He also spent a surprising amount of time housekeeping -- or, rather, un-housekeeping. Most of ''Tideland'' takes place inside a long-abandoned farmhouse, and the set was a miracle of grunginess and dilapidation in which cobwebs had been applied, brand new walls had been distressed to look old and water-stained, and ancient household implements had been knocked around until they looked even older. But as the camera tracked around and the crew moved props in and out, they accidentally created little pathways of relative orderliness, and Mr. Gilliam several times called for more dust. 
 Mr. Gilliam professes to be quite satisfied with ''Tideland,'' though he expects it to get mixed reviews. ''Deservedly so,'' he said recently, ''because it pushes a lot of weird buttons. My wife says it's shocking because it's so innocent, and I think it may be a kind of litmus test for people.'' 
 About ''The Brothers Grimm,'' he said that he was more uncertain, and that he still didn't have full perspective on the movie because the process of making it had been so difficult and the release date had been shifted around so. Along the way, though, his differences with Bob Weinstein -- and with his brother, Harvey, who runs Miramax -- had almost miraculously resolved themselves. ''I actually think we made it better without succumbing to other people's idea about what would make it better,'' he said, adding, with just a touch or irony: ''Everybody's happy now. We're a big happy family.'' 
 He also said: ''There's a good side and a bad side about working with the Weinsteins. They're like old -fashioned studio heads, not bureaucrats.'' And, he added: ''I told Harvey I really admire what they do. I like watching them work -- from a long distance away.''
 When I asked Bob Weinstein about the disagreements between him and Mr. Gilliam -- some of them previously reported in the press -- he denied that there were any and said: ''What's in the press isn't worth commenting on. We had a great relationship with Terry. It was standard operating procedure. He made a great movie, and now we're going to market it in a way that's true to what it is -- a great story.''

HEADLINE: A Neighborhood In North Carolina Is Put Up for Sale

BYLINE: By MICHELLE CROUCH

DATELINE: Charlotte, N.C. 

 BODY:
IN many parts of the country, developers are buying up older homes, tearing them down and building million-dollar mansions in their place. 
 Now, 22 homeowners here are taking matters into their own hands with an unusual marketing proposal.
They've put their entire neighborhood up for sale.
 Homeowners in Sherbrooke, a neighborhood about six miles from downtown, are betting that a developer will pay a premium for 15 acres of prime real estate under their 1950's ranch houses. Their asking price: about $700,000 a lot, triple the individual value of most of their homes. 
 More than 20 developers have been in touch since the owners advertised their proposal in the local paper in the spring. Several developers have told the neighborhood they planned to put together proposals. 
 The homeowners aren't the first to realize that their lots are worth more together than separately. Neighborhoods in urban areas like Orange County, Calif., Washington and Chicago have sold collectively to home builders, pocketing thousands more than they would have individually. 
 But analysts who track teardowns said it's still rare for a neighborhood to initiate the idea.
 ''It makes sense from an economic point of view, but it's a tricky thing to organize,'' said John K. McIlwain, senior fellow for housing at the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit research center in Washington. 
 Sherbrooke is a subdivision of three-bedroom, two-bath ranch homes. Most were built in the 1950's on what was then a dirt road surrounded by cow pastures and cotton fields. 
 In 1970, the city's first suburban mall opened on a nearby farm, attracting offices, restaurants and a flood of homes. Over the years, SouthPark Mall grew into the city's toniest fashion destination, with dozens of high-end specialty stores. The area around it soon became one of the city's most desirable -- and expensive -- places to live.
 Luxury condominiums and million-dollar homes sprouted on open lots. As land became harder to find, developers started tearing down some of the original homes.
 It wasn't long before Sherbrooke residents felt the pressure. Their large, wooded lots made their land especially valuable.
 Several months ago, three homeowners signed contracts with a developer who planned to build high-rise condominiums, sparking concerns that the neighborhood would lose its character and quiet charm. 
 The project died when the homeowners failed to persuade everyone else to change the covenants to allow multistory buildings. But it got neighbors thinking.
 ''We've seen so much destruction and teardowns of dated homes,'' said Jim Rogers, a real estate broker who lives in the neighborhood and who helped organize the effort. ''We just don't fit in anymore.''
 Along with Keith Fackrell, president of the neighborhood association, he researched the price of land within a mile of the neighborhood and found it was selling for $400,000 to $900,000 an acre, with larger tracts going for more. Because each lot in their neighborhood was significantly larger than any other parcel sold, they decided they could ask about $1 million an acre, knowing they would probably end up getting less.
 Their next challenge was persuading the rest of the neighborhood to go along. While some homeowners had lived there for years and were ready to downsize, others were young families who had recently moved in. The best way to gain a consensus, they decided, was to agree that everyone would get the same amount in the sale, even though some lots were larger and some homes were in better condition than others. 
 Mr. Fackrell and Mr. Rogers called a meeting and pitched the idea. If they didn't sell en masse, they told their neighbors, a developer would likely pick them off one by one, and they would have little control over what went up next door.
 Still, some neighbors were initially reluctant. 
 ''Then we told them the asking price,'' Mr. Rogers recalled. ''One man said he could be in a hotel by Saturday.'' 
 As traffic has worsened and commutes have lengthened, Charlotte builders -- like those in Chicago, Washington and New York -- are trying to meet the demand for newer houses close to town. 
 While there are plenty of one-house-at-a-time teardowns, developers increasingly are looking for larger parcels where they can build planned communities. But getting each homeowner to agree can take years, and one dissenter can kill a deal.
 Sherbrooke's residents have signed legal contracts agreeing to sell at a minimum price, which they declined to name. ''These folks are saving the developer a step,'' said Dan K. Cottingham, a partner with residential real estate firm Cottingham-Chalk & Associates. 
 Todd Harrison, land acquisition manager for Centex Homes in Charlotte, said the site is too small for his company but would be attractive to a builder of small custom homes or condominiums. 
 A developer could make an easy profit there, he said, if the city agreed to change the zoning to allow condominiums or a mix of town homes and single-family homes. Otherwise, under the current zoning, a developer would need to build at least 50 homes priced at about $1 million apiece to make it worthwhile, he said. That would be harder, he said, but not impossible. 
 At least one other neighborhood nationwide has successfully pulled off a joint sale originated by the homeowners and not by a developer. Poplar Terrace, a neighborhood of Vienna, Va., formed a real estate collective several years ago. Most of the 70 homeowners in the community agreed to sell to Centex Homes, which plans to build 500 to 1,000 condos and town homes. 
 ''The people who haven't signed are on the edges of the development and we've been able to work around them,'' said Stephen Fritz, vice president for operations at Centex in Washington. 
 In Charlotte, Sherbrooke homeowners say it could be months before they strike a deal, as developers study the numbers, seek financing and talk to city officials about a possible rezoning. 
 Some homeowners, like Louise Nezelek, say they will win no matter what the outcome. Mrs. Nezelek and her husband, Ed, fell in love with their three-bedroom, two-bathroom home the minute they walked in two years ago. She especially enjoys drinking coffee on her porch, ''where it doesn't even feel like you're in the city,'' and picking blueberries, figs and asparagus on her three-quarter-acre lot.
 But she said she knew it would be foolish to say no to the deal if she can get three times the market value of her home. She would be able to find something similar, or better, nearby. ''If something works out, we'll go along,'' Mrs. Nezelek said. ''But to tell you the truth, I don't really want to move. I'm happy here.''
 Next week: Another tactic for homeowners who want to sell to developers.

HEADLINE: Pop Art That's a Bit Like 'South Park' 

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
ORLANDO REYES may spend more time administrating than making art these days, but that's the price you pay for operating a successful artist-run gallery in Jersey City. Mr. Reyes, and Mario Monroy, his collaborator in the venture, have gradually built one of the funkiest galleries in the state, with a roster of out-there exhibitions by young artists.
 The openings are something, too, and have been known to get a tad out of hand: they've already had one arrest. ''A case of mistaken identity,'' Mr. Reyes explained. 
Gallery 58, a former glass factory in a quiet north corner of Jersey City, in a largely Latino neighborhood, consists of a street-front gallery and back-room project space. The street-front space is much like your standard white-box gallery, while the back room, off the kitchen area, and a nearby bedroom, where Mr. Monroy evidently sleeps, are like a large theatrical stage. The two owners use it for photographic and television-commercial shooting to help pay the rent and keep the gallery open.
 The front gallery, on Coles Street near Las Piedras, one of Jersey City's last members-only social clubs, has been taken over by Dylan Egon and Scott Sjobakken, a pair of Jersey City artists who are keeping Pop Art alive. This is their second appearance with Gallery 58; each of them has had separate shows here over the last couple of years. Mr. Reyes decided to give the pair a focused, joint exhibition after spotting some similarities in theme, subject matter and style running through their work.
 The pairing feels right, for both artists reflect subtly on American values, cultural power and the military campaigns in which the United States is entangled. Mr. Sjobakken's paintings blur the line between entertainment and war, depicting popular action figures, cartoon characters, dolls and corporate mascots embroiled in violent conflicts of one kind or another. The use of toys makes it all seem a bit unreal, like a video game, while at the same time hinting at an economic motive for some of these conflicts. 
 Mr. Egon claims similar ground, making quizzical assemblages combining painted backgrounds (dollar bills, Mickey Mouse, Popeye and other cartoon characters) with replica guns, bullets (with the gunpowder removed), toy cars, mousetraps and black-and-white cutout pictures of call girls from the pages of newspapers, among other things. These casual setups, strewn with weird stuff, are sites of cultural compression, fetishization and wonder. You start to think: Is this who we are? If so, it is cringingly off.
 Message-based art can sometimes feel like a slap in the face -- it is easy to be sensational, even accusatory. These artists do it in more subtle ways, using popular and cartoon imagery to draw you into a glossy world where, you quickly realize, everything isn't quite right. The cartoon series ''South Park'' uses the same technique, with its warped characters and acid irony. Mr. Egon and Mr. Sjobakken's work is more out-there, and brash, and thus somewhat brave in a time of enveloping conservatism.
 Dylan Egon/Scott Sjobakken,'' Gallery 58, 58 Coles Street, Jersey City, through Sept. 1. Information: (917) 349-1693 or www.fifty8.com.

HEADLINE: Mom and Pop Hold Sway At the Shore

BYLINE: By SUSAN WARNER

DATELINE: STONE HARBOR 

 BODY:
THE shopping district in this Shore town stands out for what it is missing. Rather than navigating temperature-controlled aisles under hazy skylights, shoppers meander along a tree-lined street where it is possible to see the setting sun. Rather than a Starbucks, there is Coffee Talk. And instead of uniform signs for the Gap and Wal-Mart there are one-of-a-kind ones above the henna tattoo parlor, Neptune Gifts and the Free Shop boutique.
 In fact, in a state known for its end-to-end malls and retail strips, there is no sign within miles of the ubiquitous stores that usually fill them.
''It is kind of surprising that there are no chains,'' said Beth Greenblatt, 27, a shopper from Miami in town to visit her parents at their summer home here. ''But that's why I come here -- to get away from all that.'' 
 This town and others like it have become a respite from the national and international retail chain stores that are difficult to avoid. With a few exceptions, the towns dotting the barrier islands are throwbacks to an era of independent, mom-and-pop shops in an age of big-box stores.
 While the national retail chains have managed to set down roots along many shorefront and island towns, like Newport, R.I., and Hilton Head, S.C., Jersey Shore towns from Cape May all the way up to Long Beach Island have remained impenetrable. Even as national chains have like Home Depot opened nearby, along Route 9, Cape May and barrier-island towns have managed to retain their independent businesses, partly because of circumstance, and partly by design.
 For many visitors to the Shore, the type of aimless recreational shopping that the low-slung shops in these towns inspire is as important to a vacation as sand castles and sunscreen. And while seasonal tourists like Ms. Greenblatt are drawn to Shore towns for their character, it is the tourists who also help keep the large chain stores at bay. 
 It is not that they aren't spending money. A fifth of the $32.3 billion that tourists in the state spent last year went to shopping, according to an analysis by Global Insights, a Pennsylvania economic-analysis firm, and 23 percent was spent on food. The problem is, the tourists are part-time residents. As a result, many large-scale retail chains prefer malls, or strip centers in urban and suburban areas -- which have a year-round population to draw from -- to the seasonal shore towns, whose population scatters by the time the first frost appears. 
 ''A lot of the chains wouldn't mind having places at the Jersey Shore, but it becomes difficult to justify the expense when it's really just a four-month season,'' said Marshall Cohen, chief analyst for the NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y., that serves as a consultant for PacSun, Starbucks and other large retail chains. ''These places just don't generate the demographics that hit the radar screen as an opportunity for large retailers.''
 The independent stores that can't be found elsewhere, small towns have realized, are part of the allure for tourists. It is not uncommon for local planning and zoning boards to oppose large retail chains when they show interest in a beach town, Mr. Cohen said. ''What's happened on the Jersey Shore, much like the old Hamptons, is that the towns are very much into preserving a small-town flavor,'' he said. ''They work very hard at keeping out the commercialization to retain that specialized mom-and-pop shop in the community. It keeps them from becoming the everyday mall environment.'' Wawa, a Pennsylvania convenience-store chain, has met opposition in Shore towns wary that its stores will bring an influx of noisy traffic at off hours. To appease local zoning and planning boards, the chain has had to bend some of its operational rules and in some cases has built stores that fit the Shore locale. In Wildwood, Wawa opened a do-wop style store to fit into the city's 1950's look, and in Cape May it built a Victorian-inspired outlet, said Harry McHugh, vice president for store operations for the chain. But the chain is the sole major retailer that has penetrated the island with more than a few token stores. 
 The stores that have prevailed instead are stores like Hoy's Five & Ten, a local chain that has four outlets on the Shore, one of them on the blocklong retail strip here. It caters to the seasonal visitor who may have left a few things at home; dish towels, dental floss, socks, Brillo, bleach and vinyl pillow protectors make up much of their inventory. But it also specializes in Shore kitsch, selling Boogie boards, board games, ceramic lighthouses, live hermit crabs and much more. 
 At Hoy's many customers dart in and out for necessities, but others linger over items like this year's hot seller, the spiky, squishy Puffer Ball, or a fuzzy red, white and blue Viking hat.
 ''We look for the zany,'' said David Hoy, the grandson of the store's founder, who now runs the local chain. ''They don't necessarily have to buy it. But if they try it on and laugh and have a good time they'll come back.''
 The chain, which was started in 1935 in New Castle, Del., at one time had 18 stores from Delaware to the Jersey Shore before Kmart and Caldor happened. 
 ''Like Woolworth's, all the other stores succumbed except the ones along the Shore,'' Mr. Hoy said. ''That's where we had the niche marketing, and discounters were not interested in coming to an area where there was no real population nine months of the year.'' 
 The small stores and local chains along the Shore, including Hoy's, B&B Department Stores and Atlantic Books, are nimble enough to weather the slim profit margins that come during those lean winter months, when nationwide retailers who have shareholders to answer to are expecting a sizable bump in sales because of the holidays. 
 ''We can't compete against Wal-Mart and Kmart on the mainland, but here, we can compete,'' said Charles Tier, a partner in the local company that owns the Hand's variety stores on Long Beach Island and Della's variety stores in Cape May. After the summer season, he said, ''the rest of the time everybody struggles at the Shore.'' 
 Many scale down their staff, their hours, or both, during the off-season. 
 Mark Simon, owner of Atlantic Book Shops, with seven stores on the Jersey Shore, cuts his store hours in the winter back to five or six hours a day, five days a week, from at least 13 hours a day, seven days a week. Often, only the store manager stays on all year. On winter days, managers clean the stores or unpack inventory.
 ''They get health care and that's what they work for,'' Mr. Simon said. ''There are days that customers are few and far between.''
 At the seven Uncle Bill's Pancake House restaurants on the Shore, students and teachers make up a significant share of the summer staff, according to Casey O'Hara, whose grandmother founded the business in 1962. Mr. O'Hara, who manages the Uncle Bill's restaurant here and in Avalon, said about half the staff are surfers. 
 At the same time, local shops and chains do not have the same time constraints as the large national chains. ''We aren't at the mercy of retail timing that dictates coats have to take over the entire floor by August,'' said Jeff Davidson, president of B&B Department Stores, a family-owned clothing retailer with stores in Ocean City, Beach Haven, Ship Bottom, Manahawkin, Seaside Park and Lavallette. ''We're smaller, we're more flexible and we adapt much better.''
 Shore retailers must still vie with the discount stores of the world that drove some local chains, like Hoy's, to close their stores that were off the islands.
 ''They won't ever come on the island,'' said Mr. Davidson, referring to big-box stores. ''But they do affect us in buying because they are so large and dictate so much. We are at the mercy of all the big guys.'' 
 Manufacturers not only set lower prices for the huge chains that buy in bulk, allowing them to pass along steeper discounts to their customers, but they also cater to them by selling only products that they show interest in. 
 B&B was part of a cooperative buying group of more than 200 small independent retailers about two decades ago, but it has since disbanded. ''There's not enough of us left around,'' Mr. Davidson said. ''The manufacturers have to give the big guys all the production and they dictate the styles. As Wal-Mart gets bigger and bigger, the resources available to produce for people like us will get tougher.'' 
 And the everyday mall environment is increasingly moving closer. 
 The Walk, an outdoor mall in Atlantic city, has drawn national chains like PacSun, owned by Pacific Sunwear of Anaheim, Calif. 
 ''New Jersey is one of our most productive states, but we have mall-based stores as opposed to opening individual store locations,'' said Gar Jackson, PacSun's director of investor relations. 
 While chain retailers are not venturing onto the islands themselves, several strip centers are rising nearby on the mainland where chains can capture some of the summer business, but also cater to a year-round crowd. Discount chains T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have opened stores in a strip center in Cape May Court House just over the causeway from Stone Harbor. There is a major development inland from Wildwood, with a sign saying that Wal-Mart will join the Kmart and Lowe's already there.
 ''What you're going to see is plenty of suburban shopping only 10 or 15 minutes from the shoreline,'' said Mr. Cohen, the retail analyst. ''Not like New Jersey needs another mall, but you'll see centers coming on the mainland where the population is full-time but close enough to take advantage of the wealthy vacationing customers.''
 For now, the bays remain a buffer. 
 Wawa, the exception to the rule, has managed to set up shop because it has adopted some of the techniques that smaller businesses have used. The convenience-store chain based in Southeastern Pennsylvania has 550 stores in the Mid-Atlantic, including 75 at the Jersey Shore.
 Mr. McHugh said the privately owned chain was willing to cross over onto the barrier islands because so many of its customers in Philadelphia and South Jersey were migrating there in the summer as well.
 ''Those are our people and we needed to follow them,'' Mr. McHugh said.
 It has succeeded by following the successful strategy of local chains on the islands. The total winter staff of 20 to 25 workers grows to 70 to 80 in the summer. The company brings in 100 to 200 foreign students each summer, many of them from Ireland, and more recently Eastern Europe. If it were easy, other large chains would be in business at the Shore, too, Mr. McHugh said. Wawa's willingness to find ways to overcome the obstacles of doing business at the shore has paid off. ''If you're willing to take it on, it's a good business,'' he said.
 While the Shore's independent chains have made a go of it where giants fear to tread, problems remain.
 This year, a cold, rainy spring hurt business, said Francine Keller, owner of Making Waves, a women's specialty retailer here.
 ''When you are operating a business at the Jersey Shore, you're like a farmer because the weather really has an impact on what's going to happen for us,'' Ms. Keller said.
 Mr. Davidson said sales are down at his stores as well.
 ''This year the first five months were the worst I've ever seen because of the weather,'' Mr. Davidson said.
 Mr. Simon of Atlantic Books said traffic was down in many communities, where increasing affluence has lead new homeowners to tear down small multi-unit rental building to construct massive second homes that the owners use only on weekends. A side effect is the shrinkage of their customer pool. 
 ''Twenty years ago, there were small cottages and people came back and rented for a week every year,'' Mr. Simon said. ''Now, you don't have the turnover.'' 
 He said that despite the challenges, he plans to stick with his Shore business because he knows the tricks of managing a small chain through the seasonal ebbs and flows.
 ''Our business would not work if we were getting into it today,'' he said. ''It would take too long to understand the aspects of getting opened and closed, even partially, each year and hanging on to a core of employees. It won't stop me from keeping the stores, but I wouldn't do it again.''

HEADLINE: Which Tunnel Is That Again? 

BYLINE: By JOSH BENSON

DATELINE: Trenton 

 BODY:
FOR many truckers hauling freight into New York City, New Jersey thruways are simply a slow-moving route to their final stop. For residents of New Jersey, the state's highways are often traffic-clogged quagmires loaded with commercial vehicles. So when transit advocates and New Jersey and New York congressmen won a $100 million appropriation from Congress last month to study and design a freight tunnel under the New York Harbor linking the two states, they expected thunderous praise from all around. 
 What they got, for the most part, was a collective shrug, followed by muted opposition. 
It is perhaps fitting that New Jerseyans, always leery of New York's oversize shadow, have greeted the idea of a multibillion-dollar freight rail tunnel with a mixture of skepticism and ennui. But they are the ones, the tunnel's backers say, who stand to gain the most. Its impact on New Jersey -- which currently bears the brunt of New York-bound truck traffic from the south and west -- could be significant. The tunnel could significantly ease congestion and lessen the emissions spewed by commercial vehicles by taking hundreds of trucks a day off the roads, proponents say. 
 ''There's no doubt that the greatest benefits from this project would accrue to New Jersey,'' said Jon Orcutt, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, which lobbied for the funds. ''But it seems as if, to the extent that anyone in New Jersey likes it, no one is talking about it.''
 Well, actually, someone is. The North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, the metropolitan planning organization for 13 counties in northern and central New Jersey, has voiced opposition to the freight tunnel plan, saying it would not, in fact, reduce traffic, that it proposes rebuilding New York City's freight infrastructure without upgrading New Jersey's, and that freight ferries might be a better solution. 
 And there was a smattering of local interest recently in Jersey City -- where the trains would enter the harbor on their way to Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, to a terminal in Queens. But it was by officials in Hudson County and Jersey City, where the tunnel would start, and by community advocates there who feared the tunnel could make matters worse. 
 Voices of support have been somewhat quieter. United States Representative Robert Menendez, cited by tunnel advocates as the project's best-known supporter among the New Jersey delegation in Washington, did not publicly acknowledge the appropriation, and his office could not even clarify his position on the matter last week. 
 That has made mounting an opposition a bit harder, said a spokesman for the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority. ''We have been trying to make our opinion on the project known, but if it has a low profile, it's hard for the opposition to have a profile as well,'' said the spokesman, David W. Behrend. 
 For now, the $100 million infusion should be enough to complete studies of the project's environmental impact and to begin engineering work, before the time comes again in several years to lobby for the estimated $4.8 billion to $5.7 billion that the tunnel would actually cost. 
 The idea, eventually, will be to provide freight trains with a crossing that goes from a point near the current site of the Global Marine Terminal in Jersey City to New York City and beyond, absorbing some of the commercial cargo carried to New York by truck. 
 Supporters of the tunnel say that it will lessen the miles that trucks travel on New Jersey roads by tens of millions each year, and would significantly curb emissions of greenhouse gasses and asthma-inducing exhaust in the metropolitan New York region.
 At the same time, they say, it will prevent roads like Interstate 80 and Route 1-9, which are already prone to bottlenecks, from becoming paralyzed with expected traffic increases in the next 15 years.
 ''New Jersey has just become this thoroughfare for trucks crossing the state,'' said Marnie McGregor, director of Move NY & NJ, a coalition of mass transit advocates and labor groups that support construction of the tunnel. ''It's a problem that has to be addressed.''
 They also tout the economic benefits of the project to the Port of New York, which is currently trying to cling to its business in New York and New Jersey in the face of competition from other port cities that have superior capacity. 
 But the tunnel remains an uncertain prospect. 
 In addition to the billions that would still be needed to build the tunnel, there is another issue: No one knows who is actually going to work on the project. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey seemed taken aback when news of the grant money was proudly announced by the tunnel's most persistent champion, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, and a spokesman said that it would be ''premature'' to interpret the new cash at their disposal as an actual commitment to do anything. The politicians who could ease the tunnel's construction -- Gov. George E. Pataki and Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey -- have made it clear that they have other priorities; and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has withdrawn his support for the tunnel.
 And of course, even if all of the major bureaucratic and political obstacles are eventually cleared, local residents and officials will be on hand to remind would-be transportation visionaries that the devil -- as always -- is in the details. 
 ''We still don't know enough about it,'' said state Assemblyman Louis Manzo of Jersey City. ''If there's a chance of garbage being associated with this tunnel, the opposition is going to raise its voice again.''

HEADLINE: Honest, That Is Gov. Codey

BYLINE: By JOSH BENSON

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD 

 BODY:
THE Wednesday morning before a major tournament is usually a relaxed time, when a trickle of dedicated golf fans make their way to the course for a last chance to watch the pros lofting shots on the practice range or strolling around, yardage books in hand, for a final round before competitive play begins.
 But there, causing a stir alongside the 18th fairway of the Baltusrol Golf Club with a marathon stand-up routine, was a distinctly middling golfer, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, whose greatest moment in the sport was a recent practice round he played with Vijay Singh, who won the P.G.A. Championship last year.
''Can I get your signature, Governor?'' asked one young golf fan, extending his pairing sheet in Mr. Codey's direction. 
 ''No, I'll give you my autograph, not my signature,'' he said. ''Even though you're from Union County. Ever been to Essex? You stay out of there, huh?''
 He passed back the paper, grabbed a hat from another fan and continued signing. ''Where are you from? Westfield? Cranford? Oh, you're all Republicans!''
 Mr. Codey had showed up at Baltusrol that morning to attend the dedication of a plaque on the Lower Course's 18th hole to commemorate one of the more spectacular shots made by Jack Nicklaus, who twice won the United States Open here. The ceremony was at 9:30 a.m.
 As 11 a.m. approached, the governor, in a striped tie and suit pants, was still working the crowd. Nearby, sweating heavily, were a number of staffers in suits and a pair of security men wearing admission tags that marked them as ''vendors,'' a cover compromised only by their suits, dark glasses and wired earpieces.
 ''Making money?'' Mr. Codey asked one man who introduced himself as an old acquaintance. ''I'm not -- I'm on a fixed income.''
 One fan asked a stranger who the garrulous man in the middle of the crowd was, shrugged at the answer, and then plunged in anyway among a dozen other bystanders to take a picture.
 ''Hey, wait a minute, you're a Tar Heels fan!'' Mr. Codey said, before agreeing to pose for what seemed like the hundredth time.
 His staff tried to edge the governor toward an air-conditioned hospitality tent designated as his escape route. He did not budge. ''Look at this,'' Mr. Codey said to no one in particular. ''Can you imagine if I was a good golfer?''

A Major Is a Major Is a Major
 It was only after Baltusrol lost out on the 2006 United States Open to the rival Winged Foot course in Mamaroneck, N.Y., that its members decided to bid for this year's P.G.A. Championship. Even though Baltusrol's international reputation is built largely on its history of playing host to memorable United States Open championships, the club's loyalists firmly reject the idea that they are now associated with a lesser major.
 ''A major's a major,'' said Vinny Dolan, a club member and Morristown resident, as the golfer Justin Leonard whizzed past on a cart. ''And this P.G.A. Championship will be kind of special because we've never had one here.''

Golf Season, Not Bee Season
 Residents in neighborhoods that play host to professional golf tournaments are typically as interested in the economic impact of the event as they are in the actual contest. 
 In suburban Springfield, anecdotal evidence suggests that prospects were mixed for residents hoping to benefit from the influx of golf fans. 
 Thanks to Baltusrol's policy of not providing spectator parking, people with houses near the course enjoyed some success in turning their yards into boutique parking lots for Lexuses and BMW's at an average price of $20 a day. And one enterprising family even did a brisk business in ''phone storage,'' charging an eminently reasonable $3 a day to hang on to fans' cellphones, which are banned from the course.
 Less successful, however, was an appeal from one Springfield resident and town employee who cultivates bees as a hobby. ''Local Honey,'' read a flier posted near one of the course entrances. ''100% Raw. Backyard Beekeeper.'' 
 ''You're the first person to call,'' P.J. Martin said when reached at the advertised number last Thursday. ''I guess these people aren't honey eaters.''

HEADLINE: Restoring a Theater's Lost Luster

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: ELIZABETH 

 BODY:
WHEN George Castro arrived in the United States 20 years ago from Colombia to attend law school, he says, he literally didn't have a dime -- only a quarter he found in a telephone booth at the Miami airport.
 ''My father told me, 'You are going to the land of opportunity, so find some opportunities,''' Mr. Castro recalled. A few years later, he found real estate. 
Moving away from practicing law, Mr. Castro, who was by then ensconced in the growing Latino population in this city, got his real estate license in 1989. He quickly made himself a star, selling $10 million worth of homes at the beginning of an economic downturn, and the next year, as the economic picture worsened, selling $27 million.
 Later, Mr. Castro bought a Union County Century 21 franchise and turned it into a sales producer that currently ranks in the top 1 percent of the nearly 6,000 Century 21 offices in the country. 
 Along the way, the ambitious young agent became a pillar of the local Hispanic community, which currently constitutes about half of Elizabeth's population of 125,000, and began organizing cultural and entertainment events intended to appeal to Hispanic interests.
 In 1991, for example, Mr. Castro and his younger brother, Maurice, who followed him to Elizabeth and frequently works with him on projects, rented out a vacant rundown theater on East Jersey Avenue downtown to televise an international soccer elimination game between Colombia and Argentina -- and filled the old hall's 2,700 seats.
 After a most satisfying 5-0 win by Colombia before a roaring crowd that night, Mr. Castro recalls, he turned to his brother and asked, ''What do you think about us buying this place?'' 
 They closed the deal in 1994, and for the last decade Mr. Castro has poured his energy and money -- $15 million by his estimate -- into restoring the venerable theater, which was built as an opera house in 1865.
 He wants to fully re-establish the once-renowned Ritz theater -- a vaudeville house where Betty Grable worked as a chorus girl in the 1920's, and subsequently a movie theater, concert hall, country-western music venue and site for rock music videos and commercials -- as a premier entertainment hall. 
 The Ritz has won awards for its acoustics over the decades. Once a platform for vaudeville luminaries including Cab Calloway, the Marx Brothers and Jack Benny, the Ritz stage was graced by Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. in the 1960's, Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross in the 1970's, Johnny Cash and the Oak Ridge Boys in the 1980's, and Sting and Rod Stewart (for their videos) in the 1990's.
 Last year, Mr. Castro presided over a sold-out crowd for Julio Iglesias. Mr. Castro said he has deliberately scheduled events at the theater while renovation work was going on, so that patrons could experience the theater's process of rebirth for themselves. ''That way, people come to love a place,'' Mr. Castro said. ''If people love the Ritz, then it can become a center for the community and a key to reviving downtown Elizabeth.''
 Elizabeth, whose average household income was only $35,175 in the 2000 census and whose average home value was just $143,000, has the potential for a significant rebound, Mr. Castro asserted, and, of course, local political officials working on downtown revitalization heartily agree.
 Mr. Castro, the father of two young children, also sponsors free Christmas shows for children at the theater -- which has formally been rechristened the Ritz Theater and Performing Arts Center.
 For Presidents' Day this year, Mr. Castro invited 50 children from the Boys and Girls Club of Newark to see an Abraham Lincoln impersonator. ''The lesson of Abraham Lincoln's life,'' Mr. Castro told the children at the performance, ''is to never give up and that with hard work, anyone can become a successful American.'' 
 The work of restoration at the Ritz has been arduous, according to Mr. Castro. He said that at the peak of reconstruction efforts a couple of years ago, he had 50 people on staff working full time, most of them scraping umpteen layers of paint from walls, fixtures and floors, or fashioning new woodwork in a workshop set up in the theater basement.
 The leaky pipes, the crumbling walls, the faded and peeling paint, the ''horrible'' bathrooms have all been replaced, Mr. Castro pointed out on a recent tour through the building.
 The elaborate molding with gold leaf trim, the Art Deco-style theater lights, the marble wainscoting in the lobby, the rich fabric coverings on the theater walls have all been recreated in exacting historical detail.
 He did not make an application to have the theater named to the National Register of Historic Places, but said he followed national historic guidelines anyway. 
 A set of imposing 65-by-13-foot Renaissance-style murals by the Colombian-born artist Jorge Posada were hung on the proscenium last summer.
 Now, carpenters are building a large reception bar at the back of the theater, and carpet layers are at work installing new red patterned floor covering, rushing to complete the job in time for a ceremonial visit on Sept. 18 by Alvaro Uribe, the president of Colombia, to recognize Mr. Castro's efforts.
 Mr. Castro was appointed to the State Investment Council by former Gov. James E. McGreevey. He also serves as a trustee of Union County College and is on the board of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.
 In 1998, he spearheaded efforts to create the state's first Hispanic political action committee, and in 2001 was named ''businessperson of the year'' by the New Jersey Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
 ''This country has been very good to me,'' Mr. Castro remarked at the time of the Chamber award -- and he said he planned to sound the refrain again when meeting President Bush at a business gathering in Texas this month and again during the Colombian president's visit. 
 He still has the quarter that he found in Miami, kept in a frame at his home in Elizabeth. ''I found so much more here,'' he said, ''and sincerely, I would like to give some back.''

HEADLINE: Awash in Information, Patients Face a Lonely, Uncertain Road

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
Nothing Meg Gaines endured had prepared her for this moment. Not the six rounds of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer that had metastasized to her liver. Not the doctor who told her, after Ms. Gaines was prepped for surgery, that he could not operate: a last-minute scan revealed too many tumors. ''Go home and think about the quality, not the quantity, of your days,'' he said. 
 Not the innumerable specialists whom Ms. Gaines, then 39 and the mother of two toddlers, had already mowed through in her terrified but unswerving effort to save her own life. Not the Internet research and clinical trial reports, all citing the grimmest of statistics. Not the fierce, frantic journey she made, leaving home in Wisconsin to visit cancer centers in Texas and California.
Now, just about out of options, Ms. Gaines faced an excruciating decision. Her last-ditch chemotherapy regimen did seem to be working. Three medical oncologists thought she should stick with it. But two surgical oncologists thought she should first try cryosurgery, injecting liquid nitrogen into the tumors to shrink as many as possible, and then following up with chemotherapy, allowing it to be more effective. 
 The catch? Ms. Gaines's chances of even surviving the procedure were uncertain.
 ''Who will decide?'' she asked a surgeon from Los Angeles. 
 The doctor then recited what has become the maddening litany of medical correctness: ''We're in the outer regions of medical knowledge,'' he said, ''and none of us knows what you should do. So you have to make the decision, based on your values.''
 Ms. Gaines, bald, tumor-ridden and exhausted from chemotherapy, was reeling. ''I'm not a doctor!'' she shouted. ''I'm a criminal defense lawyer! How am I supposed to know?'' 
 This is the blessing and the burden of being a modern patient. A generation ago, patients argued for more information, more choice and more say about treatment. To a great extent, that is exactly what they have received: a superabundance of information, often several treatment options and the right to choose among them.
 As this new responsibility dawns on patients, some embrace it with a sense of pride and furious determination. But many find the job of being a modern patient, with its slog through medical uncertainty, to be lonely, frightening and overwhelming. 
 Many prostate cancer patients can choose a passive treatment, like watchful waiting, or a more aggressive therapy, like radiation or surgery; each has differing risks and different patterns of side effects. Women with breast cancer often hear conflicting advice from the experts: lumpectomy or mastectomy? Some patients with heart disease can be told by one doctor that they need a bypass, by another that they need angioplasty and by a third that drugs would be just fine. Infertility patients face a blizzard of options.
 Such quandaries do not apply only to life-rattling illnesses. Last summer, with the second joint of his left big toe painfully throbbing from gout, Carl Schneider, a law professor at the University of Michigan who had already consulted his internist and a rheumatologist, leaned wearily against a hospital wall as three other doctors argued over which regimen he should follow. One doctor handed him a 20-page Internet printout that cited gout treatment studies, none of them definitive.
 ''At 57, it's a little late to be starting medical school,'' Mr. Schneider remarked acidly. ''But the burden still falls on me, having to pick among opinions.'' 
 The job of being a modern patient includes not only decision making, of course, but often coordinating doctors, medical records and procedures, as well as negotiating with insurance companies, who are often the ultimate arbiters over which treatment options will be covered. 
 As Ms. Gaines was being treated for cancer she had to wage such a battle. Before she had her diagnosis, her H.M.O. gynecologist laparoscopically removed what appeared to be a cyst on her ovary. But during the procedure, the cyst, which turned out to be a malignant tumor, burst, sending cancer cells into her abdomen. She then wanted to be treated by a specialist, but her insurance plan did not have a gynecological oncologist on its roster. So Ms. Gaines spent months fighting to transfer her care to an out-of-network doctor. Finally the insurers relented, but only after the specialist agreed to perform her surgery at the H.M.O.'s regional hospital, not his own. 
 Like many patients, Ms. Gaines did not turn to a primary care doctor to help coordinate her care or aid with decisions. Increasingly, that soul-healing doctor-patient relationship has become harder to sustain. Whipsawed by insurance plans, patients frequently switch physicians. Pressed by diminishing reimbursements, those doctors are building ever larger, more unwieldy practices, with less time for each patient.
 The strain has left doctors themselves feeling exhausted, angry and heartbroken.
 ''My visits are almost ludicrous,'' said Dr. John Russo, an internist in West Orange, N.J., who sees 5,000 patients a year. ''But economically you have to see so many more patients than you should, just to keep the lights on. You can't sit and talk and really get an entire history. So you do what you were taught as a resident: do more tests, don't spend more time with patients, getting to know them.'' 
 Ms. Gaines was out of time. She had to make a decision. She felt the chill of mortality and the full weight of nearly a year of drastic operations, blood clots, a punctured lung, chemotherapy, research, traveling, countless specialists and unanswerable questions bearing down on her. 
 ''Who's in charge here?'' she thought that night, wishing someone would just issue her marching orders. ''Oh. I am.''


When Doctor Knew Best
 A generation ago, most of the diagnostic tests that monitored Ms. Gaines's cancer did not exist. Nor did the range of treatments. After the cancer had been found, most likely her primary care doctor or local oncologist would have told her what to do. And Ms. Gaines would have obeyed.
 Until the late 1960's, patients perceived doctors, then almost exclusively white men, as unassailable figures of authority. They knew best. But during the social and cultural upheaval that ushered in the women's rights, civil rights and consumers' rights movements, the paternalistic authority of the physician became deeply suspect. Women fought to join the conversation. Challenging the mystification of medicine, the Boston Women's Health Book Collective published ''Our Bodies, Ourselves,'' a landmark guide. Women changed conventional wisdom about the prevalence of hospital deliveries, hysterectomies and mastectomies.
 With the introduction of Medicaid and Medicare in 1965, health care began to be seen as a right, not a privilege. Patients repositioned themselves as consumers of health care, entitled to as much information as possible. Support groups sought to empower patients with booklets and questions for doctors. 
 In response, many patients became insatiable consumers of medical information. In a New York Times/CBS News poll of 1,111 adults in February, 44 percent of patients who received a diagnosis sought additional information about their treatment from sources others than their physicians, including the Internet, friends and relatives, and other doctors. 
 Although the push has been on for patients to become more knowledgeable about their care, as they read unfiltered information, they can become more flustered. Shauntel Anderson, 24, a baby sitter in the Bronx who learned she had cardiac arrhythmia, had to choose between continuing her medication or being hospitalized for a procedure known as a catheter ablation. 
 ''I did research for two or three weeks,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''I went to 15 or 20 Web sites because I needed to know everything they were going to do to me. But the Web was messing me up: I got confused because I didn't understand it.'' Her cardiologists then suggested a few helpful sites. She chose the ablation. 
 The drive among patients to become better informed has been fueled, in part, by the array of options that often accompanies diagnoses, many so new that gold-standard treatments, backed up by randomized trials, have yet to emerge. 
 But hope is a potent elixir. Patients with good insurance or other financial resources have quickly learned how to find medical centers that could offer them the latest procedures, like the cryosurgery Ms. Gaines sought out, which had no long-term experience behind it at the time.
 A patient's research does not have to be any more extensive than turning on the television. The eruption of pharmaceutical advertising has introduced millions to medical conditions that were once discussed only in the privacy of a consultation, and to the promises of new approved treatments. And inevitably following these promises is the prompt: ''Ask your doctor.''
 At the same time, medical science itself is widely perceived to be in a Renaissance period. Basic research in fields like biotechnology has received deep bipartisan federal support. As the results continue to unfold, patients with major and minor health problems can choose from a fresh array of options: some good, some bad, some redundant and some virtually miraculous.
 In the Times/CBS poll, slightly more than half the patients who received a diagnosis were given multiple treatment options. One-third made the decision on their own, with those between the ages of 45 and 64 most likely to do so. 
 Whether patients make a decision by themselves or at the behest of a doctor, the fact that the choice is theirs has become known among bioethicists as patient autonomy -- the right of governance over one's own body. The term is symbolic of the pendulum swing away from the paternalism common through the 1960's. Patients began seeking second and even third opinions. 
 Floyd Allen, a social worker with CancerCare, a support organization, says that the prostate cancer patients he counsels become exasperated: ''For the people who have insurance, they're angry about having to shop around for opinions, and the folks on Medicaid are mad because they can't afford to shop around.''
 By the 1980's, opinion seeking could even turn into doctor-shopping for specific procedures. Patients started suing doctors, an escalating conflict leading to, among other things, high malpractice premiums, Congressional debates and, in the examining rooms, overcautious conversations between litigation-alert doctors and patients. 
 Within the past decade, the shift in the doctor-patient conversation -- from, ''This is what's wrong with you, here's what to do,'' to ''Here are your options, what do you want to do?'' -- became all but complete. Baby boomers had gotten what they had asked for. And then some. 
 ''People want to feel a part of their health care,'' said David Mechanic, a medical sociologist at Rutgers University. ''But they don't want to be abandoned to making decisions all on their own. When a doctor says, 'Here are your options,' without offering expert help and judgment, that is a form of abandonment. ''

The Doctor Is Out
 In the 11 years since Rick Sommers received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, medical advancements have raised and dashed his hopes, and ultimately led to a schism with his neurologist. 
 Mr. Sommers, 45, a former marathon runner and New York D.J., went through the shock that many patients experience, after two neurologists determined the cause of his numbness and tingling. 
 ''The doctors are trying to map out exactly what is wrong with you,'' he said, ''and they're giving it to you in sophisticated neurologic terms. It's like being in a foreign country: you don't speak the language, and you're trying to find directions.'' 
 Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease in which the immune system can go haywire and cause neurological disturbances, called exacerbations. The disease can stay dormant for years at a time, and then flare up. In Mr. Sommers's case, his arm goes dead, and his hand feels like it is on fire.
 In 1994, there was a waiting list for the one treatment available. Mr. Sommers became a patient of a leading specialist, and went on a double-blind study for a new drug, not knowing whether he was getting it or the placebo. Over the next two and a half years, he took four pills a day. 
 ''I thought I was being proactive, and I had a fantasy that maybe we were on the cutting edge of something,'' he said. 
 He still had the occasional exacerbation, which required rugged outpatient treatment. There was no way to know whether the pills staved off even more attacks. One morning he was in his apartment, paying bills, idly listening to CNBC. The anchor, announcing company news, said that over the weekend, researchers reported that the test drug had flopped. ''I slumped in my chair,'' Mr. Sommers said. ''I felt devastated. I spent two and a half years in this study, and this is how I'm finding out it's not working?'' 
 In the years since the disease was diagnosed in him, multiple sclerosis patients have gained access to more information, more specialists and more treatment options. In addition to a phalanx of alternative remedies, at least five drugs that try to prevent exacerbations are on the market. Mr. Sommers has been taking one for the last few years. And he has tried about 10 different medications for symptoms related to multiple sclerosis.
 But with all the good news, there is still no cure. Patients can be even more confused, tantalized by the treatments and the plethora of sources of information. Mr. Sommers receives an electronic newsletter from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, a patient support group, and sets his computer's stock watch for advisories on companies researching drugs.
 Early detection for M.S. has improved, which means that more patients are seeking treatment. Clinics are filling rapidly. Mr. Sommers had to make appointments with his neurologist four months in advance. 
 ''It's hard to get a hold of the doctors at the clinic,'' he said. ''My own doctor is so overtaxed. He's pushed, he's pulled, he's torn, he's frantic, he does the best he can. But whenever I saw him, I felt like I was taking up his time. The waiting room has gotten so cramped! There are a lot more hoops to jump through before you can get to the doctor: I got more personal care 11 years ago.'' 
 His disease is progressing. He has not been able to run in five years. Sometimes, even walking is hard. But given the stress of going in for a checkup, Mr. Sommers decided to give up on his neurologist of more than a decade. It had been nine months since his last visit.
 ''I wondered if he thought about me when I wasn't there,'' Mr. Sommers said. ''I wrote a heartfelt note to my doctor to let him know why I wasn't coming back. But I never heard from him.'' 
 Even though he recently found a new neurologist, he does not know if this doctor will become the medical cheerleader and adviser that he longs for. ''So my gatekeeper is my girlfriend, not my doctor,'' Mr. Sommers said. ''We hash it all out, we figure out the options. She has a good, clear focused head about this stuff.''

The Researcher
 Last summer, as doctors tried to figure out why her husband's urine had turned the color of cola, Joyce Rich went to work figuring it out herself. 
 Mrs. Rich, 58, a nursery school teacher from New City, N.Y., had to do something with her nervous energy. Like so many people who, when threatened by illness, feel frightened and helpless, she turned into a formidable Googling machine. Doing the homework gave her the comforting illusion of having a measure of control. 
 ''I can't go into these things ignorant, although in a way I am,'' Mrs. Rich said. ''I would feel as if I just wasn't doing my part.'' 
 Mrs. Rich kept meticulous journals of questions and recommended urologists. She made copies of every test result, lugging them to every consultation. ''With our luck,'' she said, ''I was afraid they would lose the reports, so I delivered them myself. Besides, I never know if I'm going to stay with the doctor I am seeing, so I make sure I have our records ready for the next one.''
 Shortly after her husband's illness was diagnosed, she sat trembling in the beauty parlor and confided to her hairstylist, ''Ira has kidney cancer!''
 Google search: kidney cancer. Results: 10,300,000. And counting. 
 Her hairstylist called around for referrals. Mrs. Rich's manicurist was particularly helpful: her best friend just had a kidney removed. The manicurist gave her pages of online research. 
 Mr. Rich, 59, is not robust. He had already undergone open-heart surgery. Removing his kidney laparoscopically was preferable for his overall health. But the tumor was in an atypical location, making the procedure even trickier. Mrs. Rich took her list of doctors to the public library and checked resumes, how often the surgeon had performed the procedure, the number of malpractice suits and their resolution.
 ''I wasn't aware how often doctors change specialties and narrow their field,'' said Mr. Rich, a high school guidance counselor. ''They do one thing, and then you call them and they're doing something else.'' 
 Finally, Mrs. Rich narrowed her list to six. Then, the very process that had helped her feel in control now made her feel more helpless than ever. She had come to the end of her research, with absolutely no idea how to decide. At last she turned to the first place she could have gone and saved herself so much trouble, Mr. Rich's longtime internist. The Riches were lucky to have a doctor willing to be their guide. He did not bother with a menu of options. Without polite shilly-shallying, he gave them just one name. 
 ''It was such a relief,'' Mrs. Rich said. He sent the Riches to a specialist who was not even on her list. ''Cleveland?'' Mrs. Rich gasped, ''I thought Cleveland comes to New York!'' 
 In retrospect, said Mrs. Rich, who was thrilled with the specialist, ''You start this process, and you hope you get all the information you need to make a valid and intelligent decision. But you really don't. And that's where your doctor comes in handy.''

So Little Time
 With patients having so much medical information, being a primary care doctor these days means donning armor daily. Here comes the public, bearing pharmaceutical brochures, sheaves of Internet printouts, pages of time-consuming questions: Vioxx? Total body scans? Why didn't you recommend a carotid artery Doppler? 
 Uh-oh, the 11 o'clock news had a three-minute special on pain management. Or the estrogen update du jour. Ask your doctor! The phones will start at 6 a.m., the call-back list will balloon. Inquiring patients will be angry that their calls were not returned. 
 But besieged doctors first call those with emergencies, then consulting doctors, laboratories, pharmacies, insurance companies and, oh, yes, they also start seeing patients who have scheduled visits. 
 Doctors feel the benefits and burdens of medical information being so accessible to patients. Yes, studies show that the more informed patients are about their care, the more likely their health will improve. 
 But the information that patients bring to the office visit is often half-baked. Doctors must spend precious moments in an already constrained time slot re-educating them.
 Dr. Russo, the West Orange, N.J., internist who sees 5,000 patients a year, applauds patients who do their homework. But, he noted, especially when patients are researching treatment options, they flop down in his office, feeling inundated.
 ''The patients are stressed, they're so confused, and it's in our laps,'' Dr. Russo said. ''They are deserving of guidance.'' 
 He is the generalist; his job is to diagnose problems. Then he refers patients to specialists who, he hopes, will help them with the daunting decisions. 
 Patients struggle to find their way, Dr. Russo said, but ''there isn't one person to walk them through the process.'' 
 It is impossible to overestimate the bracing impact of that old-fashioned guide, the doctor who can be a patient's constant, her Pole Star. 
 Judy Brown, 46, a community volunteer in Nashua, N.H., who suffers from acute migraines, has tried dozens of preventive and pain-relief medications. Yet she has remained with the same headache specialist, who acts as her primary care doctor, for 17 years. A neurologist with a large patient load who does extensive research, he nonetheless always returns her calls, even when he is on vacation. 
 ''I don't think anyone will cure me,'' Mrs. Brown said softly. ''But my doctor helps me cope. And that means the world to me.'' 
 Patients who have a continuing relationship with a personal physician, studies show, have greater survival rates and lower health costs. Conversely, the more medical personnel involved in the patient's care, the greater the likelihood of error.
 But though that primary relationship is so fundamental for patients, the medical establishment is gradually turning away from it. The number of medical students eschewing careers in internal and family medicine and instead pursuing specialties is increasing. Among the reasons they give are the declining prestige of primary care doctors, the eroding doctor-patient relationship, the financial hardships of maintaining a practice and the drain on family life. 
 A study in the May issue of Academic Medicine showed that among third-year residents in 2003, 27 percent chose careers in primary care medicine rather than pursuing a subspecialty, down from 54 percent in 1998. Only 19 percent of first-year students said they intended to be generalists. 
 ''I can imagine patients feel lonely, 'My doctor didn't follow me,''' Dr. Russo said. ''I wish I could. I wish I had the time to sit down with them.''

Making the Decision
 When Meg Gaines was a little girl, her father, a lawyer, was transferred to Belgium; the family arrived scarcely 20 years after the end of World War II. She grew up keenly aware of European history, visiting concentration camps and battlegrounds, learning about military strategies. 
 What was the best way to fight her war against cancer, she asked herself that night in 1995, as she struggled to decide about treatment. Stay the course with chemotherapy or risk the cryosurgery first, which, back then, was a relatively experimental and possibly lethal procedure?
 ''What made sense to me was to bring in the air force and bomb the hell out of the tumors and weaken them,'' Ms. Gaines said. ''Then go in with the infantry. And so I decided to do surgery plus chemo, not just chemo.'' 
 As it happened, the Los Angeles surgeon found only one big tumor. The others, which had earlier scared off the liver surgeon in Wisconsin, were just blood density irregularities and benign cysts. 
 Eighteen months after Ms. Gaines's cancer was detected, she returned to her job, teaching criminal law and supervising students defending prisoners. The job was the same, but she had changed.
 Over the next few years, Ms. Gaines did a lot of thinking and a lot of talking about her experience as a patient, about how brutally difficult it had been to gather information, find doctors and make decisions. She helped found the Center for Patient Partnerships, which opened in 2001, based at the law school of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It helps patients with cancer and other serious illnesses finddoctors and make informed decisions, even as it trains student volunteers from disciplines like law, business, public policy and medicine how to be advocates for patients. 
 ''You can get good health care,'' Ms. Gaines said. ''But there isn't good relay, getting you to the resources and the resources to you.'' She meets with panicky, bewildered patients and occasionally shares with them her story, if only to make one point: ''I tell patients all the time: 'I know this is hard to believe, but you want to know who is managing your health care? It's you or no one.'''

HEADLINE: Other Great Artists Of the Samurai Epic 

BYLINE: By TERRENCE RAFFERTY

 BODY:
THE Film Forum's bracingly sanguinary ''Summer Samurai'' series is, among other things, a useful reminder that before Chinese martial artists became iconic figures for Western action-movie aficionados, stern, unsmiling Japanese swordsmen were pretty much all we knew about Eastern styles of violence and the rigorous codes that governed them. We learned much of this, of course, from the peerless Akira Kurosawa, five of whose pictures (including the greatest of them all, the 1954 ''Seven Samurai'') are in this 15-film series. But for many of Film Forum's patrons, I suspect, the revelation of the four-week extravaganza, which starts Friday, will be the fiercely beautiful work of Masaki Kobayashi. His two movies here, ''Harakiri'' (1962) and ''Samurai Rebellion'' (1967), are amazing: stirring, subversive and, beneath their dauntingly severe surfaces, sneakily lyrical. 
 What Kobayashi's films are not is conspicuously action-packed, at least by the standard of slash-'em-ups like Kurosawa's ''Yojimbo'' (1961) and Kihachi Okamoto's ''Sword of Doom'' (1966) and ''Kill!'' (1968), all of which are being screened in the series. Both ''Harakiri'' and ''Samurai Rebellion'' are slow-burn movies, in which everything builds to a climactic bloodletting, and the point of the violence is not so much its kinetic exhilaration as its tragic inevitability. Travis Bickle, the ticking time bomb of ''Taxi Driver,'' might well recognize the profoundly alienated warrior heroes of Kobayashi's pictures as his ancestors. 
 But the internal conflicts of Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), the hero of ''Harakiri,'' and Isaburo (Toshiro Mifune), the hero of ''Samurai Rebellion,'' are, if anything, more acute than even those of the frustrated young urban loner Travis. These men, in middle age, are facing the realization that everything they believe in is conspiring to betray them: that the social order to which they have been loyal all their lives feels no loyalty toward them. And the lofty, spiritual-seeming principles of their samurai code, which demand unwavering obedience to authority, are no help at all when authority, as is its habit, turns capricious and cruel. Although this is a tough call, it's at least arguable that living, as Kobayashi's heroes do, in an absurd universe is actually more deranging than living in the bankrupt, crime-infested, sanitation-challenged New York of the 1970's. 
 The dire events of ''Harakiri'' (showing Sept. 4 to 6) take place in 1630, in the early days of centralization under the Tokugawa shogunate: the power of local feudal lords is diminishing and the samurai whom they once employed to fight their constant battles are now largely unnecessary. Some of these masterless samurai, the movie tells us, have developed a perverse but apparently reliable con: the unemployed warrior presents himself at the house of an established clan and, pleading desperation and disgrace, asks for a place to commit suicide honorably (i.e., with proper observance of the precisely codified ritual). The clan, it's hoped, will deny the request and give the poor man a job, or, failing that, throw a little money his way and tell him to go disembowel himself somewhere else. 
 At the beginning, hollow-eyed Tsugumo turns up at the headquarters of the Iyi clan with just such a request, and the Iyi brain trust -- hardliners who consider the suicide con shameful -- prepare to oblige him. Before Tsugumo will do the deed, though, he insists on telling a story. It concerns a younger samurai who, likewise taken at his word by the stiff-backed Iyi honchos, was compelled to kill himself, very painfully, with a dull bamboo sword. (Kobayashi shows the gruesome act in flashback, and although the scene is elegantly staged, you may feel, as this horror unfolds, that you've never been more grateful a movie was shot in black and white.) 
 Tsugumo, it turns out, has an agenda beyond self-slaughter or simple extortion, and that agenda -- not unheard of in this genre -- is revenge. Or, at least, satisfaction: some acknowledgment by the Iyi clan that their treatment of the young samurai (the hero's son-in-law, we learn) was, for all the righteous invocations of honor and tradition, purely barbarous. 
 After nearly two hours of philosophical debate and mournful flashback narration, ''Harakiri'' ends the only way it can, with a bloodbath. The climactic battle, a brilliantly choreographed dance of rage and exhaustion, is as exciting as any action-movie addict could wish, but it provides few of the usual vicarious thrills of consummated vengeance. There is, rather, a melancholy, held-breath stillness to the whole sorry spectacle: even at its violent end the movie continues to hover, as it has from its opening scenes, between resignation and cold fury. 
 ''Samurai Rebellion'' is a bit less highly regarded than ''Harakiri'' (which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival), but Film Forum has given it pride of place in this series: ''Rebellion'' is the opening film, and will play for a full week (Friday through Aug. 25). It deserves the honor: if it is a slightly less intense, less scarily focused picture than ''Harakiri,'' it is also, I think, a subtler one. Set a century later, ''Rebellion'' depicts a society that appears more settled but is, as the hero discovers, no less treacherous and no more forgiving of perceived transgressions.
 Isaburo, a master swordsman, is in every other respect a placid and utterly ordinary family man, with a job, a couple of sons and a wife by whom he is, he ruefully admits, henpecked. Most of the drama, until very near the end, is domestic, revolving around the sorts of issues that might arise in a Yasujiro Ozu film, where they would be resolved, with tight smiles and quiet tears, over endless cups of tea. 
 Kobayashi's world, however, is one in which household arrangements can be dictated by forces even more unyielding than those of social convention -- in which Isaburo's clan can demand that the faithful samurai's eldest son marry one of the lord's cast-off mistresses, and then, years later, demand with equal insistence that she be returned to the palace. So Isaburo and his son, who has come to love his wife, have to strap on their swords and make a stand. 
 There's probably less swordplay in ''Rebellion'' than there is in ''Harakiri,'' but the humbler context of this drama makes the violence seem even more shocking, the depredations of authority even more pointlessly malign. And you feel, in Mifune's superbly nuanced performance, that Isaburo has to work harder than doomed Tsugumo does to make sense of what's happening to him -- to fight his way toward something better than the suicidal resignation that seems the only road out of this skewed moral landscape. 
 The greatness of these movies is so unambiguous that you're bound to wonder why Masaki Kobayashi isn't better known, and I have no good answer for that. The Film Forum series should provide him some belated justice, and if that doesn't do the trick, the Criterion Collection DVD releases of ''Harakiri'' (this month) and ''Samurai Rebellion'' (in October, in a samurai-movie boxed set that also includes, among others, Okamoto's giddy ''Kill!'') surely will. 
 He was a remarkable director, and the proof is in the delicately controlled style of these anti-authoritarian martial-arts pictures. Every shot is impeccably composed, every camera movement smooth and serene, every cut logical and exact. The filmmaking itself is supremely orderly without being oppressive. That's an impressive achievement, and in this context a terribly moving one. The clarity of art, Kobayashi's movies say, is everything. It's the way out that his noble samurai, for all their skill and faith and courage, couldn't find.

HEADLINE: A Dot-Com Die-Hard

BYLINE: By Robert Johnson

 BODY:
David Lord is not a changed man. Though his company, Toysmart, failed as an online retailer despite backing from the Walt Disney Company, he is still a dot-com believer.
 Mr. Lord, 40, is again heading an Internet business, raising millions of dollars from investors and talking about the company's prospects for big sales increases. This time, he is president and chief operating officer of RazorGator. Despite its name, the company sells neither razors nor alligators; the name was picked mainly to be catchy. 
The company provides its customers a marketplace to buy and sell tickets to sports, music and other events. It specializes in hard-to-get seats. The service is free for sellers to use, but RazorGator marks up the ticket price between 14 percent and 25 percent to cover business expenses.
 Mr. Lord began working with RazorGator as a consultant in 2004; it hired him to run the company last September. ''I was introduced to the company by a venture-capital friend of mine,'' he said. 
 RazorGator, which employs more than 100 people and is based in Beverly Hills, Calif., expects sales to grow about 50 percent this year, to more than $50 million, Mr. Lord said.
 Some 200 employees of Toysmart lost their jobs when Disney, which had a majority stake, pulled the plug on the company in May 2000. If an online retailer couldn't survive despite a partnership with the king of the family consumer market, why is Mr. Lord so optimistic about RazorGator?
 For one thing, he said, ''tickets can be electronic,'' allowing an entire transaction to be completed online. In addition, RazorGator caters to high-paying corporate clients and other groups -- arranging such amenities as restaurant reservations near the site of the concert or sports event. The overall economy is also more stable now, he said. ''I still think it was the right model, just the wrong time,'' Mr. Lord said of Toysmart, where he was chief executive. ''But I think I learned a lot.'' Apparently, his investors think so as well; Mr. Lord said he had raised $26 million in venture capital for RazorGator.
 He and his wife, Tracey, have moved with their three daughters, ages 10 to 14, from Boston to Agoura Hills, Calif. The 22-mile commute to Beverly Hills takes ''anywhere from 40 minutes to two hours, depending on traffic,'' he said. Robert Johnson

HEADLINE: No Matter the Date, Always Under the Sign of the Crab

BYLINE: By MIMI SHERATON

 BODY:
''BEAUTIFUL SWIMMERS,'' William W. Warner dubbed the hard-shelled blue crabs of Chesapeake Bay in his exquisite 1976 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by that name, which detailed the synergy between the wily sidewinders, the watermen who gathered them and the bay that is home and workplace to both. 
 Beautiful eating, however, is the lure for me whenever I am beside the Chesapeake shores, in my experience the source of the world 's pearliest and most toothsome crab meat. That, after having sampled such highly touted specimens as Maine's peekytoe, the West Coast's Dungeness, Alaska's kings and snows, Florida's stone crabs (which I knew as Morro crabs in pre-Castro Cuba) and the crustacean delights of Venice, Louisiana, Kamchatka and Shanghai. As with lobsters when I am in Maine and oysters in Brittany, it was crabs that I built my daily meals on a recent five-day quest in Virginia Beach. 
Crustaceans aside, this entertaining seaside city is a repository of some of our country's earliest history as well as a relaxed beach-and-boardwalk resort, stylistically and economically hospitable to families. My goal, however, was to have as much of that silky, sweetly briny meat as possible, in the simplest and most classic preparations -- steamed whole and spicy or mounded into puffy, meaty crab cakes, or as the tiny, supple soft-shells, preferably sauteed or lightly fried. The only noncrab tradition that fits such feasting is Hatteras clam chowder, the clear, clam-broth-based soup of the Outer Banks, modified neither with milk nor tomato and laden with clams, celery, onion and, usually, carrots, all cut in varying sizes from the chunkiest to the finely minced. 
 As has been our annual tradition, my husband, Richard Falcone, and I arrived in Norfolk promptly at lunchtime, and local friends whisked us directly from the airport to Chick's Oyster Bar, a rambling series of shacklike rooms with a big bar jammed nightly with the young set as they choose exotic house drinks or one of the 45 or so beers, really the best accompaniment to the crabs and fish fries. 
 The best place for eating, though, is the big outdoor terrace overlooking the Lynnhaven marina, where boats dock so occupants can feast onshore or aboard whether by sunlight or moonlight or -- my favorite -- twilight, when the departing sun casts a golden glow over air and water. This is the perfect setting in which to crack properly hot and spice-spiked crabs, size depending upon availability. The real prizes are the red hot jimmies, the largest males (females are avoided as breeders), steamed under a nicely gritty burnishing of the pungent spice mixture called crab boil, a blend of bay leaves and zappings of salt, pepper, cayenne and assorted aromatics. 
 The crabs are piled onto trays or sheets of paper, cracked with wooden hammers (accept no plastic substitutes) and then picked apart for the most succulent morsels to be glossed with melted butter. This hands-on endeavor, aided by rolls of paper towels, is one of life's greatest feasts. While the crabs are being steamed to order, there's Hatteras chowder, here with big chunks of carrots, celery and unpeeled potatoes and a gentle hint of thyme. Although elaborate creations invariably disappoint, noncrab eaters can opt for brightly fresh fried fish, oysters, clams and shrimp, but ask that they be only lightly floured so they are not obscured by heavy breading. 
 Anyone willing to sacrifice atmosphere for the ne plus ultra in crabs would be wise to choose the Virginia Seafood Company's South End Pub, a bar and restaurant with numerous TV sets throughout to accommodate sports lovers, attached to a 24-year-old fish market. John Galloway, a former waterman who with his father operated the fish market until new owners, Geoff and Greg Osteen, remodeled the restaurant, still holds forth in the simply adorned but pleasant dining room and convivial bar, and seems to find the largest, crabbiest jimmies available, rubbing the spice mix on the white underbellies rather then on the hard-shelled tops as is customary. ''That way,'' Mr. Galloway said, ''the spices get right onto the meat as you crack the crab.''
 Similarly, he steams succulent jumbo shrimp with crab boil, and they emerge tender and ready to peel. All are brightly accented by a refreshing, finely minced cole slaw, and, oddly in this locale, delicious New England chowder that is a Galloway family tradition, enriched with half-and-half and only slightly thickened with flour, allowing the flavors of saline clams, smoky bacon and the tingling of celery salt to register. Serious fish lovers can select from the market such local varieties as sweet but bony spots and croakers or meaty tautog (blackfish), to be fried, grilled, broiled or baked to order, or buy a tin of cooked jumbo lump crab meat ($21.99 a pound) to take home. 
 Sustaining several finger bruises from excessive crab cracking, and having grossed out my husband, who cringes at the messy sight of fanatical shellfish pickers in progress, I figured it was time for crab cakes. Here the choice narrows considerably, as the local custom is to fry them within an inch of their lives or to toss them with melted butter and scorch the fragile meat under the broiler. Fortunately there is Scott Bernheisel, the chef and owner of Lucky Star, a charmingly simple and elegant restaurant done up in pastels with wall displays of shiny Art Deco cocktail shakers and classic wine bottles. 
 Mr. Bernheisel introduces Continental subtleties into local fare. His sublime crab cakes, rich with lumps of the dewy, ivory meat, are gently sauteed and then quickly gilded under a broiler. Doing them justice are garnishes of lemon aioli sauce and a needling hot salsa of habaneros, watermelon and papaya along with marinated slivers of icy jicama. Alongside is a big, crusty butternut squash and sweet potato croquette that, though richly satisfying, somewhat overpowers the delicate crab cakes. Before and after are worth noting too, especially the inspired, Mediterranean-style clam chowder, blushed with a sprightly Latino spice mix and redolent of bacon, garlic, topped by an olive-oil-brushed crouton. For the fondest farewell to this luckiest star and our waistlines we indulged in the Chocolate Nirvana, a moistly dark, bittersweet layering of flourless chocolate torte, chocolate mousse, fudgy ganache, fresh raspberry puree and crunches of macadamia nuts. 
 A less prepossessing source for nicely sauteed crab cakes, Hatteras chowder, fairly light frying of oysters and shrimp and the most carefully broiled fresh flounder in the area is Croakers Neighborhood Grill, basically a roadhouse with a nautical decor. Memorable though the simple food can be, it was no match for the sight of the television evangelist Pat Robertson, a habitue, digging in to a pile of iceberg lettuce, the salad green that is beyond redemption. Those who miss Mr. Roberts at Croakers can search him out at his Christian Broadcasting Network headquarters in Virginia Beach and sit in on his ''700 Club'' broadcasts.
 The most glittery and cosmopolitan restaurant in the area, and consistently the best source of small soft-shells, is Coastal Grill, where the tiny, tender wonders are crisply, gently fried and served with pungent tartar sauce and scallion butter. But ask for a separate plate, so the juicy grilled corn on the cob, the salad greens and the red bliss potatoes can be removed, allowing crabs to be negotiated more comfortably. Equally careful frying enhances oysters and scallops, and among the tempting desserts, none is more luscious than the strawberry shortcake heaped between biscuit crusts and mounded with whipped cream. 
 To work off calories and renew palates, there are dozens of between-meals possibilities. In addition to standard beach exercising, there is biking along the boardwalk and pedaling surreys, fanciful carriages that seat two to four, with pedals for each. For an energy boost, try the softly sweet and chewy saltwater taffy sold in on of several Forbes shops along Atlantic Avenue. History and military buffs can visit dozens of historic houses and naval and military museums, or pay homage at Cape Henry to the First Landing Cross, marking the point where settlers are believed to have landed in 1607, before they moved on to Jamestown. Collections of paintings and, especially, of period furniture and Tiffany glass make the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk well worth the 20-minute drive. 
 For a mind-changing experience, there is the visitors' center of the Association for Research and Enlightenment, a thriving monument to its founder, Edgar Cayce (1877-1945), one of the century's foremost psychics, often considered the father of holistic medicine. Here you can see his library and films about his life and work, browse through the gift and book shop, be tested for your own E.S.P. prowess, or spend time in the spa where colon hydrotherapy -- aka an enema-- is only one of the treatments dispensed to purify the body and, with luck, the soul as well.
 To get back to nature, children and adults can be beguiled by the watery wonders of the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center with its salt marsh and boat rides through the bay and displays of denizens as varied as surging sharks and delicately diaphanous jellyfish. Or you can always go crabbing at one of dozens of sites, then do the steaming and spicing yourself.

HEADLINE: Colorado Conservatives at War over Tax Cap

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
There are circles in which the ultimate Colorado icon is neither Snowmass Mountain nor Coors beer, but a set of fiscal handcuffs called the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights.
 That constitutional cap on state and local spending, imposed in 1992, has been so effective in curbing government growth that tax opponents are making it the centerpiece of a national campaign. Similar measures are headed for the ballot this fall in California and perhaps Ohio, and parallel efforts are under way in more than a dozen other states.
For some, the long-term targets include Washington, where many on the right are troubled by the rivers of red ink that have continued to flow despite Republican rule. ''It's the ultimate goal of what we're trying to do,'' said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. ''We want constitutional limits on the size of government.'' 
 But even as the Colorado measure galvanizes antispending groups elsewhere, it is dividing them at home, prompting a right-on-right fight that is luring outside combatants and drawing blood.
 On one side is Gov. Bill Owens, the two-term Republican once promoted by National Review as a conservative of presidential timber. Arguing that the strict provision has forced a fiscal crisis, Mr. Owens is championing a ballot measure that would suspend the limit for five years, allowing the state to spend an additional $3.7 billion. Otherwise, he warns, the cap may be repealed.
 On the other side are former allies who call the governor a tax-raising apostate discrediting the law he claims to protect. In addition to Mr. Norquist, they include the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and the former House majority leader, Dick Armey, a leader of an antitax group called FreedomWorks.
 In June Mr. Armey, a Texas Republican, swept into town for a televised debate and called Mr. Owens a pledge-breaking politician caught drinking ''backslider's wine.'' Smiling through clenched teeth, Mr. Owens accused Mr. Armey of adding billions to the national debt while in Congress, and his allies passed out copies of Mr. Armey's budget votes.
 That was garden-party talk compared with the comments from Mr. Norquist, who said in an interview that Mr. Owens had gone ''beyond weak-kneed; he's put on the other team's uniform and is leading the charge.'' Retorting in another interview that Mr. Norquist ''never lets the facts get in the way,'' Mr. Owens said his former ally had ''tried to threaten me'' with political reprisal, and he challenged him to a debate.
 Mr. Norquist later responded: ''Consider that an accepted challenge. He's finished nationally.''
 Efforts to girdle government growth date back to at least 1978, when Proposition 13 cut California's property taxes and inaugurated an antitax age. About 30 states now have tax or spending limits, though few have had much impact. Most are statutory, as opposed to constitutional, making them easy to override. And many permit considerable government expansion.
 The stricter Colorado cap does three things: it imposes firm spending caps (which grow only to reflect population and inflation), returns any excess revenues to taxpayers and allows only voters, not legislators, to override the caps.
 Both sides agree that the measure reined in the budget. The growth in per capita spending fell to 31 percent in the decade after the cap from 72 percent in the decade before, according to the Independence Institute, a Colorado group that favors it. 
 Supporters say the cap ignited the subsequent economic boom, with low taxes luring businesses. They also say it kept the state from overspending when flush only to face painful cuts later. ''Tabor saved Colorado's fiscal fanny,'' said Jon Caldara, the institute's president.
 But the Bell Policy Center in Denver, an opponent of the law, found sharp reductions in immunizations, mental health services and inspections of day care centers, along with an increase in substandard roads and uninsured children. The center also blamed the cap for reducing access to higher education. ''We're taking away the opportunity for people to better their lives,'' said Wade Buchanan, the center's president. 
 In 2003, David H. Koch, a major supporter of conservative causes, helped establish a nonprofit group, the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, which promotes spending limits nationwide. It split off from an earlier Koch-backed enterprise, now called FreedomWorks. It, too, is pushing similar measures in 10 states. Yet another group, the American Legislative Exchange Council, is promoting a model bill among conservative state legislators.
 Conservative frustration with government growth increased with President Bush's first term, which added more than $1 trillion to the national debt. Conservatives once talked of electing their own; they now talk of electing their own and tying their hands.
 Stop us before we spend again? ''Yes, that's really it,'' said Mr. Armey, who argues that the pressures to spend, reinforced by lobbyists and contributors, can overwhelm even the firmest conservatives.
 In Ohio, the secretary of state, J. Kenneth Blackwell, is gathering signatures for a ballot initiative this fall. A Republican running for governor next year, Mr. Blackwell readily concedes that the increased spending over the past decade has come with Republicans controlling both the legislature and governor's mansion.
 ''The G.O.P. has given the state the two largest tax increases in state history,'' he said. ''You need fiscal architecture in the Constitution that establishes guardrails.'' 
 Another major fight is under way in California, where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has pushed an antispending provision onto the fall ballot, albeit one seemingly less strict than that of Colorado. 
 In Maine, a veteran tax opponent, Mary Adams, is gathering signatures to put a spending cap on the ballot next year. And last year, the leader of the Wisconsin Senate, Mary Panzer, a moderate Republican, delayed convening a special session to consider a spending cap. That drew a primary challenge from a conservative rival, Glenn Grothman, who defeated her in what Mr. Norquist calls a watershed moment. 
 ''It's one thing when policy analysts are supporting something,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''It's another when it becomes the kind of thing politicians lose seats over.''
 Other states where advocates are pushing caps include Arizona, Kansas, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. 
 In seeking to suspend Colorado's spending cap, Mr. Owens notes that it has an unforgiving feature -- the so-called ratchet. That permanently lowers the cap when revenues fall, as they did by 17 percent in the recent slump. Though tax collections are rising again, the reduced baseline prevents the state from spending the money. 
 Mr. Owens said Colorado's problem was compounded by a separate constitutional provision, Amendment 23, which locks in higher spending on grades K through 12, forcing deep cuts elsewhere.
 But his opponents say a defeat for Mr. Owens will send a signal nationwide that voters like spending caps. ''I need all of you to step up and keep pressure on the governor,'' said Mr. Caldara of the Independence Institute, at a spring meeting of tax opponents from across the country.
 Citing the need for a national figure to rally the local troops, Mr. Caldara said, ''If we've got this bomb named Dick Armey, we need him right now.''
 Two months later, Mr. Armey touched down in Denver, where he met with about a dozen Republican legislators, calling them courageous to oppose a popular governor from their own party. But leaving the Capitol, he was greeted bytwo dozen protestors chanting, ''Dick Armey go home.'' And he got a similarly rough treatment at The Denver Post, where Bob Ewegen, the deputy editorial page editor, dismissed one of Mr. Armey's arguments as ''either ludicrous or duplicitous.''
 By comparison, the debate with the governor was restrained, with Mr. Armey calling him a tax-raiser and Mr. Owens striking the pose of the misunderstood conservative who had cut taxes 41 times. Of his conservative critics, Mr. Owens later said: ''Their job is to build memberships, keep the base active and convince members that the bad guys are always out to get them. In this case they're wrong.''

HEADLINE: My Generation: Hope I Shop Before I Get Old

BYLINE: By NINA MUNK. 
Nina Munk is a contributing editor for Vanity Fair.

 BODY:
MY generation was created by Time magazine. Calling us ''the 20-something generation,'' the cover article of July 16, 1990, herded and then defined the 48 million Americans born from 1965 to 1977. 
 ''They have trouble making decisions,'' the article said. ''They would rather hike in the Himalayas than climb a corporate ladder. They have few heroes, no anthems, no style to call their own. They crave entertainment, but their attention span is as short as one zap of a TV dial. They hate yuppies, hippies and druggies. They postpone marriage because they dread divorce. They sneer at Range Rovers, Rolexes and red suspenders.'' 
The myth-making continued: raised as ''latchkey kids'' in homes where television was a surrogate parent, we 20-somethings felt abandoned, according to Time. We were resentful and afraid of commitment. Even more, we were paralyzed by the social problems surrounding us -- described by the magazine as ''racial strife, homelessness, AIDS, fractured families and federal deficits.'' 
 It was huge, the impact of that Time cover. Overnight, an entire industry of management and marketing experts began to collect data, spew facts and analyze those 48 million consumers. Desperate to sell their products to what was now named Generation X, after Douglas Coupland's 1991 novel about three aimless, disaffected 20-something slackers, companies got to know our psyches inside out. We were ''the children of neglect'' (according to U.S. News and World Report) and ''the generation of diminished expectations'' (BusinessWeek); we had ''almost no one to look up to'' (Time). 
 Someone we did look up to in the early 90's was Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. Anguished, alienated and wearing a ratty wool cardigan on stage, he moaned to no one in particular: ''All alone is all we are.'' Xers were cynical, apathetic, disillusioned, withdrawn, anticommercial and angry, we were informed by specialists. ''I don't buy things,'' a (supposedly) representative 24-year-old boasted to The Los Angeles Times in 1993, especially ''if they're advertised.'' 
 It was a useful fiction, the idea of Generation Xers -- a way to create a homogeneous group out of 48 million people who, in hindsight, may have had very little in common except their youth. At the time, though, my generation seemed relevant and interesting and cool. We stood for something. We were defiant! And independent! Marketers were struggling to understand the real us! We were worth something.
 These days, no one cares about Generation X. What is there to care about? We started turning 40 this year -- we're on the precipice of middle age -- and no one's writing cover articles about us. We're conventional. At the same time, we finally do have something that unites us: shopping. It has become the defining occupation of my generation. 
 We don't just shop for anything, of course. Generation X is defined by a few recognizable artifacts: our flat-screen TV's, our $869 Bugaboo Frog strollers with matching parasol and diaper bag, our Treo phones, our Miele dishwashers, our shiny Dualit toasters, our spearmint-colored Marc Jacobs handbags, our Sigerson Morrison shoes and our Land Rovers. 
 Xers continue to sneer at baby boomers, the postwar generation born between 1946 and 1964. They're selfish and shallow and materialistic, we tell one another knowingly. Yet, according to the new American Express Platinum Luxury Survey, the average Gen Xer now spends 18 percent more on luxury goods than the average baby boomer. Our credit cards are weighing us down like millstones. We're juggling interest-only and adjustable-rate mortgages. To build the great big bathrooms and great big kitchens that define us, we're taking out home-equity loans.
 ''Consumption is this generation's currency,'' shrugs Jane Rinzler Buckingham, whose market research firm, Youth Intelligence, helps big companies understand Generation X. ''They don't have government or causes to believe in, so the Gucci bucket hat is their currency instead.'' If shopping for Gucci hats is our version of the march on Selma, appliance showrooms are our Woodstock.
 Reflecting the consuming passion of my generation, the hot new magazines are ''magalogs,'' or shopping catalogs disguised, barely, as magazines. Baby boomers may be reading Architectural Digest (median age: 49) or The New Yorker (53). But Gen Xers prefer Lucky: The Magazine About Shopping (median age: 31) and Domino: The Shopping Magazine for Your Home (35). The Gen X male, who is also occupied by shopping -- and by the unwanted hair on his back -- has his very own magalog, Cargo.
 James Truman, former editorial director at Conde Nast, helped conceive the magalogs Lucky and Domino. ''I felt they were a truthful reflection of what was going on in the culture,'' he told The Independent a few months back, and he was right. ''Everything is for sale. There is no point in pretending otherwise. So let's just put the address, the phone number and the Web site under the item and not try to make a hoopla about it signifying this or that. You don't have to get through articles on politics and serious issues. Here's the merchandise.'' 
 Specialists whose careers were built on deciphering and decoding the psyches of Generation X say that shopping is not what identifies us; shopping is merely a symptom. Deep down we are not materialistic or grasping; our compulsive shopping is an act of substitution. Filled with a sense of nostalgia for our lost childhood, we're filling a void. We're homesick. 
 Ann Fishman, president of Generational Targeted Marketing, reminded me: ''This generation got no support from family, religion or government. They grew up as latchkey kids. They had to check their trick-or-treat bags for razor blades. They were taught that sex can kill.'' And so? ''So,'' Ms. Fishman answered, ''they want someplace that yells 'Home!' It's really important to them to have a home.'' 
 IN other words, our Sub-Zero refrigerators and Dualit toasters are substitutes for the ideal home we never had, just as our too-big, too-heavy Bugaboo strollers are a substitute for the ideal parent we never had, and our flat-screen TV's are a substitute for all those years our parents left us at home alone. All alone is all we are.
 ''The world is a confusing place, period, end of story,'' added Ms. Rinzler Buckingham, the market researcher, wanting to be helpful. ''But for us, we were a generation where everything was so messed up, from politics to the environment, holes in the ozone layer, high divorce rates, AIDS. We feel rudderless, and no one has helped give us a rudder. 
 ''You know,'' she continued, ''it's like, 'My life is hard enough already, so if splurging on a big entertainment unit makes me feel better, why not?'''

HEADLINE: Death Tax? Double Tax? For Most, It's No Tax 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN Congress comes back from its summer recess, one of the first things Senate Republicans will try to do, again, is kill the estate tax.
 Perhaps no other tax has so many passionate, persevering and politically organized opponents as the estate tax, or ''death tax,'' as they have branded it.
 As Michael J. Graetz and Ian Shapiro of Yale recount in ''Death by a Thousand Cuts'' (Princeton University Press), their entertaining account of the repeal movement, opponents of the estate tax have already achieved a remarkable political feat by building broad public support for abolishing a tax that currently affects only 2 percent of all estates.
 But repeal would be costly -- more than $70 billion a year, once it was complete -- and many of the populist arguments in favor of repeal are misleading. If estate or inheritance taxes were frozen at today's levels, they would have almost no impact on family farmers and most small-business owners. 
 And while opponents contend that the estate tax is a ''double tax,'' many of the earnings that are subject to it were never taxed in the first place.
 The tax opponents, many of whom began as political neophytes more than 20 years ago, lead a powerful coalition of small-business owners, farmers, trade associations and corporate lobbying groups like the American Council on Capital Formation.
 Killing the estate tax is one of President Bush's top priorities, and the House of Representatives has already passed a repeal measure four different times. But Senate Republicans, despite attempts to cut a deal with conservative Democrats before the summer recess, have been stalled on the issue.
 Unable to muster the 60 votes they need to overcome a Democratic filibuster, Senate leaders are now vowing to push for full repeal as soon as they come back in September.
 Hoping to pressure Democrats from conservative farming states just before Congress adjourned, two business-backed advocacy groups spent about $500,000 on television ads last month in states including Montana, North Dakota, Arkansas and Louisiana.
 The ads, produced by the American Family Business Institute and the Free Enterprise Fund -- the first an advocacy group dedicated to abolishing the estate tax, the second an advocacy group aimed at a wider range of tax cuts -- focused on images of soldiers fighting on D-Day in World War II.
 ''The I.R.S. hits this greatest generation with an unjust double tax, the death tax,'' the narrator intoned in an ad aimed at North Dakota. Viewers are urged to ''tell Kent Conrad,'' the state's Democratic senator, to ''change his vote.''
 But despite the populist rhetoric and oft-repeated horror stories about families being forced to sell their farms in order to pay estate taxes, the battle is over a very large amount of money held by a very small number of families. A report last month by the Congressional Budget Office found that in 2000 only 2 percent of all estates -- about 52,000 -- were subject to any estate tax. At that point, taxes were imposed only on estates worth $675,000 or more. The limit rose to $1.5 million in 2004, and if that limit had been in effect in 2000, only 13,771 estates -- fewer than 1 percent -- would have been subject to the tax. All but 740 of them would have had enough in liquid assets to cover estate tax liabilities, the office estimated.
 At the moment, taxes are imposed only on estates worth more than $1.5 million. Under Mr. Bush's tax cut of 2001, the estate tax is set to shrink steadily over this decade and disappear in 2010. But the 2001 bill called for the estate tax to reappear in full force in 2011.
 The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that full repeal would cost $290 billion over the next 10 years, but that calculation understates the true cost because full repeal would not occur until 2011. 
 Once the estate tax was fully repealed, the Treasury would lose more than $70 billion a year in today's dollars. Over the first 10 years of full repeal, the cost would total more than $700 billion, plus interest. Assuming that the government is still running an annual deficit in 2011, which is more likely than not, the total 10-year cost would be close to $1 trillion. 
 A compromise being floated by Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, could be almost as expensive. Indeed, because of a strange wrinkle, the compromise could end up being far more generous to many heirs than outright repeal.
 Mr. Kyl's proposal called for excluding estate taxes on all property up to $3.5 million and taxing anything above that amount at 15 percent -- the same rate now charged on capital gains. Under current law, estate tax rates range up to about 45 percent.
 As a practical matter, Mr. Kyl's approach would eliminate the estate tax for more than 99 percent of all families and greatly reduce taxes for the few who owed anything at all. If the $3.5 million exclusion were in effect in 2000, the Congressional Budget Office estimated, only 3,676 estates -- about 0.15 percent of all estates -- would have had to pay any tax. But the proposed compromise also comes with an important twist that could make it more expensive than the $53 billion a year estimated by Congressional tax scorers.
 The twist is that the proposal would retain a big tax break that is supposed to disappear along with the estate tax. That break is known as the ''stepped-up basis,'' and it means that an heir does not owe any capital gains taxes on any increase in value of property during the life of the person who died. A mansion that appreciated to $10 million from $1 million, for example, would not be subject to any capital gains taxes on that profit if an heir sold it. For many families with estates worth less than $3.5 million, that could amount to a double tax break. A person could build up wealth for years, yet avoid paying taxes because the gains were all ''unrealized.'' His children could then inherit the property, sell it and avoid both the capital gains and estate taxes.
 The added cost of retaining a stepped-up basis may be only partially reflected in the official cost estimates of Mr. Kyl's proposal, because it is difficult to estimate when people will sell inherited property. But the American Family Business Institute has said that a very high percentage of heirs sell or restructure their holdings within five years. 
 That's why it is misleading for opponents of the estate tax to claim that it is a double tax on earnings that have already been taxed once.
 In many cases, that's not true. ''A lot of assets that passed through very large estates have never been taxed and never will be,'' said Mr. Graetz of Yale. ''It's a very big issue.''
 For thousands of single-digit millionaires, that could be a very good deal indeed.

 In 2000, when the estate tax exemption was $675,000, only about 2 percent of all estates -- 52,000 -- owed any tax. At higher exemption levels, the number owing tax would have been far lower.

SHOWERY

Southern California -- Who says the desert is dry? In late summer, inland areas of Southern California and other parts of the Southwest are hit by short, intense storms like this one over Twentynine Palms, Calif., on Monday. The phenomenon, known as the desert monsoon, may be more intense this year because of moisture dumped into Baja California by early Atlantic hurricanes.

DRENCHED

Shanghai -- It's typhoon season in Asia, and of the nine that China has encountered so far, the most damaging has been Matsa, which caused heavy flooding in Shanghai last Sunday. At least 12 people were killed in China; 46,000 homes were destroyed and an additional 140,000 damaged. Financial losses were estimated at $1.7 billion.

HAZY

Kuala Lumpur -- Smoke and haze from extensive forest fires in Sumatra enveloped the Malaysian capital all week; on Tuesday, it partly obscured the Petronas Towers and other skyscrapers. Health officials described the air quality as hazardous and urged people to stay indoors, schools were closed for two days, and airports were shut down temporarily.

TINDER-DRY

Spain -- A tanker in southern Spain last Sunday dumped water on a forest fire, one of several throughout the country. The fires are a consequence of Spain's worst drought in decades, and water supplies are strained by the demands of recent economic growth . Farm losses alone are estimated at more than $2 billion.

FROZEN

Australia -- It's winter in Australia, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is supposed to snow. A cold snap, however, brought snow on Wednesday to Korumburra, 60 miles from Melbourne. Accumulations were even reported at sea level, a rare occurrence in southern Australia. By the end of the week, however, all was right with the world, with the snow retreating to higher elevations.

HEADLINE: The Rail Tunnel, Pro and Con

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Take This $100 Million. Please'' does not mention the following points:
 The Taub Urban Research Center study ''Tunnel Vision'' concluded that ''the proposed hub port and rail tunnel are Industrial Era Projects ill suited for the information economy of the 21st century. Furthermore, the proposed hub port and rail tunnel represent a genuine threat to many of the communities and industries currently located in southern Brooklyn.''
 Major rail companies have not committed to using the tunnel and it has not been established that the rail rates charged would be competitive with rates charged by truckers.
 Finally, studies forecast only a 7.5 percent decrease in truck traffic if the tunnel is built. This would have little effect on road traffic and diesel emissions. The $100 million should be used for better conceived transportation projects.

HEADLINE: High Cost of Wi-Fi

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof wrongly chastises New York for neglecting to emulate the citywide wireless networks in rural Oregon (''When Pigs Wi-Fi,'' column, Aug. 7). Economic feasibility explains the discrepancy. 
 Wi-Fi in densely populated urban areas like New York is far more costly than in the uncluttered rural plains. Prevailing Wi-Fi technology employing high frequency radio waves confronts difficulties in penetrating dense objects that necessitate thousands of transmitters. Accordingly, the city estimates that New Yorkers would be compelled to cough up approximately $1 billion to build a Wi-Fi infrastructure.
That staggering subsidy would also stifle the private sector development of new technologies. Companies like XG Technology and Flarion, for instance, are flirting with lower-frequency waves to deliver the same high-speed data, reducing the equipment required and cutting the deployment cost sharply. 
 Too great an infatuation with Wi-Fi will make the United States the caboose, not the locomotive, of the wireless sector.

HEADLINE: One Global Game, Two Sets of Rules 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
GLOBALIZATION is imperfectly understood by many American policy makers, with dangerous consequences for the United States economy, says Clyde Prestowitz, author of ''Three Billion New Capitalists: The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East'' (Basic Books, 2005, $26). A former trade negotiator in the Reagan administration, he is president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. Here are excerpts from a conversation:

Q. Why do you say that many American policy makers don't understand globalization?

A. There are two different concepts of globalization. One concept is based on the American experience, which is one of a democratic country under a rule of law that holds to market principles. This view holds that the objective of economic policy is to improve consumer welfare and believes in the thinking of David Ricardo and Adam Smith about comparative advantage and free trade maximizing consumer wealth.

Q. Doesn't everybody embrace that view?

A. No, there's a second concept, which is a strategic-trade, export-led, growth kind of globalization. This concept is held by many countries around the world, particularly in Asia. It focuses on economic development as a matter of strategic significance. It explicitly aims to achieve trade surpluses and large dollar reserves. It's aimed at fostering production and a high savings rate but suppressing consumption.
There are two different games going on. The difficulty in the United States is that frequently the second game is not recognized or acknowledged or, if it is, it's dismissed as being not significant.

Q. What are the consequences of not speaking the same language about globalization?

A. We have a very distorted global economy. It is tilted. There's one consumer, which is the United States. All the other major countries are producers and net exporters. The United States consumes far more than it produces and has to borrow money from the rest of the world to finance that consumption. The rest of the world, particularly Asia, and particularly the central banks of Japan and China, provide a kind of vendor financing to the United States to enable it to continue buying their exports. You have a kind of Ponzi scheme that constitutes the global economy. Like any Ponzi scheme, it's not indefinitely sustainable. At some point, the world will run out of savings to finance American consumption, or the rest of the world will begin to doubt the ability of the United States to make good on its obligations. There will be a collapse of one kind or another.

Q. What do you think of the current China debate?

A. As with Japan back in the 1980's, I think Washington has too much faith in theoretical macroeconomic models. There's a lot of emphasis on getting the Chinese to revalue the yuan, which they have recently done. This reminds me of the pressure put on Japan to revalue the yen. If you look at the history, the yen has strengthened by more than 100 percent since the mid-1980's but we still have a huge trade deficit with Japan.
 What's not recognized in Washington is that the world is tilted. The United States has built an economic structure of consumption. The rest of the world, particularly Japan and China, have built economic structures favoring production and exports. Currency revaluations have not reduced these trade imbalances so far.

Q. Can there be such a thing as fair trade in these relationships?

A. I think there can be, but there has to be a recognition by the American side of the existence of these different concepts of globalization.

Q. What should the American government be doing?

A. Insist that the rules of the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund and all the various global institutions be observed. Japan is part of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. It's supposed to be floating its currency. But it intervenes periodically in currency markets to manage the value of its currency. There ought to be some discipline. When countries are engaging in offering financial investment incentives, those are arguably indirect export subsidies and are of questionable validity under globally agreed trade and investment rules.

Q. Should the real debate be about China or about how the United States is competing?

A. This quintessentially is a debate about American competitiveness. The biggest single thing we should do is to get our own fiscal house in order. We are overconsuming. That is making us very dependent on foreign financing.

Q. Why is it a problem if other people want to sell the United States their things and finance the purchases?

A. It's not a problem for a while. In fact, it feels really good for a while because you get free consumption. But as Warren Buffett has pointed out, in the long term, it turns you into a sharecropper. To finance the consumption, you keep selling off your assets. You sell the garage. Then you sell the guesthouse. After a while, there's nothing left to sell and you have to go to work and earn real money to pay your debts. Your kids and grandkids will have less opportunity and lower standards of living.

Q. Aside from fiscal policies, what are the other elements of a response?

A. We need to have a strategy. When I.B.M. sold its PC division to China, C.E.O. Sam Palmisano told The New York Times that I.B.M. wants to be part of China's strategy. I don't blame him. If I were the head of I.B.M., I'd want to be part of China's strategy, too. But it raises an interesting question: If you ask an American C.E.O. if he or she wants to be part of America's strategy, none of them can answer the question. Because America doesn't have a strategy.

Q. In a nutshell, what should America's strategy be?

A. We have to maximize American strength. The United States is innovative. We have strengths in high technology, research and development and entrepreneurial undertakings. We should be making the investments in R.&D., technology infrastructure and education to maintain and maximize those strengths.

HEADLINE: Don't Put Away That Yawn-o-Meter Just Yet 

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
IT'S August. It's time for a doldrums check.
 The price of an ounce of gold, which has risen 60 percent since the end of 2000, is up just 1.7 percent this year.
The fixed-income market, including government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgages, has a return through Thursday of 1.6 percent, compared with 2.1 percent for the same period last year, according to Merrill Lynch bond indexes. In the junk-bond market, the 2.3 percent so far looks unlikely to grow to the full-year total of 10.9 percent in 2004. 
 Only one of the stock market's three main gauges, the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index, has a gain this year -- and it is only 1.5 percent.
 The brightest news is in commodities, led by crude oil, which is up 53.9 percent, after a 33.6 percent increase in 2004. But for other commodities, the performance is much tamer, with the nonenergy portions of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index up just 1.43 percent through Thursday, compared with a 45.6 percent gain in the energy sector, which includes crude oil, unleaded gasoline, natural gas, and heating oil and diesel.
 So, except for energy, the year is not going all that well for investors, who have not been given many easy options for their money.
 In these becalmed markets, many people have chosen to go abroad, although the rebound of the dollar, especially against the euro and the Japanese yen, has cut into their returns, too. Others have concentrated on stocks paying dividends, and some have taken a ride on growth stocks.
 Of the $96.1 billion, on a net basis, that has poured into stock mutual funds so far this year, $44.4 billion, or 46.2 percent, has gone into international funds, which concentrate their purchases outside the United States, according to AMG Data Services, which tracks the flow of money into and out of mutual funds. That inflow is already high enough to be the second-best year in AMG Data's records, dating back to 1992. 
 Of the $33.8 billion that has gone into taxable bond funds, $8.3 billion has flowed into international or global funds. Over $18 billion has gone into equity funds concentrating on dividend-paying stocks, and more than $9 billion into aggressive-growth stock funds. 
 Whether American stocks and bonds and gold and other commodities break out from here depends on a lot going right. And that is a big bet right now.
 In 2004, things did go right. The S.&P. 500 jumped 7.2 percent after the presidential election. In the fixed-income market, returns accelerated from an annual rate of 3.5 percent in mid-August to 5.7 percent by year-end. 
 But the catalyst that helped stocks-- the presidential election -- will not be there this year. As for bonds, it is not clear that investors can count on the surprising assistance they received at the end of 2004: longer-term interest rates remaining historically low despite short-term rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
 For now, the environment for stocks is O.K. -- but not great. The bullishness indicator of the American Association of Individual Investors, which worries investors when it is too high, has only recently fallen below the excessive optimism level, according to Ned Davis Research. So that is just a mild positive for stocks. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500 is down to 19.89, well below its highs but still above historical averages.
 The environment for bonds is not as good, because there is no sign that the Federal Reserve will soon stop raising its benchmark short-term interest rate, which stands at 3.5 percent after the increase last week.
 Since the end of June, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note has risen a third of a percentage point, to 4.24 percent, and the average national rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 5.89 percent, up from its low for the year of 5.53 percent in June. 
 The price of gold is not likely to be helped by further rate increases by the Fed, either, said John Hathaway, the portfolio manager of the Tocqueville Gold Fund. ''The biggest thing for gold has been the increase in short-term interest rates,'' he said. ''It's been a headwind for gold.''
 But a stock rally could be started by a retreat in oil prices, which would ease fears of slowing economic and corporate earnings growth.
 Then again, with some economists predicting 4.5 percent growth in the second half of the year, an oil retreat might make bond investors fearful of excessive growth and inflation, sending prices lower and yields higher. Higher yields would mean higher mortgage rates, which could slow the housing market, curb consumer spending and, in the end, worry stock investors.
 So it's a seesaw battle between oil and interest rates and stocks and bonds. It may be a very long season of the doldrums.

 Although the three major stock indexes have recovered from their April lows, only the Standard & Poor's 500 is ahead for the year.

HEADLINE: Someone Tell the President the War Is Over

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
LIKE the Japanese soldier marooned on an island for years after V-J Day, President Bush may be the last person in the country to learn that for Americans, if not Iraqis, the war in Iraq is over. ''We will stay the course,'' he insistently tells us from his Texas ranch. What do you mean we, white man? 
 A president can't stay the course when his own citizens (let alone his own allies) won't stay with him. The approval rate for Mr. Bush's handling of Iraq plunged to 34 percent in last weekend's Newsweek poll -- a match for the 32 percent that approved L.B.J.'s handling of Vietnam in early March 1968. (The two presidents' overall approval ratings have also converged: 41 percent for Johnson then, 42 percent for Bush now.) On March 31, 1968, as L.B.J.'s ratings plummeted further, he announced he wouldn't seek re-election, commencing our long extrication from that quagmire.
 But our current Texas president has even outdone his predecessor; Mr. Bush has lost not only the country but also his army. Neither bonuses nor fudged standards nor the faking of high school diplomas has solved the recruitment shortfall. Now Jake Tapper of ABC News reports that the armed forces are so eager for bodies they will flout ''don't ask, don't tell'' and hang on to gay soldiers who tell, even if they tell the press. 
 The president's cable cadre is in disarray as well. At Fox News Bill O'Reilly is trashing Donald Rumsfeld for his incompetence, and Ann Coulter is chiding Mr. O'Reilly for being a defeatist. In an emblematic gesture akin to waving a white flag, Robert Novak walked off a CNN set and possibly out of a job rather than answer questions about his role in smearing the man who helped expose the administration's prewar inflation of Saddam W.M.D.'s. (On this sinking ship, it's hard to know which rat to root for.) 
 As if the right-wing pundit crackup isn't unsettling enough, Mr. Bush's top war strategists, starting with Mr. Rumsfeld and Gen. Richard Myers, have of late tried to rebrand the war in Iraq as what the defense secretary calls ''a global struggle against violent extremism.'' A struggle is what you have with your landlord. When the war's uber-managers start using euphemisms for a conflict this lethal, it's a clear sign that the battle to keep the Iraq war afloat with the American public is lost.
 That battle crashed past the tipping point this month in Ohio. There's historical symmetry in that. It was in Cincinnati on Oct. 7, 2002, that Mr. Bush gave the fateful address that sped Congressional ratification of the war just days later. The speech was a miasma of self-delusion, half-truths and hype. The president said that ''we know that Iraq and Al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade,'' an exaggeration based on evidence that the Senate Intelligence Committee would later find far from conclusive. He said that Saddam ''could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year'' were he able to secure ''an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball.'' Our own National Intelligence Estimate of Oct. 1 quoted State Department findings that claims of Iraqi pursuit of uranium in Africa were ''highly dubious.'' 
 It was on these false premises -- that Iraq was both a collaborator on 9/11 and about to inflict mushroom clouds on America -- that honorable and brave young Americans were sent off to fight. Among them were the 19 marine reservists from a single suburban Cleveland battalion slaughtered in just three days at the start of this month. As they perished, another Ohio marine reservist who had served in Iraq came close to winning a Congressional election in southern Ohio. Paul Hackett, a Democrat who called the president a ''chicken hawk,'' received 48 percent of the vote in exactly the kind of bedrock conservative Ohio district that decided the 2004 election for Mr. Bush. 
 These are the tea leaves that all Republicans, not just Chuck Hagel, are reading now. Newt Gingrich called the Hackett near-victory ''a wake-up call.'' The resolutely pro-war New York Post editorial page begged Mr. Bush (to no avail) to ''show some leadership'' by showing up in Ohio to salute the fallen and their families. A Bush loyalist, Senator George Allen of Virginia, instructed the president to meet with Cindy Sheehan, the mother camping out in Crawford, as ''a matter of courtesy and decency.'' Or, to translate his Washingtonese, as a matter of politics. Only someone as adrift from reality as Mr. Bush would need to be told that a vacationing president can't win a standoff with a grief-stricken parent commandeering TV cameras and the blogosphere 24/7.
 Such political imperatives are rapidly bringing about the war's end. That's inevitable for a war of choice, not necessity, that was conceived in politics from the start. Iraq was a Bush administration idee fixe before there was a 9/11. Within hours of that horrible trauma, according to Richard Clarke's ''Against All Enemies,'' Mr. Rumsfeld was proposing Iraq as a battlefield, not because the enemy that attacked America was there, but because it offered ''better targets'' than the shadowy terrorist redoubts of Afghanistan. It was easier to take out Saddam -- and burnish Mr. Bush's credentials as a slam-dunk ''war president,'' suitable for a ''Top Gun'' victory jig -- than to shut down Al Qaeda and smoke out its leader ''dead or alive.'' 
 But just as politics are a bad motive for choosing a war, so they can be a doomed engine for running a war. In an interview with Tim Russert early last year, Mr. Bush said, ''The thing about the Vietnam War that troubles me, as I look back, was it was a political war,'' adding that the ''essential'' lesson he learned from Vietnam was to not have ''politicians making military decisions.'' But by then Mr. Bush had disastrously ignored that very lesson; he had let Mr. Rumsfeld publicly rebuke the Army's chief of staff, Eric Shinseki, after the general dared tell the truth: that several hundred thousand troops would be required to secure Iraq. To this day it's our failure to provide that security that has turned the country into the terrorist haven it hadn't been before 9/11 -- ''the central front in the war on terror,'' as Mr. Bush keeps reminding us, as if that might make us forget he's the one who recklessly created it. 
 The endgame for American involvement in Iraq will be of a piece with the rest of this sorry history. ''It makes no sense for the commander in chief to put out a timetable'' for withdrawal, Mr. Bush declared on the same day that 14 of those Ohio troops were killed by a roadside bomb in Haditha. But even as he spoke, the war's actual commander, Gen. George Casey, had already publicly set a timetable for ''some fairly substantial reductions'' to start next spring. Officially this calendar is tied to the next round of Iraqi elections, but it's quite another election this administration has in mind. The priority now is less to save Jessica Lynch (or Iraqi democracy) than to save Rick Santorum and every other endangered Republican facing voters in November 2006.
 Nothing that happens on the ground in Iraq can turn around the fate of this war in America: not a shotgun constitution rushed to meet an arbitrary deadline, not another Iraqi election, not higher terrorist body counts, not another battle for Falluja (where insurgents may again regroup, The Los Angeles Times reported last week). A citizenry that was asked to accept tax cuts, not sacrifice, at the war's inception is hardly in the mood to start sacrificing now. There will be neither the volunteers nor the money required to field thewholesale additional American troops that might bolster the security situation in Iraq. 
 WHAT lies ahead now in Iraq instead is not victory, which Mr. Bush has never clearly defined anyway, but an exit (or triage) strategy that may echo Johnson's March 1968 plan for retreat from Vietnam: some kind of negotiations (in this case, with Sunni elements of the insurgency), followed by more inflated claims about the readiness of the local troops-in-training, whom we'll then throw to the wolves. Such an outcome may lead to even greater disaster, but this administration long ago squandered the credibility needed to make the difficult case that more human and financial resources might prevent Iraq from continuing its descent into civil war and its devolution into jihad central.
 Thus the president's claim on Thursday that ''no decision has been made yet'' about withdrawing troops from Iraq can be taken exactly as seriously as the vice president's preceding fantasy that the insurgency is in its ''last throes.'' The country has already made the decision for Mr. Bush. We're outta there. Now comes the hard task of identifying the leaders who can pick up the pieces of the fiasco that has made us more vulnerable, not less, to the terrorists who struck us four years ago next month.

 BODY:
On a wide-ranging visit to Long Island this month that included meetings with numerous business leaders and public officials, Senator Hillary Clinton tried to push the issue of regional planning into the front of people's minds, where it should be. 
 We live in a densely populated region that builds, sprawls and evolves largely through the uncoordinated activities of hundreds of governmental bodies large and small, which get little encouragement from the federal government to work together. Senator Clinton noted that millions of Long Islanders -- like the residents of other older suburbs across the country -- live in a policy blind spot, unable to tap resources spent on higher government priorities, like the redevelopment of inner cities or the paving of highways for exurban sprawl. 
Senator Clinton has introduced legislation to create a $250 million fund for redevelopment grants to local governments in old bedroom communities like ours, in a worthy but so-far-fruitless effort to spur federal reinvestment in the increasingly creaky suburban infrastructure. It is of a piece with the smart-growth agendas of County Executives Thomas Suozzi of Nassau and Steve Levy of Suffolk. Both men have seen setbacks of their efforts, most recently in the defeat of a plan to overhaul the Long Island Regional Planning Board. 
 The board is admired for its big-picture perspective but it has had little effect on policy. The plan was to turn it into a council, with more members, a broader outlook and a fresher approach to issues shaping Long Island's future. The plan was approved by a bipartisan majority in Suffolk's Legislature but died in Nassau's by one vote. That was an unfortunate victory for shortsighted critics who thought the plan was fatally flawed because it did not include members from towns and villages, which hold ultimate power over land-use decisions. That is a fair argument, but not one that justified killing off the opportunity to jump-start long overdue discussions about Long Island development.
 Long Island is lucky to have two county executives who think broadly, and cooperatively, about its future. Mr. Levy and Mr. Suozzi say they will pursue their efforts to reform the planning council through administrative changes, just as Senator Clinton vows to keep pressing for federal money. They deserve support. In a region whose very landscape has been marred by parochialism and self-interest, thinking bigger is often better.

HEADLINE: Big Tobacco, in Court Again. But the Stock Is Still Up.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
On and on they go, mammoth lawsuits against the nation's biggest tobacco companies. 
 Just two weeks ago, Philip Morris USA and five other cigarette makers were sued in a federal court in Boston by a group seeking to recover $60 billion for the government in Medicare benefits for smoking-related diseases. Lawyers for the group, the United Seniors Association, said the law also allowed the court to award an additional $60 billion to the plaintiff.
 The lawsuit is just the latest in more than 50 years of legal challenges to the tobacco industry. Hundreds of other cases are still pending in this country and abroad, including some that have been grinding on for years, like the federal government's effort to claim $280 billion in a racketeering case. 
 As the nation's largest cigarette maker with half the domestic market, Philip Morris, alone, is currently a defendant in 454 cases; it spent $933 million in legal costs from 2002 to 2004, with lawyers billing $850 an hour and, in rare cases, up to $1,000. 
 Are company officials concerned about the Boston case? Are they concerned about any case? To some extent, yes, they say. But this is an industry that long ago accepted litigation as a routine cost of business. 
 ''Obviously, we take the litigation very seriously,'' said Steven C. Parrish, a senior vice president of the Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris. Mr. Parrish added, ''We believe we have the appropriate strategies and resources to successfully manage the litigation.'' 
 Like other tobacco companies, Philip Morris has a modest staff that oversees the company's litigation and retains leading law firms and specific lawyers on a case-by-case basis.
 For the trial in the government lawsuit, which ended in June after nine months, much of the courtroom work was handled by two lawyers representing Philip Morris -- Dan K. Webb of Winston & Strawn in Chicago and Theodore V. Wells Jr. of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York -- along with David M. Bernick of Kirkland & Ellis in Chicago, who represented the Brown & Williamson tobacco company.
 Mr. Webb is a former United States attorney in Illinois who has represented Microsoft, General Electric and the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Wells has defended civil and white-collar criminal defendants, including former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, former Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey and the financier Michael Milken. Mr. Bernick, who has defended chemical and asbestos companies, specializes in complex corporate cases and has been retained by Philip Morris for a class-action tobacco case in New York. 
 With such legal power, the tobacco companies have enjoyed a reasonable measure of success in court.
 Since 1998, when the major tobacco companies settled lawsuits with the states for $246 billion over health care costs related to smoking, domestic cases involving Philip Morris as a defendant, alone or with other companies, have ended with 27 verdicts in favor of the defendants and 16 in favor of the plaintiffs, with potential combined awards of $948 million.
 But the company has appealed 13 of those cases. Of the remaining three, Philip Morris paid plaintiffs in two, for a total of $20.3 million. The other case was dismissed.
 Over the same period, Philip Morris's leading competitor, Reynolds American, which merged last year with Brown & Williamson and now has 30 percent of the domestic market, has been a defendant in 50 cases and has paid once, for $5 million.
 In the same years, the stock prices of Philip Morris and Reynolds American have more than doubled. 
 ''Tobacco companies have an excellent, excellent track record in litigation,'' said Christine Farkas, an equities analyst for Merrill Lynch who follows the industry. ''Is it disruptive to business? Yes. But if they lose at trial, they typically win on appeal.''
 The biggest lawsuit facing the industry is the government's racketeering case, which now hinges on a federal judge's ruling on liability and the Supreme Court's decision on whether to consider an appeal to sustain a request for $280 billion in damages that a lower court denied. 
 If the Supreme Court decides not to hear the government's appeal, the companies are facing a potential $14 billion judgment, an amount the government is seeking from the companies to finance a national stop-smoking campaign. 
 The government case is one of nine pending actions against Philip Morris as sole defendant or co-defendant in class-action lawsuits over health-related claims or a case involving multiple claims. The other Philip Morris cases involve plaintiffs seeking the recovery of health care costs, as well as tobacco prices and cigarette contraband. 
 In addition, Philip Morris is a defendant in 151 cases in other countries. 
 Among the unresolved cases, stock analysts and lawyers who monitor tobacco litigation identify three cases as most threatening to the industry and especially to Altria, which is waiting for litigation to diminish before splitting off its food company, Kraft. 
 They are the federal government's case and two class-action suits -- one in Florida that could cost Philip Morris $74 million and other companies $69 million, and the other in Illinois, where Philip Morris is the lone defendant, facing a lower court verdict of $10.1 billion.
 ''Whatever spin the companies give you, they are still under a serious threat from all three of these cases,'' said Richard A. Daynard, associate dean at Northeastern University School of Law in Boston and chairman of its Tobacco Products Liability Project. ''There's a reasonable likelihood they could get a bad result in any or all of them.'' 
 The government case involves the largest amount of money and the most sweeping charges. The companies are accused of misleading the public about addiction, nicotine content, secondhand smoke, scientific evidence and marketing practices. 
 The Florida suit poses a considerable threat as well. It started 11 years ago, when lawyers sued Philip Morris, Reynolds and six other tobacco companies on behalf of all ''addicted'' smokers in the United States who contended that their illnesses derived from cigarettes. After the class was narrowed to smokers in Florida, a two-year jury trial ended in 2000 with the largest judgment ever against the tobacco industry, $145 billion. 
 Three years later, an appeals court reversed the decision. After the full appeals court refused to reconsider, the plaintiffs appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. Oral arguments were heard last November. 
 If the State Supreme Court rules against them, the companies say they intend to take the case to the United States Supreme Court.
 Stanley M. Rosenblatt, the Miami lawyer who represents the plaintiffs, declined to discuss the case, saying it was ''too sensitive'' with the decision expected at any time. 
 The Illinois case is one of several in which plaintiffs are accusing the companies of fraud over the use of terms like ''light,'' ''lites'' and ''low-tar'' to describe their products.
 The case is directed only at Philip Morris, with accusations that the company defrauded smokers by using words that suggest Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights cigarettes may be less hazardous than the so-called full flavor brands.
 In 2003, a state judge ruled for the plaintiffs, awarding $7.1 billion in compensatory damages and $3 billion in punitive damages. The Illinois State Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal, and oral arguments were made in November.
 Matthew L. Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, who has been fighting the cigarette companies for years, said any substantial financial judgment against the industry had the potential to shake investor confidence despite a history that shows tobacco companies to be resilient in the face of their legal problems. 
 As an example, Mr. Myers said, a victory for the plaintiffs in the Illinois case may influence court decisions in some of the other ''lights'' cases.
 ''I think they understate the risk,'' he said of corporate officials. ''Since Wall Street operates on psychological impact, tobacco companies have done a brilliant job since they settled the lawsuits with the states, telling people there's nothing out there that could rattle their economic stability in a fundamental way. I just don't believe that's true.''
 But Ms. Farkas, the analyst, said two developments convince her that the companies can probably withstand current and future legal attacks. 
 Courts have shown a growing reluctance to certify large groups as a ''class'' plaintiff, and a Supreme Court ruling in a 2003 case involving State Farm Insurance limited the amount of punitive damages a plaintiff could seek.
 ''If tobacco companies lose in one court, they simply move to the next,'' Ms. Farkas said. ''In general, the litigation environment has gotten better for them, and their stock prices reflect it.''

HEADLINE: Big Thoughts, Ready for Takeoff

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
''In a curious twist, the utopian mind has migrated from left to right, and from the academy to the airport bookshop.'' 
 From John Gray's review of ''The World Is Flat'' by Thomas L. Friedman in The New York Review of Books
 CAN it be? The airport bookstore, the haven of Danielle Steele and Jackie Collins, of Stephen King and John Grisham, of ''Bergdorf Blondes'' and ''Your Best Life Now,'' has become the new marketplace of intellectual ideas?
 The proof is out there, on the shelves. At Barbara's Bestsellers in the central terminal at La Guardia Airport, in a display designed to be seen by travelers on their way to the nearby food court, ''Collapse,'' Jared Diamond's weighty tome on the rise and fall of civilizations, sits next to ''The 3-Hour Diet.'' On the bottom shelf, David McCullough's latest work of history, ''1776,'' sits cheek-by-jowl with Terry McMillan's latest novel. And ''The World Is Flat'' itself, by Mr. Friedman, The New York Times columnist, is up near Janet Evanovich's ''Eleven on Top,'' the latest installment in the adventures of a bounty hunter.
 ''A lot of business travelers go for the hardcovers,'' said Mustafa Jackson, assistant manager of the store. ''It keeps their mind off the stress of travel.''
 Though it may be difficult to imagine settling down to ''Collapse'' on a transcontinental flight, other serious nonfiction titles are almost designed as a new kind of airplane read. ''Freakonomics,'' by Steven D. Leavitt and Stephen J. Dubner, with its witty chapter headings (''How Is the Ku Klux Klan Like a Group of Real-Estate Agents?'') encourages browsing. And the title of ''Blink,'' Malcolm Gladwell's treatise on unthinking, seems to celebrate the book as a quick read.
 For his part, Mr. Gladwell has some ideas why he and other authors are popular in airports. ''You spend so much time sitting on the tarmac these days waiting to take off,'' he said. ''Maybe people need something they can sink their teeth into. These are a little weightier than the latest John Grisham.''
 Sara Hinckley, vice president for book purchasing at the Hudson Group, which operates bookstores and newsstands at more than 50 airports in North America, said her company has noticed the trend. ''Nonfiction has been an important category,'' Ms. Hinckley said. ''When we look through our bestseller list at the end of the year, there are always a few nonfiction titles that outsold everything.'' 
 ''What might be also affecting this is the fact that there are a lot more of these quality narrative nonfiction books out there,'' she said.
 But the trend has much to do with the customers themselves. Terry Kraml, of Trofie Productions, a marketing firm that works with airport bookstores, said that customers are drawn to serious nonfiction because they want information.
 ''People aren't going just to John Grisham for entertainment anymore,'' Ms. Kraml said. ''People are looking for substance now.''
 Of course, Mr. Grisham is still doing quite nicely, and bodice rippers, sci-fi and other in-flight mainstays are hardly dead. Terry Bell, regional director of Borders Specialty division, which includes 17 airport bookstores, said that fiction ''still remains the largest percentage of our business.''
 The typical airport purchaser is ''a very highly educated, high-income, male, techno-savvy customer,'' Ms. Hinckley said. ''The same kind of customer that goes into Barnes and Noble goes into our store.'' (In October, the New York Times Company, in partnership with the Paradies Shops, will open a New York Times bookstore in the airport in Lexington, Ky.)
 If many of these customers gravitate toward heavier fare, Walter Kirn, whose novel ''Up in the Air'' is set amid airports and air travel, can understand why. Traveling, he said, tends to instill in people a sense of expansiveness and possibility.
 ''I wouldn't be surprised if people read things on planes that they wouldn't read at home,'' he said. ''There is something about air travel that promotes a feeling of importance. So why not read important books?''
 Mr. Gladwell said one byproduct of the trend is that airports have become the main place where he is recognized -- by customers who have been browsing or buying. 
 ''They've just walked through the bookstore,'' he said, ''and they look up and boom -- there's the guy with the big hair.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the popularity of nonfiction books at at airport stores misspelled the surname of one of the authors of ''Freakonomics,'' a best seller. He is Steven D. Levitt, not Leavitt.

HEADLINE: Living Large, by Design, in Middle of Nowhere

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: WESLEY CHAPEL, Fla. 

 BODY:
New River Township is, for the moment, the edge of beyond.
 Its square mile of tightly packed homes is the outer crest of Tampa's residential swell, four miles from the nearest grocery store and 30 minutes from the nearest major mall. Just down the road, beyond some orange groves, cattle graze languorously amid the insect hum of a sun-baked field, and only a few mobile home parks and a roadside stand selling tiki huts interrupt the vast sea of pine, palmetto and dense thatch.
 But it will be a short-lived isolation. More than three dozen other communities in Pasco County, some bigger than New River, are in the works, promising 100,000 new homes in the next five years. A megamall is coming. And the first of the big-box stores, a Home Depot and a Sam's Club, had their gala openings not long ago. 
 ''It used to be just us and the retirees,'' said Ruth Parker, who was busy decorating a new child care center at the edge of New River, a part of Wesley Chapel, where she has lived for nine years. ''Five years from now, there will be a city here.''
 America is growing. And it is growing the fastest here, at the farm-road margins of metropolitan areas, with planned communities sprouting up and becoming a prime focus, almost a fetish, for election strategists from both major parties.
 Such places do not sprout by happenstance. Driven by irresistible economic forces and shaped by subtly shifting social patterns, they are being created, down to the tiniest detail, by a handful of major developers with a master plan for the new America. In the case of New River, that developer is KB Home, one of the nation's biggest and most profitable builders with $7 billion in sales last year, which helped make it sixth among all Standard & Poor's 500 companies in total revenues.
 KB Home has 483 communities under development in 13 states and expects to complete more than 40,000 new homes this year. Yet it is just one of about two dozen such corporate giants fiercely competing for land and customers at the edge of America's suburban expanse.
 Poring over elaborate market research, these corporations divine what young families want, addressing things like carpet texture and kitchen placement and determining how many streetlights and cul-de-sacs will evoke a soothing sense of safety.
 They know almost to the dollar how much buyers are willing to pay to exchange a longer commute for more space, a sense of higher status and the feeling of security.
 ''You bring people out here, and they say, man, look at all this open space,'' said Marshall Gray, president of KB's Tampa division. ''But I assure you, there are deals in the works for virtually every significant piece of ground you can see out here.''
 Over the next decade, New River will expand to 1,800 acres and be home to 15,000 people living in 4,800 single-family homes, condominiums, town houses and rental units. It will have a 200-acre town center with 180,000 square feet of office space, 500,000 square feet of commercial space, schools, government offices and a 207-acre park.
 At the moment, though, it is nothing more than an island of 400 suburban homes in the middle of nowhere, an infant exurb.
 The term ''exurb'' was coined in the 1950's in ''The Exurbanites'' by A.C. Spectorsky, a social historian, to describe semirural areas far outside cities where wealthy people had country estates. The exurbs of the 21st century are a different animal. And they are not the same as the older rings of closer suburbs.
 The homes in exurbs are generally larger and the space between them smaller. They tend to turn their backs to the street, with the biggest and most used rooms in the rear. And the people who live in them are different. Instead of the all-white enclaves of the 1960's and 70's, the new exurbs are a melange of colors and cultures. 

A Different Kind of Flight
 ''In one sense, these exurbs are just suburbs that take a longer time to drive to,'' said John Husing, a political and economic consultant in California. ''With these, white flight has nothing to do with it. It's all housing prices. The makeup of these communities is a reflection of who's migrating, and that's people who have enough money to be middle class.'' 
 Look deep into the history of many of the new exurbs, and an entrepreneurial character like Beat (pronounced BAY-at) Kahli, an Orlando-based developer, can often be found.
 The son of a baker from a Zurich suburb, Mr. Kahli abandoned his dream of racing in the Tour de France when he realized that he would never be fast enough. Instead, he went to business school in Zurich and became an investment banker.
 In 1989, Flag Development, a consortium based in Fort Myers, Fla., bought the land that is becoming New River from a farming family, as well as an even larger tract on the far east side of Orlando. It approached Mr. Kahli about investing in Florida real estate, and he and some other Europeans bought in.
 But in 1993, with his investors eager for results, Mr. Kahli, 41, came to Central Florida and was stunned.
 ''I thought, oh my gosh, what have we done?'' Mr. Kahli said. ''On the map, these places looked like they were not so far from Disney World and the Kennedy Space Center, but I saw that they were actually way, way out in the middle of nowhere.''
 In the recession of the early 90's, it was impractical to think of developing such remote properties, Mr. Kahli said. But as the economy improved, he decided he could transform the property outside Tampa and the huge tract east of Orlando into major communities.
 ''Most people in Florida are from someplace else,'' said Mr. Kahli, a rotund and ebullient man with an infectious delight in what he has built. ''I was just from someplace a little farther away. Everyone was very accepting of me. There is no way an American could go to where I lived in Switzerland and be accepted in this way.''
 Mr. Kahli bought out his European investors, brought in some new American backers, and came away owning 82 percent of the deal. In 1996, he moved to Florida, first to Fort Lauderdale, where he met his wife, and then to Avalon Park, his development east of Orlando. He now lives in nearby Winter Park in a home with a swimming pool and a five-car garage, a millionaire pillar of the community who sits on the board of the Orlando Regional Chamber of Commerce.
 ''These are normal homes for normal people,'' Mr. Kahli said as he steered his gleaming black BMW along Avalon Park's winding lanes like an admiral in his flagship.
 He pointed out the schools and the stadium that he helped the county build, and the town center where he owns two restaurants and the local weekly newspaper, the East Orlando Sun, for which he writes a column. Just outside the development is a cement plant, the first of seven he built around the state, making him the co-owner of the largest independent concrete contractor in Florida. 
 Sometimes developments like Avalon Park grow in unincorporated areas of remote, rural counties. Sometimes they fall within the boundaries of old towns, where they offer tax revenues but bring the challenge of providing services. Often, when they grow large enough, they become cities.
 Avalon Park comprises 14 interconnected ''villages'' around a town center. Its residents, Mr. Kahli said, are mostly young families, with an average of almost three children per household.
 When the project is finished in five years, he said, 15,000 people will live there. Already, the town center has cafes, beauty parlors, a gas station and a sprawling supermarket. Fresh banks of condominiums sprout on its periphery.
 ''This is what New River will look like in five years,'' Mr. Kahli said.
 But it looks nothing like that now. Drive up Interstate 275 from the shimmering towers of downtown Tampa, past the old clapboard neighborhoods and the greyhound track, until the strip-mall muddle thins, and there is an endless canyon of pine and palmetto. Only billboards relieve the monotony, and at least half of them extol the new housing developments: ''A new standard for luxury.'' ''Own from the low $200's.'' Just before it enters Pasco, the county that sits like a hat atop metropolitan Tampa Bay, I-275 meets I-75. Two exits farther north is the ramp for Route 54.
 ''They used to say that you went to Tampa to visit your parents, and you went to Pasco to visit your grandparents,'' said Mr. Gray, of KB Home. ''Pasco was the realm of the nearly dead and the newlywed.''
 A thick swirl of commercial clutter chokes the Route 54 exit and its surrounding intersections, but heading east, the roadside becomes a tangle of brush and gravel. Drivers pass eight churches, all Protestant.
 About four miles from the interstate exit, the entrance to New River emerges from behind a bank of trees, a flower-lined entryway flanked by stucco walls and a line of homes with their backs turned on the highway clamor.
 Mr. Gray, a connoisseur of sod, points to the grass and young trees along the entryway. ''Look at the grass in that lawn,'' he said. ''See how nice and thick it is. It's called floratam. Now look at this yard. That's called Bahia sod. It's cheaper, looks a little weedy.''
 When Mr. Kahli began building in 1999, first in Avalon Park and then in New River, he signed a deal with American Heritage, a company acquired by KB Home in 2002. Now, KB coordinates the residential development, which includes a mix of homes by KB and Windward, another national builder. Mr. Kahli retains control of the town center and other commercial sites.

Focus on Market Research
 One area in which KB Home takes pride is its market research. It asks things like where people want their kitchens and how much more of a commute they can stomach. And it surveys its own buyers to get a comprehensive idea of who they are and why they bought.
 The data from KB tells much about New River. In the first phase of development, more than 60 percent of the buyers had household incomes of $40,000 to $80,000; in Tampa, that is solidly middle class. Nearly half were between the ages of 30 and 40. They were 38 percent Hispanic, 24 percent white and 16 percent black. Three-quarters of the buyers had children in the house. More than 80 percent commuted, with the vast majority traveling to Tampa, a drive of anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. 
 Four years ago, the first New River homes sold for as low as $150,000. Today, the smallest models cost $212,000, and an average home with 2,657 square feet, three bedrooms and a two-car garage costs at least $245,990.
 In its most recent survey of Tampa home buyers, KB asked people what they valued the most in their home and community. They wanted more space and a greater sense of security. Safety always ranks second, even in communities where there is virtually no crime.
 Asked what they wanted in a home, 88 percent said a home security system, 93 percent said they preferred neighborhoods with ''more streetlights'' and 96 percent insisted on deadbolt locks or security doors.
 So KB Home offers them all. ''It's up to us to figure out what people really want and to translate that into architecture,'' said Erik Kough, KB's vice president for architecture. And the company designs its communities with winding streets with sidewalks and cul-de-sacs to keep traffic slow, to give a sense of containment and to give an appearance distinctly unlike the urban grid that the young, middle-class families instinctively associate with crime. ''I definitely feel safe here. I feel protected,'' said Lisa Crawford, who moved to New River about a year ago with her husband, Steve, and their two children.
 ''And I can tell you that the people in Tampa are a whole lot different than the people here,'' Ms. Crawford said. ''In Tampa, there's a faster pace. I like it here, that it's more of a community, more of a small-town feel.'' 
 Mr. Gray said KB's Tampa division talks about a Mendoza line when determining what features to include in a home. The term comes from baseball and is used to describe someone with a batting average hovering at the .200 mark. Mr. Gray said he did not know how it migrated to real estate, but he uses it to describe components that are strongly desired by 70 percent or more of the home buyers.
 Extra closet space, a walk-in pantry and a covered patio are all above the Mendoza line, so they are included in all New River homes. People spending more than $220,000 for their home get space for a home office because it falls above the Mendoza line. More than $260,000, they get dual sinks in the master bathroom.
 At the heart of the matter, KB asks home buyers to put a dollar value on their time. Would they accept a commute that was 15 minutes longer for a house that was 10 percent cheaper? What about 15 percent? What if the commute was an additional 30 minutes?
 The answer, the company decided, is that a house in New River must be $12,000 cheaper than the same house in the north Tampa suburbs, 15 minutes closer to downtown. And in Silverado, a community that KB hopes to build 15 minutes farther north in Pasco County, the house must be $12,000 cheaper than in New River.
 Almost all of the fastest-growing counties in the United States are in exurban areas. And these far-flung communities proved, in the last election, to be among the strongest supporters of President Bush. His top advisers credited the 2004 victory, in part, to a strategy that focused on what the campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, called a Republican ''fortress'' beyond the cities.
 Although opinions differ about why Republicans did so well last year in these areas, it seems to boil down to demographics. The bulk of people who choose to live in exurban communities, families with young children and property owners who share a desire for security and more personal space, are statistically more likely to vote Republican, as are the rural residents who live here before the exurbs arrive.
 In 2004, the two precincts nearest to New River -- those voting at the nearby middle school and at a Baptist Church a few miles away -- gave 1,265 votes, or 61 percent, to Mr. Bush, and 782 votes, or 38 percent, to John Kerry.

A Community of Republicans
 ''Most of the people I know out here are Republican,'' said Yolanda Breuer, 34, who works for a software company in Tampa. ''In the workplace in the city, its more like 50-50. And there were some Kerry supporters out here. But mostly, it's Republican.''
 Ms. Breuer said that she and her husband, Andrew, 29, who switched jobs to become a Pasco County firefighter, did not move to the exurbs to be near others who shared their values. It just worked out that way.
 ''What we wanted was a bigger house and a bigger master bedroom,'' she said. And they got it, moving from about 2,500 square feet to about 4,400, including a patio enclosed by a screen that stretches up two stories. They know they paid a price to live here. On a normal day, Ms. Breuer's commute to work is 35 minutes, but it can balloon to more than an hour on a bad day. The rural roads are already choked at rush hour, and when the caravans of minivans make the daily pilgrimage to schools and soccer games. ''Oh, it's awful,'' Ms. Breuer said. At a KB model home not far away, Piper Bein and her husband, Mike, an electrical contractor, were casually surveying the 3,475-square-foot building. When asked what they wanted in their new home, the Beins, both 28, blurted the same word in unison: ''space.''
 Their two children, Landen, 6, and Cade, 3, scampered from room to room, playing hide-and-seek in the warren of hallways, pantries, walk-in closets and bathrooms.
 The sales representative, Ole Pietersen, was delighted with the opportunity to point out the room for storage. ''Lots of places to hide, aren't there, boys?'' he said, smiling at their parents.

HEADLINE: Adding Glass-Box Minimalism to Midwestern Downtown 

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

DATELINE: DAVENPORT, Iowa 

 BODY:
Whatever you think of Minimalist architecture -- sleek and sexy or cold and impersonal -- it's hard to deny its remarkable durability in the art world. For decades it has been the preferred style of art dealers and curators, as conservative in its way as the 19th-century salon tradition. Its familiarity only adds to its main virtue: the ability to instantly imbue an art institution with a gloss of cultural sophistication.
 The Figge Art Museum here, the first major American building by the British architect David Chipperfield, is a monument to that notion of good taste. Mr. Chipperfield has a knack for making Minimalism look fresh, and here he has designed a very pretty box. Tasteful almost to a fault, the building's sharp-edged forms and carefully buffed surfaces, which have a soft, reassuring glow, will be especially comforting to those who like their world organized in neat compartments. 
More important, the Figge has already added a frisson of excitement to a once-dilapidated area of this city of 100,000. And Mr. Chipperfield, who draws heavily on old Modernist history here, deftly roots his design in its surrounding grid of dull brick buildings.
 Good taste, of course, is about emulating the taste of others, which rarely leads to new ideas. Though thoughtfully conceived, the Figge doesn't venture into dangerous territory. Its cool aesthetic is in telling contrast to the expanding emotional range of contemporary architecture: what might have seemed like a leap forward less than a decade ago now seems quaint and conventional.
 Set on the edge of downtown along a bank of the Mississippi River, this industrial-scale building was built to house the expanding collections of the old Davenport Museum of Art. The project is also part of a long-term effort to reconnect the downtown area to Davenport's waterfront, a former manufacturing area dominated by scattered parking lots and a docked riverboat casino. Eventually, the city plans to transform the waterfront into a public park, adding to the museum's soothing aura.
 This is a common strategy for revitalizing dying industrial cities whose civic leaders see cultural tourists and their disposable income as an antidote for the loss of manufacturing jobs. 
 In the art world, it has become fashionable to dismiss the cultural component of urban development plans as an expression of a museum board's vanity. But you would have to be a hardened cynic not to feel supportive of the Figge's efforts here. The museum, clad in translucent glass, looms over the mostly barren brick buildings that surround it and has an elusive simplicity. Seen from downtown, the building's corners sometimes seem to be dissolving into thin air. It helps anchor the surrounding neighborhood, while its ethereality seems to suggest that the area's renaissance could be a momentary fantasy.
 That image gets more complex as you draw near the building. The main facade overlooks a vast plaza paved in concrete bricks, which put the museum at a slight remove from the city. Pierced by the lobby entrance and a service door, the facade has a symmetrical, buttoned-up look. But that symmetry breaks down as you circle around to the back, where a grand staircase cut directly into the facade leads to the main lobby and a restaurant, offering sweeping views of the river and the riverboat casino. (Some of the development costs are being covered by Vision Iowa, a state fund that channels gambling proceeds into cultural and civic projects.)
 Most architects will recognize the contrast between the front and back as a winking reference to precedents like Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in Garches, France. There, too, the taut symmetry of the main facade gives way to a more informal composition in the rear -- an expression of the complex inner life hidden behind the building's stoic public face. The idea also harks back to Vaux-le-Vicomte, the 17th-century palace built by Louis XIV's finance minister, where the humble facade veiled a potent expression of state power.
 Mr. Chipperfield's careful nod to history gives the building a nuanced complexity that you won't find in a conventional glass box. 
 But that effect diminishes once you enter, as less is more becomes less is less. The lobby, a clean composition of horizontal white bands and towering doorways punctuated by the blood red wall of the restaurant at one end, is neither pretentious nor dazzling. The main galleries are conventional white cubes, though well proportioned and generously scaled. Of these, the warmest is the top-floor temporary gallery, a rough warehouse-like space that currently houses Janet Cardiff's remarkable ''40 Part Motet'' (2001), whose elliptical arrangement of 40 speakers, each projecting the voice of a single singer, brings the space to life. (In general, the architecture of the galleries is not well served by the collection, a mix of Mexican, Haitian, European and American art.)
 Unfortunately, the museum's temperament is aptly summarized by its educational gallery, a relatively small space surrounded by a lecture hall, library and art studios. The layout suggests that art is here to be dissected by academicians, with the institution serving as a place for moral education rather than aesthetic pleasure, a legacy that is particular to American museum culture. You long for a bit of the messiness of the art studios to spill out into the galleries, for children to smudge the walls with paint-stained hands.
 Such drawbacks make Mr. Chipperfield's work seem less intellectually rigorous than it did at first glance. In his still-young but robust career, Mr. Chipperfield has joined the ranks of prominent architects who express their ideas through scale, proportion and a refined palette of materials. He has spent time in Japan, where he briefly became enamored of the work of Tadao Ando, whose masculine concrete houses are monuments of monastic simplicity. His buildings also echo of the work the Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza.
 Mr. Chipperfield has yet to match Mr. Ando's potency or Mr. Siza's gentle lyricism. Nor does he venture into surreal territory, in the way of, say, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. Judging from his past work, he may be too naturally cautious to risk the failures and false starts that are part of a truly creative process. 
 He is nonetheless a highly competent architect. And this project, set in the American heartland, offers the occasion to reflect on how, in a relatively short time, architectural debates that were once confined to the ghetto of academia have worked their way into the cultural mainstream. Think about it. A decade ago, a museum like the Figge would have been greeted as a daring departure from the kind of dull brick institutional boxes that were then the norm. Today, you are tempted to ask yourself, is this all there is? That's a huge step forward.

HEADLINE: Invisible to Most, Women Line Up for Day Labor

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The women are not noticed by the weekday morning crowds that rush past Eighth Avenue and 37th Street, in the heart of Manhattan's fashion district. They arrive in twos and threes after 8 a.m., shrinking against the buildings on both sides of the avenue, until scores of them are waiting, small, dark-haired Mexicans, Ecuadoreans, Hondurans.
 By noon they have vanished. In swift, discreet sidewalk negotiations, perhaps half have been hired for a day's work at the minimum wage or less in some of the neighborhood's last struggling garment factories. The rest have given up until tomorrow.
A few miles away in Williamsburg, commuters on the busy Brooklyn-Queens Expressway are equally oblivious to the similar scene unfolding on an overpass above them. There, the work at stake is $8-an-hour housecleaning, and those vying for a day's scrubbing, mainly for Hasidic homemakers, stand in a crude ascending hierarchy of employer preference: Mexican and Central American women in their 30's at the back, Polish immigrant women in their 50's and 60's in the middle, and young Polish students with a command of English at the head of the line. 
 At a time when male day laborers have become the most public and contentious face of economic immigration to the United States, these two rare female shape-ups have doubled in size almost unobserved in recent years. Their growth reflects a larger overlooked reality: Women make up 44 percent of the nation's low-wage immigrant work force, and worldwide, studies show, more and more women are migrating for work.
 Often invisible and undercounted, experts say, female economic migrants are an increasing presence, especially in big cities like New York, where the demand is not for men to pick lettuce or process poultry, but for women to pick up the scraps of a collapsed manufacturing sector, or to serve in the vast underground economy of domestic service.
 Although more women across the country are showing up in day-labor hiring halls, often run by grass-roots labor groups, experts say that these two female shape-ups may well be the only significant ones of their kind in the nation -- places where women are willing to put their personal safety in jeopardy for a few hours of work. 
 ''What else is there to do if you have nothing to eat?'' asked Rosario Jocha, 49, still standing on Eighth Avenue at 11 a.m. on a recent Wednesday. She said she had recently grabbed a day's work cutting threads from jackets even when the employer, a Chinese immigrant subcontractor, insisted he could not pay more than $5.75 an hour, 25 cents below the state minimum wage. ''I've been here 11 years, and I still haven't found a stable, steady job.'' 
 At both locations, some of the women waiting for work had been in the country as little as a few months; others, like Ms. Jocha, a Queens resident from Ecuador, were old-timers who spoke of better jobs lost when small-business employers could not pay rising rent. On Eighth Avenue, merchants said that 100 to 150 women regularly sought work six mornings a week year round -- double or triple the number when the intersection first emerged as an informal female hiring site about six years ago. 
 Yet May Chen, a vice president of Unite, the garment workers' union, whose headquarters is only a dozen blocks away, said she was unaware of the shape-up's existence until she was asked about it for this article. And Aaron Adams, a veteran garment center landlord who passes by every day, said he had assumed the women standing there ''were just shooting the breeze.''
 Rhacel Salazar Parrenas, a sociologist who has written extensively about the feminization of migration, said she was not surprised. ''The space that these women occupy, the public spaces in the city, are just like fleeting moments,'' she said. ''They don't really have a place in the city that's visible, so it's easy to ignore them.''
 Even the discussion of legal guest worker proposals in Congress centers on male migrants, she said. But though nationally men account for about two-thirds of labor migration among illegal immigrants, primarily because of agricultural demand, she said, global patterns indicate that women are easily half the immigrant workers flowing to large metropolitan areas like New York.
 Ms. Parrenas and other researchers find that women who migrate for work are likely to be single mothers supporting children in their native countries. Compared with their male counterparts, they earn less, despite higher levels of education, according to a 2002 study of the United States' low-wage immigrant work force by the Urban Institute, a research group in Washington, which estimated that two million foreign-born women made less than the minimum wage. Yet women are also more likely to remain in America, and they send home a higher proportion of their earnings.
 Unvarnished lessons in global supply, demand and division play out at both New York hiring sites.
 ''We never talk to the Latinas -- sometimes they agree to work for less,'' said Teresa, a 53-year-old Polish widow who, like many of the 60 women waiting for cleaning work near Marcy and Division Avenues in Williamsburg on a recent Friday morning, would give only her first name. 
 At the other end of the curved concrete abutment, Maria, 35, from Ecuador, gave a shrug. ''They pay them more,'' she complained, as a woman in Hasidic dress passed by the Spanish-speaking group and selected a tall young Polish woman. ''It's just that they're white.''
 Even among the Poles, immigration complicates the pecking order. Some older women won green cards after years as live-in maids for sponsors, and boast in broken English of children in college. Other women lack papers, or shuttle on temporary work visas between their struggling families in rural Poland and spartan, overpriced rooms in Brooklyn. And in summer, just when demand declines because of employer vacations, they now face growing numbers of young Polish women working illegally on tourist visas while living rent-free with Brooklyn relatives.
 ''They don't want babushkas,'' complained Zofia, a 50-year-old mother of five, as a young Hasidic man led Justyne, a 24-year-old Polish student, to his S.U.V. 
 Not all employers had the same preferences, however, and most, like Rifky Kohn, 28, a pregnant mother of four, were on foot. At midday, with the Sabbath approaching, she gladly hired a Polish woman in her late 60's. 
 ''She looks more experienced,'' explained Mrs. Kohn.
 Rosa Yumbla, who supports four children in Ecuador, recently skipped a day on the overpass to address a national conference of day labor organizers at New York University Law School. She spoke at the urging of the Latin American Workers Project, an advocacy group in Brooklyn. 
 ''We suffer the changing weather throughout the year, the heat of the sun and cold in winter, because where we wait to be picked up is on the corner,'' Ms. Yumbla said in Spanish to an audience that included the mayor's commissioner for immigrant affairs. ''Help us secure a space where we can be safer.''
 For now, the women depend on one another and their own instincts for safety. On a recent Wednesday, when a man on Eighth Avenue approached a young Mexican woman with a vague description of a part-time job in a store at the Port Authority, an older woman drew close and signaled disapproval. The man, who gave his name as Victor Miranda and his age as 55, then turned to Josefa Limas, 32, who arrived from Puebla, Mexico, only six months ago.
 She, too, shook her head. ''Sometimes they'll just end up taking you somewhere else,'' she said, describing another woman's close call the previous day. ''An Indian man took her to an elevator and wouldn't let her out. He came over and tried to grab her. She pressed an emergency button and got away.''
 Still, the pressure to take chances can be strong. Nellie, 32, who shares a room in the Bronx, pulled out a picture of the three children she left four years ago with her sister in rural Ecuador, in an effort to earn money for the heart operation needed by her son, the youngest.
 ''The little I make here I send to him,'' she said. ''Many times I just want to go to be with him, but I don't have the money to do so. It gives me a desperate feeling.'' 
 On this day she counted herself lucky: she had been called back for a second day's work at $6 an hour, she said. And leaving the line, she melted into the crowd.

HEADLINE: Where Timber Is King, a Lumberjack Wears Rhinestones

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

DATELINE: MORTON, Wash., Aug. 14 

 BODY:
When the announcer hollered, ''It's a 27-inch log and they made sawdust fly!'' and then, ''Ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about the Swedish fiddle here, the misery whip!'' the crowds here at the 63rd annual Loggers Jubilee clapped and stomped their feet.
 But the hundreds gathered for the ''granddaddy'' of all logging shows, as its organizers call it, really whooped it up for contestant No. 50 when he was called for the hot saw competition, in which the goal is to saw through a log 27 inches in diameter at lightning speed. He held his 90-pound power saw in one hand and waved to his fans in the bleachers with the other.
Why the ruckus over contestant No. 50? For one thing, he turned 71 last week. And the man, known as the Rhinestone Logger, a retired timber faller, has competed in Morton for almost half a century, traveling here from Sweet Home, Ore., chopping, sawing and tree-topping his way to fame in the nation's forest belt and around the world. 
 To digress, rhinestone-wise, Bob Waibel, who also calls himself the Globetrotting Logger, was invited to Washington, D.C., in 1976, he said, for a logging exhibition as part of the bicentennial celebration. His wife, Mona, made him a pair of rhinestone-and-red-sequin-studded suspenders for the occasion, and he has worn them to every logging competition since.
 ''About that time, Glen Campbell was singing 'Rhinestone Cowboy,''' Mr. Waibel said Sunday, wearing the suspenders (which he removes before competing so the rhinestones will not fly off) and a red, white and blue baseball cap, as a group of men were sizing wood for the contest with axes and power saws, in a grassy arena below the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. ''So I said, 'Why don't we have a Rhinestone Logger?'''
 Mr. Waibel, whose father and three brothers worked in timber (his father and a brother died logging), started competing in logging shows in 1955. The games have become something of a craze lately, with contests broadcast on ESPN and a lucrative worldwide circuit netting the top competitors -- fewer and fewer of them actual lumberjacks like Mr. Waibel -- more than $100,000 in prize money in a summer.
 Mr. Waibel's son, Rob, 39, a high school teacher from a suburb of Portland, Ore., learned the sport from his father. The younger Mr. Waibel is a professional timber sportsman and one of the best on the timber circuit, but he is not a professional logger. 
 ''People who grew up around logging definitely have an edge,'' he said Sunday as he polished his ax for the second day of the Loggers Jubilee, an ax made especially for chopping western alder trees, one of the varieties used for this show. 
 While timber sports are growing, experts say, with more college teams cropping up across the nation in the last few years and exposure on ESPN piquing new fan interest, logging, once a backbone of the economy in this town of 1,050, has virtually disappeared as a dependable livelihood in the Pacific Northwest. 
 The timber industry's decline is the result mostly of victories for environmentalists who fought successfully in the 1980's and 1990's to protect the region's forests, particularly old-growth trees, from logging. But the industry has also suffered from technological advances that replaced logging jobs with machines.
 The environmental battles were initially centered on saving the habitat of the endangered northern spotted owl, a species that became threatened during the logging heyday of this region. The owl is still mentioned with such disdain around here that the animal may as well be a feathered devil. (At the Morton event, one man wore a T-shirt with a picture of a Campbell's soup can and the words ''Cream the Spotted Owl.'') 
 Morton, with its two lumber mills, still the major employer here and in surrounding Lewis County, fared better after the timber industry crash than many towns, but many people lost their jobs. With its prime location, fairly close to Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier, and about 75 miles south of Seattle, town officials are hoping that tourism -- which is boosted heavily once a year by the thousands who flood into town for the Loggers Jubilee -- can help Morton recover. They have plans to offer train rides through the area, long a thoroughfare for the railroads, said the mayor, Bob Worsham, who moved here from Miami seven years ago.
 Morton, surrounded by Douglas fir, cedar and pine forests and now part retirement community and part mill town, was once called the railroad-tie capital, said Mr. Worsham's wife, Eleanor, who grew up in the Seattle area and volunteers for the local historical society. It was a hub of railroad-tie production until the early 1950's, she said. 
 Now, many of the events at the logging show exhibit methods that were long ago replaced by automated machinery, including tree-topping, in which the contestant races up an 80-foot spar pole, straps in and cuts a piece of wood off the top, and crosscut sawing, which features a long and wide saw, known as the misery whip, used to slice a perfectly round piece from a log, called a cookie. 
 Show organizers and contestants say the Loggers Jubilee is as much about heritage as it is about competition. Among the 50 contestants this year competing for the top prize of $500 were nine women.
 In Morton, where most of the show's fans either worked in the timber industry or are related to someone who did, the jubilee has a unique spirit, people said, especially compared with the staged events on ESPN.
 ''There's timber dying all around us and we can't cut it,'' said Sonny Mettler, who has managed the Morton show since 1980 and still works in the timber industry as a log buyer. ''The logging show lets people know how it was done in the past.''
 On Sunday morning, the Rhinestone Logger, Mr. Waibel, said he would compete in the hot saw competition again, even though he had trouble starting his saw on Saturday, but would refrain from chopping. ''There's getting to be a lot of competition,'' he said. ''I can name 15 people I can't beat.''
 Still, he said, he planned to come back to Morton, even with his bad knees, ''as long as I'm standing on two feet.''

HEADLINE: Critics Say It's Time to Overhaul Army's Bonus System 

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Margot Williams contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
An Army recruit in Midland, Tex., signed up for four years in the infantry on April 22, and received a $20,000 bonus. Three weeks later near El Paso, another recruit who chose the same job and length of service received no bonus.
 Military officials do not consider such disparities surprising. For decades, the Army has used bonuses selectively, to sign up recruits for immediate needs, to help attract applicants for hard-to-fill specialties, and to win over qualified people who might otherwise be lost to better-paying opportunities. Even with the Army falling short of its recruitment goals for the year, the military says the program works: A doubling of the top bonus to $40,000 is often the first thing that Army officials request when Congress asks what they need to maintain troop strength as the war in Iraq goes on. And the Army officials said there were no plans to change the program or give out significantly more money.
''Not all skills qualify for the maximum bonus,'' said Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon. ''The Army uses bonuses to attract applicants into skills or specialties where they are most needed.'' 
 But outside the Pentagon, a growing number of military experts, retired Army officials, recruiters and applicants have begun to clamor for an overhaul in how the Army doles out its incentives. They say that the Army's use of the top bonus amount can be confusing, and it is indeed handed out very infrequently, leading some to charge that applicants can be misled. The bonus disparities among seemingly equal recruits, they said, can also lead to dissension in the ranks as soldiers compare what they received to enlist.
 Most fundamentally, though, critics described the program as an ineffective tool for attracting troops -- a holdover from an era when the most significant recruiting challenges came from competition with a robust economy. Now the main hindrance to recruitment is war, many said, and bonuses should be used to boost compensation for anyone willing to volunteer. 
 ''The problem is that they need volume,'' said Col. David Slotwinski, a former chief of staff for the Army's recruiting command, who retired in 2004. ''The bonuses should be spread so you can attract the greatest volume in the shortest time.''
 In the civilian world, bonuses for starting a new job are relatively rare. But in a profession fraught with danger, which initially pays only about $30,000 a year, including allowances for housing and food, a bonus can represent a significant boost in income and respect. 
 Over the years, the military's bonus program has become increasingly sophisticated. Military officials acknowledge that the $20,000 figure, and the maximum offer of $70,000 for college tuition, are often used on signs and by recruiters as marketing tools, to spark interest among potential applicants. 
 Recruits lock in an actual amount only at the end of the process, when they are sitting alone with a job counselor at a local processing station, just before they sign their final contract. They must first pass a battery of tests, and their qualifications and the Army's needs affect the size of the offer. Those who score well on the military's aptitude test or agree to ship out immediately are likely to be offered a higher bonus. Those who sign up for hard-to-fill jobs, like those in Special Forces, have traditionally received the most money. 
 Beth Asch, a senior economist at the Rand Institute who specializes in military personnel, said that the Army's job selection and bonus program was closely modeled on the airlines' ticket system, and often yielded the same kinds of varying results. 
 ''What they're trying to do is marry up individuals with training slots,'' she said. ''It's trying to balance a recruit's desires and schedule with what the Army wants. It's just like the airlines where someone sitting next to you paid a different price.''
 Colonel Hilferty, the Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said that the Army's job and incentive system ''works best when it fills needed skills with soldiers.'' He said the Army would give out $207 million in bonuses this year, after receiving supplemental funding, up from the $141 million originally budgeted, and $125 million in 2004. Between the beginning of the Army's fiscal year in October and June, the Army gave a bonus of at least $1,000 to 25,189 recruits, or 53 percent of those who signed up.
 Douglas Smith, a spokesman for the Army recruiting command at Fort Knox, Ky., said that recruits did not have to sign the contract if they were unhappy with an offer. He said that recruits knew that the top bonuses -- like cheap airfares -- are restricted to those who meet specific qualifications. 
 ''I don't think we're any different than any other corporation that advertises options about its product or service,'' he said. ''If you look at our ads, its says you may be eligible.''
 Some recruits, however, say that it can be startling when they compare notes.
 ''One guy I know got $9,000, and someone who signed up after him got $6,000'' for the same job, said Almendro Fernandez, 17, a recruit from Waipahu, Hawaii, who starts Army boot camp later this summer and did not receive a bonus. ''They're pretty confused.''
 David Segal, a military sociologist at the University of Maryland, said that disparities in compensation also undermined cohesion among troops as they move up the ranks. 
 ''Once they start hearing that someone got a better deal,'' he said, ''soldiers get angry.'' 
 An analysis of Army data -- of every enlistment package given out between October and June -- reveals wide chasms between what recruits receive. 
 It shows that the top bonus of $20,000 was given to only 6 percent of the 47,727 people who signed up for active duty. In 31 of 33 job categories, including officers, recruits were more likely to receive nothing than the top $20,000 payout.
 In the infantry, the Army's largest occupation and one of its most dangerous, more than a quarter of those who signed up since October did not receive a bonus. Twelve percent received $20,000 and the rest received a hodge-podge of amounts with 439 receiving $5,000, 723 receiving $10,000 and 547 receiving $15,000. Among all infantry recruits, the average bonus was $9,264.
 In the ammunition category, which includes the explosives specialists who defuse roadside bombs in Iraq, 320 people received no bonus at all while 118 received $20,000. The average for all 815 ammunition recruits was $7,561.
 Even in the Special Forces, which awarded the highest average bonus of $14,020, 98 people did not receive a bonus. 
 College money was also scarce. The statistics show that fewer than 10 percent of all recruits earned money from the Army College Fund, an incentive program that provides tuition assistance and is needed to reach the maximum of $70,000 for college. 
 The most common compensation package for a new recruit amounted to an average bonus of $5,589, roughly $13,712 in annual salary (not including allowances for housing and food) and the Montgomery GI Bill, which offers about $36,000 for tuition if recruits agree to contribute $100 a month for their first year and go to a four-year college. 
 But the bonuses did not necessarily pack a punch: they are paid out over several years and taxable, unlike re-enlistment bonuses in a combat zone. And according to some military experts, the Army has still not directed its incentives toward its most pressing needs . 
 Under the current system, for example, the people who signed up to play in Army bands received an average bonus of $6,396 -- $645 more, on average, than what was received by those who joined military intelligence, and more than double the amount paid to enlistees in combat engineering. 
 Ms. Asch, the expert at Rand, said that these discrepancies were the result of an outdated system, intended for peacetime recruiting. To reach the Army's current recruiting goals of 80,000 active duty troops, 28,485 in the Reserves, and 63,000 in the National Guard, she said, more money should be given to more people. 
 ''The Army should be applying the bonuses more broadly,'' she said. ''Essentially what they need to do is give out higher entry pay, and since the Army has the same pay table as everyone else in the military, the only way they can do that is with the bonus.''
 ''The nice thing about bonuses is that they are temporary,'' she added. ''You can experiment; you can have a floor of, say, $2,000 for everyone and go up from there. The beauty of them is that they're flexible.''
 Recruiters said they would also welcome the chance to give large bonuses to everyone, rather than just a chosen few. Sgt. First Class Leon Jones, who worked as an Army recruiter in Washington until last summer, said that he often felt uncomfortable with the Army's use of the bonus, especially since recruits discovered what they would be paid only after they had become vested in the process, when it was difficult to turn back. He said that the bonuses seemed to exploit the vulnerabilities of poor recruits. 
 ''There is an old saying that goes, 'all that is lawful is not expedient,' '' said Sergeant Jones, who left the Army July 29, after 16 years. ''We are supposed to be the ethical standard bearers for a nation.''
 Mr. Smith, the Army spokesman at the recruiting command, denied that the current system was unethical or misleading. He said that the Army was testing a program that would let recruiters with laptops make job and bonus offers in an applicant's home. But, he said, he did not know when it would be available nationwide.
 In the meantime, the Army is turning to other incentives. In July, it began paying an additional $400 a month for three years to those who serve in a handful of fields, including the infantry. Military officials are also considering proposals to help soldiers buy homes or start businesses.
 Congress, which held several hearings this summer on military recruitment and retention, has seemed willing to go along with these proposals, including the doubling of the top bonus to $40,000.
 But even if the new incentives become widely available, they may not be enough to sway some recruits toward dangerous occupations. Roy Ross, 18, who shipped off to Army boot camp on July 20, said he turned down several jobs with large bonuses that were open to him because of his high score on the military's aptitude test.
 ''I looked into it, and they were really dangerous,'' said Mr. Ross, who is from Jacksonville, Fla., and chose to become a helicopter mechanic. ''I'm wild, but I'm not that wild.''

HEADLINE: Our Modern Tribes: Forced or Chosen?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 If we can explain cultural differences, David Brooks says (column, Aug. 11), we can understand why different countries and cultures are more or less economically successful and more or less technologically advanced. Maybe, or maybe not.
As we watched legal barriers to racial, religious and sexual advancement fall in the United States over the last half-century, as blacks, Jews and women (among others) enrolled in colleges and took jobs previously barred to them, we also witnessed another phenomenon.
 No matter the success of members of these cultural minorities in academia, business and the professions, they still faced the bitter stings of discrimination. Minority applicants discovered that business and professional success was no guarantee of a country club membership or a home in an upscale community. 
 Are those members of minorities who join organizations with others from similar cultural backgrounds or who move ''into self-segregating communities with people like themselves'' the ones who are ''building invisible and sometimes visible barriers to keep strangers out,'' or are they the victims of segregation?

HEADLINE: Even in Vain, Swatting Spammers Feels Good

BYLINE: By Tom Zeller Jr.

 BODY:
IT seemed a banner week for the antispam crusade. 
 Last Tuesday, Microsoft announced that Scott Richter, whose company in Colorado, OptInRealBig.com, was considered by antispam activists to be one of the world's most prolific junk e-mail operations, had agreed to settle a lawsuit with the company for $7 million.
 After recouping the company's legal costs, Microsoft executives said they planned to reinvest $5 million of the settlement to fight spam. Another $1 million will go to New York State, which assisted in the lawsuit, to increase computer access for low-income families. (Mr. Richter admitted no wrongdoing.) 
 Then on Wednesday, America Online introduced its second annual ''Spammer's Gold Sweepstakes,'' in which the spoils seized in legal settlements with spammers are given away in daily prize drawings. Last year's prize was a $45,000 Porsche Boxster. The grand prize this year: $20,000 in gold bars, $65,000 cash and a 2003 Hummer H2 S.U.V., its trunk stuffed with ''products from Time Warner Brands,'' according to the official contest rules. The Hummer's odometer registers 18,500 miles, presumably driven by its previous owner, a spammer named Brad Bournival.
 Mr. Richter's case in particular was celebrated in the blogosphere as proof that lawsuits can nudge spammers toward reform. 
 Mr. Richter ''has done significant damage to the Internet and deserves to suffer a million indignities with a red-hot Garden Weasel,'' wrote Craig Cook, a Web designer and author of the blog Focal Curve (focalcurve.com). ''But on the whole it seems 'Snotty Scotty' has indeed stopped spamming.''
 ''See kids,'' Mr. Cook added, ''death threats do work.'' 
 Of course, death sentences against spammers aren't on the table (although surely some Internet users would like to put them there), but as the America Online and Microsoft actions make clear, the legal threats are real. The question is, do they work? 
 For every Scott Richter or Brad Bournival sued into submission, legions of faceless, stateless spam rings generate billions of spam messages every year. Indeed, a report issued by the Federal Trade Commission in 2004 explicitly questioned the efficacy of lawsuits -- largely because in a shadowy industry marked by spoofed I.P. addresses and offshore servers, simply identifying someone to sue is a difficult and costly enterprise. 
 ''As a result of spammers' obfuscatory techniques,'' the F.T.C. reported, citing one major Internet service provider's experience, ''amassing the required evidence for one lawsuit required eight people who expended approximately 1,000 hours of work.'' 
 Litigation costs ''can range from $100,000 or less (when the spammer is easily identifiable) to more than $2 million (when the spammer mounts an aggressive defense),'' the commission's report continued. ''Not surprisingly, some I.S.P.'s believe that lawsuits against spammers are an expensive and often fruitless way to stop spam. Instead, these I.S.P.'s expend the bulk of their antispam resources improving their filtering technologies.''
 Filtering, in fact, is where money should be spent, according to Richi Jennings, an independent technology consultant and an analyst with Ferris Research. 
 As it is, Mr. Jennings points out, a good e-mail filter, whether built into an e-mail program, added on or deployed at the server level by an Internet service provider, can snag 95 percent or more of all spam messages. And as the algorithms get better at distinguishing good e-mail from bad -- no matter how crafty the spammers become -- the return on spammers' investments will inevitably dry up. 
 At some point, Mr. Jennings reasons, the number of eyeballs forced to look at unsolicited e-mail will be too few to make spamvertizing a worthwhile marketing strategy. 
 ''I certainly think there's less spam now than there would have been if spam filters hadn't become as good as they have,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''The lawsuits are the cherry on the cake, but they aren't necessary'' to eliminate junk messages. 
 Both Microsoft's settlement with Mr. Richter and the AOL sweepstakes come on the heels of other hints, however subtle, that spam volumes might be leveling off. Although the e-mail monitoring company Postini continues to show the average weekly spam volume holding strong at roughly 75 percent of all e-mail (as it was through most of 2004), MessageLabs, a competing e-mail security company, has registered a downturn in spam volume over the last six months -- from 83 percent of all e-mail in January to 67 percent in June. (On the downside, MessageLabs also reported a jump in virus-laden e-mail, from one in every 51 messages to one in every 28, over the same period.) 
 Still, it was widely noted when Mr. Richter and OptInRealBig were delisted last month from the Register of Known Spam Operations, a list maintained by the British antispam outfit Spamhaus. That's no easy feat. Spamhaus is a merciless spam watchdog. But Steve Linford, the group's director, said that OptInRealBig appeared to have become a legitimate e-mail marketing business.
 ''He phoned us up late last year and said he was going to make this change,'' Mr. Linford said, ''and we said, 'If you make the change, we'll take you off the list.''' 
 But Mr. Linford also says that dips in spam volumes are mere anomalies -- if they can be believed at all. He also suggests that neither the threat of lawsuits nor advances in filter technology will bring an end to the problem anytime soon. 
 ''The spammers are relying anyway on extremely low returns on every spam that they send -- literally on one in a million,'' Mr. Linford said. Accomplished spammers are able to transmit hundreds of millions of messages each day, while spending perhaps only a couple of hundred dollars for time on a network of hijacked computers. Even if just a tiny percentage of those messages gets through the filters, and even if only a tiny number of the e-mail recipients actually click through to buy something, the promise of handsome profit remains real. 
 ''The economics are still all stacked in the spammer's favor,'' Mr. Linford said.
 Still, the announcements from Microsoft and AOL last week drew widespread headlines, and they will surely prove dissuasive for some. But at least a few observers wonder if highlighting the gold bullion, fast cars and other booty amassed by prominent junk e-mailers isn't just as likely to tell second-string spammers that as long as you don't get caught, the game is worth the risk. 
 ''When you parade a stack of gold bars, coins and a loaded Hummer H2 in front of a spammer,'' wrote Brian McWilliams in his Web log at spamkings.oreilly.com, ''it's like waving red meat in the face of a Rottweiler.''

HEADLINE: Iran's New Leader Turns to Conservatives for His Cabinet

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Iran's new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on Sunday nominated a cabinet dominated by conservatives as officials warned that Iran would not give in to pressure from the West over its nuclear program.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's selections for his 21-member cabinet provide the first window into the policies that he may pursue in the next four years.
He had promised to establish a moderate government that would focus on the fair distribution of wealth and the eradication of corruption and poverty. But his candidates are largely from conservative backgrounds, and many of them are close to Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
 The proposed interior, cultural and intelligence ministers are well-known conservatives. Their nominations suggest that Mr. Ahmadinejad intends to restrict some of the social, cultural and political freedoms that were granted under the former president, Mohammad Khatami. 
 Some of the others are not well known, but according to background information carried by the ISNA news agency, a number have been members of the conservative Revolutionary Guards.
 Parliament must approve the cabinet, in a vote expected to be held in the coming days. But there is little doubt that the new president's choices will be approved.
 Iran also warned the West on Sunday that it would not negotiate over its uranium conversion plant in Isfahan, where it resumed work last week after rejecting an offer from European negotiators for a package of inducements to halt its nuclear program. 
 The United States contends that Iran is trying to pursue a clandestine program to build nuclear weapons. Iran contends that its program is for peaceful purposes.
 ''The Isfahan issue is over,'' said Mohammad Saidi, deputy chief of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, state television reported Sunday.
 ''What is left on the table for discussion is Natanz,'' he added, referring to the nuclear site where Iran can conduct the more delicate process of uranium enrichment. The process can lead to making nuclear fuel, or if enriched to higher levels, to making nuclear weapons. ''We definitely have plans for Natanz in the near future,'' he said. 
 Iran's departing Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamidreza Assefi, also said Iran had plans to resume its enrichment program. But, he said, ''Europe's behavior will heavily influence the decision.''
 Nearly 300 Islamist students staged a demonstration outside the British Embassy in downtown Tehran on Sunday. Protesters who bombarded the embassy with stones and tomatoes chanted, ''Iran must resume enrichment.'' Britain, France, Germany and Europe had been negotiating with Iran over the program. 
 Iran rejected a proposal from Europe this month to abandon its enrichment program in return for economic, technological, political and security incentives, and it resumed work at Isfahan. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency, could send the case to the Security Council for possible sanctions but so far has approved a resolution calling on Iran to halt its nuclear work. 
 Manouchehr Mottaki, who was nominated for the post of foreign minister, is close to conservatives in Parliament, where as a member he has criticized Iran's policies in its talks with Europe. He is a former ambassador to Japan and Turkey. 
 But analysts in Tehran said that because Ayatollah Khamenei makes foreign policy, Mr. Mottaki lacked the authority to make major changes. ''He might come with an agenda to make foreign policy about 10 percent more hard-line,'' said Nasser Hadian, a political science professor at Tehran University. ''But he showed in his TV debates'' with one of the nuclear negotiators ''that he is not such an extremist.'' 
 Mostafa Pourmohammadi, nominated to run the Interior Ministry, was deputy minister to a former conservative intelligence minister, Ali Fallahian, who suppressed cultural and political liberties. He has close ties to Ayatollah Khamenei.
 Hossein Mohseni Ejehei, a cleric proposed for the post of intelligence minister, was the leader of the special court of clergy and, as a judge, sent advocates of change to prison. Hossein Saffar Harandi, nominated as culture minister, is a former senior member of the Revolutionary Guards who advocates conservative policies as a newspaper columnist. 
 ''This is a cabinet that wants to create terror and fear,'' said Mostafa Tajzadeh, an advocate of change who was deputy interior minister.
 ''The first message after you hear their names is that political and cultural liberties are going to be restricted,'' he added. ''But it all depends on how political parties can keep society alert.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad nominated no women for his cabinet, although some conservative women in Parliament were expecting to win cabinet seats. Mr. Khatami had no women in his cabinet, but two women were among his several vice presidents. 
 Mr. Tajzadeh also said that judging from the cabinet list, Mr. Ahmadinejad appeared to be distancing himself from supporters who hoped he would improve economic opportunities for the average Iranian.

HEADLINE: Social Security Lessons

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Social Security turned 70 yesterday. And to almost everyone's surprise, the nation's most successful government program is still intact.
 Just a few months ago the conventional wisdom was that President Bush would get his way on Social Security. Instead, Mr. Bush's privatization drive flopped so badly that the topic has almost disappeared from national discussion. 
But I'd like to revisit Social Security for a moment, because it's important to remember what Mr. Bush tried to get away with. 
 Many pundits and editorial boards still give Mr. Bush credit for trying to ''reform'' Social Security. In fact, Mr. Bush came to bury Social Security, not to save it. Over time, the Bush plan would have transformed Social Security from a social insurance program into a mutual fund, with nothing except a name in common with the system F.D.R. created. 
 In addition to misrepresenting his goals, Mr. Bush repeatedly lied about the current system. Oh, I'm sorry -- was that a rude thing to say? Still, the fact is that Mr. Bush repeatedly said things that were demonstrably false and that his staff must have known were false. The falsehoods ranged from his claim that Social Security is unfair to African-Americans to his claim that ''waiting just one year adds $600 billion to the cost of fixing Social Security.''
 Meanwhile, the administration politicized the Social Security Administration and used taxpayer money to promote a partisan agenda. Social Security officials participated in what were in effect taxpayer-financed political rallies, from which skeptical members of the public were excluded.
 I'm writing about this in the past tense, but some of it is still going on. Last week Jo Anne Barnhart, the commissioner of Social Security, published an op-ed article claiming that Social Security as we know it was designed for a society in which people didn't live long enough to collect a lot of benefits. ''The number of older Americans living now,'' wrote Ms. Barnhart, ''is greater than anyone could have imagined in 1935.''
 Now, it turns out that an article on the Social Security Administration's Web site, ''Life Expectancy for Social Security,'' specifically rejects the idea the Social Security was originally ''designed in such a way that few people would collect the benefits,'' and the related idea that the system faces problems from ''a supposed dramatic increase in life expectancy in recent years.'' 
 And the current number of older Americans as a share of the population is just about what the founders of Social Security expected. The 1934 report of F.D.R.'s Commission on Economic Security, which laid the groundwork for the Social Security Act, projected that 12.7 percent of Americans would be 65 or older by the year 2000. The actual number was 12.4 percent.
 Despite Ms. Barnhart's efforts, however, privatization seems to be dead for the time being. The Democratic leadership in Congress defied the punditocracy -- which was very much in favor of privatization -- by refusing to cave in, and the American people made it clear that they like Social Security the way it is. 
 But the campaign for privatization provided an object lesson in how the administration sells its policies: by misrepresenting its goals, lying about the facts and abusing its control of government agencies. These were the same tactics used to sell both tax cuts and the Iraq war. 
 And there are two reasons to study that lesson. One is to be prepared for whatever comes next on Mr. Bush's agenda. Despite the tough talk about Iran, I don't think he can propose another war -- there aren't enough troops to fight the wars we already have. But there's still room for another big domestic initiative, probably tax reform. 
 Forewarned is forearmed: the real goals of reform won't be as advertised, the administration will say things about the current system that aren't true, and the Treasury Department will function in a purely partisan capacity. 
 The other is that the public's visceral rejection of privatization, together with growing dismay over the debacle in Iraq, offers Democrats an opportunity to make an issue of the administration's pattern of deception. The question is whether they will dare to seize that opportunity, when for some of them it means admitting that they, too, were fooled.

HEADLINE: Candidates Criticize Bloomberg's Use of City's Money

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ and MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker and a Democratic mayoral candidate, demanded yesterday that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg curb the city's rising costs of random bag searches on the subways by persuading the federal government to foot more of the bill.
 Mr. Bloomberg authorized the searches, which began on July 21, after the suicide bombings and attempted bombings on London's transit system. A New York police spokesman said that the searches and the increased patrols on the subways cost from $1.2 million to $1.9 million a week in overtime. 
''The city of New York has been getting shortchanged for years and is having to shoulder the burden of defending our country from foreign attack,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It's wrong, and I think the mayor ought to be standing up and doing something about it.''
 Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that his administration was doing all it could to secure federal money for antiterrorism measures. ''We are trying to get homeland security monies to pay for all of the different things that we do to keep this city safe,'' he said. 
 The Republican mayor and his four Democratic challengers weathered the heat and marched -- though not together -- in the Dominican Day Parade on Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan.
 Later, another Democratic mayoral candidate, C. Virginia Fields, lashed out at Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki for agreeing to grant Goldman Sachs at least $150 million in tax breaks, among other incentives, to build a $2 billion headquarters in Lower Manhattan. ''The hard-working people of New York City should not have to pay for Pataki and Bloomberg's failure of leadership,'' Ms. Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said in a statement.
 Mr. Bloomberg called Goldman ''a good corporate citizen,'' and said yesterday: ''Downtown, as you know, was shaken by a terrible tragedy. And it's just crucially important that we get companies to go down there, even sometimes when it's not in their economic interest, and so we try to soften the blow or make it better.''
 Earlier, the Democratic candidates made campaign appearances at churches. Representative Anthony D. Weiner visited St. Augustine's Episcopal Church in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, went to Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.
 Mr. Ferrer portrayed his bid for City Hall as a David-and-Goliath struggle. ''All the smart money was on Goliath,'' Mr. Ferrer told worshipers, adding, ''some guy shows up, a champion of the other side, about my height, about my size, a small guy.'' 
 Stu Loeser, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign spokesman, responded that if Mr. Ferrer was saying that it was tough running against a mayor who had brought down crime and led education reforms, ''then we aren't going to argue with him.''

HEADLINE: Can Gene-Altered Rice Help Rescue the Farm Belt?

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: WATSON, Mo. 

 BODY:
Like an expectant father, Jason Garst stood in calf-deep water and studied the three-foot-high rice plants growing in a flooded field here. 
 It was a curious sight in northwest Missouri, where the growing season is considered to be too short for rice. Mr. Garst, a sixth-generation farmer, is hoping at least one of the 12 varieties on his test plot will sprout this fall. If one does, he will start growing rice plants that have been genetically engineered to produce proteins found in human milk, saliva and tears. Once converted into a powder form, those proteins would be used in granola bars and drinks to help infants in developing countries avoid death from diarrhea.
''I know in my heart that this will be better than anything else we are doing,'' said Mr. Garst, 35, who also farms soybeans and potatoes. 
 The rice project is backed by a private company called Ventria Bioscience but also has the support of the state and a local university, which are hoping to reverse the long decline in the area's farm economy. But the project has run into opposition from environmental groups and even the beer giant Anheuser-Busch amid fears about the health effects of genetically engineered crops, making Mr. Garst's little rice paddy a piece of a larger battlefield. 
 The economic and academic ambitions of the Missouri project make it unique, but the arguments echo those heard in similar disputes in Europe and, increasingly, in the United States. Critics of Ventria's plans are concerned that the gene-altered rice could contaminate regular rice crops and pose a health risk to consumers, scaring off buyers. Ventria and its academic partner in the project, Northwest Missouri State University, say they can control the potential for contamination. And they say the risks are minimal when balanced against the potential for the special rice to help cut the costs of drugs and save lives.
 The debate has a certain urgency in the Farm Belt because it highlights the challenge facing much of the region's economy: finding new products that will reduce farmers' reliance on commodity crops. As equipment has become more efficient and foreign competition has stiffened, farms have consolidated and profit margins have shrunk, forcing farmers to plant ever more acres to squeeze out a living. The genetic engineering work that Ventria and other companies are doing can add value to products like rice, offering farmers a more stable income that does not rely on steep government subsidies.
 ''There is no question that this represents a chance to transform the economy of the region,'' said Mark Drabenstott, director of the Center for the Study of Rural America at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. ''For regions like northwest Missouri, there is not a long list of economic alternatives.''
 Despite opposition, Ventria's plans to grow genetically engineered rice -- eventually to commercial scale -- are going forward. The company began growing rice in North Carolina this summer after getting approval from the Agriculture Department. Once Ventria decides where it will grow rice in Missouri, it will have to apply for a permit from the department, a process expected to take two to three months.
 Dean L. Hubbard, president of Northwest Missouri State, persuaded Ventria last year to move its operations from Sacramento to new buildings planned for the Northwest campus in Maryville, about 90 miles north of Kansas City. 
 Seeking a way to reverse the area's slide in population, Dr. Hubbard teamed up with Melvin D. Booth, a Northwest Missouri alumnus who previously ran two large biotechnology companies. The two approached Ventria about making it part of the university's plan to form joint ventures with young biopharmaceutical companies.
 Ventria was already considering similar offers from universities in Georgia, Louisiana and North Carolina, but Scott E. Deeter, Ventria's chief executive, agreed to visit the university last August. Mr. Deeter said that on the ride from the Kansas City airport, he was intrigued when Dr. Hubbard described the university's program to heat and cool the campus using bio-fuel derived from paper and wood chips.
 At the meeting, Mr. Garst presented him with a research paper he had prepared on what it would take to grow rice in northern Missouri. ''It was very impressive,'' said Ning Huang, Ventria's vice president for research and development, who was there.
 Finally it came down to whether Ventria scientists would agree to move to Maryville, population 10,000, from California. Next year 13 will move, including Dr. Huang.
 Under the agreement reached last November, Ventria will pay farmers more than double what they make on their most profitable crop, and pay Northwest Missouri $500 an acre for crops grown on university land. The university is spending about $10 million to help build a production and teaching complex, and the state is kicking in another $10 million.
 Atchison County, Mo., where Mr. Garst's farmland is, has lost more than 1,000 people, or 14 percent of its population, since 1990. The town of Watson, once a thriving rural hub with three grocery stores and an opera house, has just over 100 people and no place to buy a soda. Most buildings have been boarded up. 
 ''To reverse the population slide, you have to make it profitable to farm,'' Dr. Hubbard said. ''My dream is that 10 years from now, this rural economy has been transformed, that it is vibrant again and people are renovating their downtowns.''
 The fate of Mr. Garst's experimental rice plot has loomed larger since Ventria encountered resistance to planting its rice in the southern part of the state, where rice has traditionally been grown. 
 When the company was considering Missouri as a place to grow its rice, it talked to Anheuser-Busch, which uses Missouri rice in its beer. Mr. Deeter said Anheuser-Busch initially did not raise any opposition to the project. But when Ventria tried to plant rice in southern Missouri this spring, the beer maker threatened not to buy any rice grown in the state. The company feared a consumer backlash if people thought gene-altered rice could end up in their bottles of Bud. 
 For Missouri's farm economy, the risk of growing pharmaceutical rice is high. More than half of Missouri's rice is sent abroad, to the European Union and Caribbean countries that are especially sensitive about genetically modified products. 
 ''We are still having to make statements to our customers that the rice we export is not genetically modified,'' said Carl Brothers, the vice president for marketing at Riceland Foods, which markets more than half of Missouri's rice. ''We are concerned longer term that if Ventria and others get involved that will get harder to say.''
 The two companies reached a truce in April: Ventria agreed not to grow genetically modified rice within 120 miles of commercial rice crops. ''We can continue to purchase rice grown and processed in Missouri as long as Ventria's growing areas remain sufficiently far from commercial rice production,'' said Francine Katz, a spokeswoman for Anheuser-Busch.
 That deal suddenly made four test plots in the northern part of the state, including Mr. Garst's, all the more important, since Ventria's agreement with Northwest Missouri State calls for the company to grow 70 percent of its rice in the state.
 To prove to its customers that it would have a diverse supply base, Ventria must grow in at least one other location in North America, and is also searching for a growing area in the Southern Hemisphere to be able to produce year-round. In June, Ventria planted 70 acres of genetically modified rice in North Carolina. There, environmentalists continue to attack the company, saying the rice poses a threat to other crops and the human food chain.
 Ventria's rice fields are just a few miles from a rice-seed-screening research center and are also close to two wildlife refuges with large populations of migrant birds and swans that environmentalists contend could transport Ventria's rice seeds into wild areas. Storms and floods, environmentalists say, could also lead to rice contamination.
 ''Just washing away in a big rain- storm is enough,'' said Margaret Mellon, director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington. Scientists at Ventria, which is yet to make any money from its bio-rice, say rice is among the safest crops for genetic engineering. Rice stalks pollinate themselves, so the altered genes, which are synthetic versions of human genes, cannot be easily transferred to plants in other fields. And Ventria requires farmers to employ a ''closed system,'' using dedicated equipment and a production process where the seed is ground into a powder before it leaves the farm.
 But critics say that there is no way to guarantee that the farmers will follow all the government regulations and Ventria's rules, and that they are worried about the risk of contamination because it would be hard to detect. ''We simply wouldn't know if a contamination event took place,'' said Craig Culp, a spokesman for the Center for Food Safety, in Washington. 
 Dr. Hubbard acknowledged that there are risks, but he said he believed that they were minimal.
 Federal regulations have been tested before, most notably in 2002, when drug-producing corn made by ProdiGene began sprouting in soybean fields near its Iowa and Nebraska sites. The Agriculture Department seized 500,000 bushels of soybeans and assessed the company nearly $3 million in fines and disposal costs. Earlier, in 2000, a gene-altered variety of corn that was approved for animal feed but not for human consumption was found in taco shells and other grocery items, prompting recalls. 
 Mr. Garst is a modern breed of farmer with a master's degree and a healthy interest in science. And he himself has done whatever he can to wring more from his commodity crops, even trying out a $300,000 tractor that steers automatically using a global-positioning satellite to till straighter rows. 
 ''Obviously, you will not see pharmaceutical crops from here to Kansas City,'' he said of Ventria's project. ''But there will be pockets in this area where you will see development. If you keep two more farmers in this area it is huge -- there are four of us now.''

HEADLINE: A Whiff of 'Reefer Madness' in U.S. Drug Policy

BYLINE: By SALLY SATEL, M.D.. 
Sally Satel is a psychiatrist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a co-author of ''One Nation Under Therapy.''

 BODY:
Patients arrive broke, busted or abandoned at our methadone clinic in a raw section of Northeast Washington. They are opiate addicts, primarily dependent on heroin, though some take vast doses of street-bought painkillers like OxyContin.
 Drinking the pink methadone solution every day prevents withdrawal sickness.
About half of our patients have also spent years on crack or alcohol. Not all have stopped, but at least they have cut back. We see almost no methamphetamine users, but that is a simple accident of geography -- the corrosive drug hasn't yet reached epidemic proportions in this part of the country. 
 The personal ravages of hard-core addiction are enormous, and they translate into enormous social costs -- crime, violence, incarceration, homelessness, unemployment, hepatitis C, H.I.V./AIDS. 
 Such an immense burden makes me wonder about the wisdom of federal priorities.
 Why is marijuana, of all drugs, the main target of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy? 
 Answer: the gateway theory of addiction. Start with marijuana, the idea is, and progress to methamphetamine or heroin or cocaine.
 To me, the ''gateway'' assumption, which took root in the 1950's, has a nostalgic, ''Reefer Madness'' feel. But it is still driving federal policy. The drug czar's office made that clear last month in response to a call from the National Association of Counties ''to put the same kind of emphasis on methamphetamine abuse as they have on marijuana.'' The association had just announced that its 500 members were reeling from methamphetamine-related crime, incarceration and child-neglect. 
 The Office of National Drug Control Policy defended its prioritization. Addressing ''early marijuana use is an effective way of heading off and preventing subsequent movement into other drug use,'' said a spokesman for the drug czar on National Public Radio. 
 Is this true? Is the gateway argument a valid justification for marijuana policy?
 No reasonable person disputes that most users of cocaine and heroin have smoked marijuana earlier in life. Likewise, the more frequently people consume marijuana the more likely they are to try hard drugs. 
 But what is the nature of the linkage? Is it actual cause and effect, as the drug czar's office implied, or a correlation based on a common factor that predisposes youth to drug use in general? And how frequently do we observe such a progression? 
 One theory is that teenagers who smoke marijuana without incident are emboldened by the experience to try other more risky and exotic drugs. And perhaps buying marijuana brings them in contact with dealers of stronger drugs. 
 Or possibly cocaine and heroin abusers would have developed their drug problems no matter what. As RAND researchers reported in a 2002 article, ''Reassessing the Marijuana Gateway Effect,'' ''Marijuana use precedes hard drug use simply because opportunities to use marijuana come earlier in life than opportunities to use hard drugs.''
 A relatively newer theory suggests that marijuana sets up the user's brain to be more receptive to harder drugs. A much-publicized 1997 study from the Scripps Research Institute reported that cannabis activates the same reward circuitry in the brain as cocaine, heroin, tobacco and alcohol. But this has dubious relevance to future addiction. After all, almost any normal pleasurable activity, like eating or sex, also stimulates those pathways. 
 In any event, a brain activation effect couldn't be too powerful, as most casual marijuana smokers do not graduate to the abuse of hard drugs. Only about 3 percent of monthly cannabis users go on to try a hard drug in the same year, according to data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. And roughly one-fifth of those who try cocaine eventually become addicted; perhaps one-third of heroin experimenters do.
 Social scientists have found that adolescents who progress to hard drugs are already quite troubled to begin with. Truancy, failing in school, fighting, stealing and drinking often come before heroin or cocaine involvement. Marijuana use before age 15 is also a red flag indicating psychological turmoil and social instability. 
 By contrast, older teenagers who experiment with marijuana generally function as well as nonusers with respect to school and mental well-being.
 These observations are consistent with my own clinical experience.
 As staff psychiatrist for the clinic, I have taken over 500 detailed histories of adults with opiate addictions. Marijuana was the least of their problems when they were young. More often, they were staggering under the weight of a chaotic home life and had dropped out school, committed petty crimes and battled depression. These problems, not marijuana, led them to hard drugs.
 Efforts to prevent new generations of addicts are noble, but they should be rational too. It's hard to say whether any one policy a drug czar could devise would have derailed the early trajectories of my patients' lives. But it is clear that such a large investment in the gateway theory has been of little help.

HEADLINE: From a Childhood Ambition Comes a Quest to Save the Tiger

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

 BODY:
In the 1960's, when Ullas Karanth was a teenager in India, he read books by naturalists who were researching the tigers of Asia. ''Someday, I'll study tigers, too,'' he told himself.
 But in a country still emerging from colonial rule, there was no such profession as wildlife biologist. And so Ullas Karanth took up engineering, which he detested, only to give it up and become a farmer, bringing him closer to the wilderness and the tigers.
By the 1980's, he had established himself as a kind of amateur biologist gathering information on the animals of the Nagarahole reserve near to his farm. 
 That work eventually led to an opportunity to study in the United States and later to become a protege of the pioneering tiger expert George Schaller. Today Dr. Karanth is himself a leading tiger researcher and the director of the Wildlife Conservation Society's India Program, which is based in Bangalore. 
 Dr. Karanth, 57, was in New York on a recent summer afternoon to attend a conference at the Bronx Zoo, a subsidiary of the conservation society, on the future of tigers in the wild. In a break in the proceedings, he spoke of his favorite feline. 

Q. Do we know how many wild tigers still exist in India?

A. We don't. The government claims that there are over 3,000. But that figure is based on a flawed counting method that officials developed for themselves. There are preservation groups who claim the number is more like 1,000. It's probably not that low.
 At the Wildlife Conservation Society, we won't guess. What we will say, based on scientific data, is that there are only about 115,000 square miles of forest still left in the country where tigers can thrive and breed.
 In most of that territory, there's been a tremendous tiger decline due to habitat degradation by local people and development activities like mines, dams and roads, and the poaching of tiger prey. We believe that if India is to have tigers, these wildlife reserves must be rigorously protected. 

Q. Is the killing of tigers for use in traditional Chinese medicine contributing to their disappearance?

A. That's part of it. The fact that the parts of one dead tiger are worth something like $5,000 certainly encourages poachers.
 Actually the biggest threat to tiger survival is habitat destruction and the uncontrolled hunting of tiger-prey species. We have plenty of forest areas where there should be tigers, but their numbers are low there because the prey species have been hunted out by local people. So it turns out that if you want to protect tigers, you also need to protect the deer.
 In India, wildlife conservation has an unusual history. Tigers were very much in decline until the 1970's, when Indira Gandhi came to power. She was an autocrat. But she was also a very keen naturalist, and she had complete control over the nation's politics. Mrs. Gandhi told her minions that there would be no more destruction of important wildlife areas and she enforced that order.
 She put in strong laws, stopped uncontrolled hunting and logging in the reserves. And thanks to her cracking of the whip, the tiger came back.
 That recovery continued until the 1990's, when Indian politics became very fragmented. The leaders we've had since are excellent on economic development, but none have shown much interest in conservation. 

Q. You've spent decades observing tiger behavior. What do you find most interesting about them?

A. The way nature has designed them. They are built to take down prey four to five times their own size. If I went into the forest, it would be hard for me to get within striking range of a deer. This huge cat does it effortlessly. It can grab onto something that weighs about a ton, wrestles it down and kill it, all very safely and quietly.

Q. Have you ever gotten emotionally involved with the animals you were observing?

A. Objective scientists aren't supposed to, but I have. During the early 1990's, I was putting radio collars on tigers and leopards at Nagarahole reserve in southern India and then tracking their behavior.
 With time, this one leopard got really quite habituated to me. For two years, I'd follow him at night. I had a little laboratory in the middle of the forest, and this leopard used to come around at midnight frequently and I'd hear his call.
 Even half asleep, I'd turn on my receiver and when I'd pick up his signals, I felt, oh, O.K., there's my leopard. But one morning, his signal read as if he was lying inactive somewhere in the forest and I really got worried.
 When I finally located him, he was strung up like a lynching victim. The leopard had walked into a snare some poacher had set up for deer. 
 Yes, I know, leopards have high mortality rates, and I'm not supposed to feel emotion. But when this happens to a creature you know, you can't be coldblooded.
 Incidents like this happen every day and their toll on animal life is cumulative. The killers are usually local people trying to get some protein. 
 However, this is one reason I feel negatively toward the ''sustainable use'' concept that one hears so much in development circles. 

Q. What's wrong with the concept of sustainable use and the idea of financing projects for local people to make money from the forests, and in turn protect the animals?

A. It's naive. People and tigers have never coexisted harmoniously. They compete for land, protein, resources. In a country like India where there are so many people and so little land, sustainable development is actually a recipe for wiping out the protected areas.
 If you want tigers, you can't have people sweeping through the reserves cutting down trees, gathering forest products, hunting for protein and creating gardens that fragment the natural areas. 
 Moreover, you definitely should not be paying forestry officials -- charged with protecting wildlife -- to do rural economic development. If you do it, their mission drifts toward development and the wildlife conservation part gets lost. 
 To protect wildlife, you have to do the harder thing, which is set aside some areas where human activities are reduced or eliminated. At present, about 5 percent of the country is designated as protected. But I estimate that 75 percent of that ''protected'' land has been compromised by human activity. This needs to be halted.

Q. Do you think the Indian tiger can be saved?

A. Certainly. If there's the will. One thing that gives us a head start: India actually has more wild tigers than our neighbors.
 We won't need to reintroduce them. Also, tigers reproduce easily; they are not like pandas. 
 Also, I believe that there are aspects of Indian culture that can be mobilized for conservation. If you look at the Hindu religion, there's real guilt associated with the killing of an animal. So if you are protecting a park and you catch a poacher, this sense of guilt puts the enforcement officials at an advantage. 
 Another thing, at the core of our religion is the belief that man is a part of nature. This supports the idea that wild animals have a right to survive. 
 I've talked with farmers whose crops have been raided by elephants, and they really hated them. But when you asked, ''Don't elephants and tigers have the right to exist?'' they always said yes. All these factors make me optimistic.

HEADLINE: Prices of Drugs for Elderly Said to Far Outrun Inflation

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
For the third consecutive year, the average prices of dozens of brand-name prescription drugs widely used by elderly Americans have risen more than twice as fast as general inflation, according to a survey to be released today by the advocacy group AARP.
 The 12-month average increase for 195 drugs was 6.6 percent, or more than double the 3.1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index that tracks general inflation.
Also in line with the trend in recent years, there was little inflation -- less than 1 percent -- in the average price of generic drugs, AARP said. 
 Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a University of Minnesota drug price specialist who analyzed wholesale drug prices for the AARP survey, said the price increases underscored the big burden the federal government will be taking on in January, when Medicare benefits will be expanded to include prescription drugs. 
 Consumer groups, including AARP, which represents older Americans, have been trying to persuade Congress and the Bush administration to use Medicare's vast purchasing power to bargain directly with drug makers on prices. Under the 2003 law that set up the new drug benefit, Medicare is currently barred from such negotiating, but must accept prices negotiated by insurers, drugstore chains and pharmacy benefit managers -- which individually lack Medicare's clout. 
 Drug makers, Mr. Schondelmeyer said, ''want to manage their prices, and they might as well start from as high a point as they can.''
 Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the drug industry, criticized the AARP numbers, saying they were based on wholesale prices and ''do not reflect the true amounts paid by seniors for their medicines.'' Mr. Johnson, a senior vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, said actual overall drug prices were not rising as fast as general inflation, once rebates and discounts arranged by insurers were taken into account. 
 That view is shared by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research center in Washington. ''With the new Medicare benefit, no senior will have to pay the full retail price for prescription drugs,'' Joseph Antos of the institute and Thomas F. Wildsmith of the Hay Group, an organizational consulting firm, wrote in a recent institute report.
 But Dee Mahan, a health policy specialist with Families USA, a consumer advocacy group, said wholesale prices were ''a valid thing to look at'' because increases at the wholesale level were typically passed along to purchasers after discounts were subtracted. 
 Ann Smith, a spokeswoman for Medco Health Solutions, a large pharmaceutical managed care company that negotiates rebates and discounts on behalf of drug plans, said the 6.6 percent wholesale price increases were ''generally what we are also seeing.''
 The difference in inflation between name-brand and generic drugs is illustrated by statins -- drugs used to lower cholesterol. Early this year Pfizer raised the wholesale price 5 percent for Lipitor, the best-selling statin, to $2.17 each for 10-milligram pills and $3.15 each for 20-milligram pills. 
 But there was no increase in the $1.18 wholesale price for several generic versions of Mevacor, an older statin. 
 Other price increases in the first quarter of 2005 on AARP's list of ''top brand-name prescription drug products'' included Merck's Fosamax calcium treatment, up 4.9 percent, and Sanofi Pharmaceutical's Ambien sleeping pills, up 5 percent. 
 More than half the drugs in the sample, 110 of 195, had increases in manufacturers' wholesale prices in the first quarter of 2005. For a typical older American who regularly takes three brand-name prescription drugs for a chronic condition, the price for a year's worth of those drugs would probably have increased $866, on average, since 2000, AARP said.

HEADLINE: Fuel Economy Plan Is Seen Omitting Rule for Big S.U.V.'s 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is expected to abandon a proposal to extend fuel economy regulations to include Hummer H2's and other huge sport utility vehicles, auto industry and other officials say. 
 The proposal was among a number of potential strategies outlined by the administration in 2003 to overhaul mileage requirements for light trucks -- sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans. It had been seen by industry officials as likely to be adopted.
But the impact of the tougher requirements would have been borne almost solely by the increasingly troubled domestic auto industry, a concern for the administration. 
 Its broad plan to overhaul the light-truck mileage rules would change the regulatory system from one using averaged mileage for an automaker's entire annual light-truck output to one that sets up five or six classes, determined by a vehicle's size.
 The rules, the first major rewriting of fuel economy standards since they were created in the 1970's, will be released late this month. They are sure to renew vigorous debate about the nation's dependence on foreign oil, a matter underlined by rapidly rising oil and gas prices. 
 The administration plan is still being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, which has had a role in drafting the plan. Further revisions could be made, including on the question of extending the regulatory system to cover larger vehicles. Until the details are published, its potential effect on the nation's oil consumption will not be fully clear. And the volatility of oil prices could push consumers toward buying more efficient vehicles, a trend that may outstrip regulations in determining fuel consumption in years ahead.
 ''We have no comment on it until we're ready to release it,'' said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a branch of the Transportation Department. ''It's still a fluid process at this point. We look forward to significant fuel savings without sacrificing safety or doing harm to the American economy.''
 Because cars, S.U.V.'s and other light-duty vehicles account for 40 percent of the nation's oil use, changes in the regulatory system are always watched closely, more so in an era of increased concern over foreign oil imports, rising fuel prices and debate on the effects of global warming. 
 The broad outline of the Bush plan is almost certain to meet objections from environmentalists and those hoping for an aggressive approach to curbing dependence on foreign oil. But domestic automakers are likely to see it as a victory, since the new plan will decrease advantages that some foreign automakers, like Honda, have in the current system because they do not make the heaviest trucks and S.U.V.'s. 
 Roughly speaking, corporate average fuel economy regulations -- known as C.A.F.E. standards in the industry -- divide each automaker's annual new vehicle production into two categories: passenger cars and light-duty trucks. New cars must average 27.5 miles a gallon and light trucks 21.2 miles a gallon in 2005 models and 22.2 miles by 2007. The figures represent lab-generated mileage and overstate the numbers that can be achieved on the road. Rules for cars are not being changed.
 When the current two-category system was created in the 1970's, cars ruled the American road. Since then, automakers have developed new classes of vehicles that qualify as trucks, including S.U.V.'s, minivans and family-oriented pickup trucks with two rows of seats. As a result, not only is the number of vehicles on the road increasing, but the average new vehicle is getting lower mileage than it did two decades ago because so many more new vehicles are trucks. An increasing emphasis on horsepower is also a major factor. 
 Larger sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks weighing more than 8,500 pounds when loaded, like many Hummers and Ford Excursions, have been exempt from the regulations. When the system was created, vehicles of that weight were generally used for commercial purposes, but now hundreds of thousands sold each year are intended for family use.
 Automakers have had powerful incentives to produce such vehicles because they are exempt from fuel regulations, have had rich profit margins, and many consumers can claim tax breaks for them. The administration had suggested including larger S.U.V.'s in fuel economy regulations in a first wave of proposals in December 2003, but domestic automakers objected that such a move would harm their fragile bottom lines. 
 The decision not to include larger S.U.V.'s was a recent development, said people briefed on the deliberations, who declined to be identified before the plan is made public. There could still be revisions, and the plan's release will be followed by a public comment period and then a revised final rule, which must be published by next April to have an effect on 2008 models.
 Gasoline prices have become a powerful counterweight to regulatory benefits given the biggest gas guzzlers. Many automakers, seeing the weakness in sales of large S.U.V.'s this year -- they have recovered only after heavy discounting -- are re-emphasizing plans for smaller, lighter S.U.V.'s in the future. 
 Under the Bush administration plan, about half a dozen size classes will be determined by the vehicle's length and width. Instead of an overall mileage requirement for the total fleet of light trucks a manufacturer sells in a model year, makers will have to meet some kind of target or average within each size class. As a result of the proliferating categories, it will probably become more difficult to predict fuel economy trends. 
 ''It's an invitation to game the system and increase our oil dependence and the pollution that results,'' said Dan Becker, a global warming strategist at the Sierra Club. ''The Bush administration is failing to use the most powerful weapon in its arsenal to save people money at the pump.'' 
 Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a lobbying group for General Motors, Toyota and several other producers, said: ''The one thing we haven't heard is what the values will be for the different categories, and that will really tell us what the system means. 
 ''Once the proposal comes out, we will have to take a hard look at it and see what the benefits may be to improving fuel economy.'' 
 The administration has taken some steps to increase fuel regulations for light trucks, raising the mileage standard for trucks to 22.2 miles a gallon for 2007 models, from 20.7 miles a gallon in 2004 models. Environmentalists have argued that gains from that move were offset by credits given to automakers for making vehicles that can use ethanol, even though there are few gas stations that carry the required blend. 
 Under the administration's plan, for 2008 to 2010 models automakers will have a choice of complying with the new size-based system or the current system, though a further increase beyond 22.2 miles a gallon is expected in the current system. After 2010, the current system will be eliminated.

HEADLINE: Honoring Rebels With a Social Agenda 

BYLINE: By ROSLYN SULCAS

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 13 

 BODY:
''Wow, that was intense,'' the choreographer Robert Battle said, emerging from the American Dance Legacy Institute gala performance at Skidmore College here. Mr. Battle, along with about 50 dancers, choreographers and educators, was in Saratoga Springs as part of a five-day conference held by the institute. Its focus was the New Dance Group, a now largely forgotten but once influential collective of dancers, teachers and choreographers during the 1930's, 40's and 50's, whose work was featured at the gala.
 ''The group was the most important voice in dance when I began in the 40's,'' said the choreographer Donald McKayle, who was honored during the conference. ''There was nowhere else in New York City where you could take classes in all kinds of modern dance techniques, as well as in ethnic dance forms. And it had a real social agenda: it was racially mixed, and classes cost 10 cents, so that no one was excluded.'' 
Mr. McKayle, a tall, genial man who looks at least a decade younger than his 75 years, is well known in the dance world and has had a successful choreographic and academic career. But many of his teachers and choreographic peers at the New Dance Group -- Sophie Maslow, Jean Erdman, Hadassah, Valerie Bettis -- remain, at best, names from the history books, even to dance lovers.
 ''The New Dance Group had fallen through the cracks by the 70's,'' said Carolyn Adams, a former Paul Taylor dancer who founded the American Dance Legacy Institute in 1994 with her sister, Julie Adams Strandberg. By the early 1990's, they decided that something had to be done about dancers' lack of access to this kind of seminal historical repertory. ''It's as if drama students could never read Shakespeare, or music students listen to Mozart,'' Ms. Strandberg said.
 The women were not exactly short of things to do: Ms. Adams has directed the New York State Summer School of the Arts modern dance program in Saratoga Springs for 17 years and serves on several dance advisory boards; Ms. Strandberg started Brown University's dance program and is associate artistic director at the summer school. Still, the American Dance Legacy Institute was created to shepherd a project the sisters had thought about for a long time: the development of several ''Etudes,'' reasonably priced packages of videotaped and written material that would offer a distillation of a choreographer's work in the form of a solo, with footage of detailed coaching, historical background, a Labanotation score, musical score and costume designs. 
 ''For $75, it lets people have concrete physical experience of a choreographer's work without that choreographer having to be present,'' Ms. Adams said. ''It's an incredible educational tool.'' 
 To date, nine such Etudes, in various stages of completion, exist, and the project remains the principal goal of the institute, which is based at Brown, in Providence, R.I. (Ms. Strandberg's dance students there have participated in research on and reconstruction of near-forgotten works.) Several Etudes have documented New Dance Group members: Mr. McKayle, Anna Sokolow, Daniel Nagrin and Pearl Primus. The others are on works by Jose Limon and by a younger generation: David Parsons, Danny Grossman, Danny Buraczeski and Mr. Battle.
 This year's institute conference celebrated the Etudes and also the opening of an exhibition about the New Dance Group, ''Dancing Rebels,'' at the National Dance Museum here. Organized by Ms. Adams and Ms. Strandberg and attractively designed by Ralfe Lawson, it offers a brief but fascinating look at the group's history and work, notably the socialist ethic that motivated these choreographers from the group's inception in 1932. ''Dance Is a Weapon in the Class Struggle,'' one poster proclaims. 
 The exhibition (which will run for a year) and the presence of several original members of the group -- Mr. McKayle, Mary Anthony, Jean-Leon Destine, Muriel Manning, Billie Kirpich -- provided a thought-provoking context for the gala Friday night. At a panel discussion before the performance, the question was posed: Is there still a place for dance with a social conscience? 
 The enthusiasm of the audience, which included many summer-school dance students, seemed to suggest an affirmative response. Among the many affecting performances, Eve Gentry's 1938 ''Tenant of the Street,'' a solo about homelessness that uses tensed, drawn-out movement to draw a portrait of inner fear and loneliness, was beautifully danced by Mary Anne Santos Newhall. In ''The End,'' a solo from Anna Sokolow's 1955 ''Rooms,'' Amy Taravella demonstrated the economy of physical means with which intense emotion can be displayed, as did Mary Ford in Mary Anthony's ''Lady Macbeth.'' 
 Some of the pieces were historical curiosities; Jean Erdman's Balinese-inspired ''Creature on a Journey,'' and Hadassah's ''Shuvi Nafshi'' show the interest at the time in ethnic and folkloric dance forms. But Mr. Nagrin's 1948 ''Strange Hero,'' a stylized rendition of a cigarette-smoking gangster brought to vivid life by Shane O'Hara, looked entirely fresh, as did Mr. McKayle's ''Rainbow Etude,'' movingly danced by Jude Sandy. And Mr. McKayle's 1972 solo, ''Angelitos Negros,'' performed by Stephanie Powell, proved the highlight of the evening. Ms. Powell wielded every inch of her long, sinuous body with impeccable power and control, effortlessly conveying the grandeur and pathos of the words to which she dances: ''Though the Virgin may be white,/ Paint little black angels for me,/ For they too go to heaven.''
 ''To see the works that pioneered the art form is incredibly important,'' Mr. Battle said Saturday morning, after teaching a class to summer students. ''At that moment, those choreographers were daring, and it encourages me to go into the unknown, to think about what impact I might have 30 or 40 years from now.''

HEADLINE: The Binge Continues

 BODY:
When a country buys more from foreigners than it sells to them -- as the United States does -- the result is a trade gap that must be plugged by selling off American assets, mostly corporate and government bonds. We've seen that system, for lack of a better word, function swimmingly in the past few days. 
 On Friday, the government reported that the United States' trade imbalance with the rest of the world hit $58.8 billion in June. It was the third-biggest monthly deficit on record, exceeded only by the figures from February and last November, and it led to market jitters over the government's ability to finance its huge deficits on favorable terms. Yesterday, however, the Treasury announced that foreigners poured $71.2 billion into the United States in June, comfortably covering that month's trade gap. The markets exhaled. Stock prices rose, and the dollar gained on the euro. 
That would be fine, and the markets -- and the American people -- could continue to breathe easy, if the foreign capital flowing into the United States were purely a sign of American economic vitality. Unfortunately, that's not the case. 
 A big reason that foreign money is coming here is that interest rates in the United States are higher than elsewhere. That may -- or may not -- continue for some time, but attracting capital because one's rates are better is generally considered only a temporary advantage. When conditions change, the focus of investors and traders shifts to fundamental strengths and weaknesses -- the underpinnings that determine the long-term health of an economy.
 Looked at that way, attracting the money the United States needs could well require even higher interest rates than those currently on offer. That's because the United States' budget and trade deficits and its heavy foreign indebtedness are significant fundamental weaknesses.
 More disturbing still, the trade gap itself is likely to grow substantially and require ever greater foreign financing. The deficit in June was measured before the price of oil rose in July and August. Factoring in higher energy costs, future deficits are likely to be higher than June's by tens of billions of dollars every month for the near future, if not for a long time to come. Even before the recent spikes in oil prices, the United States was on track for a trade deficit this year of more than $700 billion, easily twice the size that most economists consider sustainable.
 The United States will always manage to finance its deficits. The question is how high the interest rates will have to go. The answer depends in large part on getting the fundamental weaknesses under control. 
 Unfortunately, the Bush administration is crowing about long-term budget deficit targets it cannot reach under any set of reasonable assumptions, while Congress's response to the trade deficit is to blame China. In the meantime, the interest on the bonds that are financing Americans' insatiable appetite for everything from gasoline to toys is piling up, to be paid by the children and grandchildren of today's consumers.

HEADLINE: Goldman at Ground Zero

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Goldman Sachs Decides to Stay at Ground Zero'' (front page, Aug. 11) provides an interesting counterpoint to an increasingly prevalent view of business called ''corporate social responsibility.''
This view tries to redefine businesses as engines of social welfare that happen to make profit by giving ''stakeholders'' -- interested parties tangentially related to corporations -- comparable, if not greater, influence over corporate governance than that held by shareholders. 
 But businesses help people most when they earn profits. The Goldman Sachs decision to stay in Lower Manhattan will revitalize the area and create hundreds of new jobs. Those employed as contractors, traders and even maintenance staff will spend their earnings, creating demand for even more jobs. 
 Goldman Sachs made its decision based on cold economic analysis, not on how many families it can lift out of poverty. But a revitalized Lower Manhattan will make things better for everyone.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Seeks Stakes In New Sites For Trading

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Two deals to secure places to trade stocks and options that could eventually be alternatives to the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market are expected to be announced soon, with nearly every significant Wall Street bank scrambling to align itself with one or both of the efforts.
 Morgan Stanley, UBS, Credit Suisse First Boston and Citigroup are expected to announce today that they are joining Merrill Lynch and the Citadel Derivatives Group in buying an equity stake in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which trades options and stocks and has the ability to trade futures.
At the same time, Fidelity Investments, Lehman Brothers, Credit Suisse First Boston, Citigroup and a Citigroup unit, Lava Trading, are in advanced talks to create an electronic stock trading platform in Boston, which will be structured similarly to the Boston Options Exchange, according to two people briefed on that plan. 
 The two deals appear to be a reaction against the might of the New York Stock Exchange and of Nasdaq. The power of those two markets was magnified earlier this year, when the New York exchange announced a merger with Archipelago, an all-electronic market, and days later Nasdaq agreed to buy another electronic trading platform, Instinet. 
 While the Big Board and Nasdaq have been fierce competitors for years, some of the big Wall Street firms, which account for a huge chunk of the trading sent to these exchanges, bristled at the duopoly being created virtually overnight, fearing that the cost of trading could rise. 
 Financial institutions seek to trade stocks at the best price for their clients. By becoming stakeholders in different trading arenas, they hope to make sure that they have a say in how markets operate.
 ''It's an insurance policy for the future,'' said Junius W. Peake, a professor of finance at the University of Northern Colorado. ''They are keeping an oar in if there needs to be another exchange that does something useful.''
 Representatives for all the firms involved declined to comment yesterday.
 Notably absent from the efforts to seek alternate trading marketplaces is the investment bank Goldman Sachs, which conceived of the combination of the New York Stock Exchange and Archipelago. Goldman advised both parties on the merger, which caused something of an uproar among competitors. 
 Foremost among their concerns was that Goldman not only owns seats on the New York exchange, but also owns a leading specialist firm on the floor and holds an equity stake in Archipelago.
 Chief executives at some banks, including Merrill Lynch, expressed dismay that the Big Board would consider such a transformative deal without consulting its major owners and users. Of course, most other Wall Street firms are also owners of seats on the exchange, and a few own specialist firms and or stakes in electronic trading operators or other alternative markets.
 And the Big Board and Archipelago were fully aware of those potential conflicts, as they hired other banks to render fairness opinions and signed a merger agreement that clearly laid them out.
 Still, the widespread interest among Wall Street's top trading firms in the Philadelphia exchange and in a new Boston exchange shows how much the trading universe has changed in just a few years. Shares, once bought and sold on the floors of exchanges, are increasingly traded electronically. 
 Exchanges, both national and regional, which were member-owned cooperatives operated as nonprofit entities, are shifting to a profit-making, publicly traded model owned in small or large part by the major users of the exchange.
 The changes are taking place as trading stocks has become less profitable, while trading options, futures and derivatives is more attractive. Those exchanges that can offer the ability to trade various financial products -- and to clear the trades, another profitable piece of the business -- are better positioned to be profitable entities as they are transformed.
 The result of these changes is a group of new public exchanges whose market value and market structure are wholly different from a decade ago. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange went public in December 2002 at $35 a share. Its shares are currently trading around $274. Archipelago and the International Securities Exchange are both publicly traded electronic exchanges. Archipelago deals in stocks and options while the I.S.E. trades stock options.
 As a result of the pending merger of the New York Stock Exchange and Archipelago, the Big Board is to shift from a member-owned, nonprofit entity to a for-profit, publicly traded company owned by shareholders.
 In the Philadelphia deal, Morgan Stanley would buy 10 percent of the Philadelphia exchange with an option to buy an additional 10 percent if the market met certain performance goals. UBS, Credit Suisse First Boston and Citigroup would each buy 5 percent with the right to an additional 5 percent. The banks join Merrill Lynch and the Citadel Derivatives Group, a subsidiary of the Citadel Investment Group, which in June each secured the right to buy 20 percent of that exchange, people briefed on the deal said.
 Philadelphia shifted from a mutually owned nonprofit cooperative to a for-profit company in January 2004.
 Predominantly an options market, the exchange has gone from a human-based model (where individuals manage trading in a stock by standing in a crowd and negotiating a price) to an electronic model where competing market makers (individuals who buy and sell stock to create prices for potential buyers and sellers) operate electronically and remotely.
 While the bank's investment in the Philadelphia exchange is economically insignificant -- Merrill Lynch and Citadel paid $7.5 million for their initial stakes -- it represents an attempt to find a trading alternative.
 Philadelphia's platform can be appealing for Wall Street as it requires less investment than one that requires that people be present on the floor. The equity transactions also offer the banks ownership stakes in an exchange that could go public as well as the ability for those banks to trade against their own inventories of shares, which is generally more profitable for them.
 The Philadelphia exchange figured into the N.Y.S.E.-Archipelago deal. Documents released by the exchange related to the merger indicate that both the Big Board and Archipelago were interested in the possibility of buying it before they reached their own merger agreement.

HEADLINE: Surge in Corporate Taxes Is Expected to Reduce Deficit 

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said Monday that the federal budget deficit would decline 20 percent this year because of an unexpected surge in corporate income tax payments, but it discerned no improvement in the long-term fiscal outlook for the next decade.
 The office, a nonpartisan budget agency, predicted that the deficit would fall by $81 billion, to $331 billion, in the current fiscal year, from a record $412 billion last year.
In March, the agency projected a 14 percent increase in corporate income tax payments this year, but it now foresees an increase of 42 percent, or $80 billion, to $269 billion this year, from $189 billion in 2004.
 Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, director of the budget office, said, ''The budget outlook has improved noticeably for this year, fiscal year 2005, but is largely unchanged for the decade past that, and the economy remains in very good shape.'' 
 Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the projection for this year might ''seem better by comparison with the deficits of 2003 and 2004, which were the worst in history.'' But, Mr. Spratt said, ''at $331 billion, the deficit for 2005 still ranks as one of the top three.''
 Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said the report confirmed that the economic policies put in place by Congress and President Bush were lowering the deficit, benefiting businesses and creating jobs. But Mr. Gregg said unchecked growth in federal benefit programs was ''threatening our economic stability.'' He vowed to rein in the growth with legislation that Congress plans to take up this fall.
 The current fiscal year ends in seven weeks, so the latest estimates for 2005 are considered highly reliable. The budget office predicts that the deficit will be $314 billion in 2006 and will remain above $300 billion a year through 2010.
 To finance the deficit, the Treasury borrows money from the public. Debt held by the public will total $4.6 trillion this year, up from $4.3 trillion last year, and will climb to $6.3 trillion in 2010, the budget office said.
 The new report documents two trends: growth in federal spending for individual benefits, driven by the aging of the population, and an expectation that the government will rely more on individual income taxes and less on corporate taxes. 
 Under current law, the budget office said, spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will double in the coming decade and will account for more than half of all federal spending by 2015. The federal government is spending $1.04 trillion on the programs this year, or 42 percent of the budget. But, the agency said, the three programs will consume 53 percent of the entire budget in 2015 -- $2.08 trillion of $3.9 trillion.
 The agency said Monday that ''the economy will continue to expand at a healthy pace,'' growing 3.7 percent this year and 3.4 percent next year. But it said inflation would be higher than expected, partly because of higher oil prices.
 Tax cuts have been a central feature of President Bush's domestic policy. Many of the tax cuts enacted at his request are scheduled to expire by 2011. Assuming these changes occur on schedule, the budget office predicts that individual income taxes will account for 53 percent of all federal revenue by 2015, up from 43 percent today. But it expects that corporate income taxes will shrink to 8 percent of all federal revenue, from 13 percent this year.
 Congress has increased spending significantly since the budget office made its last official forecast, in March. The agency now foresees annual deficits totaling $2.1 trillion from 2006 to 2015. That is more than double the total of $980 billion forecast in March. Moreover, the budget office said, the cumulative total of federal budget deficits will be higher still -- $1.3 trillion higher in the coming decade -- if Congress makes the recent tax cuts permanent, as Mr. Bush has proposed.
 Mr. Bush and many Republicans say the tax cuts should be extended to keep the economy strong. But the budget office said that such an extension could increase the deficit by more than $250 billion a year from 2012 to 2015. 
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that corporate income tax payments were growing more than would have been indicated by the growth of corporate profits, and that he did not know why. The agency assumes that three-fourths of this year's increase in corporate tax payments is temporary.
 The budget office also said that total revenue was expected to increase 14 percent this year, to $2.1 trillion, while spending is expected to rise 8 percent, to nearly $2.5 trillion. The economy will grow more slowly than revenues, measured by the gross domestic product, it said, so revenues as a share of the G.D.P. will rise for the first time since 2000.
 Federal subsidies paid to farmers will nearly double, to almost $18 billion this year, from $9 billion in 2004, it said. Crop prices have dropped significantly this year, so farmers are entitled to more assistance. Spending on food stamps will reach nearly $33 billion this year, up from $29 billion.
 It also said that spending for student loans would rise 75 percent, to $14 billion this year, from $8 billion last year. But the figure will stay around $8 billion a year from 2006 through 2011.

 Israeli Police Warn Gaza Settlers on Deadline
Thousands of Israeli policemen and soldiers moved to surround the Israeli settlements of Gaza, warning residents that they had until early Wednesday to leave or be forcibly removed from their homes. The officers presented a show of force but avoided confrontation with the settlers and their supporters, many of them young and emotional. A1


The major Palestinian factions, including the militant group Hamas, have agreed to oversee jointly how the governing Palestinian Authority uses land left behind as Israeli settlers and soldiers leave the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials said. A7


Even with security forces surrounding their settlement and a final deadline looming to leave their homes for good, residents of Neve Dekalim celebrated a victory by its basketball team over a rival Gaza settlement in what would most likely be the league's final championship game. A7

Iraq Charter Deadline Extended
Still deadlocked after days of negotiations, Iraq's leaders decided to give themselves another week to agree on a new constitution and resolve a series of fundamental disagreements over the future and identity of Iraq. A1

Details on Cypriot Plane Crash
At least 6 of the 121 passengers were still alive at the end of the Helios Airways jet's long, slow and still-mysterious descent, Greek officials said. Firefighters also found a haunting clue of the plane's last minutes: the body of a flight attendant in the wrecked cockpit, suggesting that she tried to take control of the plane. A6

Egyptian Group Exerts Power
As Egypt prepares to kick off its first multicandidate campaign for president on Wednesday, and as it experiments with new boundaries for political speech, the Muslim Brotherhood has re-emerged as a crucial player. A3

Schroder Makes a Vow on War
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder used an old theme to give a new twist to the current German election campaign, saying he would refuse to allow German troops to be used in any military campaign against Iran. A3

 Files on Court Nominee Reflect Debates of 80's
Only an indistinct portrait of the young John G. Roberts Jr. emerged in thousands of pages released by the National Archives from the Supreme Court nominee's years in the Reagan White House. But the documents do provide a vivid reminder of the debates that consumed official Washington in those days. A1

Lower Deficit Predicted
The Congressional Budget Office said that the federal budget deficit would decline 20 percent this year because of an unexpected surge in corporate income tax payments, but it discerned no improvement whatsoever in the long-term fiscal outlook for the next decade. A10

Adoption Law Challenged
Advocates for parents' and children's rights went to federal court in Missouri seeking to block a new state law, part of a broader effort by Gov. Matt Blunt to balance the budget, that limits financial aid for some parents who adopt foster children, including those with severe disabilities. By creating uncertainty and denying aid to some, the critics say, the policies will discourage adoptions of some of society's forsaken children. A9

Mass Mailing of 'Jesus' DVD
 Since 1992, the Jesus Video Project, an evangelical ministry, has mailed over 20 million copies of a video of the movie ''Jesus,'' aimed at bringing religion into people's lives. The ministry calls the mailings ''saturation evangelism.'' A9

Muslim Cleric to Be Deported
 An Islamic cleric being held by immigration officials within the Department of Homeland Security agreed to be deported, after federal investigators accused him of planning to set up a religious school in Lodi, Calif., where recruits could be trained to kill Americans. A11

Posthumous Pardon Planned
The only woman ever executed in Georgia's electric chair, Lena Baker, an African-American, is being granted a posthumous pardon, 60 years after she was put to death for killing a white man she said had held her in slavery and threatened her life. A9

Though they work less than a hundred feet from each other in opposite wings of City Hall, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg rarely sees Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, in person. Nevertheless, ever since the mayor took office, Mr. Miller has been a constant presence in the mayor's life. A1

Plea in Turkey-Tossing Case
Every bone in Victoria Ruvolo's face was shattered last November when she was struck by a 20-pound turkey hurled through her windshield by a Long Island teenager. But when she arrived in court to hear the teenager plead guilty to second-degree assault charges, Ms. Ruvolo was not seeking retribution, but the youth's redemption. B1

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: BERLIN, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder used an old theme over the weekend to give a new twist to the current German election campaign, saying he would refuse under any circumstances to allow German troops to be used in any military campaign against Iran.
 But as several commentators and opposition figures argued Monday, if his abrupt introduction of Iran into the campaign is similar to the tactic he used three years ago in connection with Iraq, the current situation is strikingly different. No country, including the United States, is making serious military threats against Iran.
 Still, Mr. Schroder's strategy seemed clear. In elections three years ago, faced with an uphill struggle to retain the chancellorship, he categorically rejected the use of force against Iraq, which infuriated the United States but helped, probably decisively, in his come-from-behind victory. 
 Now, with new elections less than five weeks away and polls showing Mr. Schroder well behind his opponent, Angela Merkel, leader of the Christian Democratic Union, he seems again to be trying to exploit the German public's visceral opposition to the use of force in international affairs.
 ''Let's take the military options off the table,'' he said Saturday in an election rally in Hanover, an allusion to a comment President Bush made last week to the Israeli radio that ''all options are on the table'' in connection with Iran.
 In an interview published Sunday in the daily Bild Zeitung, the chancellor said, ''I consider the military option to be extremely dangerous, so I can with certainty exclude any participation by the German government under my direction.'' 
 The comments took diplomats here by surprise, and seemed almost certain to introduce new tensions into the trans-Atlantic relationship.
 ''The president has said for quite a while now that we support European diplomacy, and we've been giving full backing to that effort,'' said Robert Wood, a spokesman at the American Embassy in Berlin. ''In the interview with Israeli radio, he was merely reiterating the government's position. Our policy hasn't changed.''
 In Washington on Monday, the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said at his daily briefing, in response to a question about Mr. Schroder's comments: ''I think we're working very closely with the German government on the issue of Iran. We're working well on the diplomatic approach.''
 Mr. Schroder's move comes at a delicate juncture in the two-year-old effort by Britain, France, and Germany to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear program in exchange for a package of economic benefits.
 Last week, at the prompting of the three countries, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, criticized Iran for restarting aspects of its nuclear fuel program and asked it to restore an earlier suspension of its nuclear activities.
 European diplomats say the next step is a report next month by the agency's director, Mohamed ElBaradei, about Iran's compliance with the demand, failing which the most likely option seems to be to refer the matter to the Security Council for possible sanctions.
 But behind the scenes, European diplomats, citing possible Russian and Chinese opposition, are skeptical about winning a Security Council vote on sanctions. What some officials in Europe say might be more effective would be a pledge by both Europe and the United States to relinquish any military option in exchange for Iran's permanent cessation of all of its nuclear projects.
 For months, officials here have enthusiastically spoken of a ''good cop, bad cop'' combination in which Europe has offered a diplomatic out for Iran while from offstage the United States has threatened an ultimate recourse to force if all other means, including sanctions, fail.
 Mr. Schroder's weekend comments indicated a shift in the German position, because he seems ready to grant Iran guarantees against any use of force without Iranian concessions. 
 Most of the commentary in the German press was critical of Mr. Schroder's weekend comments.
 ''Schroder knows that a strike against Iran is not on the agenda and that the U.S.A. is politically and militarily incapable of carrying one out,'' the German business daily Handelsblatt said in an editorial on Monday. ''And yet he misuses Bush's remarks in order to score points in the election campaign. In doing so, he endangers the crucial solidarity of the West.''
 The daily Die Welt said, ''The chancellor should be ashamed.''
 Mr. Schroder seems to be trying to put Mrs. Merkel on the defensive, by pressing her to say clearly whether she would take part in military action against Iran.
 But opposition spokesmen have instead criticized Mr. Schroder for undermining trans-Atlantic unity over what is essentially a nonissue.
 ''The federal chancellor is giving Tehran the disastrous impression that the world community is no longer united,'' said Wolfgang Schauble, a prominent Christian Democratic Union member of Parliament. ''He is thereby accepting the growing danger of an Iranian nuclear bomb.''
 ''Although he knows better,'' Mr. Schauble added, ''he is acting as if the problem is not in Tehran, but in Washington.''

Effect of Rising Oil Prices Becomes Clearer as Inflation Shows Big Gain
Inflation surged last month, the government reported, as the long rise in energy prices finally seemed to be pinching the American economy. After absorbing the burden of oil at $40 a barrel, then at $50 and beyond, consumers have started to react as prices have risen above $60 in recent weeks. [Page A1.]

Citing high oil prices, Wal-Mart announced its smallest quarterly profit growth in four years and warned that its third-quarter earnings would fall short of analyst estimates, disappointing Wall Street. [C1.]

Stocks tumbled after Wal-Mart said higher gasoline prices curbed customer spending. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.53 poinits, or 1.18 percent, to 1,219.34, its biggest point drop in almost four months. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 120.93 points, or 1.14 percent, to 10,513.45 and the Nasdaq composite index slid 29.98, or 1.38 percent, to 2,137.06. [C9.]

Record oil prices are beginning to slow the economy but expansion continued in July because of the housing market and consumer demand, data from several new reports showed. [C1.]

Oil Concerns Present Challenge in Indonesia
Indonesia's oil troubles are coming home to roost, posing a growing challenge to the ability of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, left, to maintain economic stability. Indonesia is a member of OPEC, and oil and natural gas are among the country's largest sources of export revenue. But red tape, legal uncertainty and political turmoil have turned Indonesia into a net oil importer, and companies have shied away from investing in new oil wells or refineries. [C6.]

Morgan Stanley Names Gorman to Lead Unit
John J. Mack, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, has hired James P. Gorman to be president and chief operating officer of the individual investor group. Mr. Gorman is the former retail chief at Merrill Lynch. [C1.]

J.P. Morgan to Pay $350 Million in Enron Settlement
Taking another step to put the Enron debacle behind it, J.P. Morgan Chase agreed to pay $350 million in cash to settle claims over the role it played in the fraud that led to the collapse of Enron in 2001. [C3.]

Lions Gate Set to Announce Use of Blu-ray Format
Lions Gate Home Entertainment is expected to announce that it plans to produce next-generation digital video discs using Blu-ray technology developed by Sony and others. [C4.]

Advertisers Put Focus on Everyday Women
Madison Avenue is increasingly interested in using everyday women in advertising instead of just waifish supermodels. The change comes after the Dove line of personal care products sold by Unilever introduced a self-described ''campaign for real beauty.'' Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C1.]

Hewlett-Packard Quarterly Revenue Rises 10%
Hewlett-Packard continued its turnaround in the third quarter, announcing that its revenue rose 10 percent, beating analyst expectations. Profit in the quarter fell sharply, though, because of a one-time tax charge. [C3.]

Lawyers to Present Closing Arguments in Vioxx Case
After more than four weeks of testimony that ranged from tedious to riveting, the first Vioxx-related personal injury lawsuit is about to go to jurors. [C3.]

Standard & Poor's May Lower Delta Debt Rating
Standard & Poor's said it might lower Delta Air Lines' debt rating as shrinking cash holdings and rising fuel costs pushed the company closer to bankruptcy. ''The airline's already slim chances of avoiding bankruptcy are dwindling rapidly,'' Philip Baggaley, an S.&P. analyst, said in a statement. S.&P. has a CC rating on Delta, which is 10 levels below investment grade. The stock rose 19 cents, or 14 percent, to close at $1.58. [C8.]

Investor Interest in Programs for Troubled Teenagers
More parents of troubled teenagers are sending their children to special programs -- no matter the cost. At the same time, the number of programs available has soared, drawing the attention of investors. [C1.]

HEADLINE: Deliveryman Relives the Fear Of 81-Hour Ordeal in Elevator 

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Even in New York, the city of eight million unfinished stories, the one about the Chinese deliveryman stuck in a Bronx elevator for 81 hours has lingered in collective memory. But for Ming Kuang Chen, the deliveryman, the ordeal never really ended. 
 In the first sit-down interview since he was belatedly rescued in April and then promptly dropped from sight, Mr. Chen spoke yesterday about the lasting results of his confinement: his crippling fear of the dark, his terror of immigration authorities, and the stomach pains that have plagued him since he was trapped in a brightly lighted 4-by-6 1/2-foot box without food or water, thinking that he was going to die. 
''I'm afraid to go anywhere dark now,'' said Mr. Chen, 35, speaking through an interpreter in the office of City Councilman John C. Liu, who has become one of the few people he trusts. ''I have to get about in the daylight hours.'' As for elevators, he added, he has yet to enter one alone. 
 Now, after months of moving from place to place, mainly out of state, to avoid being picked up as an illegal immigrant, he said he had returned to New York for one day, for medical help.
 Psychiatrists call such symptoms classic hallmarks of post-traumatic stress disorder, and spoke of barriers to treatment like language, culture and money. But for Mr. Chen, who is deeply indebted for his passage to the United States and supports a wife and son in his home village in the Fujian province of China, his illness mainly represents a disastrous obstacle to delivery work in the nationwide network of Chinese restaurants where illegal immigrants like him are dispatched from New York to toil night and day, six days a week. 
 Last spring, aspects of his elevator ordeal came to seem strangely symbolic of the status of illegal immigrants in New York -- omnipresent in the everyday economy of shrimp-fried-rice deliveries, yet virtually invisible in their legal no-man's land. A security camera had been operating in the elevator car the whole time that he was stuck there, even as the police, fearing the worst, were conducting an aggressive door-to-door search of the Bronx apartment tower and sending scuba divers into a nearby reservoir to search for his body.
 To Dr. Lynne Tan, a Montefiore Medical Center psychiatrist who has helped arrange treatment for Mr. Chen at no fee, there is also wider symbolism in his traumatic experience of helplessness in the elevator, where his cries went unheard, misunderstood or unheeded for so long.
 In that sense, it is the immigrant experience at its worst. ''He can't speak English,'' she said. ''He was trying to speak through the intercom and couldn't communicate. This is to be completely helpless and not to be able to ask for help.''
 Notwithstanding the lights in the elevator -- an express that had become stuck between the third and fourth floors of a 38-story building, Tracey Towers, and was then taken out of service with Mr. Chen still inside -- his fear of the dark is a classic traumatic-stress reaction to the fear of dying that he endured, Dr. Tan said. She agreed with his own view that his symptoms also reflected fear that immigration officials could be lurking somewhere, preparing to grab him.
 Like most immigrants from the villages in the Fuzhou area, Mr. Chen speaks a dialect closer to Mandarin than to Cantonese, but distinct from both. At Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, where he was treated for dehydration after his release from the elevator, language quickly became an issue when doctors realized that he needed psychotherapy for the lasting effects of his experience, Dr. Tan said.
 ''We referred him to psychiatry, but nobody could treat him,'' Dr. Tan said. ''The residents don't speak Mandarin. I can't do therapy in Mandarin.'' Telephone interpretation services by AT&T, known as language lines, which are useful for other medical interactions, do not really work well for this kind of doctor-patient exchange, she added.
 Montefiore's policy is to treat residents of its neighborhood regardless of their immigrant status or whether they are insured, but that is not the case with many psychiatric practices. As an illegal immigrant, Mr. Chen could not apply for Medicaid. And at postgraduate centers where therapists in training are willing to see patients for $5 to $10 per session, Mandarin, let alone Fuzhou dialect, is nonexistent, Dr. Tan added. 
 Eventually, however, she was able to refer Mr. Chen to a Mandarin-proficient doctor at the Charles B. Wong Community Medical Center in Chinatown. 
 Mr. Chen, a slender man who wore a black T-shirt and dark trousers during the interview, said he was relieved when Montefiore officials who set up his treatment told him he would not have to worry about the bills. He has been taking the medication prescribed by his doctors, he said. But so far, he finds the results disappointing.
 ''It's helping a little bit, but not the way I was before,'' he said. ''I worry about my health, because the way I am now, I'm not able to work, and we owe so much money, and I have a family to support.'' 
 He did not want to reveal where he had lived, where he lived now or how he had tried to work. ''It's been very hard since my status has been discussed,'' he said. ''For the past four months, I haven't really been living anywhere stable,'' he added, describing shared quarters ''sometimes in New York, sometimes out of state.'' 
 One reason the police feared foul play the night Mr. Chen failed to return to the Happy Dragon restaurant in the Bronx, where he had worked for two years, was that in recent years several immigrant deliverymen had been killed for money or food. Others have been robbed. But even without such disasters, the typical life of Fujianese immigrants is one of extreme stress and isolation, according to Kenneth J. Guest, an anthropologist at Baruch College who has studied them.
 ''They may not ever learn the name of the city where they're sent -- just the area code,'' Mr. Guest said yesterday, pointing out the lists on a board at an employment agency at East Broadway and Division Street in Chinatown, one of many that dispatch such immigrants around the country. ''The jobs are so intense and demanding that people can only stand it so long. Then they bail out, and hop the next bus back to New York.'' 
 Still, Mr. Chen said, he does not want to go home to his wife. ''I would prefer for her to come and take care of me,'' he said with the first hint of a smile. According to Councilman Liu, Mr. Chen earned $300 in his Bronx delivery job for 12-hour days, six days a week. ''It is definitely hard work over here,'' Mr. Chen said. ''But the money you earn is worth it.'' In China, where his job was loading cargo on a ship, ''we just had barely enough to survive.''


CORRECTION-DATE: August 20, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about Ming Kuang Chen, a Chinese-food deliveryman who described the lingering effects of his ordeal in a Bronx elevator, where he was trapped for 81 hours in April, misstated the day of the interview and the name of a medical clinic in Chinatown where he was referred to a doctor proficient in Mandarin. He was interviewed on Monday, not Tuesday; and the clinic is the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center, not the Charles B. Wong Community Medical Center.

HEADLINE: Healthy Housing Market Lifted the Economy in July

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Record oil prices are beginning to slow the economy, according to several reports released yesterday, but expansion continued in July because of the housing market and demand from businesses and consumers.
 The reports said inflation grew faster than expected, industrial production slowed in July and home construction took a slight breather. But the consumer generally remained resilient.
''Outside of energy, the consumer is fine,'' said Anthony Chan, a senior economist at JPMorgan Asset Management. ''That's why growth this year will be weaker than last year, and it will be weaker next year than this year.'' 
 Even though economists do not expect higher energy costs to derail the current expansion, some, like Mr. Chan, argue that rising interest rates and oil prices will slow growth from the 4.2 percent pace it set in 2004, which was the fastest since 1999.
 The Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent in July after being unchanged in June and falling 0.1 percent in May, the Labor Department reported. Excluding food and energy prices, the core inflation rate was up 0.1 percent in July, the same percentage increase as in June. Economists were expecting an overall increase of 0.4 percent. 
 Compared with July 2004, consumer prices were up 3.2 percent and the core rate was up 2.1 percent. In the New York area, prices rose 0.9 percent from June and 3.4 percent from July 2004. 
 Other economic reports released yesterday showed that new-home construction dipped 0.1 percent in July and that industrial production grew 0.1 percent in the month.
 Economists said both numbers were poised to increase because construction permits were still rising and manufacturers had depleted inventories.
 Energy prices climbed 3.8 percent, with petroleum-based products up 6.1 percent. Food prices were up 0.2 percent in July from June. Excluding energy, consumer prices were up 0.2 percent in the month.
 Rising energy has the greatest impact on average American workers -- those in nonsupervisory or production occupations. For that group, which makes up 80 percent of America's private labor force, real average weekly wages, which take into account inflation, fell 0.2 percent in July, according to a Labor Department report released yesterday. Wages rose 0.4 percent before taking into account the effect of rising prices.
 Price decreases in many industries appear to be offsetting some of the increases in energy costs, however. New car prices, for instance, fell 1 percent in July, the second month in which domestic automakers offered low employee prices to all buyers. Apparel prices, which have decreased or stayed flat for six of the last seven months, fell 0.9 in July.
 Those price reductions, some of which are driven by competition and others by companies hoping to remedy slow sales, have helped increase retail sales and keep consumers shopping. Retail sales were up 1.8 percent in July and 1.7 percent in June.
 ''Obviously, at some point it becomes the case of the price effect outweighing the ability to spend more, but we haven't gotten to the point yet,'' said David J. Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
 The housing market is an example of a market not buckling under rising prices.
 Housing starts, which measure the beginning of new construction, fell 0.1 percent in July, to 2.04 million, but were still 2.8 percent higher than a year ago, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Permits for new residential construction, an indicator of future activity, were up 1.6 percent, to 2.17 million, compared with June and up 2.5 percent compared with a year ago.
 ''With these permit numbers and the record home sales in June, there is plenty of momentum,'' said Timothy E. Rogers, chief economist at Briefing.com. He said that although there was some talk that the housing sector was starting to slow ''I will believe that when I see it.''
 In some parts of the country, particularly in the West, an area with some of the nation's hottest housing markets, home sales do appear to be slowing and prices seem to be leveling off after big increases in the last few years, according to regional statistics and real estate agents.
 ''You do see some evidence of a little bit slowing in the West and some expanding activity in the South,'' Mr. Greenlaw said. 
 Economists expect home sales and construction activity to stay at current high levels until mortgage rates, which remain at historically low rates, rise by 0.5 percentage points or more. The average 30-year fixed-mortgage rate was 5.89 for the week ending Aug. 11, according to Freddie Mac. That was up slightly from 5.82 percent the week before and 5.85 percent a year earlier.
 The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, reported that industrial production rose 0.1 percent in July, less than the 0.5 percent economists were expecting. Most of the shortfall was caused by automakers reducing output by 2.3 percent in the month as they tried to clear lots filled with unsold trucks and sport utility vehicles. Excluding autos, production rose 0.4 percent.
 Hurricanes and tropical storms hurt oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, driving down mining output 1.3 percent in July. But production rose in computer and electronic equipment (up 2.3 percent) and at utilities (0.7 percent).
 Economists, who were expecting production to be up 0.5 percent over all, said they still expected industrial output to climb in the second half of the year because consumer demand remained strong and manufacturers and retailers were staring at largely empty warehouses.
 ''We have seen very clear evidence that capital investment is rebuilding very rapidly,'' Mr. Rogers said.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Mexico: Economy Grows 3.1% in Second Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Mexico's economy grew less than expected in the second quarter as farming slumped 3.3 percent from a year ago and demand fell in the United States for Mexican-made cars. 
Gross domestic product expanded 3.1 percent from a year ago after growing 2.4 percent in the first quarter, the government said. ''The most obvious thing that happened to Mexico in the first half of the year is that U.S. industrial production and the car sector in particular took a big hit,'' said Michael Hood, an economist with Barclays Capital in a telephone interview. The United States buys about 85 percent of Mexico's exports.

 BODY:
The New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O's 39 member unions have voted unanimously to support a $2.9 billion transportation bond act that will appear on the statewide ballot in November. 
''The infrastructure of the state is very important to future economic development of the state,'' said Denis M. Hughes, president of the state federation, which represents about 2 million workers. Labor support is considered crucial for the bond measure, which would provide $1.45 billion for state highway and bridge projects and $1.45 billion for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. A 2000 transportation bond measure that would have raised $3.8 billion did not have the labor federation's support and failed. Sewell Chan (NYT)

HEADLINE: A New Police Force Emerges From Mosul's Chaos 

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: MOSUL, Iraq, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
The Five West police station, erected over four days in July on a gravel-covered hill in the most violent part of this violent city, is little more than concertina wire, concrete barriers, gun towers and portable sheds. Police officers mill about, some in street clothes or gym shorts, sorting through Glock pistols and machine-gun belts. 
 It may not look like much, but garrisoning the police so deep inside the insurgency's home turf would have been inconceivable a few months ago, say American officers, who credit the police with gathering intelligence leading to the capture of insurgent suspects even as attacks against the police have soared.
With the Bush administration and military leaders eventually planning to withdraw troops, the training of Iraqi security forces is a critical element of American strategy. Most attention has focused on the military, but the police will be at least as important. And nowhere did the police fail quite so spectacularly as in Mosul in November, when a 5,000-man force deserted in the face of an insurgent uprising, sending Iraq's second-largest city into chaos. 
 Under heavy protection of United States troops, the Mosul police are rebuilding. Compared with some nastier hot spots -- like Anbar Province and Tal Afar -- they are further along. But the effort to resurrect the police has encountered huge sectarian, cultural and even tribal obstacles, and now exemplifies a central question for American planners: Have the police force's improvements been contingent on careful and continual hand-holding by large numbers of American soldiers, and will they evaporate when American forces begin pulling out? 
 Many soldiers say the police will crumble unless large numbers of American troops stay for years. ''Without that security blanket, the Iraqi police will be scared, and a scared Iraqi is a useless Iraqi,'' said First Sgt. Keith Utley of the First Battalion of the 24th Infantry Regiment, which patrols western Mosul. 
 The executive officer of one company in the battalion, First Lt. Dan Kearney, said Mosul could experience gang-style civil war no matter when troops leave. ''While we're here, it's like they have Big Brother looking over them,'' he said, referring to the police. ''I don't think the police are the kind of people who will stick it out.''
 Quite a few Iraqi officers also fear an early pullout. ''The situation would blow up again,'' said the Mosul police chief, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Mohammed Khalif al-Jibouri, who says American forces need to stay for at least five years. 
 One problem is that Iraqi Army units -- dominated by Kurds and Shiite Arabs -- believe that insurgents have widely infiltrated the police, who are largely Sunni Arabs mostly from one tribe, the Jibouri. Many insurgents are Jibouri, according to the police and American officers. 
 In theory, the Iraqi police and army leaders are supposed to work hand in hand to fight insurgents. But they speak of one another with contempt, and the army refuses to share sensitive information with the police, believing it will be leaked to terrorists. ''Their houses are next to the terrorists' houses, and they are afraid,'' said Col. Nur al-Deen, commander of an Iraqi Army battalion in western Mosul. 
 In addition, the police suffer from widespread corruption. A $5,000 to $10,000 bribe can spring a prisoner, says the American battalion's commander, Lt. Col. Erik Kurilla. Many police officers terrify residents, shooting weapons wildly to intimidate bystanders, and the police are known to ''arrest'' people to serve as laborers and to steal money during searches, American officers say. 
 And much of the intelligence the police gather comes from beating information out of detainees, Iraqi and American officers say -- tactics that some fear could hurt Mosul in the long run. 
 Colonel Kurilla says the police might be ready to replace American troops next year -- if their improvement continues and the flow of foreign fighters is stopped. The police now are shooting back at attackers instead of fleeing, he said. Undercover officers are on patrol and making arrests, he said, while some officers carry out operations on their own. 
 ''There are lots of issues,'' he said. ''But where they are now versus where they were in November is night and day.''

Starting Over
 Early in the occupation, Mosul enjoyed relative peace despite its volatile ethnic mix of two million -- mostly Sunni Arabs on the west side of the Tigris River, and Kurds on the east. At the outset, the American military based a division of more than 20,000 troops here, but cut the number last year by half. As the Marines invaded Falluja in November, Mosul was seized by an insurgent revolt. 
 Arriving in October, Colonel Kurilla's battalion endured some of the most violent urban fighting of the war. In 10 months, the 700-soldier unit has been awarded 153 Purple Hearts and seen a dozen men die, including one killed Aug. 4 by a sniper near Four West. 
 It is calmer now: Attacks against troops in western Mosul fell in July to the lowest level of the year. Intelligence gathered by Colonel Kurilla's battalion has helped capture dozens of operatives of terrorist cells. Commerce has returned, and vegetable and finished-goods markets bustle. 
 But attacks against the police have doubled in just two months, Colonel Kurilla said. And violence against American troops probably will never decline much further, he said. ''It's foolish to think there will be a nirvana where American soldiers can carry flowers down the street,'' he said. ''There will always be somebody willing pick up an AK-47 and shoot Americans.'' 
 The police started returning in March. Now, much of their routine is guided by American troops, who visit western Mosul's 10 stations up to half a dozen times a day and supply guns, barriers and other needs, while directing them on tactics and strategy. 
 Many crucial police decisions remain with Americans. Over a few days in late July and early August, American officers engineered the promotion of a new commander at Five West, moving aside an ineffective officer. They conducted a sting operation -- without the police -- that captured insurgents planning to ambush police officers. They captured a mortar team that attacked Four West -- again without police help. And they removed the police from a highway checkpoint into Mosul and replaced them with Kurdish Iraqi Army troops after it became obvious that the police were allowing suspicious loads into the city. 
 Asked for a best-case example of police effectiveness, Colonel Kurilla cites an operation one week ago: Police officers arrested two men handing out insurgent literature. One told police interrogators where to find other suspects, whom the police arrested in a raid planned in part and backed by American troops. (The police killed one man during the raid, saying he had a grenade. An American commander on the scene, First Lt. David Webb, said he was not certain the man was armed.) One suspect who was arrested identified another suspect, who was arrested by the police and later revealed a weapons stockpile.

A Support System
 Almost every day, Colonel Kurilla and a squad venture into the city to counsel the police. On Aug. 6 they and this reporter arrived at Five West, where Maj. Khaled Mahmoud Mutab eagerly explained how he beat a policeman who fired his belt-fed machine gun in the air. Colonel Kurilla praised him for training men not to fire wildly but suggested that physical abuse was not necessary. 
 Major Mutab waved a judge's order to arrest a fuel smuggler. But the suspect lived in a bad area. ''I need support and protection,'' he said. Colonel Kurilla said he would arrange something. 
 Minutes after the Americans departed, insurgents fired mortars at an Iraqi Army barracks. The Americans rushed to a mosque where the projectiles were launched, next to the busiest market in western Mosul. But no Iraqi police officers responded, and the mortar team vanished. 
 Next the troops went to Four West, a ramshackle building pockmarked by shrapnel and bullet fire, where they met one of the commanders, Col. Hassan Yaseen al-Jibouri. Colonel Kurilla asked about a suspect who was arrested and taken to another station. ''They're not going to get bribed and release him, are they?'' he said, jokingly. 
 ''Maybe,'' replied Colonel Jibouri, who did not seem to be joking. 
 Colonel Jibouri said he believed that 90 percent of the police were Jibouris -- most from outside Mosul -- because men from other tribes ''get threatened and quit.'' 
 ''Don't forget, many of the terrorists are Jibouri,'' he said. It is ''only the cowards'' within the police who aid insurgents, he said. 
 The Americans left and discovered the body of a man shot in the head and dumped on the asphalt of the Yarmouk traffic circle, one of the busiest intersections. No police officers had responded. 
 The troops demanded answers from men at a watermelon stand 80 yards away, but they said they knew nothing. ''These people live in fear,'' Colonel Kurilla said, clearly frustrated. ''They saw something.'' 
 But frustration is common. One night in late July, American soldiers arrived at Five West to join in a raid. They found the station commander dozing. As troops went over details of the operation, a policeman supposed to operate a heavy machine gun walked in, acting drunk. He brought his fingers to his mouth as if drinking from a bottle. The Americans suggested that he stay behind. 
 At the target house, none of the men found were the right suspects. The police were unsure what to do, but arrested the brother of one suspect. Grabbing the man, a few police officers started to kick him. But the Iraqis realized no one had brought handcuffs. Capt. Scott Cheney, a company commander, interceded to bring the operation to a close. The Iraqis decided to load a few detainees into a pickup truck found at the home and drove back to the station. 
 Captain Cheney said he believed that the police would be ready to take over next year but conceded his disappointment over that night. ''We're starting at ground zero with the police,'' he said.

Loyalties and Rifts
 Stacking the police with Jibouris was an early necessity for assuring confidence in the chain of command. Now, though, some American commanders view it is a liability to have the police dominated not only by one ethnicity, but by one tribe -- and one with many insurgents in its ranks. 
 The sectarian divide between the Sunni Arab police and the army suggests that the two may always have trouble working together against insurgents. Many American officers believe that the Kurds may someday try to seize Mosul and drive Arabs out. 
 In an interview, General Jibouri, the Mosul police chief, argued that the Iraqi Army should be dismantled because it is actually controlled by Iraqi Kurdistan and by Shiite-dominated Iran. ''Half of them are Kurds and half of them are Shiites, and their loyalty is to their political parties,'' he said. ''The real Iraqi Army, all of them are unemployed.'' 
 Grabbing hold of the Iraqi flag next to his desk, he declared he should be president. ''I will not allow Massoud to plant another flag,'' he said, a reference to the Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani. ''I will not let Iran lead the Iraqi Army.'' 
 A few miles west, Colonel Deen said the police -- those who are not insurgents -- are largely frightened men. ''We are from Kurdistan, and we can't let them know what we're doing,'' he said. He says he sees little police presence. ''They are sitting inside,'' he said. ''No one is out on patrol.'' A large American pullout could send the city into chaos, he added. ''Every neighborhood would be fighting with each other,'' he said. 
 Ultimately, Mosul needs a strong civilian administration to bring security forces together and guide the police to ''enforce the rule of law instead of the rule of the jungle,'' said Lt. Col. Todd McCaffrey, commander of the First Battalion of the Fifth Infantry, which patrols much of eastern Mosul. 
 The police are making progress, ''but I don't know if the police are about peace and security, or about their own survival and power,'' he said. There are few effective police officers on the east side of the city, he said. ''If we left right now, this place would go south.''

Fighting the Fighters
 Foreign fighters continue to flow from Syria, American officers say. One -- a would-be suicide bomber from Libya -- recently told interrogators he trained in Syria for a month, believing he would fight street warfare, Colonel Kurilla said. But he was locked in a room to watch jihadist videos and told he would be a suicide bomber, or be killed. 
 Nevertheless, nearly all terrorist suspects captured lately were Iraqi. And most insurgent financing appears to come from local kidnappings and Mafia-like protection schemes. Ransom demands average $20,000 to $50,000, and many Iraqis who work for American forces pay insurgents who would otherwise kill them, Colonel Kurilla said. 
 In other words, American taxpayers are indirectly helping pay for car bombs and mortar attacks. 
 Police interrogations have indisputably contributed to more effective intelligence, but that has put American troops in the position of using information beaten out of detainees by the policemen they mentor. 
 The police admit to rough tactics. ''Most of them give us the truth,'' said General Jibouri. ''But others are sneaky and tricky, and we need to use force.'' American officers, he said, ''want me to offer them juice and music.'' 
 Sitting nearby, Capt. Jeff VanAntwerp, one of Colonel Kurilla's company commanders, told the chief that Iraq would eventually be better off if the police changed tactics. ''We don't want it to be normal to abuse people,'' he said. ''Our concern is for the future of Iraq.'' 
 In one instance, a detainee said he was strung to the ceiling while an iron pole was knocked into his rectum. The captain said he did not believe that happened, but added: ''Are the police capable of that? Yes.'' 
 Many beatings appear meted out using hoses filled with sand or canes that strike the back and buttocks, said Capt. Brad Warr, a physician's assistant who examines detainees turned over to American forces. 
 American officers point out that more severe forms of abuse were standard during Saddam Hussein's government and say they cannot order the police to change how they conduct interrogations. 
 And without police beatings, the American military may miss crucial intelligence. On July 18 a person suspected of being an insurgent, who American troops believe was beaten by the police, led soldiers to a stockpile of more than 1,000 mortar rounds, 450 rocket-propelled grenades and 27 surface-to-air missiles. 
 Captain VanAntwerp told the chief that under the American military's rules, troops could not have beaten information out of the suspect, captured with two others. ''If we had had the three guys that your guys captured, we would not have that weapons cache right now,'' he said.
 He says the police force's most immediate problem is a tendency to fire weapons wildly for no reason. Iraqi mothers routinely complain that it is too dangerous to allow children outside when officers are near. ''Their treatment of people creates a perception of instability,'' he said. 
 For now, the police remain fragile. A single devastating attack could tip Mosul back toward pandemonium, Colonel Kurilla said. ''If Four West falls, we could be right back to where we were in November,'' he warned his officers in a recent meeting. 
 But he remains optimistic that the police and the army can eventually survive the insurgency. He added, ''The question then becomes: Can they survive each other?''

HEADLINE: ECONOMY SHOWS SIGNS OF STRAIN FROM OIL PRICES 

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and DAVID LEONHARDT; Jennifer Bayot and Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New York for this article and Jeremy Peters from Detroit.

 BODY:
Inflation surged last month, the government reported yesterday, as the long rise in energy prices finally seemed to be pinching the American economy. After absorbing the burden of oil at $40 a barrel, then at $50 and beyond, consumers have started to react as prices have risen above $60 in recent weeks.
 Wal-Mart blamed high oil prices yesterday as it reported that in the recent quarter its profits rose at their slowest rate in four years. The chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., told investors that expensive oil was worrying him because it seemed to be erasing recent income gains for many customers.
Airlines have already felt the sting of increasing jet fuel costs. Last week, Delta, United and Continental raised domestic fares in their latest attempt to stem losses; Delta is struggling to avoid bankruptcy. United Parcel Service recently reminded its drivers not to leave truck engines running while they deliver packages. 
 Nearly all of the jump in inflation last month came from energy. Overall prices rose 0.5 percent in July -- and 3.2 percent over the last year -- after having been flat in June.
 Across the country, families are trying to figure out where to cut corners so they can afford gas that now averages $2.55 a gallon nationwide after posting the biggest weekly jump in at least 15 years, according to the latest government statistics. 
 ''We spend much less,'' said Hollie Tubbs, a 32-year-old teacher's assistant in Brooklyn. Instead of going to the movies, watching plays or dining out, she now takes walks in the park with her husband and son and checks the newspaper to see when a nearby Barnes & Noble will be holding a free story hour. ''Everything is related to gas prices. The more you drive, the more you spend. In order to bring the budget down, we stopped driving.'' 
 If consumers are feeling hard-pressed by higher gasoline prices, matters could become worse this winter when heating oil bills arrive. Some commodity analysts say that is when the full impact of the higher energy costs will be felt.
 Forecasters still expect economic growth to remain healthy for the rest of the year, as companies invest in new factories and the housing boom continues. But the high cost of oil already appears to be curbing growth, translating into unusually modest gains in employment and pay. 
 If history is any guide, higher prices will hurt consumption, curb the nation's output and shift spending patterns. The risks of a domino effect on the economy are real, economists say.
 ''We can't lose sight of the fact that energy restricts growth,'' said Anthony Chan, a senior economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ''It is doing so.''
 So far, the economy has showed much more resilience in the face of higher energy costs than most analysts had anticipated. Although prices began rising in early 2002, consumers have kept shopping, companies have expanded and inflation has remained under control. At times, it seemed a new economic era had dawned.
 Without question, economists say, rising oil prices cause less economic pain than they once did. It takes half as much energy to produce $1 of gross domestic product today, adjusted for inflation, than it did 30 years ago. Even at today's prices, oil is cheaper than it was in the early 1980's, once adjusted for inflation. 
 The falling costs of other goods, thanks in large part to global competition, have also helped cushion the blow from higher energy costs. While energy prices rose 3.8 percent from June to July, the price of all other goods inched up only 0.2 percent, the Labor Department said yesterday.
 ''There seems to be a greater tolerance in the economy in terms of what can be withstood,'' said Doug Leggate, an energy analyst with Citigroup in New York. 
 But a spike in oil prices still hurts, economists say, even if the pain does not come immediately. In the past, the full effect was not felt until a year, or even two years, after prices began rising. Both of the last two recessions -- in 1990-91 and in 2001 -- began more than a year after energy prices started a sharp climb.
 ''It is way too soon to be sanguine,'' said Andrew J. Oswald, an economist at the University of Warwick in England, who has written about oil. ''The influence of a petroleum shock runs deep and runs slow. My own view is that we will find oil shocks still hurt, and hurt fundamentally.''
 It was only 13 months ago that the price of a barrel of crude settled above $40. Oil, which closed yesterday at $66.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, is not likely to become much cheaper anytime soon, analysts say. Nor are natural gas prices, which have gained 73 percent this year. This means that winter heating bills for American households are set to soar. 
 ''Higher gasoline prices and heating oil bills are like consumption taxes,'' said Bob Gillon, a senior analyst with John S. Herold Inc. ''They will be a hardship on many. People will cut back on some purchases.''
 The blow has been softened in recent years by falling long-term interest rates, which have allowed homeowners to refinance their mortgages and cut their monthly payments, and by rising house values. 
 ''You don't have to take a couple hundred bucks and stick it in the bank each month, because your home price is going up,'' said Lakshman R. Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York. ''You might even withdraw some money.'' 
 Despite some scattered signs of a slowdown, like Wal-Mart's announcement yesterday, consumer spending has continued to increase. Home Depot and J.C. Penney both reported yesterday that their profits rose in the most recent quarter.
 But the portion of income that Americans save each month, on average, has now fallen to zero, according to the government. That leaves families with scant cushion; if the savings rate were higher, people could cover rising energy costs by cutting back on the amount of money they set aside.
 Most workers have received only a tiny raise in their hourly pay since 2001, according to inflation-adjusted figures from the Labor Department. 
 ''Consumers have held up the economy,'' Mr. Oswald, the economist, said. ''But, of course, that kind of behavior cannot be sustained in the long run. Eventually, reality dawns, and high energy prices come back to bite you.''
 The biggest reason to think that the economy could avoid another downturn is that today's high prices are to a large extent a byproduct of robust economic growth. During previous oil shocks -- in 1973 and from 1979 to 1981 -- prices rose because supplies were cut off. 
 Today's surge in oil prices is a result of demand from consumers in the United States and China, leading to a sustained rally that began at the end of 2003. 
 So, high prices may be able to do only so much damage to economic growth, some economists say. If the economy starts to stall, energy prices will probably come down, too.
 Among the worst-hit by the high oil prices are airlines, whose woes over the last few years have been accelerated by fuel costs. 
 With fuel bills expected to reach $83 billion this year, a 36 percent jump from last year, airlines are finding it increasingly difficult to hedge against higher prices. This year, their losses are expected to reach $6 billion, up from $4.2 billion last year, according to the International Air Transportation Association. 
 At U.P.S., which operates the world's ninth-largest airline, as well as a fleet of 88,000 trucks, the energy bill soared 45 percent in the second quarter this year, after a 30 percent jump in the first quarter and a 35 percent increase in 2004 compared with 2003.
 ''Oil prices have risen more suddenly than we had anticipated,'' said Susan Rosenberg, a U.P.S. spokeswoman.
 Besides asking drivers not to leave their truck engines running when delivering packages, the company is counting on new technology to help drivers determine the best delivery routes, saving an expected 14 million gallons of fuel. It has also passed on some of the added energy costs as a fuel surcharge.
 The effect of higher prices has had an uneven impact on companies. ''It's a mixed bag,'' said Neil Elliott, a director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization. The industries most affected ''tend to be a slow or declining part of the American manufacturing base.''
 Some companies have simply shut down factories or moved them to countries where energy and other costs are less expensive. 
 Dow Chemical, for example, has closed dozens of plants in the United States, including two major ones in 2002 and 2003, as natural gas prices started to soar. Last year, the run-up in energy prices cost the company an extra $3.4 billion. 
 ''We can pass on some of the costs, and we have, and we try as hard as we can,'' said Gordon Slack, the director of the company's energy policy. At the same time, it has planned expansions in Kuwait and investments in Oman, where natural gas is cheaper.
 Instead of passing on the costs, carmakers have sharply cut prices to attract buyers. For much of the year, sales of gas-thirsty sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks have declined. Then in July, the first month all three American automakers extended their employee discounts to all buyers, sales shot up.
 Some industry experts said the discounts allowed consumers to shrug off the high gas prices.
 ''That $30,000 S.U.V. became $27,000 or $26,000," said Walter McManus, a scientist at the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan. 
 Consumers, he said, are willing to overlook the extra money they will have to spend on fuel because they believe that it is offset by the deep discount. 
 In the end, much will depend on consumers.
 ''It wasn't nearly as bad'' last year, said Tina M. Leshowitz, a 42-year-old bookkeeper from Lodi, N.J. She said that she expected energy prices to keep rising through the winter and that she would probably have to cancel her planned Christmas trip because of rising ticket prices. 
 ''It's out of control now. I've got to cut back on everything.''
 Until now, consumers have not made good on such threats. But some economists say that more families may be starting to do so.

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Are Finding Out That Much of Life Costs More

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
High energy costs are pinching New Yorkers at the pump, in the real estate office and at the corner restaurant, as business owners and landlords pass on fuel costs to consumers around the region. 
 Retail prices in the New York area rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in July, according to the federal government, and 3.4 percent between July 2004 and last month. The slight rise in inflation was largely due to higher prices for gasoline and shelter, particularly government-subsidized apartments. While New York lagged behind the rest of the nation as gas prices soared over the last year, the increases here have begun to surpass the rest of the country's. 
 In the New York region, residential rents rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in July, the largest increase in more than five years. In New York City, rents rose 1.1 percent last month compared with the month before; those prices have risen 6.4 percent since July 2004.
 The increases in rents stem primarily from the elimination of federal government subsidies on many apartment units, as well as increases in rents for the city's rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments.
 ''A factor that we have picked up and has influenced the July figures relates to Section 8 housing,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which oversees the price index, a measure of consumer spending for a variety of goods and services. ''Apparently a number of these former federally subsidized units have now been restored to market rates,'' he said, ''and this is affecting the rental numbers.''
 In contrast, rents in the open market remain 20 percent to 25 percent lower than the peak in 2001, real estate agents say. ''Rents have bottomed out this year and are flat or have risen a little,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., a real estate appraisal and consulting company in New York. 
 ''As mortgage rates rise, rental rates are expected to increase as buyers priced out move back to rentals, increasing demand.'' 
 Landlords in market-rate apartments are also passing on increased fuel and energy costs, as have restaurants and grocery stores and other merchants whose costs of doing business have risen along with gas prices. ''Gasoline is one of those items.'' Mr. Dolfman said, ''that either directly or indirectly effects every other item in the C.P.I.'' 
 Gasoline prices rose 8.2 percent between June and July in the region, compared with 6.1 percent nationally. In May, the average price of a gallon of gas in New York was 1 percent higher than the average price nationally; by July, the differential had grown to 4 percent.
 Food and beverage prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent between June and July, led by restaurants. The cost of food bought in restaurants has risen almost 3 percent over the last year, according to the index. ''Restaurants tended to pass on these increased energy and operating costs to consumers,'' Mr. Dolfman said, adding that New Yorkers tended to compare prices for items bought in grocery stores, in an effort to keep down the cost of cooking at home.

HEADLINE: Better Ways to Control Immigration

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Issuing more visas so more unskilled workers can enter the United States would merely put the facade of legality on an activity that shouldn't be happening in the first place. 
 You can't hide a white flag with a flurry of green cards.
Allowing a flood of foreign unskilled workers into the country would also undermine what should be efforts to match our own unskilled, jobless citizens to those jobs through our state employment departments. 
 That renewed focus might also lift wages and interest in those essential but underpaid positions so that more of our own citizens would view them as an honorable step up into the middle class instead of as an exercise in exploitation.
 Want to really stop illegal immigration? A good start would be to link trade with, and foreign aid from, the United States to the effectiveness of our trading partners' efforts at stopping the outflow of unskilled workers from their side of the border.

HEADLINE: But Who Pays for That Home in the Exurbs?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 I was born in Tampa. I recall when there was almost nothing there but orange groves and pastures. Now when I am near there, I am overwhelmed by the growth, especially in communities like New River.
 The sense of ''community'' that residents of these exurbs perceive is largely an illusion. Close neighborly relations seldom develop. Rather, it is the relative sameness of income and lifestyle that bonds these residents.
When your neighbors drive the same minivan or S.U.V. as you do, and have houses that look exactly like yours, they seem more like you. Meanwhile, you are insulated from life beyond the subdivision gates.
 My wife and I recently made the transition back into the heart of town after living in a gated community on the outskirts. We couldn't be happier. 
 We have an hour extra to spend together every day -- our commute went from 45 minutes to 4 -- which we can spend relaxing in the shade of one of the 100-year-old trees that line our street or participating in the many cultural activities downtown. 
 Although we may have political beliefs and economic circumstances different from our neighbors, I'll consider my life a bit richer for the experience. That's a genuine sense of community.

HEADLINE: Oil Worries Challenge Indonesia's Economic Stability 

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

 BODY:
Indonesia's oil troubles are coming home to roost, posing a growing challenge to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's ability to maintain economic stability.
 Indonesia is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and oil and natural gas are among the country's largest sources of export revenue. But red tape, legal uncertainty and past political turmoil have turned Indonesia into a net oil importer, and companies have shied away from investing in new oil wells or refineries. At $65 a barrel, oil has become as big a threat to Indonesia's economic health as it is to that of the United States or Europe. 
Analysts are increasingly divided as to whether Mr. Yudhoyono will be able to keep Indonesia on course or whether oil prices will join the list of calamities buffeting the country, including terrorist attacks, the December tsunami, bird flu, the reappearance of polio and spreading forest fires that have sent a pall of acrid haze across Southeast Asia in the last two weeks.
 The president did little to settle that debate yesterday, when he told Parliament that oil prices remained a threat and that while he expected the economy to grow 6.2 percent next year, it would do little to reduce unemployment and poverty.
 Like its neighbors Malaysia and Thailand, Indonesia subsidizes the price of fuel to keep it affordable for citizens. All three countries are now moving to pass along the higher oil prices to consumers.
 ''The fuel price hike policy will indeed increase the burden of the people, and may even cause an increase of poverty,'' Mr. Yudhoyono said. But, saying he pursued the policy with ''a heavy heart,'' he predicted that if oil prices remain where they are, Indonesia would have to spend more than 140 trillion rupiahs on subsidies this year. Indonesia spent 73 trillion rupiahs ($7.4 billion) on fuel subsidies last year.
 ''The burden for fuel subsidy that we must bear will swell along with the price hike of international crude oil,'' he said.
 Oddly, it is just that kind of candor that is generating optimism among foreign investors and analysts about Indonesia despite its many problems. Indeed, approved foreign direct investment rose 79 percent in the first seven months of this year, to $6.64 billion, according to Dow Jones. 
 ''This government has identified publicly many of the same problems that businesses have identified,'' said James W. Castle, president of the business consultancy Castle Asia in Jakarta. ''In the past, there was always this feeling of denial. Now at least we're talking the same language.'' 
 Analysts also say that one of Mr. Yudhoyono's biggest obstacles remains getting the country's lumbering bureaucracy to enact his policies. Yesterday, he reiterated his pledge to eradicate corruption and shake up the government machinery. In addition to filing 233 lawsuits charging corruption, he said he would seek changes in government salaries, professionalism, productivity and ''the increase of discipline and work ethos.''
 Pessimists say the bureaucracy is holding up many of the foreign investment pledges being made. ''All the hoopla over F.D.I. coming to Indonesia hasn't come through,'' said Harry Su, head of research at BNP Paribas in Jakarta, referring to foreign direct investment. New toll roads and other infrastructure projects, for example, are being held up as bureaucrats and investors wrangle over terms, analysts say. 
 Emblematic of the hurdles in Indonesia's crucial oil and gas sector, analysts say, is the dispute delaying development of oil fields near the central Javan town of Cepu. With more than 600 million barrels of oil, Cepu could firmly re-establish Indonesia as an oil exporter. But Exxon Mobil and Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina have been locked in negotiations since 2001 over how to split revenues from the field. 
 Mr. Yudhoyono indicated in his address yesterday that a deal had been concluded, but details have yet to emerge despite reports of a preliminary agreement in late June.
 This week, Indonesia reported that its economy slowed to 5.5 percent in the second quarter compared with the period a year ago, from 6.2 percent in the first quarter. The second-quarter figure was below the government target of 6 percent for the year, the pace economists and policy makers agree is the minimum necessary to absorb new entrants into the job market and reduce poverty in the restive archipelago, the world's most populous Muslim nation. Faltering investment in oil and gas showed up as a 2.9 percent drop in overall mining output. But optimists were encouraged by the data, noting that other sectors were performing well. 
 ''It's not really a broad-based slowdown,'' said Chua Hak Bin, senior regional economist at DBS Bank in Singapore. ''I find it difficult to be too alarmist.''
 But pessimists caution that rising fuel prices are pushing up prices for other goods and services, auguring ill for consumer spending. Inflation in July rose to 7.8 percent.
 Still, the optimists say that Mr. Yudhoyono deserves more credit -- and time. ''You've got to give the government more benefit of the doubt and, unfortunately, be more patient,'' Mr. Castle said. ''Indonesia's problems are so deep and profound.''

HEADLINE: Profit Slows For Wal-Mart As Oil Prices Crimp Sales

BYLINE: By ROBEN FARZAD

 BODY:
Citing high oil prices, Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, announced its smallest quarterly profit growth in four years yesterday and warned that its third-quarter earnings would fall short of analyst estimates, disappointing Wall Street. 
 The company said that second-quarter earnings rose 5.8 percent, to $2.8 billion, or 67 cents a share, compared with $2.7 billion, or 62 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Sales for the period, which ended July 31, rose 10.2 percent, to $76.8 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting a quarterly profit of 65 cents a share and revenue of $77.46 billion. 
 The bad news out of Bentonville, Ark., dragged down other retailers, and contributed to an overall drop in the market yesterday. The Standard & Poor's retailing index fell almost 3 percent. Wal-Mart shares dropped $1.53, or 3.12 percent, to $47.57, not far from their 52-week low of $46.20. Other retailers followed suit. J.C. Penney lost 4.16 percent and Sears Holdings fell 5.34 percent.
 ''Wal-Mart Stores did miss their plan as our customer continues to be impacted by higher gas prices and it is difficult to improve our expense leverage in the current environment,'' the chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., said in a statement. 
 ''I worry about the effect of higher oil prices,'' Mr. Scott said in a recorded message for investors, adding that the impact could potentially ''erase improvements in employment and real income for an important part of our customer base.''
 The company also cited high gasoline prices when it posted disappointing first-quarter earnings in May. 
 With 3,762 stores in the United States and traffic of more than 100 million customers a week, Wal-Mart's heft and ubiquity make it a macroeconomic barometer among retailers. The company aggressively squeezes suppliers and wields its overseas buying power to pass on its trademark ''every day low prices'' to consumers.
 ''This news shouldn't come as a surprise,'' said Ulysses Yannas, a broker who follows retail stocks for Buckman Buckman & Reid. ''They deal with the lowest-income customers, on average.'' 
 Mr. Yannas estimated that Wal-Mart would have had to expand its sales by 12 percent to offset fully the impact of higher energy costs, which in addition to affecting customer spending have added to the company's store overhead and transportation costs.
 Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, Thomas M. Schoewe, said utility expenses rose $100 million and fuel costs were up $30 million in the quarter.
 Still, the case can be made that Wal-Mart's dogged low-price model helps it run counter to economic cycles -- making it a more compelling spending destination for consumers with tight budgets.
 ''You'd have to be blind, deaf and dumb to not have known that oil prices went up,'' said Bernard Sosnick, a retail analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''But if that indeed has a severe impact on economic growth, you'd still have to say that Wal-Mart is a defensive play. It sells the cheap food and consumables that consumers have to replenish.'' 
 Still, analysts said, the retailing giant is not immune to the prospect of consumer spending starting to contract over all. 
 ''Lower-income consumers are getting pressed more and more by high gas prices,'' said Joel L. Naroff, the chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa. ''It's hard to give up driving,'' Mr. Naroff said, ''but people cut back here and there, and that will only worsen with higher oil prices.'' 
 ''If you have to spend seven or eight dollars to drive to Wal-Mart, it had better be a big purchase,'' he said, ''otherwise the savings won't be that great.''
 Mr. Naroff also cited the concurrent impacts of high summer cooling bills and the Federal Reserve's continued tightening of interest rates, which he said disproportionately hurt consumers who borrow using their credit cards.
 With its customers having grown accustomed to such consistently low prices, Wal-Mart could have a particularly hard time passing on the higher energy costs -- both its own and those of its suppliers. 
 ''Wal-Mart made a living jamming costs down on everyone else,'' Mr. Naroff said. ''Now, how much can they absorb on their own?''
 Looking to the third quarter, Wal-Mart predicted earnings in the range of 55 cents to 59 cents a share, which is a penny lower than the Wall Street consensus; for the fiscal year, the company forecast earnings of $2.63 to $2.70 a share, compared with its previous range of $2.70 to $2.74.
 ''Right now, I believe that the middle of the range is reasonable,'' Mr. Schoewe said in the recorded message.
 Wal-Mart also announced yesterday that starting in February it will switch from its schedule of weekly sales updates to a quarterly report providing guidance on earnings and sales. 
 ''The weekly updates were a little tedious and not terribly relevant,'' said Todd Slater, an analyst at Lazard. ''They generally don't measure trends very well.''

HEADLINE: Bleecker Street Trades Funk for High Fashion 

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Laurice Rahme, who owns the Bond No. 9 perfume stores, has had a shop on Madison Avenue for four years. Now, she is opening one on Bleecker Street, which runs through Greenwich Village and has in the last few years become home to high-end fashion boutiques. 
 ''Fragrance follows fashion,'' Ms. Rahme said. ''Bleecker Street is the new mini-Madison Avenue, focusing on a younger crowd.'' 
 With three Marc Jacobs stores and two Ralph Lauren stores -- and another one coming -- Bleecker has become a shopping destination for the children of the customers of her Madison Avenue stores, said Ms. Rahme, who opened her first store in 1999 at 9 Bond Street in NoHo and has two others on Madison Avenue.
 Her store is not the only new one. James Perse, a West Coast designer, recently opened a store on the street, and brokers say other stores are being built for Stetson (hats), Selima Optique (eyeglasses) and a unit of Abercrombie & Fitch called Ruehl, selling fashion accessories.
 In the last few years, the influx of fashion stores has changed the face of the street, as antique stores have given way to national retailers that can afford to pay higher annual rents. 
 ''Retail space on Bleecker Street has increased from $75 a square foot just three years ago to $300 a square foot today,'' said Faith H. Consolo, chairwoman of Prudential Douglas Elliman's retail leasing and sales division. ''That is higher than SoHo, which is back up to $200 a square foot.'' 
 Most of the retailing spaces on Bleecker between Bank Street and West 10th Street are in the lower floors of federal-style residential buildings and are relatively small. Bond No. 9 will occupy just 300 square feet. Most are in the 400- to 500-square-foot range, brokers say, calling them ''little jewels.''
 These modest spaces give a retailer the opportunity to test new products and marketing concepts without changing an overall image, said Laura H. Pomerantz, a principal in PBS Realty Advisors, a brokerage company.
 ''As SoHo has become more national, some of the bigger retailers who wanted to test new concepts have opened on Bleecker Street,'' Ms. Pomerantz said. ''Marc Jacobs has done on Bleecker Street what it did on Melrose Place in Los Angeles. And when you get both Ralph Lauren and Marc Jacobs in the same area, it becomes a destination.''
 In addition, she said, the popularity of the area as a place to live means that retailers will be interested in locating nearby. ''As the residential part got stronger, it meant that services and retail have to follow,'' she said. ''With younger people in the area, retailers have to have things that appeal to them.''
 In some cases, the products are highly distinctive. ''You can find things on Bleecker Street that are nowhere else,'' Ms. Consolo said. ''Look at Lulu Guinness, which sells very expensive ladies' handbags. They are out of London, and the Bleecker Street store is the only one in New York.'' 
 She said fashion stores have changed the economic playing field on the street by sharply pushing up rents. ''Old Bleecker Street was rents at $5,000 a month,'' Ms. Consolo said. ''New Bleecker Street is rents of $25,000 a month.'' As happened in SoHo a decade earlier, the ability of fashion stores to pay higher rents is changing the neighborhood.
 In spite of the West Village's popularity as a residence, the demand for retailing space along the street is leading some property owners to consider converting ground-floor apartments to stores. ''They can do that because 50 years ago they converted retail space to residential,'' said Joseph Aquino, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Because they can show that it was once retail, they can convert it back.''
 This demand for new store spaces on the street is seen as part of the growing prosperity of a wider area. ''The changes on Bleecker Street are in response to changes in the West Village, which has become a very expensive and very hip place to live,'' said Benjamin Fox, an executive vice president of Newmark Retail. ''Ralph Lauren and the others are trying to capture that audience.''
 Mr. Fox said that when Lauren opened multiple locations on the street, it attracted the attention of other retailers who wanted to be in a developing shopping area. ''If Ralph Lauren opened in northern Manhattan, other people would start looking there, too,'' he said. ''It takes a powerhouse name like that to make something like Bleecker Street happen.''
 Robert K. Futterman, who operates a retailing brokerage firm bearing his name, said: ''Bleecker Street connects the West Village with the meatpacking district, and it has a quaint, homey feel. You have shoppers seven days a week, both men and women, so it is a great place for merchants to display their goods.''
 Many of those shoppers, Mr. Futterman said, are nearby residents who are drawn to the shops and to the more cutting-edge apparel stores that have opened in spaces vacated by meatpackers to the west. ''It's not like SoHo, which is driven by tourists,'' he said.
 Ms. Rahme of Bond No. 9 may attract a few tourists, though, since she is moving in next to the Magnolia Bakery, whose signature cupcakes have been featured on ''Sex and the City.'' 
 ''It is all about the pleasurable experience,'' she said. ''Eat the pastry, maybe buy some perfume as a fashion accessory as you stroll the little streets of the Village that are like the Left Bank of Paris.''

HEADLINE: Label Conscious

BYLINE: By LARRY MAGID

 BODY:
People like to label things. They put labels on cellphones, digital cameras, CD's and circuit breakers, not to mention file folders, envelopes and name tags. There was a time when people used typewriters to create paper labels and Dymo label makers to emboss plastic labels. But labeling, like most things these days, has mostly gone digital. 
 Avery, Staples, OfficeMax and other companies make sheets of blank labels for both laser and inkjet printers. Blank computer labels, which typically come in 8 1/2-by-11 sheets, are useful if you want to print several at a time, but they are inconvenient if you just want one or two labels. They can also be wasteful since there are typically 20 or more labels per sheet.
A better choice, if you just want a label or two at a time, is a dedicated label printer. Some battery-operated label makers like the Dymo ExecuLabel LM150 ($40), Brother PT-1280 ($40) and Casio KL-60SR ($20) have their own keyboards and do not require a computer. 
 Even more versatility, though, comes from label printers that connect to the U.S.B. port of a PC or Mac. The Dymo ExecuLabel LM450 ($140), Brother PT-1950 ($70) and Casio CW-L300 Label-Biz Disc Title Printer ($130) can be used both ways -- there is a keyboard as well as a U.S.B. port for plugging into a PC.
 But typically label printers depend fully on your computer. Computer-connected label printers come with software that lets you design and print labels with text and graphics, handling orientation and formatting issues for supported labels. Also, the software generally allows you to use the printers with popular applications for mass mailings. 
 Most such printers from Brother, Dymo and Seiko Instruments work with both Windows and Macintosh computers. All PC and Mac models let you print address labels with postal bar codes. Models in the Dymo LabelWriter 400 series ($90 to $130) can also print postage if you have an account with a service like Stamps.com or Endicia Internet Postage. 

Printing Processes
 Dedicated label printers use a thermal process. There are no ink cartridges to buy or manage. Still, as with all printers, your cost of ownership isn't limited to your initial investment. While you'll never have to buy ink, you will have to buy label stock once you run out of the supply that comes with the printer. 
 So before using a dedicated label printer to create multiple labels, consider the cost of label stock. Label printers use special stock that comes in rolls. The cost varies from about 3 to 6 cents a label -- compared with about a penny a label if you buy sheets to run through a standard laser or ink jet printer. (Regular printers are also faster for large jobs.) 
 Some dedicated label printers use a relatively lightweight paper stock while others use laminated stock. With most paper labels, there is no ink. Though thicker, the paper is similar to old-fashioned fax paper in that it darkens when heat is applied. With laminated labels, ink is supplied through a separate ribbon physically attached to the label stock. In both cases, the printer selectively applies heat to print text and images. In most cases, your color choices are limited to black on a white, clear or colored background. 
 Paper labels are subject to fading and blurring over time, especially if exposed to sunlight. Laminated labels that use a ribbon are less prone to fading. Paper labels are fine for labeling envelopes, file folders, CD's or other items that will not be handled too much or exposed to sunlight. 

Label Formats
 In addition to the distinctions in paper finish, there are also two formats -- die-cut labels and continuous-feed labels -- and most printers are made to handle only one. 
 With die-cut labels, each label on the roll is the same size and shape. You might buy a roll of 130 address labels that are about 1 inch wide by 3 1/2 inches long, or perhaps shipping labels that measure about 2 1/2 inches by 4 inches. Other options include round labels designed for CD's or DVD's and labels designed specifically for file folders, diskettes or VHS tapes.
 Continuous-feed stock is a set width but labels can be any length. Most laminated stock comes this way. Some PC printers and virtually all of the hand-held stand-alone printers work with continuous-feed laminated stock that ranges from one-quarter inch to one inch in width. 
 Most of the computer-based printers designed for paper labels, however, work only with die-cut label stock. Once you load a specific label stock in the machine, you can print only that type until you change the stock. Removing one set of labels and replacing it with another is not difficult, but can take a bit of time. 

Versatile Models
 Dymo makes two machines that take two types of stock at a time. The LabelWriter Twin Turbo ($160) has two spools for die-cut paper labels, and its software has a setting that allows you to switch between them. With this printer, you could immediately switch from address labels to CD labels, for example, without having to replace label stock. 
 Dymo also makes the LabelWriter Duo ($200), which lets you switch back and forth between die-cut paper labels and continuous-feed laminated labels. I tested it with both types of stock and it worked fine. Laminated stock is cut automatically as it is ejected from the printer.
 The Brother QL-500 is the most versatile label printer on the market. At under $90 with reasonably priced label stock, it is also economical. In addition to accepting several sizes and styles of die-cut labels, it also accepts continuous-feed paper (including more expensive coated ''film'' paper, though not laminated stock) up to 2.4 inches wide. The software automatically senses the label type and adjusts accordingly. 
 Most of the time I just use Brother's narrowest (11/7 inch) continuous-feed paper, which works for address labels, file folders and most other uses. A 100-foot roll of that paper costs about $12, or about a penny an inch. A manual built-in paper cutter cuts labels to the proper length when printed. The more expensive QL-550 ($110) has an electric paper cutter but is otherwise identical to the QL-500. 
 If 11/7 inch is too wide for your application, you may have to trim it with scissors. The 2.4-inch stock can be used to print small signs, banners and even bumper stickers. 
 Brother is quick to point out that the stock will fade in the sun over time, but I printed out a bumper sticker on yellow coated stock that remained legible on the back of my car for about three months. By that time, I was ready for a new message anyway. Another advantage to the Brother QL-500 is that the stock comes in cartridges that are easy to change. It takes only a few seconds, for example, to switch from CD labels to address labels or continuous-feed labels.
 Seiko Instruments recently refreshed its Smart Label Printer line with devices that are not only compatible with Macintosh as well as Windows, but also have a more Mac-like look. The SLP 410 ($100) prints only 11/8-inch labels. The SLP 420 ($130) and the high-speed but more expensive SLP 430 ($190) also print 21/8-inch labels. I connected the 430 to a Macintosh and was impressed by the software, which made it easy to integrate text and graphics.
 Even though electronic label makers are becoming less expensive and more versatile, there remains, for those blessed with legible handwriting, an even cheaper way of labeling things. Pens and permanent markers are cheap, lightweight, wireless and portable.

HEADLINE: China and Russia Are Set to Begin Joint Military Exercises Today

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
China and Russia will hold their most ambitious joint military exercises beginning Thursday, with naval ships, bombers, fighter planes and 10,000 troops massing on China's northeast coast for maneuvers that the two countries say will show their deepening cooperation.
 They say the exercise is not intended to threaten other countries, but to improve the ability of China and Russia to thwart terrorism and separatist uprisings on their borders. But the focus of those concerns is in Central Asia, while the exercises will be on the Pacific coast, 3,000 miles away. Energy and regional tensions exist in northeast Asia, however, and the display of mutual political trust between China and Russia may be more important than the military training involved, specialists in Russian and Chinese relations said. 
''It's really got nothing to do with terrorism -- that's just a neutral justification,'' Bobo Lo, who specializes in Chinese-Russian relations at Chatham House, an international relations institute in London, said of the exercises. ''The real rationale is not a military one, and not even a security one, but to show the strength of the overall relationship.'' 
 The differences between what Russia and China are saying about the exercises may be more revealing. 
 A senior Chinese military officer suggested this week that the exercises were intended to bring Russia in to deter the United States from supporting Taiwan if it moved toward independence and China responded with force.
 ''For China, the real threat to national sovereignty, territorial integrity and the mission of national reunification is a large and powerful potential foe with high-tech weapons,'' said Col. Lai Bin, of the People's Liberation Army's Academy of Military Sciences Beijing, apparently referring to the United States. ''Carrying out training and exercises for this makes perfect sense.'' His comments appeared in Asia Weekly, a mainland-controlled Chinese-language magazine published in Hong Kong.
 But suggestions that Russia would back China in an attack on Taiwan are far-fetched, Russian analysts said. ''Russia supports China's one-China policy,'' said Vasily Mikheyev, a specialist on Chinese-Russian relations at the Institute of International Political and Economic Studies in Moscow, ''but Russia certainly doesn't want to be involved in Chinese-Taiwanese tactical rivalry.''
 Increased Chinese military cooperation with Russia may eventually help reduce influence in Asia, said Andrew Yang, a specialist on the Chinese military at the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a privately financed research organization in Taipei, Taiwan. ''Better security relations with Russia will help China to balance U.S. influence in the region,'' he said.
 The exercises will also give China an opportunity to learn from Russia's forces, which have more experience in the complicated joint maneuvers that China may eventually use to threaten Taiwan.
 Despite a decade of double-digit increases in official military budgets, China's arms still lag behind Russia's most advanced weaponry, said Bates Gill, a specialist on China's international security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''It will be an opportunity for the Chinese to see a superior military in action.''
 Russia will also be showing off new military equipment, including the Tu-95MS fighter and the Tu-22M3 bomber, Chinese and Russian news media have reported.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices Increased Sharply in July

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Wholesale prices in July rose more sharply than expected and at a faster rate than consumer prices, indicating that businesses were still shielding consumers from the full brunt of higher energy costs.
 The Producer Price Index, which measures what producers receive for goods and services, rose 1 percent in July, the Labor Department reported yesterday, double what economists had been expecting and a sharp turnaround from flat prices in June. Excluding food and energy, the core index of producer prices rose 0.4 percent, higher than the 0.1 percent that economists had forecast. Much of that increase was a result of an unexpected increase in car and truck prices. 
On Tuesday, the Labor Department said the prices that consumers paid for goods and services in July were up 0.5 percent over all, and up 0.1 percent excluding food and energy.
 Most of the overall rise in both consumer and producer prices was caused by energy costs, which increased 4.4 percent in the month. (Wholesale food prices fell 0.3 percent in July.) Compared with July 2004, wholesale prices were up 4.6 percent; the core rate climbed 2.8 percent, its fastest pace since 1995.
 Typically, increases in the Producer Price Index portend similar changes in the consumer index as businesses recoup higher costs from customers. But for much of this expansion, which started at the end of 2001, that has not been the case. In fact, many businesses like automakers have been aggressively discounting their products.
 Economists are pondering how long businesses will be able to keep themselves from passing on higher energy costs to their consumers.
 ''It's mighty difficult the closer you get to the consumer to raise prices, and that remains the case,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at the consulting firm MFR. ''There is a big debate out there as to how long can this continue.''
 Mr. Shapiro said that businesses have been unable to raise prices because of competitive pressures both domestically and overseas. Profits at many companies are starting to suffer as a result. For example, Wal-Mart Stores, which prides itself on being the home of ''every day low prices,'' reported its smallest quarterly profit growth in four years on Tuesday, citing the rising toll that energy was taking on its expenses and its customers ability to buy.
 Economists noted that the Producer Price Index might be overstated this month because it shows wholesale prices for cars and light trucks rose 1.5 percent and 1.4 percent in July. Those increases are in stark contrast to the sharp discounts being offered by Detroit automakers since June.
 Mr. Shapiro said the increases appeared to be a statistical anomaly created by how researchers adjust the price data for seasonal variations. Excluding autos and trucks, the core index rose just 0.2 percent, not 0.4 percent.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which prepares the report, said the car and truck data was based on survey information it received from automakers. ''It was surprising, but it's not uncommon for manufacturers to scale back some incentives while actively promoting others,'' Antonio Lombardozzi, an economist with the bureau, said.
 The report also showed big price increases for raw materials (up 6.7 percent) and goods in production (up 1 percent). Increases in crude oil and natural gas played the biggest part but the price of iron and other metals also rose.
 Rising prices have been a growing concern for the Federal Reserve, which has been raising short-term interest rates to try to head off inflation and maintain moderate growth in the economy. The benchmark federal funds rate on overnight bank loans is now at 3.5 percent, and economists expect it will be raised to 4.25 percent by the end of the year.
 ''As long as there is a perception that higher prices are in the tea leaves, that's a problem certainly for policy makers,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research. ''And I think that's why the Federal Reserve seems hellbent on raising rates.''
 Mr. Yamarone said other signs indicated that prices would continue their upward march. For instance, he anticipates that food prices, which have fallen five of the last seven months at the wholesale level, could rise because of the drought in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: For Egyptians, a First Taste of Candidates Stumping for President

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
Campaigning in Egypt's first multicandidate presidential election kicked off Wednesday with President Hosni Mubarak -- unchallenged for 24 years and almost certain to win -- trying to depict himself as just another competitor in a 10-member race.
 The Sept. 7 election is the cornerstone of Mr. Mubarak's reform program, and his government is trying to show it will be a fair race to convince skeptical Egyptians it is serious about greater democracy. 
 Previously, Mr. Mubarak ran uncontested in yes-no referendums. But the United States has been pressing Mr. Mubarak, one of its closest Arab allies, to move ahead with democratic change, and the fairness of the election is a major test of Washington's policy of promoting democracy in the Middle East.
 Several major opposition parties are boycotting the vote, dismissing it as a sham, stacked against them on nearly every level. 
 The overpowering edge Mr. Mubarak's governing National Democratic Party enjoys in organization and influence was clear Wednesday, when billboards praising him cropped up overnight across the capital. No opposition advertisements were to be seen.
 Mr. Mubarak, who never before made a show of stumping for votes, delivered an old-fashioned appeal for support, promising greater political and economic change in his opening campaign speech. 
 ''I will work hard to earn the support and the confidence of every one of you, the children of our people in Egypt's hamlets, villages and towns,'' he said.
 ''There are still more constitutional and legislative amendments to complete building our democracy. We still have more economic and social reforms to reach the modern society we dream of.''
 Television screens beside the podium showed a short campaign film about Mr. Mubarak, highlighting his private side. In the film, his wife, Suzanne, talked about ''the eye contact'' that brought them together when they first met. ''He is a man anybody gets attracted to, elegant, balanced, handsome, full of confidence and greatness,'' she said.
 Portraying an image of a middle-class family, Mr. Mubarak said he had not bought a car until a few months after his marriage. He even talked about crying when his political duties prevented him from accompanying his older son, Alaa, to Washington for back surgery.
 The speech was broadcast live on a privately owned Egyptian satellite station, and the Mubarak campaign said parts would appear on state-run television during the time allocated to each candidate. The campaign has said Mr. Mubarak will abide by all campaign finance and media rules.
 Earlier this year, Mr. Mubarak pushed through a constitutional amendment allowing a direct election with competitors. His nine opponents are mostly from minor opposition parties. His main challengers are Noman Gomaa, leader of the Wafd Party, and Ayman Nour of the Ghad Party. 
 Mr. Nour laid out his own political agenda in a speech just after the president's, arriving in a horse-drawn carriage at his campaign headquarters in an impoverished neighborhood of central Cairo. He promised that as president he would abolish emergency laws, free all political prisoners and establish a human rights ministry.
 The first two years would be a transitional period ''to move on from totalitarian rule to sensible rule and from tyrannical rule by one person to the rule of the homeland,'' he said.
 ''We shouldn't let defeat seep into hearts by assuming Mr. Mubarak will win. He's not going to win,'' Mr. Nour said to a roar of applause.

HEADLINE: Price Quirk Means Cheaper Gas at New Jersey Toll Roads

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

DATELINE: BLOOMFIELD, N.J., Aug. 17 

 BODY:
Glenn Fletcher hopped down from the driver's seat of his green Lincoln Navigator with a question rarely heard this summer. ''Why is this gas so cheap?'' he asked.
 Mr. Fletcher was genuinely pleased to be paying almost $56 to fill his tank Wednesday afternoon because he recognized that the prices on the pumps on the Garden State Parkway were unusually low. He had caught on to an anomaly that many drivers never notice: The price of gas on New Jersey's two main toll roads changes only on Fridays, usually just before the morning rush. 
 That rule hardly matters to most drivers, except when gas prices are exceptionally volatile, as they have been in the past week. Since Aug. 10, the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey has set a new high -- unadjusted for inflation -- every day, hitting $2.49 yesterday, according to AAA Mid-Atlantic.
 New Jersey already has among the cheapest gas prices in the country because of its low fuel taxes. But at the eight rest areas along the Garden State Parkway, which pump Mobil gas, and the 12 that line the New Jersey Turnpike, which sell Sunoco, the price was lower still, stuck at $2.38 since Friday morning. For Mr. Fletcher, that gap amounted to a savings of more than $2.50, or 11 cents a gallon below the state average.
 ''I just noticed the signs and I wondered what's going on up in here in North Jersey,'' said Mr. Fletcher, who stopped at the Bloomfield rest area on his way home to Marlton in Burlington County. ''I'm surprised the line's not backed up and causing a traffic jam.''
 The price is the same up and down the two toll roads, the result of the contract the New Jersey Turnpike Authority has with its fuel vendors, said Joe Orlando, a spokesman for the authority, which also runs the parkway. Those terms allow the vendors to set the price once a week, but no higher than 3 cents a gallon above the average price charged by 100 stations that are surveyed weekly. When prices are rising, drivers on the toll roads are the winners. But when prices fall, they can find themselves paying more for gas than elsewhere.
 On Friday, the statewide average was $2.35 a gallon, said Tracy E. Noble, a spokeswoman for AAA Mid-Atlantic, in Hamilton, N.J. Since then, it has jumped 14 cents, or 6 percent in five days, making a fill-up on the Turnpike a bargain, she said.
 ''You assume when you're driving on the Parkway and the Turnpike and you have nowhere else to go, you're going to be paying higher prices,'' Ms. Noble said. ''In the past, under normal circumstances, their prices have been higher than your average local gas station.''
 This week, she said, the American Automobile Association has been advising people to ''shop with their steering wheel,'' even if the hunt takes them onto a superhighway that charges tolls.
 That advice does not apply in New York, though, because the New York State Thruway Authority allows the fuel sellers at its 27 travel plazas to survey their markets and charge a locally competitive price.
 But Lori Brown, a resident of Oakland, N.J., said she had made such detours lately at the urging of her husband, a limousine driver who spends about $90 a day on gas.
 ''I will get on the parkway just to get gas because it's so cheap,'' Ms. Brown said, as an attendant pumped $35 worth of gas into her Kia Optima for the drive to visit her daughter's taco stand in Seaside Heights. ''Isn't it weird?''
 According to Gasbuddy.com, a Web site that posts prices reported by drivers, no station in the state was charging a lower price than the toll road stations were. Even Costco warehouse clubs, which had created a controversy by selling gas to their members at steep discounts, were charging more.
 ''That's kind of crazy,'' said Billy Rappaport, a television producer from New York City, who was driving with his girlfriend to Kentucky. ''It's usually a 180 of that. Usually, you're paying for the convenience.''
 ''Crazy'' and ''weird'' were not the words on Frank Durantino's lips as he looked out at the idle attendants in front of his Shell station in Bloomfield, less than a mile away. He was steaming over the loss of more than 500 gallons a day in sales as customers passed by on their way on and off the Parkway.
 Mr. Durantino, who owns two Shell stations, said his cost for fuel had risen 18 cents a gallon in less than a week. So, he was compelled to raise his price to $2.56 a gallon.
 ''I'm getting crushed over here,'' he said, his biceps bulging out of the rolled-up sleeves of his shirt. ''If I was selling my gas at $2.38 a gallon, I'm dead.''

HEADLINE: 14 Face Rackets Charges In New Jersey Mob Arrests

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
It began like another news conference on yet another mob bust: 14 people suspected of being members of the Genovese crime family were rounded up Wednesday morning and charged with racketeering, loan sharking and extortion.
 Then came the twist.
All the victims were Greek-Americans, a group that is known to have a corner on the New Jersey diner trade. 
 According to Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, Mafia members went after Greek-American diner owners and threatened to hurt them unless they paid punishing interest rates and protection money.
 The diner owners ''had to make a decision if they wanted to get beaten up or pay up,'' Mr. Christie said at a news conference Wednesday in Newark. He did not name any of the victimized owners or businesses. 
 Mr. Christie added that the TV show ''The Sopranos'' might glamorize the mob life, but that members are ''just common hoods who'd rather steal for a living than work for a living. It's no more glamorous than that.''
 Leslie Wiser Jr., the F.B.I.'s special agent in charge of the Newark office, added, ''While the cast members of 'The Sopranos' may be returning for another season, the members of the Genovese crime family arrested today will not be returning to crime so soon.'' 
 That would presumably be a relief to Greek-American business owners in New Jersey, several of whom said they were surprised to hear about the arrests.
 ''I can see this happening 30 or 40 years ago, when you had immigrants running businesses, but the Greeks running diners today have been in this country for a while,'' said John Pappas, whose family has owned the distinctive Coach House Diner in North Bergen since 1939. ''I'm shocked.'' 
 Mr. Christie said he could not explain why the suspects were singling out Greek-Americans who owned diners, restaurants and other businesses.
 ''I don't know why Greeks,'' he said.
 Clay Constantinou, a prominent Greek-American businessman in New Jersey and a former United States ambassador to Luxembourg, said, ''My gut feeling is this happened because they are successful and they tend to deal a lot in cash.''
 Greek businesses are an especially tight-knit network in New Jersey. Diner owners have banded together to buy food in bulk at lower costs and often talk shop. 
 Mr. Pappas said that until now, stories of mob interference seemed more myth than reality.
 ''I've heard things, but it's always third- or fourth-hand,'' Mr. Pappas said.
 According to a 43-page indictment unsealed on Wednesday, the activities were controlled by Lawrence Dentico, an 81-year-old reputed Genovese crime captain also known as Little Guy and Little Larry, who is in jail on murder and racketeering charges. Authorities said Mr. Dentico and associates made more than $5 million from illegal gambling and loans and extortion in New York and New Jersey.
 Operations were based in a social club in Hoboken and a bar and deli in Jersey City, the authorities said. Several associates, including Joseph Scarbrough, 66, and Michael Crincoli, 46, were charged with threatening business owners with economic harm and violence.
 Prosecutors said the charges were based on recordings and evidence gathered in search warrants. The investigation took more than three years, Mr. Christie said, and was ''a body blow'' to organized crime in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Comptroller Backs Tax Credits 

BYLINE: By Al Baker (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. gave his endorsement yesterday to an agreement to provide state and city tax credits and use Liberty Bonds to reduce borrowing costs for the construction of Goldman Sachs's $2 billion headquarters opposite the former World Trade Center site. 
In a statement, Mr. Thompson said the deal ''strengthens the hope of renewal and job stability for Lower Manhattan.'' Bettina Damiani, project director of Good Jobs New York, a nonprofit group that tracks corporate subsidies, said Mr. Thompson's approval was ''surprising considering how little information about the economic impact of this deal has been made public.''

HEADLINE: The Immigrants' Legacy: A Taste for Opportunity

BYLINE: By James Flanig

 BODY:
FOR 20 years, Gilbert de Cardenas Jr. traveled California and the Southwest marketing Mexican-style cheeses for Cacique Inc., a company founded in 1973 by his parents shortly after they immigrated to the United States from Cuba.
 As the Hispanic population swelled and a tide of Hispanic food products, like tortillas and salsa, caught on with the American public, Cacique grew in the 1980's and 90's from a bootstrap enterprise in a small dairy in the Los Angeles suburb of La Puente into the largest American maker of Hispanic-style cheeses, with approximately $130 million in annual sales today.
 But as he made his sales rounds, Mr. de Cardenas noticed that something was missing from the aisles of giant supermarkets and neighborhood bodegas alike: distinctly Hispanic meat. There were no Hispanic lunchmeats, no specially seasoned cold cuts or hot dogs.
 So Mr. de Cardenas, who is 42 and recently earned a Master of Business Administration from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, researched the market and made plans for a couple of years. This month he began his own company and brand name, demonstrating that the Hispanic immigrant economy had grown large enough to attract the vast resources of the American capital markets. 
 The company, MTK Inc., based in Pasadena, Calif., has begun shipping Don Gilberto brand cold cuts and frankfurters to small supermarket chains catering to Hispanic neighborhoods in California and Texas. With just six employees, it is starting off small, contracting out the production and distribution of its products.
 But Mr. de Cardenas has big ambitions. He plans an intensive advertising campaign on Spanish-language broadcasting stations and in-store promotions in the first two years ''to establish our foothold in the marketplace,'' he said. He expects to expand into Nevada, Arizona and Illinois by late next year and into Miami, New York and New Jersey in 2007. He also hopes to talk soon with Costco Wholesale and the Sam's Club division of Wal-Mart Stores about supplying the large packages they require.
 Though he is not trying to break into supermarket chains like Kroger and Safeway, he is already projecting sales of $25 million in his first year, reaching $50 million in 2010 and eventually more than $150 million. ''The Hispanic lunchmeat market is huge, between $1.5 billion and $3 billion,'' he said. ''We'll be only a fraction, but of a monstrous market.'' 
 To enhance the appeal in the Hispanic store chains, like Gigante Supermarkets and Liborio Markets, MTK will label its Don Gilberto cold cuts prominently in Spanish, and secondarily in English -- ''jamon'' in big red letters, ''ham'' in smaller type. Flavors will be different, too. ''Not spicier but sweeter, less salt and more garlic,'' Mr. de Cardenas said. ''They will have more flavor.''
 Don Gilberto Foods has its work cut out. Hispanic consumers are buying luncheon meats made by the major producers like Kraft Foods, which markets recipes prepared with Latin accents, such as plantains and bacon, and ham with corn relish. ''The big guys own the shelf space, so Don Gilberto will face a challenge,'' said Roger Laverty, a veteran food store executive who developed the Smart & Final warehouse chain in Los Angeles in the 1990's and now is chief executive of the Diedrich Coffee Company.
 Whatever the challenges, Mr. de Cardenas has more than demographics and entrepreneurial enthusiasm on his side. Unlike his parents, who struggled and scraped to make and sell cheeses that would appeal to their Mexican and Central American neighbors in Los Angeles, Mr. de Cardenas is starting out with serious financial backing.
 The Los Angeles brokerage and investment firm Stern Fisher Edwards raised approximately $4 million for MTK this year in a private equity offering to local investors. Other than Mr. de Cardenas, who put up about $700,000 of the financing, only one of the investors had any connection to the immigrant Hispanic community or to Latin America. 
 Yet Stern Fisher's investment bankers didn't have to do a lot of explaining. ''The clients were very receptive,'' said Jon Kmett , the firm's president. ''They already had the vision and understanding of the Hispanic market, saw the power of it here in Southern California.''
 So do a lot of other people. The Hispanic population in the United States has surged to 40 million today, from under 30 million a decade ago, and in the same period its buying power has more than doubled, to $450 billion a year from $200 billion. The investment community is constantly on the alert for promising start-ups that can tap into that lucrative market. And Southern California is one of the hottest places to look for them. The number of Hispanic businesses in the region increased to an estimated 150,000 today from fewer than 100,000 in the middle of the last decade.
 Indeed, old family money that helped build Los Angeles in the 20th century is investing in Hispanic enterprise in the 21st. A $150 million private equity fund, RC Fontis Partners, has just formed to help Hispanic family companies make the transition from family ownership to professional management.
 It is backed partly by the Chandler family, the guiding spirit behind many Southern California institutions, and partly by the Villanueva family, whose members were pioneers in developing Spanish-language broadcasting. 
 RC Fontis Partners and similar funds hold out the same potential of high returns, typically 20 percent a year over the long term, that much larger private equity funds offer to pension and institutional investment managers.
 In the case of MTK (which stands for My Three Kids, referring to Mr. de Cardenas's children, Anthony, Isabella and Gilbert) the investors are to earn 9 percent a year plus amortization of their investment. At the end of five years, they are to have their initial stake repaid and be given the opportunity through a reduced price warrant to purchase up to 20 percent of MTK. 
 But will Don Gilberto Foods be able to generate high sales and profits against the entrenched competition of the Krafts and Hormels and ConAgras that dominate luncheon meat cases?
 Mr. de Cardenas professes not to fear the competition. The large lunchmeat companies, he says, have a faulty understanding of the emerging market because they depend on market surveys from major supermarket chains and thus miss the independent and ethnic grocer groups. Also, he says, with the combativeness that entrepreneurs often express for big companies, ''they move rather slowly.'' 
 Not surprisingly, major food companies don't see it that way. Kraft labels and advertises its Oscar Mayer hot dogs and cold cuts in Spanish. Hormel Foods is expanding its Hispanic specialties, labeled Herdez and Manny's, through acquisitions, like this year's buyout of Arriba Foods in New Berlin, Wis. 
 Even a more aggressive campaign by big food companies to market Hispanic-style meats could hold opportunity for Mr. de Cardenas, in his view, because MTK might then become a takeover target. At the right price, he says, an acquisition would reward the outside investors and serve his own ultimate goal.
 ''I want to pass on opportunities to my children,'' he said. ''That may be in this company or it may not. But I want to pass on opportunities.''
 Mr. de Cardenas's parents lost a cheese business when Fidel Castro came to power in the 1960's. They came to the United States in 1971 and created not only a new and larger cheese business but also opportunity for their children. The entrepreneurial tradition continues.

HEADLINE: Governor of Ohio Is Charged With Breaking Ethics Law 

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
Gov. Bob Taft, scion of Ohio's most famous Republican family, was charged yesterday with violating state ethics law by failing to report 52 gifts, including golf outings, hockey tickets and meals, on his annual financial disclosure reports.
 The charges, all misdemeanors, bring the first prosecution of a major political figure stemming from a widening investigation of Thomas Noe, a rare-coin dealer, Republican fund-raiser and friend of Mr. Taft. State officials have accused Mr. Noe of mishandling and possibly stealing millions of dollars from a state workers' compensation fund. 
While the charges against Mr. Taft are considered relatively minor, they add to a scandal involving his administration and Mr. Noe that is likely to reverberate deep into next year's campaign for governor, Democrats and Republicans agreed. Mr. Taft, in his second term, is barred by term limits from running again in 2006. But in what is shaping up as an extraordinarily spirited race, three Republicans and two Democrats are competing to succeed him.
 The governor will be arraigned in Columbus this morning, when, prosecutors said, they expect him to plead no contest. Mr. Taft's lawyer, R. William Meeks, did not return phone calls for comment. 
 Mr. Taft will make a public statement about the charges after his arraignment, said Mark Rickel, a spokesman. Mr. Rickel said the governor had no plans to resign.
 The charges carry maximum penalties of a $1,000 fine and six months in jail on each of the four counts. But state officials said it was unlikely that Mr. Taft -- great-grandson of President William Howard Taft, and son and grandson of United States senators -- would face jail time. 
 The investigation into unreported gifts to Mr. Taft was an offshoot of a much broader inquiry into Mr. Noe's handling of $50 million in unorthodox investments in rare coins and memorabilia for the Ohio Workers' Compensation Bureau.
 The investments were first reported in April by The Toledo Blade, and Mr. Noe's lawyers have since said that as much as $13 million of the $50 million cannot be accounted for. State Attorney General Jim Petro, himself a Republican, has filed a suit against Mr. Noe asserting that he may have diverted nearly $4 million of the investments for personal use. In addition, federal investigators are looking into whether Mr. Noe may have funneled illegal contributions to President Bush's campaign last year. 
 Currently, a task force involving the Justice Department, the F.B.I., the state police, the State Ethics Commission and prosecutors from two counties are combing state documents and Mr. Noe's records for evidence of criminal malfeasance. As a part of that inquiry, investigators have been checking whether Mr. Noe tried to buy influence or win state contracts using campaign contributions or gifts. One former official, Brian Hicks, pleaded no contest last month to a single charge of failing to disclose that when he was the governor's chief of staff, he and his family twice stayed at Mr. Noe's home in Florida. 
 In the course of checking his own records, Mr. Taft publicly acknowledged in June that he had failed to report dozens of free golf outings and additional gifts from Mr. Noe and others. That acknowledgment brought on the investigation that resulted in the ethics charges filed yesterday.
 State officials said the 52 gifts omitted from Mr. Taft's disclosure forms, mostly golf outings dating from 1998, were worth a total of nearly $6,000. Ohio law requires disclosure of each unreimbursed gift worth more than $75.
 Some Democrats have raised the possibility of impeachment proceedings against Mr. Taft. But a leading Republican, Speaker Joe Husted, said an impeachment motion could not pass in the Republican-dominated House. 
 Other Democrats said it would be politically advantageous for them if Mr. Taft remained in office throughout the 2006 campaign. In a state where Republicans not only hold the governor's office but also command overwhelming majorities in both houses of the legislature, Mr. Taft's approval ratings have fallen below 20 percent in some polls. Democrats and even some Republicans blame him for higher taxes, a weak economy and an array of scandals.


CORRECTION-DATE: August 19, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about ethics charges against Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio misstated the given name of the state's House speaker, who said that if an impeachment motion was made, it could not pass the House. He is Jon Husted, not Joe.

HEADLINE: UConn Suspends 2 Players After Thefts 

BYLINE: By DAVID PICKER; Jane Gordon contributed reporting from Storrs, Conn., for this article.

 BODY:
The men's basketball program at the University of Connecticut has enjoyed tremendous success under Coach Jim Calhoun, including two national championships during the past six seasons. But it suffered a blow yesterday when Calhoun indefinitely suspended two members of the team who were arrested in the theft of four laptop computers.
 Marcus Williams, a junior and the starting point guard, surrendered to the university police Tuesday night and was charged with four counts of third-degree larceny, a felony. He had just returned from Argentina, where he played for the United States in the men's under-21 world championships. 
A.J. Price, a point guard who was redshirted during his freshman season, in 2004-5, was arrested Friday and charged with the same counts in addition to one misdemeanor count of making a false statement to the police.
 The four larceny counts carry a penalty of up to five years in jail and $5,000 in fines, The Associated Press reported. The police said they intended to make a third arrest. 
 ''In light of the pending charges against Marcus and A.J., I have suspended them from all basketball team-related activates,'' Calhoun said in a statement. ''They are barred indefinitely from all team activities, and their academic and personal activities will be closely monitored on a daily basis by the members of our basketball staff.
 ''They will continue to have complete access to all of the academic support staff so they can focus their energies on their studies.''
 Williams and Price were released on $10,000 bond each and are scheduled to appear in Superior Court in Rockville, Conn., next Tuesday. 
 According to the UConn police, the arrests stemmed from a lengthy investigation of three separate burglaries at student residences in which the laptops were stolen. They said the burglaries occurred between June 9 and 14. The police said that Williams, Price and a third person attempted to sell the computers at several locations in the Manchester, Conn., area, including a pawnshop, and that Williams was recognized immediately by the pawnshop staff, which did not accept the computers.
 The four computers, valued at $11,500, were recovered, and two of them were seized from Price's local residence, the police said.
 They said Price first told them that he had no knowledge of the computers but, when presented with evidence to the contrary -- text messages -- he admitted that he did.
 The arrests could hurt the team's national championship hopes next season. UConn went 23-8 last season but was upset by North Carolina State in the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament. Williams was one of four starters scheduled to return for the 2005-6 season.
 The Huskies have made the N.C.A.A. tournament in 9 of the last 11 seasons and advanced to the final eight or beyond five times during that span. Calhoun, who is entering his 20th season as the UConn coach, took the team to the N.C.A.A. championship in 1998-99 and 2003-4.
 Williams, 19, a native of Compton, Calif., averaged 9.6 points and 7.8 assists in 31 games last season. He set a team record with 16 assists during a game against Central Connecticut in December. He did not play during the second semester of his freshman season because of academic issues.
 Price, 18, of Massapequa, N.Y., did not play during his freshman season because of a brain hemorrhage in October. He subsequently had surgery and had not been cleared by doctors to resume playing with the team.
 Gary Charles, who coached Price during an all-star game when Price was in high school, said he was surprised by the arrest. ''A.J. was always a soft-spoken young man whenever he was around me and other companies,'' Charles said.
 For a team that is generally viewed as having a clean reputation, Connecticut has endured a handful of recent incidents involving its star players.
 In February 2003, Ben Gordon, a leader on the 2003-4 national championship team and now with the Chicago Bulls, was arrested on charges of assault and disorderly conduct, having been accused of slapping a female student. He was sentenced to probation and 30 hours of community service. 
 Khalid El-Amin, who briefly played with the Miami Heat, was arrested on a marijuana possession charge in April 1999, two weeks after helping guide the Huskies to a national title. He acknowledged having the marijuana and was sentenced to a day of community service. 
 In April, Williams's backup, Antonio Kellogg, was expelled from the university after being charged with attempting to assault a police officer, criminal trespass and possessing marijuana.
 The UConn women's team, which has won five national titles since 1995, has not had to contend with off-court issues of this nature.
 ''I think the situation is extraordinarily sad,'' said Peter Barth, an economics professor at the university and a season-ticket holder for the men's basketball team. ''As a parent, I feel badly, especially for A.J. Price's parents, after his medical troubles last year.''

HEADLINE: As Views Disappear, Rumblings Of Resistance

BYLINE: By ERNEST BECK

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY is feverish with construction, from high-rises on the sedately residential Upper West Side to new towers designed by Frank Gehry proposed for Brooklyn. But with the city's pace of development showing no signs of slowing, community groups remain silent on one consequence of the building frenzy: rapidly disappearing views of the rivers and sky. 
 ''Unfortunately, buildings are going up and getting higher,'' said Sean Sweeney, director of the SoHo Alliance, a group involved in zoning and landmark issues. ''You can't expect to have a clear view forever from an apartment in New York City.''
But not everyone in the country is resigned to the loss. In many other cities and towns where development is surging, officials and community groups are fighting back. 
 Over the past few years, a scattering of cities across the country, particularly on the West Coast, have taken on the issue of view protection and citizen complaints about everything from a neighbor's new second-story bedroom to trees that have grown too tall. 
 In a recent case concerning view protection, a court in San Luis Obispo County in California ruled that the state's Coastal Commission could restrict development to safeguard coastal views for the public. The ruling was the result of a suit against the commission by Dennis C. Schneider, who had proposed building a 10,000-square-foot home for himself on the Harmony Coast between Cayucos and Cambria. A Superior Court judge, Roger Picquet, noted that kayakers, boaters and surfers also enjoy the shore as the homeowner would, and that their views merit protection. 
 As the population grows and the coast becomes more congested, Peter Douglas, executive director of the California Coastal Commission in San Francisco, said, ''it is even more of a priority to have a policy of protection, even for those on the sea looking back to land.''
 Last year, the city council of Westlake Village in Ventura County, Calif., approved an ordinance establishing rights for residents with views. They now have the right to take legal action if the views from homes are ruined by a neighbor. 
 Belvedere, Calif., a bedroom community north of San Francisco that is famous for its million-dollar views of the Bay and multimillion-dollar homes, has enacted strict rules on square footage and landscaping to ensure that a neighbor's view of passing sailboats isn't obscured. 
 ''Views are always an issue and are always contentious,'' said Pierce Macdonald, Belvedere's interim planner.
 Charles Gwathmey, the architect, discovered that for himself when he took on a project to build a house in Belvedere on a hillside lot for a businessman and his small family. When Mr. Gwathmey saw the site for the first time in 2001 he was astounded by the sweeping vistas. ''They were so spectacular, so wild, I couldn't believe it,'' he recalled. 
 Preserving those views became a priority in while designing the house. To win approval from local authorities, Mr. Gwathmey's New York firm, Gwathmey Siegel, came up with the idea of a contemporary five-story, 12,000-square-foot house that cascades down the hillside, reminiscent of houses in Italian hill towns. Rather than rising to obstruct the next door neighbor's view of the Bay, the house -- completed in 2003 -- is ''sensitive to the ordinances and to the neighbors,'' Mr. Gwathmey said. 
 In Tiburon, Calif., a town adjacent to Belvedere with equally stunning views, hillside design guidelines were adopted in 1981. When it comes to choosing what might be blocked, officials are sometimes forced to make Solomon-like decisions. ''Blockage of a hillside is not given as much weight as blockage of an important object like the Golden Gate Bridge,'' said Dan Watrous, planning manager for Tiburon. ''That is a real premium view.'' 
 The differing approaches to view protection reflect the fact that zoning ordinances are controlled by local authorities, not the federal government or the states. And rules and regulations vary tremendously. While localities often provide for open spaces, and codify building heights and setbacks to maintain public views, they don't usually provide a mechanism to guard or guarantee private views, according to William Klein, research director of the American Planning Association, a nonprofit education and advocacy group for city planners. In general, community activists ''can raise a stink about losing their views,'' noted Peter Slatin, editor of The Slatin Report, an online real estate newsletter, ''but there are no legal means by which a resident can absolutely block something.'' Efforts to preserve and protect, say, a New York City homeowner's classic Brooklyn Bridge view usually lose out in big development battles. 
 What's more, community groups have little legal firepower to stop developers like Donald Trump. Trump Place, his project on Manhattan's Upper West Side, provoked controversy a few years ago by blotting out private views along 72nd Street. 
 Some community activists in New York, like Arlene Simon, president of Landmark West!, a nonprofit group that advocates protecting the architectural heritage of the Upper West Side, would like to wield the clout that Belvedere residents enjoy.
 ''It would be great to have more local power,'' she said, ''especially in areas where things are getting hot, like the outer boroughs.'' With such power, she added, ''we might help stop McMansions being built in Jackson Heights.'' But for the moment, Ms. Simon and others are resigned to losing views. ''C'est la vie, it's life in the big city,'' she said.
 To be sure, it is easier to control development in an exclusive enclave like Belvedere, which is described as ''one of the most desirable places in the world to live and raise a family'' at the city's official Web site.
 The residents want to keep it that way, as Mr. Gwathmey found out. His design, was approved on the first go, however, because it did not obstruct views from two adjacent houses: the first floor is the street-level garage; subsequent floors below contain bedrooms and living areas, with the pool and boat dock at the bottom of the hill. The presence of the house is ''nonexistent on the street,'' Mr. Gwathmey said. 
 In New York, struggles over zoning and building permits are more complex. Compromise is necessary to reach a consensus on zoning squabbles and view preservation, city officials say. Yet with the city's population at an all-time high, the economy booming and development encouraged by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- a record 25,208 new housing permits were issued last year -- chances are increasing that some residents could lose their small patch of sky.
 There must be trade-offs between public and private views, says Amanda M. Burden, the city planning commissioner, noting that preserving the distinct character of neighborhoods like low-rise Park Slope, Brooklyn, for example, is often more important than preserving a private view. ''People don't mind if their views are blocked if there isn't an explosion of big buildings that changes the entire neighborhood,'' she explained. If views are lost, Ms. Burden added, the city tries to set up ''view corridors'' and ''open public spaces that provide light and air.''
 A view corridor is not exactly what Lorna Nowve has in mind when she peers out of her window in the Chatsworth, a landmark Beaux-Arts building on 72nd Street near Riverside Drive. When she moved into the building in the late 1980's, the view from her 11th floor apartment took in a sweeping stretch of the city extending from the Statue of Liberty to the 79th Street Boat Basin. 
 But then, despite local opposition, came Trump Place, a complex expected to eventually include 17 waterfront towers along the Hudson. Now Ms. Nowve said she sees ''a field of flat-screen televisions and three car lengths of Hudson River.''
 For Ms. Nowve, a film producer, the Trump building is ''an anonymous wall that turns its back on the vibrancy of the city.'' 
 Mr. Trump believes otherwise. Neighborhood activists ''fought me on everything,'' he said in a phone interview. ''I won because I had the proper case. Everybody loves the job I did there.'' 
 Some cities strive for a balance between public and private views. In Seattle's downtown, buildings must be set back from the street to enhance views of the mountains and water. A policy aims to maintain views of icons like the Space Needle from public parks. ''Everything that is built blocks a view of something,'' said John Rahaim, Seattle's planning director. ''But this policy allows us to tweak the building to protect views.'' 
 Not so in New York. The city has only designated one area -- the Brooklyn Heights promenade -- as a protected ''scenic view district.''

HEADLINE: How Old Friends of Israel Gave $14 Million to Help the Palestinians 

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
It was perhaps an odd request to make of a man noted for his commitment to Israeli causes and his fierce criticism of the Palestinian Authority. 
 Please raise $14 million to help buy the Jewish settlers' lucrative greenhouses in the Gaza Strip so that the Palestinians can take them over when the settlers are gone. Oh, and can you get it done by the weekend, before the pullout starts? If not, the settlers will destroy the greenhouses on their way out of Gaza to keep them out of Arab hands.
Last Wednesday, though, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, real estate magnate and publisher of The Daily News, received just such a pitch from his friend James D. Wolfensohn, the former president of the World Bank, current Middle East envoy for the White House and would-be broker of the deal. 
 Mr. Zuckerman, who is also former head of the American-Israel Friendship League, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, and the Soviet Jewish Zionist Forum, said he thought about the ironies. But not for too long.
 ''Despite my skepticism,'' Mr. Zuckerman said in an interview on Tuesday, ''I thought to myself, 'This is perhaps the only illustration or symbol of what could be the benefits of a co-operational, rather than a confrontational attitude.'''
 So he in turn picked up the phone and called a few of his friends and fellow billionaires, who also happened to be prominent Jewish philanthropists. 
 Not all of them shared his enthusiasm. ''Some people said, 'Well, if these people are so anti-Semitic, why should we do anything to help them?''' Mr. Zuckerman said.
 But Lester Crown of Chicago, whose family owns General Dynamics, said yes. Leonard Stern, the chairman of the Hartz Mountain real estate empire and former owner of The Village Voice, called Mr. Zuckerman back from a cruise ship in the Mediterranean and said yes. A foundation that prefers to remain anonymous said yes. 
 Within 48 hours, Mr. Zuckerman said, he had his $14 million. And the Palestinians had a shot at inheriting relatively intact the greenhouses whose vegetables and flowers have been a major source of Israeli export income, and, not incidentally, about 3,500 desperately needed Palestinian jobs.
 When the deal was announced Friday, the donors were anonymous, apart from Mr. Wolfensohn, who put up $500,000 of his own. But word about these things tends to leak out, and yesterday morning, Mr. Stern said he got a call at his beach house in the Hamptons from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. 
 ''She said that she wanted to let me know that myself and every member of the group that helped make this possible had made a very positive contribution to the peace,'' he said. Mr. Stern, 67, was asked the last time he received a call from Ms. Rice. ''Before my bar mitzvah,'' he joked, before answering, ''Never.''
 The purchase of the greenhouses had been months in the making. The Israeli government is giving the settlers $55 million for the greenhouses themselves, but Israeli law allows compensation only for buildings and land, not for movables like the greenhouses' computerized irrigation systems. 
 Without those, the Palestinians would not be able to make a go of running the greenhouses, Mr. Zuckerman said. It was those, the greenhouse guts, that carried the $14 million price tag.
 The United States Agency for International Development was willing to put up the money, but could not give it directly to the Israelis because Israel does not qualify for the agency's help, Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Stern said. 
 The simple way around that obstacle would have been for the agency to give the money to the Palestinian Authority to hand over to the settlers. But there, Mr. Zuckerman said, ''The attitude was, 'We are not going to put our fingerprints on anything that helps the Jews.'''
 The donors arranged to funnel their money to the Aspen Institute, a private advocacy group that has been working on investments in the Palestinian areas, and a private Israeli group helped broker the deal with the settlers. 
 Mr. Stern said he was not used to writing a seven-figure check to a cause he had not had time to research himself.
 ''But when you know people and you know they're passionate, and you have a great respect for their judgment,'' he said of Mr. Zuckerman, ''I listened to him, and I asked him one question. 'Are you contributing?' He said yes. I said 'Well, O.K., then I will.'''
 Mr. Zuckerman is hardly naive about the prospects for peace in the Middle East. 
 On Monday in U.S. News & World Report, which he also publishes, he wrote an editorial excoriating both the Palestinian Authority's leader, Mahmoud Abbas, and his more violent, increasingly powerful rivals in Hamas. 
 ''The sad fact,'' Mr. Zuckerman wrote, ''is that everything is going wrong.''
 But some hope, he said, is better than no hope.
 ''It's not an easy thing to be up against,'' Mr. Zuckerman yesterday, ''when someone is swearing and yelling at you, and you're saying, 'O.K., well, I'm going to give you $14 million so that you can do better.' But this is the one thing that might be seen as a constructive effort.''

HEADLINE: Rice Urges Israel and Palestinians to Sustain Momentum

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday offered sympathy for the Israeli settlers who are being removed from their homes in Gaza but also made it clear that she expected Israel and the Palestinians to take further steps in short order toward the creation of a Palestinian state. 
 ''Everyone empathizes with what the Israelis are facing,'' Ms. Rice said in an interview. But she added, ''It cannot be Gaza only.'' 
Israel began the forcible eviction of thousands of Gaza settlers on Wednesday, and Ms. Rice called it ''really quite a dramatic moment in the history of the Middle East.'' Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, she added, had shown himself to be ''enormously courageous.''
 Ms. Rice has visited the region twice recently to ensure that the Gaza withdrawal proceeds smoothly. While she noted that the withdrawal would take several weeks to play out, soon after that, she insisted, Israel must take further steps, including loosening travel restrictions in the West Bank and withdrawing from more Palestinian cities. 
 At the same, she added, the Palestinian Authority must take its own steps, moving quickly to disarm Palestinian factions intent on breaking the cease-fire.
 Her remarks came during an interview with reporters and an editor of The New York Times at the State Department. She discussed the major issues facing her in Iran, North Korea and elsewhere, but she also talked about what she considered her major accomplishments in her first seven months in office. She came to the State Department in January after serving as President Bush's national security adviser.
 ''This is a very remarkable time,'' she said. This fall, she noted, there will be ''the Iraqi referendum followed by Iraqi elections; Afghan elections for the Parliament; Egyptian contested elections for the first time. 
 ''You've also had the withdrawal of the Syrians from Lebanon and the elections in Lebanon,'' she went on. ''We've got reform efforts that we are tracking in Jordan. And of course women have the right to vote for the first time in Kuwait.''
 ''Something very dramatic is changing in the Middle East,'' she said. ''And it is changing in the direction of -- and I only say in the direction of -- more open, more pluralistic, contested political environment.'' Mr. Bush's efforts, and hers, in ''pressing the case'' for democratic change, she said, ''I think has had a tremendous effect.'' 
 In Israel on Wednesday, officials expressed anxiety over what they said was a determination by the militant organization Hamas to exploit the withdrawal to commit further violence against Israel. Israeli officials say they have evidence that Hamas is using the cease-fire to build up and train its own army in Gaza, preparing for more suicide bombings in Israel while also stockpiling rockets to be fired into Israel from Gaza. 
 Ms. Rice said she did not know ''how extensive'' such a buildup had been. ''But I know there has been some,'' she said. ''I don't doubt that Hamas is training and increasing its capacity to cause trouble as a terrorist organization.'' 
 Israel has used a lull in the violence to focus on the Gaza pullout. But Israeli officials say they will not make further concessions unless the Palestinian Authority makes parallel moves to go beyond the negotiated calm and begin dismantling and disarming Palestinian militant groups. Ms. Rice agreed, saying confidence-building steps needed to be taken by both sides simultaneously. She also made it clear that she expected the Palestinian Authority to take responsibility for disarming Hamas.
 ''That is their obligation under the road map,'' she said, referring to the peace plan that the United States and its allies proposed in 2003. 
 In the interview, Ms. Rice touched on other contentious issues, notably Iran and North Korea. The United States is involved in negotiations to persuade both countries to give up their nuclear programs. 
 In Vienna last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency criticized Iran for restarting its uranium conversion program but did not recommend sending the case to the United Nations Security Council, as European diplomats had said they wanted to do. Ms. Rice insisted that there had never been an intention to ask the agency to recommend sending Iran's case to the Council. 
 ''We had agreed in advance with the Europeans that we would seek a strong statement,'' she said. ''This would be a two-step process.'' 
 Early this month, three European nations, with American concurrence, presented Iran with a sweeping proposal of incentives, including agreement that Iran could have a peaceful nuclear power program sometime in the future -- if it gave up its plans to resume uranium enrichment now. 
 Iran rejected the proposal, tore the United Nations seals off its stores of nuclear materials in a uranium conversion plant in Isfahan and began processing them again, insisting that it had no intention of ceasing its nuclear program permanently. Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes, while the United States has expressed concerns that it may be trying to produce nuclear arms. 
 Ms. Rice insisted, too, that the United States remained determined to persuade Iran to change its mind.
 ''There seems to be very strong international consensus that an Iran that has behaved the way that it has over the last couple of years really should not have a fuel cycle,'' she said. ''We expect that the next step will be to work with others to make certain that there are consequences for that behavior, and we believe that the Security Council is the reasonable next step.'' 
 American officials acknowledge that they may face difficulty in persuading all of the permanent members of the Security Council to impose economic sanctions on Iran. China, for one, buys fuel from Iran. But a senior administration official said China had been helpful in the atomic agency's debate last week. 
 On North Korea, the United States faces a similar problem. In six-nation talks, now recessed for several weeks, the North Koreans insisted that they had the right to pursue a peaceful nuclear power program. Ms. Rice disagreed.
 ''There are still legs to the six-party process that may indeed bring about exactly the outcome that we are looking for,'' she said. She would not say what the administration might do if the talks failed but added that she took comfort in the fact that the United States was not negotiating with North Korea alone.

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld's Tour of South America Is Directed at Promoting Stability

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, seeking to strengthen United States ties with Latin America, is visiting Peru just days after President Alejandro Toledo was forced to shake up his government.
 President Toledo swore in a new cabinet on Tuesday. Under the Peruvian Constitution, he was forced to ask all 16 of his ministers to resign when Prime Minister Carlos Ferrero quit to protest Mr. Toledo's appointment of an unpopular ally to be foreign minister. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld planned to meet with President Toledo on Thursday. The secretary, who visited Paraguay before coming to Peru, is urging both countries to work together to stem ''antisocial, destabilizing behavior'' that threatens the Western Hemisphere's security.
 In Paraguay, Mr. Rumsfeld met Wednesday with Defense Minister Roberto Gonzalez Segovia before touring a small military museum and laying a wreath at the Pantheon of Heroes in the center of Asuncion, the capital.
 A few dozen protesters waited for Mr. Rumsfeld across the street from the shrine, which honors historic figures in Paraguay's military. Standing behind a row of police officers in riot gear, the protesters chanted ''Murderer! Murderer!'' and shouted expletives as a military band welcomed Mr. Rumsfeld by playing ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''
 The secretary's three-day trip, his third to Latin America in 10 months, reflects Washington's concerns about the increasing influence of Cuba and Venezuela. The United States wants to ensure that President Fidel Castro of Cuba and President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela do not steer other Latin American countries away from democracy. After meetings in Paraguay, military officials there said the country's leaders were very alert to the problems the two countries could cause.
 President Chavez has insisted that his country poses no threat to the region and has accused the United States of trying to isolate Venezuela.
 United States officials say that the main concern is the stability of Bolivia, which borders both Peru and Paraguay, but that other countries could be vulnerable as well. They say unstable countries, along with chronic problems in Latin America of corruption, drug trafficking and gang violence, present a security threat to both North and South America.
 In Peru on Wednesday, Mr. Rumsfeld toured a museum featuring art, jewelry, textiles and tools of the country's indigenous people. 
 Last week's cabinet shake-up was the latest crisis to hit Mr. Toledo's scandal-ridden government.
 President Toledo is in the final year of a five-year term, but American officials say there is a possibility his term could end before the next national election, in 2006, despite some economic success during his tenure. He faces low approval ratings, allegations of corruption and constant criticism from Congress.
 American officials say the strife in the Toledo government is reason for concern that Peru could fall victim to destabilization by other countries or by drug traffickers.

HEADLINE: Fair? Balanced? A Study Finds It Does Not Matter

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger (www.krueger.princeton.edu) is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.

 BODY:
THE share of Americans who believe that news organizations are ''politically biased in their reporting'' increased to 60 percent in 2005, up from 45 percent in 1985, according to polls by the Pew Research Center. 
 Many people also believe that biased reporting influences who wins or loses elections. A new study by Stefano DellaVigna of the University of California, Berkeley, and Ethan Kaplan of the Institute for International Economic Studies at Stockholm University, however, casts doubt on this view. Specifically, the economists ask whether the advent of the Fox News Channel, Rupert Murdoch's cable television network, affected voter behavior. They found that Fox had no detectable effect on which party people voted for, or whether they voted at all. 
An appealing feature of their study is that it does not matter if Fox News represents the political center and the rest of the media the liberal wing, or Fox represents the extreme right and the rest of the media the middle. Fox's political orientation is clearly to the right of the rest of the media. Research has found, for example, that Fox News is much more likely than other news shows to cite conservative think tanks and less likely to cite liberal ones. 
 Fox surely injected a new partisan perspective into political coverage on television. Did it matter? 
 The Fox News Channel started operating on Oct. 7, 1996, in a small number of cable markets. Professors DellaVigna and Kaplan painstakingly collected information on which towns offered Fox as part of their basic or extended cable service as of November 2000, and then linked this information to voting records for the towns. Their sample consists of 8,630 towns and cities from 24 states. (Because many states do not report vote tallies at the town level, they could not be included in the sample.) 
 Local cable companies adopted Fox in a somewhat idiosyncratic way. In November 2000, a third of the towns served by AT&T Broadband offered Fox while only 6 percent of those served by Adelphia Communications offered it. Fox spread more quickly in areas that leaned more to Republican candidates, but the imbalance was only slight. Furthermore, looking within Congressional districts, the likelihood that a town's cable provider offered Fox in 2000 was unrelated to the share of people who voted for Bob Dole, the Republican candidate for president in 1996, or the residents' educational attainment, racial makeup or unemployment rate. 
 Because Fox News started just before the presidential election in 1996 and was hardly available at the time of that election, a major question is whether the introduction of Fox in a community raised the likelihood that residents voted for George W. Bush over Al Gore in the 2000 election, as compared with the share who voted for Bob Dole over Bill Clinton in the (pre-Fox) 1996 election. 
 Disregarding third-party candidates, Professors DellaVigna and Kaplan found that towns that offered Fox by 2000 increased their vote share for the Republican presidential candidate by 6 percentage points (to 54 percent, from 48 percent) from 1996 to 2000, while those that did not offer Fox increased theirs by an even larger 7 percentage points (to 54 percent, from 47 percent). 
 When they made statistical adjustments to hold constant differences in demographic characteristics and unemployment, and looked at differences in voting behavior between towns that introduced and did not introduce Fox within the same Congressional district, the availability of Fox had a small and statistically insignificant effect on the increase in the share of votes for the Republican candidate. Thus, the introduction of Fox news did not appear to have increased the percentage of people voting for the Republican presidential candidate. A similar finding emerged for Congressional and senatorial elections.Voter turnout also did not noticeably change within towns that offered Fox by 2000 compared with those that did not. 
 By the summer of 2000, 17 percent of Americans said they regularly watched the Fox Cable Channel, and another 28 percent said they watched it sometimes. These numbers approached the viewership of the Cable News Network at the time. 
 Certainly many Democratic sympathizers feared that Fox gave Republican candidates an advantage. Al Franken, for example, called Fox ''a veritable all-news Death Star'' in Rupert Murdoch's media empire. 
 Why was Fox inconsequential to voter behavior? 
 One possibility is that people search for television shows with a political orientation that matches their own. In this scenario, Fox would have been preaching to the converted. This, however, was not the case: Fox's viewers were about equally likely to identify themselves as Democrats as Republicans, according to a poll by the Pew in 2000. 
 Professors DellaVigna and Kaplan offer two more promising explanations. First, watching Fox could have confirmed both Democratic and Republican viewers' inclinations, an effect known as confirmatory bias in psychology. (Borrowing from Simon and Garfunkel, confirmatory bias is a tendency to hear what we want to hear and disregard the rest.) When Yankee and Red Sox fans watch replays of the same disputed umpire's ruling, for example, they both come away more convinced that their team was in the right. One might expect Fox viewers to have increased their likelihood of voting, however, if Fox energized both sides' bases. 
 The professors' preferred explanation is that the public manages to ''filter'' biased media reports. Fox's format, for example, might alert the audience to take the views expressed with more than the usual grain of salt. Audiences may also filter biases from other networks' shows. 
 The tendency for people to regard television news and political commentary as entertainment probably makes filtering easier. Fox's influence might also have been diluted because there were already many other ways to get political information.

HEADLINE: Madison Avenue Seems Calm in August. It's Not.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THIS time of year, Madison Avenue is like the proverbial duck in the pond: seemingly placid on the surface but furiously paddling underwater.
 Although summer hours and vacations have thinned the ranks of office workers at agencies, the accounts of major advertisers are continuing to change hands at a brisk pace. The reason is that marketers would like new agencies in place so campaigns can be readied in time for the important fall and holiday shopping seasons.
In the last several days, accounts with spending estimated at more than $200 million have changed agencies, affecting brands in competitive categories like restaurants, automotive services and household products. 
 And there will be more changes as reviews proceed for other accounts, with combined spending estimated at more than $1 billion. The accounts still in review involve brands like BMW, Bank of America, L.L. Bean, British Airways, Lowe's, LensCrafters, Liberty Mutual and Morgan Stanley. 
 The biggest surprise among the accounts changing agencies was Shoney's, the chain based in Nashville that operates 300 restaurants throughout the Southeast. Shoney's is naming a new agency of record, Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York, part of MDC Partners, to replace its lead agency of the last four years, Doe-Anderson in Louisville, Ky.
 The agency change, to be formally announced today, comes a little more than two months after Shoney's hired a new senior vice president for marketing, Dan Dahlen. Shoney's, owned by Lone Star Funds in Dallas, spends about $20 million a year on advertising. A new campaign is expected in the fall.
 The hiring of Freeman represents a reunion of sorts. Two decades ago, when Mr. Dahlen was an advertising executive at Wendy's International, he and Cliff Freeman -- Mr. Freeman the person, that is -- worked together to produce the famous campaign carrying the theme ''Where's the beef?'' Mr. Freeman at the time worked for a New York agency named Dancer Fitzgerald Sample; his success with Wendy's helped him to open his own agency, where he has worked for fast-food chains like Little Caesars and Quiznos. 
 ''Cliff Freeman has proven that what counts in advertising is results,'' Mr. Dahlen said yesterday, adding that although the competitors that Shoney's faces in the family dining category ''outspend us dramatically, we now have the ability to outsmart and out-execute them.''
 Another restaurant chain, Outback Steakhouse, based in Tampa, Fla., is also changing agencies. David and Goliath in Los Angeles, the Outback agency since 2002, has withdrawn from a review for the assignment to create television commercials. Outback is estimated to spend $80 million a year on TV advertising.
 The withdrawal of David and Goliath leaves three agencies to compete as finalists in the Outback review, which began in June: Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, owned by Havas; Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group; and the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe. A decision is expected soon.
 Goodby, Silverstein had created campaigns for Subway, until last month, when Subway dismissed the agency and consolidated its creative account at MMB, formerly McCarthy Mambro Bertino, in Boston. Kaplan Thaler is the agency for the Blimpies International restaurant chain, but that account has been inactive.
 Another restaurant chain hiring an agency was Chevys, which specializes in Mexican menu items. Maiden Lane in San Francisco, the agency formerly known as Gardner Geary Coll, was named to handle Chevys advertising after a review that also included two other San Francisco agencies, Amazon Advertising and Eleven. This is the first agency Chevys has hired under its new ownership; the chain was acquired this year by Real Mex Restaurants in Long Beach, Calif. 
 In automotive services, two car-rental companies -- Alamo Rent a Car and National Car Rental -- are changing agencies as their parent, Vanguard Car Rental, based in Tulsa, Okla., selected Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of Publicis, to handle both brands. The previous agency for Alamo and National, with combined spending estimated at $20 million to $30 million, was DG&A in Los Angeles.
 The decision by Vanguard came after a review that included Fallon and agencies like Element 79 Partners in Chicago, part of Omnicom, and the Chicago office of Young & Rubicam, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands division of the WPP Group. Jerry Dow, the new chief marketing officer at Vanguard, worked with Fallon for many years when he held a similar post at United Airlines. In the automotive services market, Carfax in Fairfax, Va., which sells data about used cars, returned its creative account to the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, after working for two years with another Interpublic agency, Lowe Worldwide in New York. Carfax, which worked with Martin from 1999 to 2003, spends an estimated $30 million a year on campaigns, mostly on television.
 Finally, in household products, the Maytag Corporation in Newton, Iowa, named the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom, to handle the creative account of its Hoover division, which had been handled by another Omnicom agency, Element 79 Partners. Spending was estimated at $20 million to $25 million. The decision came after a review in which the other participants were not identified.

HEADLINE: Blood Runs Red, Not Blue

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com; David Brooks is on vacation.

 BODY:
You have to wonder whether reality ever comes knocking on George W. Bush's door. If it did, would the president with the unsettling demeanor of a boy king even bother to answer? Mr. Bush is the commander in chief who launched a savage war in Iraq and now spends his days happily riding his bicycle in Texas.
 This is eerie. Scary. Surreal. 
The war is going badly and lives have been lost by the thousands, but there is no real sense, either at the highest levels of government or in the nation at large, that anything momentous is at stake. The announcement on Sunday that five more American soldiers had been blown to eternity by roadside bombs was treated by the press as a yawner. It got very little attention.
 You can turn on the television any evening and tune in to the bizarre extended coverage of the search for Natalee Holloway, the Alabama teenager who disappeared in Aruba in May. But we hear very little about the men and women who have given up their lives in Iraq, or are living with horrific injuries suffered in that conflict.
 If only the war were more entertaining. Less of a downer. Perhaps then we could meet the people who are suffering and dying in it.
 For all the talk of supporting the troops, they are a low priority for most Americans. If the nation really cared, the president would not be frolicking at his ranch for the entire month of August. He'd be back in Washington burning the midnight oil, trying to figure out how to get the troops out of the terrible fix he put them in.
 Instead, Mr. Bush is bicycling as soldiers and marines are dying. Dozens have been killed since he went off on his vacation.
 As for the rest of the nation, it's not doing much for the troops, either. There was a time, long ago, when war required sacrifices that were shared by most of the population. That's over.
 I was in Jacksonville, Fla., a few days ago and watched in amusement as a young woman emerged from a restaurant into 95-degree heat and gleefully exclaimed, ''All right, let's go shopping!'' The war was the furthest thing from her mind.
 For the most part, the only people sacrificing for this war are the troops and their families, and very few of them are coming from the privileged economic classes. That's why it's so easy to keep the troops out of sight and out of mind. And it's why, in the third year of a war started by the richest nation on earth, we still get stories like the one in Sunday's Times that began:
 ''For the second time since the Iraq war began, the Pentagon is struggling to replace body armor that is failing to protect American troops from the most lethal attacks by insurgents.''
 Scandalous incompetence? Appalling indifference? Try both. Who cares? This is a war fought mostly by other people's children. The loudest of the hawks are the least likely to send their sons or daughters off to Iraq.
 The president has never been clear about why we're in Iraq. There's no plan, no strategy. In one of the many tragic echoes of Vietnam, U.S. troops have been fighting hellacious battles to seize areas controlled by insurgents, only to retreat and allow the insurgents to return.
 If Mr. Bush were willing to do something he has refused to do so far -- speak plainly and honestly to the American people about this war -- he might be able to explain why U.S. troops should continue with an effort that is, in large part at least, benefiting Iraqi factions that are murderous, corrupt and terminally hostile to women. If by some chance he could make that case, the next appropriate step would be to ask all Americans to do their part for the war effort.
 College kids in the U.S. are playing video games and looking forward to frat parties while their less fortunate peers are rattling around like moving targets in Baghdad and Mosul, trying to dodge improvised explosive devices and rocket-propelled grenades.
 There is something very, very wrong with this picture.
 If the war in Iraq is worth fighting -- if it's a noble venture, as the hawks insist it is -- then it's worth fighting with the children of the privileged classes. They should be added to the combat mix. If it's not worth their blood, then we should bring the other troops home.
 If Mr. Bush's war in Iraq is worth dying for, then the children of the privileged should be doing some of the dying.

HEADLINE: 2 U.S. Soldiers Killed in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
Two American soldiers were killed and two wounded Thursday in a roadside explosion in southern Afghanistan, the United States military said. The soldiers were in a convoy supporting a road construction project financed by the United States in Uruzgan Province.
 ''These terrorists are attacking the very forces working to improve Afghanistan,'' Brig. Gen. Jack Sterling, deputy commander of American forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement. 
General Sterling said the construction project, which will connect the southern cities of Tarin Kowt and Kandahar, ''stands to greatly improve the local economy upon completion.''
 He blamed Taliban insurgents for the attack. ''It's unconscionable that the Taliban would do something like this,'' he said. ''They only offer death and continued suffering to the people of Afghanistan.'' 
 The new American ambassador, Ronald Neumann, said that despite a recent increase in violence, elections scheduled for Sept. 18 would proceed as planned. ''There is violence, and there are people who will try to kill candidates and will try to stop the elections,'' he said Thursday in his first news conference since his appointment last month.
 ''I don't tell you that is going to be an all-quiet day, but they will not stop the election and they will not even come close,'' he said.

No Prison for Soldier in Abuse Case
 FORT BLISS, Tex., Aug. 18 (AP) -- A jury on Thursday spared Pfc. Willie V. Brand from prison time, reducing his rank a day after he was convicted in a brutal attack on an Afghan prisoner. Prosecutors had asked that the defendant, 27, be sent to a military prison for 10 years with a dishonorable discharge. 
 On Wednesday, a jury of four enlisted soldiers and three officers convicted Private Brand of assault, maltreatment, maiming and making a false official statement in connection with an attack on a detainee known as Dilawar at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan while Private Brand worked in a detention center there in December 2002.
 The jury acquitted him of charges that he had abused a second detainee, Habibullah. Both prisoners died in December 2002.

HEADLINE: How to Poison a River

 BODY:
New York is increasingly a state of mega-dairies, and when things go wrong with such operations, they go wrong in a mega-way. The Marks Farm near Lowville, N.Y., has a herd of some 3,000 dairy cows. Their milk is trucked away regularly, but their liquefied manure is stored in a reservoir with earthen walls. How much manure? Before Aug. 11, the reservoir at the Marks Farm contained some three million gallons. Sometime in the next day, one of the walls blew out and released most of that waste into the Black River, a popular fishing stream and a water source for towns downstream. In case you have trouble visualizing it, three million gallons of liquid manure is roughly equivalent to the water in six Olympic-size swimming pools. 
 The result has been a major fish kill and the loss -- at least temporarily -- of all recreation on the river. The mess has been gradually diluted and will finally make its way into Lake Ontario, where it will do the fish there no good.
 With any luck, what this spill will leave behind is a resolve to place new limits on concentrated animal feeding operations -- as these mega-farms are known -- in New York. As always, advocates of industrial farming argue that the increase in the number of large dairies and the inevitable loss of small ones are just a result of market forces and economic efficiency. But this has always been nonsense. 
 Mega-dairies, like huge hog confinement operations, are all too often forced upon local communities against their will. Some New York towns have tried to restrict the expansion of industrial farms nearby. But whenever that happens, the State Department of Agriculture and Markets has sued, or threatened to sue, under the state's Right to Farm Law. 
 That law made sense when farms were smaller and incapable of causing serious air pollution or a manure spill of massive proportions. Farmers still need to be protected against frivolous lawsuits, but the state needs to get out of the business of forcing industrial farms on communities that don't want them. And when farms operate at the scale of Marks Farm, they need to meet far stricter environmental standards than currently prevail. This disaster should never have had a chance to happen.

HEADLINE: Bush's Aid Cuts On Court Issue Roil Neighbors 

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO; BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Three years ago the Bush administration began prodding countries to shield Americans from the fledgling International Criminal Court in The Hague, which was intended to be the first permanent tribunal for prosecuting crimes like genocide.
 The United States has since cut aid to some two dozen nations that refused to sign immunity agreements that American officials say are intended to protect American soldiers and policy makers from politically motivated prosecutions.
To the Bush administration, the aid cuts are the price paid for refusing to offer support in an area where it views the United States, with its military might stretched across the globe, as being uniquely vulnerable. 
 But particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, home to 12 nations that have been penalized, the cuts are generating strong resentment at what many see as heavy-handed diplomacy, officials and diplomats in seven countries said. 
 More than that, some Americans are also beginning to question the policy, as political and military leaders in the region complain that the aid cuts are squandering good will and hurting their ability to cooperate in other important areas, like the campaigns against drugs and terrorism. 
 In testimony before Congress in March, Gen. Bantz J. Craddock, the commander of American military forces in Latin America, said the sanctions had excluded Latin American officers from American training programs and could allow China, which has been seeking military ties to Latin America, to fill the void.
 ''We now risk losing contact and interoperability with a generation of military classmates in many nations of the region, including several leading countries,'' General Craddock told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
 Most of the penalties, outlined in a law that went into effect in 2003, have been in the form of cuts in military training and other security aid. But a budget bill passed in December also permits new cuts in social and health-care programs, like AIDS education and peacekeeping, refugee assistance and judicial reforms. 
 Though the amounts are a pittance for Washington, their loss is being sorely felt in small countries. 
 In an outburst, in June, President Alfredo Palacio of Ecuador told a Quito television station that he would not yield to Washington. ''Absolutely no one is going to make me cower,'' he said. ''Neither the government, nor Alfredo Palacio nor the Ecuadorean people need to be afraid.''
 His nation has one of the region's largest American military bases and has become increasingly important as a staging ground for American surveillance of everything from the cocaine trade to immigrant smuggling. Still, Ecuador has lost $15 million since 2003 and may lose another $7 million this year.
 When the International Criminal Court's 18 judges took their oaths in March 2003, the tribunal was backed by 139 countries and heralded by supporters as the most ambitious project in modern international law. 
 It was intended to replace the ad hoc tribunals addressing atrocities in Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. This year the Security Council, with the United States abstaining, gave the court approval to prosecute cases related to atrocities in Darfur, Sudan.
 Many legal scholars say it is unlikely that Americans would ever face the court because its focus is on the most egregious of war crimes, like systematic genocide, and the court is intended to try cases from countries where the judicial systems are unable or unwilling to handle such cases. There are also safeguards that would give the United States' own military and civilian courts jurisdiction over Americans. 
 But Bush administration officials, including some at the State Department, assert that the court could still move against American officials. 
 ''The exposure faced by the United States goes well beyond people on active duty and it includes decision-makers in our government,'' said a high-ranking State Department official who was authorized to speak about the policy but only if he was not identified. ''We're not hallucinating that our officials are at risk.''
 ''The idea is that the court gets to second-guess if it's not satisfied,'' the official added. 
 Bruce Broomhall, director of the center for the study of international law and globalization at the University of Quebec in Montreal, disagrees. He noted that for the court to act against a suspected war criminal, the prosecutor must satisfy the judges that the host country was ''shielding the individual concerned from criminal responsibility.'' 
 Still, Mr. Broomhall said, there is ''a glimmer'' of an argument behind the administration's concern. ''If the crime is sufficiently organized and intense and a crime against humanity -- if you get past that first threshold -- it's potentially a crime within the jurisdiction of the court,'' he said.
 Others, like Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch, acknowledge that there are countries that may want to use the court ''as a political battering ram.'' 
 ''What's in dispute,'' said Mr. Dicker, director of international justice for the group, ''is what kinds of safeguards are necessary to prevent these kinds of distortions. The United States has adopted a solution that's inimical to the rule of law, that says because we're the most powerful state in the world, we'll create a two-tiered system of justice.''
 George Nethercutt, a former Republican congressman from Washington State whose amendment calling for cuts in economic aid was approved in December, acknowledged that the possibility an American would face charges was small. But he said that pushing countries to sign the agreements did not ''seem like a disproportionate expectation'' because aid is not an entitlement. 
 Opponents in the American Congress, though, call the administration's efforts part of a ''hyper-precautionary'' policy that does more harm than good.
 ''We're constantly pressuring other countries, and it comes to a point where it provokes a backlash and hurts us, hurts us militarily, hurts our commercial relationships, hurts us politically,'' said Representative Bill Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat. 
 Administration officials note that more than 100 immunity agreements have been signed. But supporters of the court say that most have been signed by poor countries heavily dependent on Washington for aid; NATO allies like Britain and Germany have been exempted from the penalties, as well as other wealthy countries like Australia and Japan.
 In about two-thirds of the countries that have signed, legislative bodies have not ratified the agreements, raising questions about their legality, said the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, which supports the tribunal. 
 In all, 53 countries, from Kenya to Ecuador to some European nations, have declined to sign the agreements, saying Washington's effort undermines their commitment to the court. Not all have been penalized and some, like Paraguay and Dominica, later yielded to American pressure and signed agreements. 
 In Latin America the immunity agreements, and the sanctions, have been especially hard to swallow for left-leaning governments who have come to power by rejecting American-backed economic policies. 
 ''It's a contradictory policy and it's ungrateful,'' said Luis Hernandez, a retired Ecuadorean Army colonel who was educated at the United States Army War College. 
 American budgetary records show that Uruguay, whose new left-leaning government has vocally declined to sign an immunity agreement, has lost $1.5 million since 2003. Costa Rica has lost about $500,000, and unstable Bolivia has lost $1.5 million.
 In addition, the United States International Military Education and Training program, which pays for Latin American military officers to study in the United States, has cut its rolls by 770 officers a year, from an average class of 3,000, military officials said.
 Most nations that have lost money are cash-strapped, like Dominica, a Caribbean island which lost $400,000 and was unable to operate its only Coast Guard boat for two years. That meant no drug patrols or searches for fishermen lost at sea, said Crispin Gregoire, Dominica's ambassador to the United Nations.
 ''We were reeling from the impact of lost aid, and our economy was not in the greatest shape,'' he said. ''The government decided to yield and we ended up signing.''
 Peru, a close Bush administration ally, has lost about $4 million ''You feel the cuts, yes,'' said Congressman Luis Iberico, president of the committee that oversees military spending and the antidrug campaign. ''These are small amounts, but nevertheless, they're necessary to support our military personnel.''
 Painful as the cuts are, many countries say they will not budge before American pressure. 
 ''We will not change our principles for any amount of money,'' said Michael I. King, the Barbados ambassador to the Organization of American States. ''We're not going to belly up for $300,000 in training funds.''
 Many officials argue that existing treaties already protect American soldiers. The new agreements go too far, they say, by adding protections for ordinary Americans, like tourists, and non-American contractors who work for American companies.
 Here in Colombia, where the American military has rotated 8,000 soldiers in the past five years as part of its largest mission in the region, a new immunity agreement two years ago has upset some officials. Colombia already had a 1974 treaty protecting American soldiers from criminal charges.
 ''These treaties say that everyone in Colombia must respect the law, Indians, Chinese, the Colombians,'' said a Colombian senator, Jimmy Chamorro, who considers them illegal. ''Everyone except the Americans.''

HEADLINE: The Word, at Last, Is In: Jobs Are Being Created 

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
A jobs report released yesterday belatedly shows how much of the economic expansion has been due to actual hiring, as opposed to fewer rounds of layoffs. In other words, are there really new jobs out there? 
 The report, from the Labor Department, says there are new jobs -- that hiring at the end of last year was the strongest since June 2002 and that employers at last added to payrolls in earnest. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the nation gained 8.1 million jobs, the most since the first quarter of 2002, according to the report. 
Among the most comprehensive employment figures available, the data confirm what less rigorous surveys have suggested and what the monthly employment figures have only hinted at. (While the monthly job report is based on surveys of employers and households, the figures released yesterday cover roughly 98 percent of the work force.)
 Economists said the data suggested a long-awaited change in the outlook of employers, a movement away from years of reluctance to add new workers. ''The rate of job creation from 2000 through mid-'04 was just stuck in the cellar, '' said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington, ''and this was an underappreciated, ongoing cause of the jobless recovery.'' 
 Late in 1999, hiring slowed so sharply that it reversed almost five years of gains in two years, according to the data released yesterday. And although hiring rose for a few months after the recession of 2001 ended, it soon began falling again -- hence, the so-called jobless recovery. 
 But last year ended with more optimism. From October to December, existing employers added 6.4 million jobs and new employers added 1.7 million jobs, for 8.1 million in all. 
 ''It looks to me like employers are finally either facing or expecting a level of demand that's much more convincing to them,'' Mr. Bernstein said ''This is yet another piece of evidence that employers are shedding their excessively cautious ways.'' 
 Job losses as a percentage of total employment hovered at the lowest levels since the government started keeping track in 1992. Over all, employment rose 0.7 percent, the most since the first quarter of 2000. 
 Construction seemed to be riding on the demand for housing, adding 101,000 jobs over all, as hiring outnumbered layoffs. That was the sector's sixth quarterly gain in a row and the largest since March 2001. 
 Service providers and retailers also expanded their payrolls, but more because of a decrease in layoffs than because of an increase in hiring. But manufacturing continued to struggle, with a loss of 25,000 factory jobs -- the 18th quarterly loss of jobs in the last five years. 
 Still, the data appear to have been an early sign of improved employment growth. Since the figures were compiled, the government has reported an average growth pace of 191,000 jobs a month.
 ''2004 was where we really established more consistent job growth,'' said Erica Groshen, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''2004 established the trend that is carrying forth in 2005.''

HEADLINE: Weiner Urges Increasing Police Force By 3,000 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Manny Fernandez contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Representative Anthony D. Weiner yesterday proposed adding 3,000 new police officers to bring the Police Department up to pre-Sept. 11 staffing levels, adding that he was the ''tough-on-crime Democrat'' in the race.
 His address on police issues came as a new poll suggested that the Democratic mayoral race was tightening up and that Mr. Weiner was gaining support just as his television ad campaign starts.
The poll from Quinnipiac University showed Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, still leading, with 33 percent of likely Democratic primary voters saying he was their choice for the nomination. He would need 40 percent in the voting on Sept. 13 to avoid a runoff against one of the other candidates, and yesterday's poll showed the three other Democrats statistically tied for second place: Gifford Miller and C. Virginia Fields at 17 percent and Mr. Weiner at 16 percent. In previous polls, Ms. Fields, the Manhattan borough president, led Mr. Miller, the City Council speaker, and Mr. Weiner. 
 The poll, conducted before the candidates debated this week, surveyed 489 Democrats who said they were likely to vote in the primary and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
 Mr. Weiner was eager to emphasize the Quinnipiac findings yesterday, saying they showed that voters had begun to respond to him, even before his television advertising starts today. 
 ''I'm the least known of the candidates, and I'm effectively tied for second,'' said Mr. Weiner, who was at Pace University yesterday to discuss his plans for fighting crime. ''All I can assume it means is what I've been saying all along -- that the issues will eventually cut through the haze. I do believe Democratic voters desperately want to see a candidate with new ideas.''
 In pledging to add 3,000 police officers to the force, he raised the ante on Mr. Miller, who had proposed adding 1,000. Mr. Weiner also said that if he is elected, he would like Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly to remain in his job, since Mr. Kelly has said he will not work for a different mayor. Other Democratic candidates have said they would prefer to name their own police commissioners. 
 Angered by Mr. Weiner's pointed criticism of labor endorsements of the Republican mayor in Tuesday's debate, unions protested at the candidate's headquarters in Lower Manhattan yesterday and put up a large inflatable rat outside.
 In an announcement on the steps of City Hall, Ms. Fields pointed with pride to her endorsement yesterday by the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women, support she hopes will add energy to a campaign that has lacked momentum in recent weeks.
 Leaders of the women's group, which has 10,000 members in the five boroughs, said Ms. Fields has made women's issues a priority. Ms. Fields said yesterday that as mayor she would fight for women, pledging to reduce domestic violence and ensure that businesses owned by women and minorities gain fair access to city contracts.
 The group's announcement was one of the first major endorsements for Ms. Fields in weeks and comes at a crucial time in her campaign. The primary is less than four weeks away, and by this weekend each of her opponents will be on the air with significant television advertising, but Ms. Fields, who has raised the least amount of money of the candidates, has yet to join them.
 Mr. Miller proposed a plan yesterday to create more jobs and promote the city's economic growth that includes $180 million in tax cuts for businesses with fewer than 500 employees.

HEADLINE: Another Bumper Crop Down on the Farm Is Keeping the Braves Well Stocked

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
With the Atlanta Braves having won their division every year since 1991, the fact that they are atop the National League East this season may not be surprising. But the way the team has managed to stay ahead of the competition, in the era of free agency, is anything but common.
 In the face of injuries and the loss of vital players to other teams over the last few years, John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager, has relied almost exclusively on his farm system to restock the club.
''I think you normally have a lot of moves, but for short periods of time,'' said Manager Pat Kelly of the Class AAA Richmond Braves. ''Generally you don't send your top prospects. But because of need, we've had to, and they've done a great job.'' 
 Of the players featured in Baseball America's list of the top 10 prospects in the Atlanta organization, six have spent time in the majors this season. Over all, 14 players from Richmond and Atlanta's Class AA team in Mississippi have played in the majors. 
 From the list of top prospects, Kelly Johnson, Kyle Davies and Andy Marte were all called up from Richmond, while Jeff Francoeur, Brian McCann and Blaine Boyer made the jump from Mississippi.
 Most of the players have filled in and then gone back to the minors, or to the bench, but outfielders Johnson and Francoeur have performed so well that they have remained in the Atlanta lineup.
 ''Kelly had limited experience, having only been in Double-A going into this year, but it was apparent he had really matured as a hitter,'' Kelly said. ''With his knowledge of the strike zone and his beautiful swing, you knew he was going to hit.''
 The No. 2 prospect in the Atlanta system behind Francoeur is Marte, a third baseman. Having filled in for the injured Chipper Jones for a few weeks, Marte is back with Richmond, where he has 17 home runs and 59 runs batted in. Baseball America's scouting report on Marte says ''he oozes intangibles, showing impressive maturity for his age.''
 Kelly said: ''He may not have been ready, but the need was there and he did a very good job filling in. Bobby Cox was very pleased with him and can't wait to get him back.''
 Proving the Braves can still produce pitching prospects, Richmond's Davies went 6-3 in the majors filling in for Mike Hampton before being sent down. The scouting report on Davies says ''his great command of his 89-93 m.p.h. fastball makes it a plus pitch.''
 Kelly was not worried about promoting Davies to the majors. ''Kyle's got tremendous poise for a 21-year-old,'' he said. ''He's a pitcher with three pitches he can control. I felt like if anyone could do it, he could.''
 The large number of call-ups has left Richmond with holes to fill.
 ''Those guys are difficult to replace,'' said Kelly, whose team is 45-81. ''It affects the team, but if it helps the team in Atlanta, that's what we're here for. ''Atlanta is a development organization. We're not that concerned about wins and losses. We're concerned about the development of our young players. That's our job.''

Hitting Streak, Average Dip
 With 26 homers and 79 R.B.I. for the Durham Bulls, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' Class AAA team, outfielder Earl Snyder has had no problems driving in runs this season. He recently compiled a 10-game hitting streak. But he had just one hit in each game and his batting average during the streak (.256) was lower than his average for the season (.262).

Misery Courts Company
 Dave Miley may be gone from the major leagues, but he is not forgotten. The Richmond (Ind.) Roosters of the Frontier League have scheduled Dave Miley Night for tomorrow. Miley, who was fired as manager of the Cincinnati Reds after going 27-43 this season, has family in nearby Brookville. The Roosters plan to honor Miley by allowing all unemployed men and women into the ball park for free. Miley will attend the game and throw out the first pitch.

Bailie Makes His Pitch
 Bowie BaySox pitcher Matt Bailie threw a no-hitter in just his second appearance for the Baltimore Orioles' Class AA affiliate last week. Bailie threw an economical 104 pitches to shut down the Erie SeaWolves, lowering his earned run average to 4.38 from 16.20.
 The start was only his second in the minors since 2002. He spent the last three years in the independent leagues.

HEADLINE: The Other Half

BYLINE: By Babatunde Osotimehin. 
Babatunde Osotimehin is chairman of the National Action Committee on AIDS in Nigeria.

DATELINE: Abuja, Nigeria 

 BODY:
THE world knows that Africans bear the brunt of the AIDS pandemic and that nearly two-thirds of the people infected with H.I.V. live here. The disease is devastating households and crippling economies across the continent. Though data show that girls and women are far more vulnerable to infection than men, we have yet to summon the courage and the political will to empower and protect them.
 In Nigeria, and across sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, epidemics are already feminized. For example, nearly 58 percent of Nigerians with H.I.V. are female. What's more, in virtually every region of the world, infections among girls and women are rising sharply. 
Unless we urgently address this trend, we will fail to end this scourge. Recognizing the reality in their own countries, some national governments, including Nigeria's, have taken important steps to prevent infection in girls and women. It is critical that donor governments and agencies coordinate to support and encourage our efforts. Furthermore, our partners' policies must be in tandem with Africa's realities. Otherwise, they may endanger the very people they seek to protect. 
 For example, a major partner, the United States government, enthusiastically promotes abstinence until marriage as the main way for young people to avoid H.I.V. infection. Abstinence is one critical prevention strategy, but it cannot be the only one. Focusing on abstinence assumes young people can choose whether to have sex. For adolescent girls in Nigeria and in many other countries, this is an inaccurate assumption. Many girls fall prey to sexual violence and coercion. Many others are married off very young, as young as 13 or 14, long before they are psychologically or physically ready. Abstinence is not an option for these girls, nor is getting their partners to use condoms. It is unacceptable for a woman or girl to ask her partner to use one in our part of the world. In Nigeria, only 23 percent of the men and 8 percent of women use condoms regularly, and, as elsewhere, almost none of them use condoms with a spouse or primary partner.
 In Nigeria, we are painfully aware that girls and women typically cannot negotiate when, where or with whom they have sex; that far too few have access to affordable health services; and that sex education is not available or accessible to many girls. When dealing with AIDS, we must address these realities and use a multipronged approach to improving education and health systems, one that can reach all of our people.
 A crucial element of our national program is the Family Life and H.I.V.-AIDS Education Program, developed in partnership with community organizations that have years of experience working with the young people of Nigeria. In a country of more than 250 ethnicities, cultures and languages, the program is designed for adaptation according to the specific needs of each of the 37 Nigerian states. 
 The program runs from primary school through university and focuses on such core issues as self-esteem and the ways boys and girls relate to each other, while also providing factual information about their bodies, pregnancy and disease. Only by educating Nigerians at an early age and in a comprehensive way will we begin to end the patterns of violence and sexual coercion, early marriage, and unsafe sexual behavior. This approach can help young people to respect and protect each other and, eventually, to help their own children.
 We are also aware that we must invest far more in comprehensive reproductive health services, including those that address problems of H.I.V., in order to reach the girls and women who are not likely to use separate H.I.V. services for fear of stigma and violence.
 In addition to youth education and access to health services, we are investing in practical tools that women can use to protect themselves. For instance, we are working with the United Nations Population Fund to reintroduce the female condom in ways that will make it more acceptable and affordable. We also have research programs to examine the possibility of using microbicides in our communities. 
 Protecting women and girls from AIDS requires true and effective partnership with international donors who are willing to undertake honest, open dialogue about what works in each of our countries. It is vital that development partners not impose their ideological or political views as a condition of partnership. National governments must have the freedom to employ the very best strategies at our disposal to help our people.

HEADLINE: Cheap Rivals Chip Away at a Cornerstone, the Arab Store

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
For decades ''the Arab on the corner'' has been synonymous here with homely down-market grocery stores jammed with fruits and vegetables, wines and liquors, dairy goods and a smattering of candy bars, floral bouquets, canned goods and preserves -- the stuff of late-night shopping sprees when other stores are shuttered.
 The more enduring of these stores have been here for generations, handed to sons by fathers who emigrated, usually from North Africa, in search of French opportunities. But now, for many, the worm is in the apple.
 The bombings in London and Egypt are naturally the city's summer talk, and they have caused discomfort for many of these merchants, in a country that has its share of ethnic tensions, but where they have tried to create a role for themselves. ''It's not good,'' said Abdelaziz Tiouajni on a recent day, as he set apples straight in his store in the northern Ninth Arrondissement. ''So many deaths.'' 
 But Arab grocers like Mr. Tiouajni face a more immediate, mundane threat. Increasingly, franchised convenience stores are invading their neighborhoods, faceless dealerships lacking physiognomy that stay open seven days a week and boast, thanks to their central buying power, prices well below those of their fragmented competitors.
 ''Competition is very severe; my competitors buy as a group,'' said Mr. Tiouajni, 25, who followed his father, Salim, to Paris from the Tunisian island of Djerba two decades ago. His father opened the store -- barely 1,300 square feet of fruits and vegetables gradually giving way to shelves of oil and flour, cereal and wine and liquor -- and Mr. Tiouajni inherited it five years ago, after his father, now 45, opened a fruit store in the southern suburb of Palaiseau.
 ''Most stores like these are run by Tunisians and Moroccans,'' he said, making them to Paris much of what the Koreans grocers are to Manhattan. His most profitable goods are the fruit, he said, because of the larger markups.
 The Arab on the corner has always had his poets, defenders and exalters. Several years ago, the French author Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt published a novel, ''Monsieur Ibrahim and the Flowers of the Koran,'' a kind of fairy tale of religious harmony in which an elderly Arab grocer befriends a Jewish boy, Moise, nicknamed Momo. When the Arab dies, Momo inherits the store and becomes Mohammed. ''Arab, in the grocery business,'' he muses in the story's closing line, ''means staying open nights and Sundays.''
 Asked if he had a particular Arab grocer in mind, Mr. Schmitt, now 45, replied: ''Yes, when I wrote the story I was living in the Jewish neighborhood around the Rue Bleue -- there was an Arab -- open from 8 in the morning until midnight. I was fascinated, I realized that many Jews felt much closer to the Arab -- someone from the Mediterranean basin -- than to other Jews, say the Ashkenazim,'' the central and northern European Jews. And who was Momo? He paused, then asked, ''Me?''
 Mr. Schmitt said he realized that Parisians were drawn to these corner stores because they had ''another rhythm -- no music -- tastes and fragrances of fruits , spices, almonds and pistachio.'' But it was also because their owners seemed tireless. ''An agreeable and pacifying place,'' he said.
 The fantasy, fable and warmth surrounding these stores may explain in part the attachment of Mr. Tiouajni's customers, despite the higher prices. If his figs are going for 4.90 euros a kilo, the chain store's price is 4.30; his Provencal melons may go for 3.90, against 1.50 at the competition. ''Our clientele is very loyal,'' he said, searching for reasons for the store's continued success. What did he think of the bombing? ''That's politics,'' he replied. ''That's not my thing.''
 The bombings in London and Egypt are no issue for Maria Pinto, 58, a concierge in a neighborhood apartment building. ''If you want good quality, it's here,'' she said. ''I buy fruit, vegetables -- it's expensive, but it's fresh, clean -- that's very important.''
 Terrorism may cast no shadow, but the menace from the Franprix at the other end of the street is very real. Last year, Franprix, a chain convenience store-cum-grocery that is part of the even bigger Casino foodstuffs group, opened another store, even more gleaming than the first, just down the street. ''Franprix is a wholesaler, our exclusive supplier, so our prices are lower on average, maybe 30 percent,'' said Joachim Amouri, the 36-year-old store manager, explaining the competitive advantage. Fruits and vegetables are delivered to the store daily, and packaged goods and frozen foods twice a week, he said.
 Would Franprix gradually swallow up the Arabs on the corner and turn them into so many Franprixs? No, he replied, because those stores, many little more than deep kiosks, are too small. So would they be forced out of business? He paused, then replied, ''That's part of the rules of the game.''
 Mr. Tiouajni acknowledges that business is not as good as it used to be, not only from the chain store competition, but also from an overall slumping French economy that discourages spending. Still, he would never consider buying a franchise himself. Indeed , if he had to begin all over again, he would do as his father did, selling only fruit. 
 ''It's more profitable,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In the Long Run, Sleep at Home And Invest in the Stock Market

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The housing boom of the last five years has made many homeowners feel like very, very smart investors. 
 As the value of real estate has skyrocketed, owners have become enamored of the wealth their homes are creating, with many concluding that real estate is now a safer and better investment than stocks. It turns out, though, that the last five years -- when homes in some hot markets like Manhattan and Las Vegas have outperformed stocks -- has been a highly unusual period.
In fact, by a wide margin over time, stock prices have risen more quickly than home values, even on the East and West Coasts, where home values have appreciated most. 
 When Marti and Ray Jacobs sold the five-bedroom colonial house in Harrington Park, N.J., where they had lived since 1970, they made what looked like a typically impressive profit. They had paid $110,000 to have the house built and sold it in July for $900,000. 
 But the truth is that much of the gain came from simple price inflation, the same force that has made a gallon of milk more expensive today than it was three decades ago. The Jacobses also invested tens of thousands of dollars in a new master bathroom, with marble floors, a Jacuzzi bathtub and vanity cabinets. 
 Add it all up, and they ended up making an inflation-adjusted profit of less than 10 percent over the 35 years.
 That return does not come close to the gains of the stock market over the same period. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has increased almost 200 percent since 1970, even after accounting for inflation. 
 Yet investment advisers worry that this reality is getting lost in today's enthusiasm for houses, even as some economists say the housing market has peaked. People are buying homes purely on speculation, trading real estate almost as if it were a stock. Surveys show that a large majority of Americans consider real estate to be a safer investment than stocks.
 ''With how strong the real estate market has performed, there is the urge for people to chase returns,'' said Jeff A. Weiand, executive vice president of RTD Financial Advisors in Philadelphia. ''But it's very difficult to beat the long-term historical record of stocks.''
 Since 1980, for example, money invested in the Standard & Poor's 500 has delivered a return of 10 percent a year on average. Including dividends, the return on the S.&P. 500 rises to 12 percent a year. Even in New York and San Francisco, homes have risen in value only about 7 percent a year over the same span. 
 That does not mean real estate is a bad investment. It is often an important source of wealth for families. But its main benefit is what it has always been: you can live in the house you own.
 ''The biggest value of the house is the shelter it provides,'' said Thomas Z. Lys, an accounting professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ''Too many people are fixated on speculation whereas most of the benefit really comes from usage.''
 Despite the fact that home values usually appreciate over time, most of the value of a house actually comes from the ability to use it. In this way, it is more like a car, albeit one that does not become less valuable over time, than it is like a stock. Whenever people sell one house, they must immediately pay to live elsewhere, meaning that they can never wholly cash out of a home's value. 
 Including the value of living in a house -- that is, the rent that a family would have to pay to live in an equivalent house elsewhere -- homes in New York have returned more than 15 percent a year since 1980, according to an analysis by Mr. Lys. 
 But only five percentage points of this return comes from sheer price appreciation, as opposed to the value of shelter. Mr. Lys accounted for property taxes, spending on renovations, interest payments and the tax deductions on those payments, and the fact that most house purchases are made with mortgages.
 When the sale of a house brings in a cash windfall, homeowners tend to focus on the fact that they made a down payment that was just a fraction of their house's value, lifting their return. But many forget just how much money they spent on property taxes, a new roof and the mortgage interest.
 Add to all these factors the corrosive effect of inflation, and the returns are even lower. 
 The Jacobses -- she is an administrator for a magazine and he a lawyer -- were quite pleased with the sale of their house in New Jersey. To them, it was a place to raise their two children more than it was an investment.
 When the couple spent about $100,000 to redo their master bathroom, install a walk-in closet and build a deck in the mid-1980's, Mr. Jacobs recalled saying to his wife, ''We'll never get the money out that we put into this, but at least we'll enjoy it for 15 years or so.''
 Told of the comparative returns on his house and the stock market, Mr. Jacobs said, ''Of course I couldn't live in the portfolio.''
 Today, however, he has come to see the advantages of the stock market. The Jacobses now rent an apartment on the Upper West Side for more than $4,000 a month and have invested the proceeds from the house sale in the stock market, making it easier for them to raise cash by selling shares. 
 ''I didn't want to take the money that we pulled out of the house and have all that money tied up in an apartment where I still have expenses of maintenance fees,'' Mr. Jacobs said.
 But many people seem to be going in the opposite direction from the Jacobses. Eighty percent of Americans deemed real estate a safer investment than stocks in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll done this spring, while only 13 percent said stocks were safer.
 Part of that sentiment is driven by the recent memory of the stock market collapse in 2000. Many homeowners seem to have forgotten that less than 15 years ago house prices in the Northeast and California fell, but the money they lost on technology stocks is still fresh in their minds. 
 Stocks are also more volatile, and their price changes can be viewed every day. ''The news doesn't report to you daily that your house price might have gone up or down,'' Mr. Lys said. ''So you think your house price is more stable than it really is because you don't observe these minute-by-minute gyrations.''
 Economists caution that any comparison between real estate and stocks is tricky, because real estate is typically a leveraged investment, in which a home buyer makes a down payment equal to only a fraction of a house's value and borrows to finance the rest. While it is possible to borrow money from a brokerage firm to buy stocks, most individual investors simply buy the shares outright.
 When home prices are rising, the leverage from a mortgage lifts real estate returns in the short term. Someone putting down $100,000 to buy a $500,000 home can feel as if the investment doubled when told that the house is now worth $600,000. 
 But the power of leverage vanishes as homeowners pay off the mortgage, as the Jacobses have. Leverage also creates more short-term risk, especially for those who have stretched to afford their house.
 ''If the home went down by 30 percent, you'd probably be sitting with a bankruptcy attorney,'' said Jonathan Golub, United States equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in New York. ''If your I.B.M. stock goes down by 30 percent, no big deal. So you had $100,000, now you have $70,000. You don't declare bankruptcy; you just don't go out to the movies as much, or you retire a year later.''
 But such risks are hard to imagine when many markets are still enjoying double-digit percentage increases every year. The number of people buying houses they do not plan to live in has surged. There are also Internet exchanges where investors can trade yet-to-be-built condominiums or futures contracts tied to average home prices in big metropolitan areas. 
 But economists and investment advisers say that most of the value from real estate comes not from anything that can be captured by flipping it, but from the safety net it provides in bad times. Even if the market shifts downward, ''you have a roof over your head,'' said Jonathan Miller, a real estate appraiser in Manhattan.
 Beyond the shelter it provides, the biggest advantage of real estate might be that it protects people from their worst investment instincts. Most people do not sell their house out of frustration after a few months of declining values, as they might with a stock. Instead, they are almost forced to be long-run investors who do not try to time the market.
 Harlan Larson, a retired manager of car dealerships near Minneapolis, still regrets having bought Northwest Airlines stock at $25 a share a few years ago. It is now trading at less than $5.
 By comparison, he views the four-bedroom home he bought for $32,500 in 1965 -- or about $200,000 in today's dollars -- as a money tree. He and his wife recently listed it for $413,000. That would translate into an annual return of 1.2 percent, taking into account inflation and the cost of two new decks and an extra room.
 They plan to move to Texas after it has sold. ''I wish I'd bought more real estate,'' Mr. Larson said.

HEADLINE: Shares Flat Amid Concern About Oil and Retail Sales 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks closed yesterday with minimal change as further warnings of slower spending at retailers persuaded investors that high crude oil prices were taking a toll on the economy.
 The specialty retailer Limited Brands joined other merchants in warning Wall Street of slowing sales, sending its shares down. Other decliners included Google, which said it would issue additional shares. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.22 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,219.02. The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.07 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,136.08.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 4.22 points, or 0.04 percent, to 10,554.93. The bulk of its gain came from one stock, the Altria Group, which surged 3.7 percent after investors received word of a potentially favorable legal development that might bear on tobacco litigation.
 The number of shares declining in value exceeded the number advancing by a ratio of almost 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.
 Crude oil for September delivery ended the day up 2 cents at $63.27. That was well off its Friday close of $66.86, but up more than $20 from the start of the year.
 Analysts said this week's easing in oil prices was not enough to offset the concerns raised Tuesday when Wal-Mart Stores warned that rising gasoline prices would hurt its earnings.
 Mark P. Bronzo, managing director of Gartmore Separate Accounts, of Irvington, N.Y., said: ''The market is very fixated on oil because of Wal-Mart's comments. Everybody is worried about the consumer.''
 Consumer spending accounts for the majority of economic activity in the United States. In addition to Limited's warning of a slowdown, Hot Topic, a retailer of teenage fashions, cut its earnings outlook. Shares of Limited slid $1.17, or 5 percent, to $22.11, making it one of the biggest percentage decliners on the S.&P. 500. Hot Topic fell $1.67, or 10.6 percent, to $14.14, on the Nasdaq.
 Shares of McDonald's declined 48 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $33.39.
 On the Nasdaq, shares of Google fell $5.11, or 1.8 percent, to $279.99 after the company said it would issue up to another 14.8 million shares.
 Shares of Altria rose $2.53, to $70.39, after a court decision that investors thought augured well for the tobacco company. The Illinois Supreme Court threw out a verdict against State Farm Insurance, which investors thought would give some clues to how the court would rule on an appeal of a $10.1 billion judgment against Altria, which makes Marlboro cigarettes. Legal liabilities are a major concern for tobacco makers.
 Shares of the drug maker Myogen rose 60 percent, to $21.67, after it reported positive results in trials of a drug to treat high blood pressure. 
 The 10-year Treasury note rose 17/32, to 100 12/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.20 percent, from 4.27 percent Wednesday.

HEADLINE: A New Arms Race to Build the World's Mightiest Computer

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
A global race is under way to reach the next milestone in supercomputer performance, many times the speed of today's most powerful machines.
 And beyond the customary rivalry in the field between the United States and Japan, there is a new entrant -- China -- eager to showcase its arrival as an economic powerhouse.
The new supercomputers will not be in use until the end of the decade at the earliest, but they are increasingly being viewed as crucial investments for progress in science, advanced technologies and national security.
 Once the exclusive territory of nuclear weapons designers and code breakers, ultrafast computers are increasingly being used in everyday product design. Procter & Gamble used a supercomputer to study the airflow over its Pringles potato chips to help stop them from fluttering off the company's assembly lines. 
 Today, driven by advances in so-called parallel computing -- with software making it possible to lash together arrays of tens or even hundreds of thousands of processor chips -- the speed of future supercomputers is limited only by cost, adequate electricity and the ability to cool the systems, which now sprawl over thousands of square feet.
 China now has 19 supercomputers ranked among the 500 fastest machines, and recent reports in Chinese newspapers stressed the importance of developing high-performance computing technology not dependent on the United States.
 ''It's becoming an issue of national pride,'' said Steve Wallach, a supercomputer designer who is a vice president at Chiaro Networks, a technology provider for high-performance computing. ''That's where the Japanese are coming from, and now the Chinese want to be viewed as a Tier 1 country in every respect.''
 Indeed, in recent weeks there have been reports that both the Japanese and Chinese are planning new investments in breaking the petaflop computing barrier. A petaflop is a measure of computing performance that describes the ability to perform 1,000 trillion mathematical operations a second, roughly eight times the speed of today's fastest computer.
 ''Everyone appears to be in the race for a petaflop,'' said Jack Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who maintains a list of the world's fastest computers. 
 Currently the world's fastest computer is a machine installed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory late last year -- and still growing -- that has reached more than 136 trillion operations a second, or 100,000 times the speed of a fast desktop personal computer. I.B.M. built the machine, Blue Gene/L, and plans to double its speed before the end of the year.
 Only small amounts of research funds have been spent so far on designing a petaflop supercomputer, an accomplishment that Japanese and American experts believe will cost nearly $1 billion for each machine to achieve. But 10 companies have indicated that they are doing preliminary work, Mr. Dongarra said. 
 In the United States, Cray, I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems have begun work toward reaching a petaflop by the end of the decade, supported by a development project financed by the Pentagon.
 The project, the High Productivity Computer Systems program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, was begun in 2003 with about $150 million as one of a series of American responses to the emergence of a Japanese supercomputer -- the Earth Simulator, intended for climate research -- as the world's fastest in 2002, displacing the United States for the first time.
 With significant financial support from the government, I.B.M., Cray and Silicon Graphics all built new massively parallel supercomputers, enabling the United States to recapture world leadership in November 2004. In the most recent ranking of the world's 500 fastest computers, released in June, the United States holds the top three positions. The Earth Simulator has fallen to fourth place, with about a quarter the computing speed of the new leader.
 Some executives say they believe the United States is well positioned to remain dominant in computing technologies. ''There is a lot less angst in the U.S. than there was previously,'' said David Turek, vice president for high-performance computing at I.B.M. ''We're not asleep at the switch.''
 But the fastest American machines are used primarily for military applications at the nation's weapons laboratories. Many scientists and technology executives in the United States are concerned about losing out in crucial markets like oil and gas exploration, automobile design and manufacturing unless they, too, have access to the fastest supercomputers. They contend that a public-private partnership is needed to develop supercomputers whose applications are not limited to the military. 
 Not all supercomputer experts are convinced that having the world's fastest computer is essential to American competitiveness.
 ''I.B.M. and Cray are doing a good job of ensuring that the U.S. remains competitive in the high-performance computing market,'' said C. Gordon Bell, a Microsoft researcher and a former supercomputer designer. Because the very largest computers are so difficult to program, their impact in the short term is relatively limited, he added.
 But in April, the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association reported that the Earth Simulator had been used by automotive engineers to greatly increase the speed and resolution of car-crash simulations, potentially offering a significant reduction in development time for new car models.
 That has alarmed some American executives, who argue that high-performance computing is now decisive in industrial competitiveness.
 ''This is a subtle but important change in the competitiveness game,'' said Suzy Tichenor, vice president for high-performance computing projects at the Council on Competitiveness in Washington.
 Last month in China, Lenovo Group, which acquired I.B.M.'s personal computer business last year, said it would join in a Chinese effort to build a petaflop machine by 2010 as part of a five-year government plan to advance the country's computer technology. Separately, two other Chinese companies, Dawning and Galactic Computing, have indicated they intend to develop petaflop-scale systems.
 A French military program, led by the French computer maker Bull, has plans to reach a petaflop in 2013.
 And already there is discussion of frontiers beyond a petaflop. Several Japanese newspapers have reported in the last month that the Japanese government is expected to announce a commitment to developing a 10-petaflop supercomputer as a follow-up to the Earth Simulator.
 Separately, the Japanese computer maker Fujitsu said last month that it planned a three-petaflop computer, and the director of the Earth Simulator told Nature magazine last week that he was planning an inexpensive modification to that machine to give it power equivalent to a 16-petaflop conventional computer. 
 The system will employ two computers, one for rough calculations and another for more precise computing, providing more efficiency than today's massively parallel machines.
 While the United States has regained the lead in supercomputing achievement, its researchers have benefited unevenly. The armed forces and intelligence agencies have traditionally commanded the very largest computing systems here, for example, while other countries have devoted their speediest computers to other efforts, notably research on climate change.
 ''These machines can be used to answer questions that literally will mean the life or death of humanity,'' said Peter A. Freeman, assistant director for computer and information sciences and engineering for the National Science Foundation. ''Currently the data the United States has at its disposal is not as good as what the Japanese have. It's a national strategy question.''

'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schreiber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'LENNON' In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). The Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE DEAR BOY' An uptight English teacher learns to cut loose, at least a bit, when he's confronted with an unflattering portrait written by a gifted but troubled student. Capably acted, but lacking in real substance (1:40). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty at Dodger Stages is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)

'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'IVANOV' Jonathan Bank's staging of the Chekhov classic ''Ivanov'' with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of that of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jonathan Kalb)

'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Stevens)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

'OEDIPUS AT PALM SPRINGS' The hand of fate reaches all the way into a steaming hot tub filled with cranky women in this seriocomic lesbian soap opera from the Five Lesbian Brothers. A richly funny Sapphic sex comedy, it is also a serious inquiry into the unforeseen extremities of despair that can attend the search for a lasting love (1:30). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)460-5475. (Isherwood)

'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them, and on the catchy music. Unfortunately the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters despite the actors' best attempts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)

'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint in Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful and funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful emotional crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'DEAR DUBYA: PATRIOTIC LOVE LETTERS TO WHITEHOUSE.ORG' Peevish, pathetic and plain unhinged, the e-mail messages rendered reader's-theater-style in this brief, seldom cheap, often funny show demonstrate that President Bush has no shortage of credulous, humor-impaired fans and foes (45 minutes). Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 907-6189. (Rob Kendt)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)

'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'BROTHER' Nothing is quite what it seems at first in ''Brother,'' Lisa Ebersole's confrontational one-act play about a pair of sisters who taunt each other, and a black man who suddenly joins them in the middle of the night in an East Village apartment. The audience is uncomfortably close to the action in this theater-in-the-round production, which starts with an ambiguous tension that quickly escalates (55 minutes). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger)

'THE PERSIANS' Though he fought with the victorious Greeks, Aeschylus wrote the tragedy of ''The Persians'' entirely from the perspective of the vanquished. This imaginative musical production by a young company called Waterwell extends that act of empathy, while also managing to be wildly funny and entertaining (1:15). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Miriam Horn)

'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)

'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Manohla Dargis)

'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the early 1970's, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)

'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)

'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)

* 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers -- including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange -- and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)

'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)

'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)

'CENTURY OF THE SELF' (No rating, four hours, shown in two parts) ''The Century of the Self,'' a four-part series produced for BBC television that is being shown in theaters in two separate two-hour segments, explores how Sigmund Freud's seminal theory of the subconscious has been successfully deployed over the past century as an instrument of consumer manipulation and social control. ''The Century of the Self'' is an unusually cerebral filmed essay that demands focus and patience from its audience as it sets about unearthing a secret history of the 20th century. (Dana Stevens)

'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)

'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renee Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)

'THE CONFORMIST' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Italian) Bertolucci's 1970's look at the soul man under Fascism returns to take us back not only to the Mussolini years, but also, more dramatically, to the time of its own making, a cinematic era of stylistic daring and aesthetic bravura. (Scott)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

'DARK WATER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Make that dark, stagnant water.(Dargis)

'THE DUKES OF HAZZARD' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Yeee-haw? Naw. (Scott)

'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)

'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Holden)

'THE GOEBBELS EXPERIMENT' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English and German) Lutz Hachmeister and Michael Kloft's fascinating documentary provides a chilling glimpse inside the brilliant but toxic mind of Joseph Goebbels via his extensive diaries. Careening from soggy sentimentality to maniacal extermination fantasies, the entries reveal a supremely theatrical man whose manipulation of mass political opinion was unprecedented. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'THE GREAT RAID' (R, 132 minutes) This tedious World War II movie which re-enacts a real-life heroic rescue of American prisoners from a Japanese camp in the Philippines, slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand. (Holden)

'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)

'HAPPY ENDINGS' (R, 130 minutes) An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, Don Roos's slyly subversive new movie is a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, and a road map to the way we live now. With Lisa Kudrow and the sublime Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Dargis)

'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)

'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)

'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is, in many ways, less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation, and how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)

'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)

'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)

'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)

'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up, but refuses to address. (Holden)

'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)

'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)

*'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)

'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)

'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)

'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring. (Scott)

'SAINT RALPH' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This story of a 14-year-old Canadian schoolboy in the early 1950's who believes in miracles is pure treacle. (Holden)

'SARABAND' (R, 107 minutes, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden)

*'SECUESTRO EXPRESS' (R, 86 minutes, in Spanish) ''Secuestro Express'' is a relentless assault on the senses about a trio of hoodlums who kidnap an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul Leroux), who then must face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the ransom money's arrival. This perfectly cast film is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief; it also raises awareness of frightening real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in Caracas, Venezuela. (Laura Kern)

'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question, ''Is there life after high school?,'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)

'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

'STEALTH' (PG-13, 117 minutes) A preposterous hash of ''Top Gun'' and ''Behind Enemy Lines,'' topped with a soupcon of ''2001,'' this crypto-video game about three stealth pilots has the makings of a kitsch classic; too bad it's not remotely funny. (Dargis)

'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) A delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, this film is about a lonely man who at 37 awakens to life for the first time during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)

'2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)

' WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)

'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

AKRON/FAMILY, DAVID GRUBBS, WOODEN WAND AND THE VANISHING VOICE (Tomorrow) The East River Music Project's final summer show features Akron/Family, a quartet that explores the crannies and latent explosiveness of Americana. The experimental guitarist David Grubbs is in a jazz-folk mood as of late. Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice warp various genres. 2 p.m., East River Amphitheater, East River Park, Lower East Side, free. (Laura Sinagra)

ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND (Tuesday) The archetypal Southern rock band is still on the road. Gregg Allman, the band's keyboardist and main singer, is more than ever the band's center, since its co-founder Dickey Betts is estranged from the band. His replacement, Warren Haynes, shares the twin-guitar passages with Derek Trucks, the drummer Butch Trucks's nephew and a jam-band leader in his own right. 6:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $65. (Sinagra)

TORI AMOS (Tonight) This piano-grinding sensualist spent the 1990's rendering stormy emotional experience via alt-rock drama. Her songs were pounded out on a well-worn Bosendorfer piano and sung in a shamanic, childlike voice. Lately, she's been seeking strong female archetypes in biblical lore and reflecting on the nuances of married sexuality. 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $50. (Sinagra)

AMSTERJAM: RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, SNOOP DOGG, 311, GARBAGE, FAT JOE, WYCLEF JEAN (Tomorrow) This random collection of faded alt-rockers and tenaciously popular rap acts includes the resurging Snoop Dogg, who does his stoner-for-all-seasons rap thing, and Fat Joe (aka Joey Crack), whose rump-shaking hit ''Get it Poppin'' is tasty New York radio candy. The funk-punk Chili Peppers, the enduring vixen Shirley Manson's Garbage, and slick ska-metal 311 forge on with alt-rock willfulness. The outspoken Caribbean folk-rapper Wyclef Jean will probably opine on Haiti's ongoing crises. 11 a.m., Randalls Island Golf Center, 1 Randalls Island, (212)427-5689, $45. (Sinagra)

APSCI (Monday) This Brooklyn-based husband-and-wife duo, whose band name is short for ''applied science,'' serves up beats that slide from synth-electro to glitch electronica. Raphael LaMotta raps with blase indie savvy while Dana Diaz-Tutaan adds jazzy filigree. 8 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)420-1466, $7. (Sinagra)

JOAN ARMATRADING (Thursday) With her deep, longing voice and songs about love and affection, Joan Armatrading was a beacon for songwriters in the 1970's and 1980's. Raul Midon opens. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 749-5838, $39 to $49. (Jon Pareles)

DICKEY BETTS & GREAT SOUTHERN (Tonight) Kicked out of a band that he founded, the Allman Brothers, the guitarist Dickey Betts wasted no time in going back on tour with his own group. His chiming, symmetrical guitar solos and the weary but amiable voice from songs like ''Blue Skies'' are intact, and he may even have something to prove. 8 and 10 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $35. (Pareles)

ERIC BURDON AND THE ANIMALS (Sunday) Eric Burdon translated American soul into British Invasion rock as the belter who led the Animals; then he came to the source, joining forces with an up-and-coming American band, War. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $27, $30 at the door. (Pareles)

EDMAR CASTANEDA (Tonight) The Colombian harp was not often heard in a jazz context until the teenage prodigy Edmar Castaneda began nudging its limits in the mid-90's. 8 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $15. (Sinagra)

RODNEY CROWELL (Tuesday) He has written songs for Emmylou Harris, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, the Oak Ridge Boys, Bob Seger, Tim McGraw, Lee Ann Womack and his ex-wife, Rosanne Cash. His own recent work tends toward raw, straightforward rockabilly. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $20. (Sinagra)

NEIL DIAMOND (Tonight and tomorrow) After four decades, during which his folk-rock evolved into high-gloss Vegas pop, this singer-songwriter has recently been working with the rock-and-rap producer Rick Rubin, who famously helped Johnny Cash garner an alt-rock audience in the 90's. Spare new songs reportedly rely on acoustic guitar and aim for a lonesome vibe. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212) 465-6741, $70 to $100. (Sinagra)

THE DOUBLE (Wednesday) Like the Fiery Furnaces, this Brooklyn band ornaments its songs with kaleidoscopic experimentation. Former math-rockers, they've seemingly gone through a Brian Wilson phase, and now use all the tools at their lo-fi disposal in service of arty pop undercut with burbles, dark surges and twinges. 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Lower Manhattan, free. (Sinagra)

50 CENT, LUDACRIS, LIL JON, MIKE JONES, CIARA (Tonight and tomorrow) Soon to have his life story captured on film, the multi-platinum rapper 50 Cent is joined here by the Southern rappers Ludacris and Lil Jon. Mike Jones gives cough-syrup haze an enticing menace, while Ciara rides molasses beats smoothly enough. Tonight at 7, Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $30 to $61. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $30 to $61. (Sinagra)

JULIANA HATFIELD (Tonight) Ms. Hatfield's voice, that of a weary but urgent ingenue, added charm to the music of the Blake Babies in the 80's and her own solo projects in the 90's. This singer-songwriter's mainstream profile dimmed, but she continues to release albums with a low-key, confessional spark. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505, $16 in advance, $18. (Sinagra)

HOCKEY NIGHT (Tonight and tomorrow) This hard-riffing band from St. Paul plays jaunty noise pop with a fierce beat, courtesy of its two drummers. The singer Paul Sprangers has a dry delivery reminiscent of Pavement's Stephen Malkmus. Tonight at 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, at Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, free. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Sinagra)

CHRIS ISAAK (Tomorrow) Chris Isaak is a disciple of Roy Orbison, writing dolorous ballads that find their only consolation in his honeyed voice and finely turned guitar lines. On stage, he's a droll storyteller. 8 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $47. (Pareles)

ISLAJA, LAU NAU, KUUPUU, PEKKO KAPPI (Thursday) Representing a panoply of sounds from the band-hopping musicians who make up the Finnish psychedelic-folk scene, this bill promises ethereal spookiness from the icy Islaja, accomplished jouhikko fiddle from Pekko Kappi, a weave of vocal textures and acoustic drone from Kuupuu and more vocal experimentation from Lau Nau. 8 p.m., Tommy's Tavern, 1041 Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)383-9699, $5. (Sinagra)

I-WAYNE (Tuesday) Last year, the 25-year-old Jamaican singer Clifford Taylor's jumpy ''Can't Satisfy Her,'' a smooth though insulting lament about a woman who won't retire from hooking, was one of the few roots-reggae songs spinning on Hot 97. In a high voice reminiscent of 60's pop crooners, Mr. Taylor (known as I-Wayne) avoids revolution slogans, calling instead for a kind of pastoral movement. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $15. (Sinagra)

SLEEPY LABEEF (Sunday) Sleepy LaBeef is an unregenerate rockabilly singer and guitarist from Arkansas. He reels off one twangy tune after another, known and obscure, like a rockabilly jukebox come to life. 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, (212)683-6500, free. (Pareles)

LEZ ZEPPELIN (Tomorrow) Strapping on the double-necked Gibson with attitude to burn, this all-girl quartet pays tribute to its swaggering namesake Led Zeppelin, ripping through the catalog with blazing accuracy. Of course, they also have their gender-bending way with macho metaphors about squeezed lemons and dripping honey. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $17 in advance, $20. (Sinagra)

LIVING COLOUR (Tonight) The virtuoso guitarist and Black Rock Coalition co-founder Vernon Reid's most famous band's intelligent and at times groovy heavy metal took the group well beyond the small bar scene in the late-80's. They return to play snug CBGB's in this legendary dive's hour of need. 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, East Village, (212)982-4052, $35. (Sinagra)

MAGNOLIA ELECTRIC CO. (Tonight) The songwriter Jason Molina is a pessimist, and the music on his latest album of melancholy but gritty Chicago country-rock, ''What Comes After the Blues'' (Secretly Canadian), resembles that of a defeatist Neil Young. 11:30 p.m., Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $10 in advance, $12.(Sinagra)

JESSE MALIN (Thursday) Jesse Malin led D Generation, the glam-rock kings of St. Mark's Place, and has gone on to a solo career that's considerably more earnest. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Pareles)

MEGADETH, DREAM THEATER (Tuesday) The Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine appeared recently in Metallica's ''Some Kind of Monster'' documentary, confessing lingering pain at his 1983 ejection from that band. His own precision thrash outfit was successful through the 90's despite grunge competition. An injury has silenced his speedy licks, but bandmates fill in on this tour with the metal technicians Dream Theater. 5 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $45. (Sinagra)

PALOMAR (Thursday) This local indie-pop quartet plays winsome songs that harken back to the 90's heyday of female-fronted guitar bands whose modest ambitions made them all the more likeable. With the Mosquitos. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $12. (Sinagra)

AMY RIGBY (Tuesday) This singer-songwriter sings about romance and decline with biting wit. She gave Nashville a try, but she's back home in New York, where her brand of real-life feistiness has always found a better fit. 9 p.m., Lakeside Lounge, 162 Avenue B, Lower East Side, (212)529-8463, free. (Sinagra)

THE RUB (Tomorrow) Continuing its hip mix of favela funk, reggaeton, dancehall, alt-rock, hip-hop, classic rock and pretty much anything else these sound-crazed smart-aleck D.J.'s can think of, this Brooklyn party celebrates its third anniversary. The point is to get the crowd chuckling and dancing at once. And it works. 11 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236, $8. (Sinagra)

CHARLIE SEXTON (Tonight and Monday) This guitar prodigy made his first record at the age of 16, when he was hailed as a sort of new-wave roots rocker. Since then he's played with Bob Dylan and produced for Lucinda Williams, and this year prepares to tour with John Mayer. His own songs increasingly tend toward personal alt-country. Tonight at 7:30, Housing Works Used Book Cafe, 126 Crosby Street, SoHo, (212)334-3324, $25. Monday at 7 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)

SYSTEM OF A DOWN (Tuesday) Combining crushing heaviness with extreme-sports dexterity allows this Armenian-American band to smuggle blatant antiwar messages past some of its more mainstream fans. 7 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900, $33 to $45. (Sinagra)

THE VANDALS (Tomorrow) Founded in 1980, this jokey punk-pop band, from Orange County, California, contributed to the bratty sound of younger bands like the Offspring and Blink-182. Tomorrow they play a benefit for CBGB. 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $25. (Sinagra)

TIERNEY SUTTON (Wednesday through next Saturday) Ms. Sutton's clear, sweetly sonorous voice isn't inherently a jazz timbre, but she is irrefutably a jazz singer; her fine new album, ''I'm With the Band'' (Telarc), was recorded at Birdland this spring, which makes this a return engagement. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

HENRY THREADGILL'S 3+3 (Sunday) Mr. Threadgill, the multi-reedist and composer, has been a restless avatar of creative music since the 1970's; here he offers the premiere of a work characteristically obsessed with texture and scored for reeds, three cellos, tuba and drums. 8 p.m., Museum of Modern Art, 14 West 54th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, (212)708-9491. Admission is free, but tickets are required, and will be distributed at 5:30 p.m. on a first-come, first-served basis. (Chinen)

JAMES (BLOOD) ULMER (Monday) As on the recent album ''Birthright'' (Hyena), Mr. Ulmer delivers a startlingly personal take on the blues, armed only with his warbling baritone and his apocalyptically groovy electric guitar. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)

CEDAR WALTON QUINTET (Through Sunday) As a pianist and composer, Mr. Walton heeds an articulate, almost courtly variety of hard-bop; he's at his best when his forms spark solos from collaborators like the saxophonist Vincent Herring. 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11 p.m. set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212)258-9595; cover: $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.(Chinen)

 Opera

'AFTERNOON ARIAS' (Today) A new summer series of free concerts features opera arias, with piano, performed by singers from the New York City Opera in the somewhat bucolic if not acoustically ideal surroundings of Bryant Park. Today's program consists of excerpts from ''La Boheme'' and ''Don Giovanni,'' with house singers including Inna Dukach, Georgia Jarman and Michael Corvino. 12:30 p.m., Bryant Park, Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street, (212)870-7787. (Anne Midgette)

GLIMMERGLASS (Tonight through Tuesday) Is it a leading opera company or an experimental theater, a proving ground for young artists or a showcase for stars? Glimmerglass aspires to be all these things with a summer season -- now in its final week -- that ranges from an austere production of Benjamin Britten's valedictory ''Death in Venice'' to ''Lucie de Lammermoor,'' a French-language version of Donizetti's classic that verges, inadvertently, on comic relief. But through ups and downs there's a lot to like: take the American tenor William Burden, incandescent in the Britten as the writer Gustav von Aschenbach. Also on the summer program are Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and an unusual double bill consisting of ''Portrait de Manon,'' Jules Massenet's one-act sequel to his most famous opera, paired with Poulenc's one-acter ''La Voix Humaine,'' which depicts a woman on the phone. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m. (''Venice''); tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Monday at 2 p.m. (''Cosi''); tomorrow night at 8 (''Portrait''/''Voix''); Tuesday at 2 p.m. (''Lucie''), Alice Busch Opera Theater, Route 80, eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607)547-2255, some tickets available tonight and tomorrow night for $31.50 to $55, otherwise sold out. (Midgette)

Classical Music

BARD MUSIC FESTIVAL (Today through Sunday) This festival chooses a single composer each year and places that artist in a rich cultural context through concerts, lectures and panel discussions. This summer's theme is ''Copland and His World,'' and the second weekend of programming begins today (at 10 a.m.) with a series of documentaries as well as a symposium titled ''Mid-20th-Century American Culture and Politics.'' Tonight's concert (at 8) is called ''South of the Border,'' and features music by Copland, Nancarrow, Revueltas, Ginastera and others. Programming continues through late Sunday afternoon, when Leon Botstein will lead the American Symphony Orchestra (at 5 p.m.) in ''The Triumph of the American Symphonic Tradition,'' with more Copland as well as music by Roger Sessions, Walter Piston, Roy Harris and others. Details at www.bard.edu/bmf. Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900; $25 to $55, with discounts for students and 65+. (Jeremy Eichler)

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Thursday) There are few cozier places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall (a former coffee barge) on the Brooklyn side of the East River. The range of music is typically broad: tonight, an ensemble that includes Rupert Boyd, a guitarist; Hector Del Curto, a bandoneon player; and Katya Mihailova, a pianist, play an eclectic program of works by Tchaikovsky, Mozart and Piazzolla. Tomorrow and Sunday, Alexander Fiterstein, a clarinetist, will take the spotlight for the Mozart and Weber clarinet quintets, and on Thursday, the pianist Jeffrey Swann performs and discusses works and transcriptions by Liszt. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083, $35; $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday; $40 tomorrow and Sunday. (Allan Kozinn)

BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight and tomorrow) The festival's 22nd season comes to a close this weekend with two blockbuster works that don't often share the same program: Schubert's Cello Quintet and Mendelssohn's Octet. With veteran performers drawn from ensembles like the Tokyo and Orion Quartets as well as the Eroica Trio, one can hope for some major summer fireworks. Tonight at 7:30, St. Andrew's Dune Church, Southampton, N.Y.; tomorrow at 6:30 p.m., Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church, Bridgehampton, N.Y., (631)537-6368, $35; $30 for 65+. (Eichler)

MAVERICK CONCERTS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This concert series near Woodstock, N.Y., in its 90th season, offers its performances in an open-backed barn that allows the sounds of nature to mingle with the music. Tomorrow afternoon the pianist Steven Lubin plays a program of Romantic music -- Sonatas by Beethoven (the ''Moonlight''), Schumann and Schubert, along with Chopin's B flat minor Scherzo. On Sunday, the Borromeo String Quartet plays works by Grieg, Faure and Brahms, with the pianist Pedja Muzijevic. Tomorrow night at 6, Sunday at 3 p.m., Maverick Concert Hall, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., (845)679-8217, $20, $5 for students. (Kozinn)

MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL (Tonight through Thursday) Since becoming music director of the Minnesota Orchestra in 2003, the dynamic Finnish conductor Osmo Vanska has been a remarkable success. Minnesotans seem to love him. Mr. Vanska comes to New York this weekend to conduct two performances with the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra. The fine pianist Stephen Hough will be the soloist in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 in A. But it's Schubert's daunting Symphony No. 9 in C (''Great'') that should really be a showcase for Mr. Vanska's talents. On Tuesday and Wednesday nights Thomas Dausgaard takes over the podium for a program that includes Beethoven's ''Pastorale'' Symphony and Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 4 in D. The soloist in the concerto, the brilliant violinist Gil Shaham, will also appear with his sister, the pianist Orli Shaham, in an hourlong all-Mozart program at the intimate Kaplan Penthouse after Wednesday's orchestra concert. This late-night series, ''A Little Night Music,'' has proved popular. And why not? You sit at round tables with a free glass of wine and enjoy the music while taking in city views. Thursday night brings the United States debut of the Russian Patriarchate Choir, an all-male ensemble specializing in Russian liturgical chant and 19th-century repertory. Russian sacred music at the Mostly Mozart Festival? How this fits into the festival's theme of traveling with Mozart is unclear. ''Mozart in Russia'' doesn't do. Still, the featured composer on the program, Dmitry Stepanovich Bortnyansky, born five years before Mozart, presented works like Mozart's Requiem at the Russian imperial court and his music has Mozartean qualities. O.K., it's a stretch. But the concert should be fascinating. Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall (festival orchestra); Wednesday at 10:30 p.m., Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, 10th floor (''A Little Night Music''); Thursday at 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall (Russian Patriarchate Choir), (212)721-6500, $32 to $52; $30 for ''A Little Night Music.'' (Anthony Tommasini)

MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Offering a smattering of choral music and jazz, but focusing on string quartets, this venerable festival presents the Arianna Quartet this weekend in a program of Mozart, Beethoven and the Dvorak Piano Quintet, for which they're joined by the pianist Anton Nel. Also on offer this weekend is a jazz ensemble called Big Easy Rhythm, specializing in early jazz. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 3, Gordon Hall at Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860)824-7126, $25; $12 for students under 24. (Midgette)

NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) Each summer the Yale Summer School of Music retreats north to this lovely spot, and the public reaps much of the benefit at concerts in the rustic Music Shed. But tomorrow the season ends, with a departure from the usual classical fare: a program by the fiddler Mark O'Connor's Appalachia Waltz Trio. 8 p.m., Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860)542-3000, $15 to $45; ages 18 to 25, $10; under 18, free with a paying adult. (James R. Oestreich)

'SERIAL UNDERGROUND' (Tonight through Sunday) The Composers Collaborative concludes its six-day festival of new music and theater. Tonight features music by Gerald Busby and Bob Windbiel. Tomorrow, Ed Schmidt and Jed Distler present ''The Gold Standard,'' described as a theater work about ''one helluva disgruntled piano player.'' Sunday's closing program includes a performance of Terry Riley's early Minimalist landmark, ''In C.'' 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212)663-1967, $20. (Eichler)

SKANEATELES FESTIVAL (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Since most other festivals are beginning to fold their tents, it may be time to dig out the map and do some exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles, N.Y., near Syracuse, this event plays host to the Turtle Island String Quartet tonight and, in combination with the Ying Quartet, tomorrow. Next week there are free master classes on Wednesday and another chamber concert on Thursday. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 8; tomorrow at Brook Farm, south on Route 41A; other events, First Presbyterian Church, 97 East Genesee Street, (315)685-7418; tonight and Thursday, $16 and $21, $13 for students and 65+; tomorrow, $18 and $24. (Oestreich)

TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) The conductor Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and the Boston Symphony Orchestra kick off the weekend tonight with a Russian program that includes Rachmaninoff's ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini,'' with Garrick Ohlsson as the piano soloist, and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade.'' And on Sunday afternoon, Peter Oundjian leads the Orchestra of St. Luke's in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24, with Peter Serkin playing the solo line, and the Beethoven ''Eroica'' Symphony. But certainly a major draw this weekend will be the Saturday evening Boston Symphony concert, led by Marin Alsop, the new music director designate of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Yo-Yo Ma will join Ms. Alsop for the Barber Cello Concerto at the heart of a program that begins with Christopher Rouse's ''Rapture'' and ends with the Tchaikovsky Fifth. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200, $17 (lawn) to $96. (Kozinn)

JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Aug. 28) Tonight through Sunday Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal will be at the larger Ted Shawn Theater and the Johannes Wieland will be at the Doris Duke Studio Theater. Wednesday through Aug. 28, Black Grace from New Zealand, a big hit last summer, moves into the Shawn, with Project Fukurow from Tokyo Thursday through Aug. 28 at the Duke.

Details of the week's free performances and exhibitions can be found on www.jacobspillow.org. Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass.; (413) 243-0745. (John Rockwell)

LINCOLN CENTER OUT-OF-DOORS (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) The week's dance attractions at this free, nicely relaxed festival begin on a very high note, with a performance by the Paul Taylor Dance Company (tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Damrosch Park Bandshell). Arthur Aviles and his Typical Theater troupe will salute disco dancing in the festival-commissioned ''Flow to the Groove'' (tomorrow at 5:45 p.m. on the plaza), followed by ''International Hip-Hop Exchange: The Underground Vanguard'' (Sunday at 7:30 p.m. at the bandshell) and a program shared by groups that include the companies of Ronald K. Brown, Jamel Gaines and Nathan Trice (Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. on the plaza). Another highlight is a program by the Stephen Petronio and Complexions companies (Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at the bandshell). Information: (212)875-5766 or www.lincolncenter.org. (Jennifer Dunning)

MOSTLY MOZART: MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Morris has been justly celebrated for his choices of and responses to a dizzying range of musical scores. The company will perform ''L'Allegro, Il Penseroso ed Il Moderato,'' a signature piece set to Handel. 8 p.m. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500 or www.lincolncenter.org, $25 to $70. (Dunning)

THE NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL FRINGE FESTIVAL (Through Aug. 28) Emily Dickinson, Lynndie England and Frida Kahlo are among the inspirations in this irrepressible festival's dance highlights. Those highlights include five programs of work with an emphasis on the theatrical, by Nina Hein and Elyssa Dole, Refraction Arts Project (Sonnet Blanton and Julia M. Smith), the brAdS company (Monica Bucciantini), Compagnie de l'Entorse (David G. Tretiakoff and Charlotte Schioler), and Anandam (Brandy Leary and Prashant Gupta).

(Dunning)

''TRADITIONS, INVENTIONS AND EXCHANGE'' (Through Sunday) This video and sound installation by Mollie Davies documents a decade-long exchange between dancers and cultural leaders about shifting artistic landscapes in Indonesia, Japan and the United States. 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, www.AsiaSociety.org. (Dunning)

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 28. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Smith)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)

MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,' through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400.(Michael Kimmelman)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. (See above.) (Johnson)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CEZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cezanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

THE NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HELION, through Oct. 9. Helion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II and presaged aspects of Pop Art and Neo-Expressionism. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or his weaknesses, but it is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)

NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality, but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)

NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Oct. 9. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)

STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 31. Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)

WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures -- not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook in which he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)

IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

'INTRODUCTIONS' Three one-person minishows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

'BODY AND OBJECTS' Depending on your mood, this three-person show might provoke thought or irritation. Most striking are Jiang Zhi's large photographs of two topless dancers, one a woman who has had a double mastectomy, the other a transsexual with breast implants. Tang Yi presents a series of photographs of a young woman blowing up colored balloons into a birdcage, and Chu Yun offers worn bars of soap as miniature sculptures formed by contact with his body. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)414-1169, through Sept. 2. (Johnson)

WILLIAM EGGLESTON 'THE NIGHTCLUB PORTRAITS' The photographer known for his jewel-like color photographs of scenes of Southern decrepitude made these powerfully lucid black-and-white portraits of customers in bars around Memphis in 1973. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Sept. 2 (Johnson)

JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of a store, but to round out a long, hot city summer, Mr. Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)

'MEDITATIVE' The mellow but disciplined vibes emanating from this group show are partly attributable to its theme: all the work was inspired by the artists' experiences of meditation. Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212)675-7772, through Sunday, and Sept. 6 to 17. (Cotter)

'ON VIEW: PHOTOGRAPHING THE MUSEUM' Among 20 well-selected ways of picturing the museum are Elliot Erwitt's view of a naked, sculptural Diana aiming her arrow at an unsuspecting live male visitor; wax figures by Hiroshi Sugimoto and Diane Arbus; a specimen drawer full of cardinals (birds, that is) by Terry Evans; and the dreamlike image of three real foxes in a formal period room by Karen Knorr. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)

BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20- inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)

'REMARKABLE HANDS' Three Japanese make art by hand: Yayoi Deki creates gently psychedelic floral patterns with a finely pointed brush; Yoko Kawamoto paints small, photo-based pictures of junked cars and industrial sites with a dry but sensuous touch; and Tomoo Gokita, using chameleonlike skill and mischievous humor, draws many different kinds of pop-culture imagery. ATM, 511 West 20th Street, (212)375-0349, through Aug. 26. (Johnson)

'SELF-PRESERVATION SOCIETY' A longtime hold-out finally moves to Chelsea and opens a sleek space with a lively show of gallery regulars. Basketball fans must see Tom Sanford's comic-realist painting of last season's infamous brawl between the Pacers and the Pistons. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, (212)334-9255, through Sept. 3. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson)

(Johnson)

'MASTERS OF CONTEMPORARY SCULPTURE' If you disregard the ugly and pretentious installation piece by the dean of Arte Povera, Mario Merz, then 50 glass snowballs by Not Vital, a circle of granite chunks by Richard Long, a sculpture of stairs painted in Burmese red lacquer by Wolfgang Laib, a life-size simulation of an airplane lavatory by Tom Sachs and a 51-minute piece of Bruce Nauman's nocturnal video of his studio all add up to an almost perfectly satisfying show. Sperone Westwater, 415 13th Street, (212)999-7337, through Aug. 31. (Johnson)

Last Chance

MET: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD' In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. (See above.) Closes Sunday. (Smith)

'BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD' This big, hot group show of the summer pays homage to Robert Smithson and casually retools countercultural languages of yesteryear for the 21st century. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-9300, closes today. (Cotter)

DAVID LEVINTHAL: 'XXX SEX DOLLS' Mr. Levinthal is known for his provocatively ironic photographs of war toys, racist kitsch and pornographic dolls. Here, along with faux-pornographic photographs, he presents 30 female miniatures from his collection; they are kitschy marvels of sexist fetishism. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)627-4819, closes today. (Johnson)

'CAPTURING A MOMENT-ITO' Highlights of this varied exhibition of works by nine Latino artists include Karina Aguilera Skvirsky's eerie video of vaguely menacing figures in Mideastern-style robes approaching in a peaceful park; portraits by Gabriel de la Mora, in which the apparently finely drawn lines are actually made of hair from the people depicted; Gino Rubert's Surrealistic paintings of dreamy erotic encounters; and Alfonso Cantu's drawings of people viewed through marbled glass. Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, (718)658-7400, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

GEERT GOIRIS, Among the most striking of the sumptuous and magical color photographs by this Belgian artist are pictures of an albino wallaby and of a mysterious explosion in a peaceful, parklike setting. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-7700, closes Tuesday. (Johnson)

GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM' With the goal of paring down sculpture to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's, creating the right containers. Experimenting with different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) Closing on Wednesday. (Glueck)

'WORDPLAY' Twenty-three artists toy with words and letters. The show includes comical, professional-looking signs by Steve Powers; sign letters arranged to spell ''Me'' in a photograph by Jack Pierson; a neon sign that says ''Just Wait,'' by Bill Rowe; an alphabet of letters made of little water puddles photographed by Abelardo Morell; and layered, hand-painted letters spelling the hidden phrase ''Weapons of Mass Destruction'' by Joe Amrhein. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)627-2410, closing today. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: A World Where Down Means Up

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
Bad news is good news for Marc Lasry, one of the largest investors in the debt of bankrupt companies.
 Yet the strong economy has not been cooperating, leaving bad news in short supply. Indeed, the number of bankrupt companies has been dwindling, as low interest rates make it easy for even weak businesses to obtain cheap financing. But Mr. Lasry and other like-minded investors are betting that their day is not too far off. 
 ''Distress is around the corner,'' said Mr. Lasry, a soft-spoken 45-year-old who oversees the Avenue Capital Group, which manages more than $7 billion invested in the United States, Europe and Asia.
 He ticks off the potential catalysts for trouble: rising interest rates and oil prices; a mounting federal deficit and a low dollar; and a real estate bubble ready to burst.
 Perhaps the biggest factor is the risk assumed by banks and others in lending to less established and highly indebted companies. Some 7 percent of all junk bonds issued last year were rated triple-C by Standard & Poor's, the highest percentage ever, according to Credit Suisse First Boston. This year, that percentage promises to be even higher.
 ''When I look at all that, my view is that logic will win out,'' Mr. Lasry said. He has just raised a $1.4 billion fund, focused on distressed debt of United States companies, although he has up to a year before he must start investing the cash.
 The question hanging over that bet is timing. When will boom turn to bust, leaving ripe pickings for Mr. Lasry and other so-called vulture investors? Mr. Lasry says he thinks corporate defaults will rise sharply over the next 12 months, although other investors say it could take longer.
 Corporate defaults dropped to just 0.44 percent of all outstanding junk bonds in the year ended in June, according to Credit Suisse First Boston. That is down from a peak of 15.4 percent in 2002.
 ''Now is not a good time to invest in distressed securities,'' said Barry Colvin, president of Tremont Capital, which allocates money to hedge funds, and has substantially reduced its allocation in the area. Still, Mr. Colvin said, Mr. Lasry has demonstrated good timing before.
 ''He is very opportunistic about investing,'' Mr. Colvin said
 After the Asian debt crisis of the late 1990's, Mr. Lasry quickly invested in the region, where he has since made millions. In 2004, an investment in the Thai Oil Company rose some 25 percent as energy prices soared. 
 Largely on the back of his gains in Asia, Mr. Lasry personally earned an estimated $125 million last year, according to a ranking of the best-paid hedge fund managers by Alpha, a trade publication.
 He now has a staff of 20 in Beijing and offices in six other Asian cities. Within the last year, Chinese banks have accelerated sales of their bad loans as the government has become more receptive to foreign investors, he said. With more than $500 billion of such loans on the banks' books, ''it's a massive opportunity,'' he said.
 Mr. Lasry also started a European vulture fund last year, largely to take advantage of new laws that will require banks in the region to increase their capital levels. The laws are prodding undercapitalized banks there to clean up their books, particularly in Germany, where banks are still weighed down with loans tied to the reconstruction of the former East Germany, he said. ''Banks are already starting to sell.''
 But closer to home, Mr. Lasry said, it has been slim pickings for vulture investors. 
 After making a bundle a few years ago by investing in the debt of large well-known companies like MCI, which emerged from bankruptcy in April 2004, Avenue's funds in the United States have lately turned to the debt of smaller businesses that still have a tough time raising capital. As an example, Mr. Lasry cites Rampage, a clothing company that had just $51 million in revenue last year.
 The combination of fewer corporate defaults and a rush of money into hedge funds specializing in bankruptcies has meant lower returns for Mr. Lasry and other investors. 
 Through July, one of Mr. Lasry's hedge funds focused on domestic debt is up just over 2 percent, slightly lagging a 2.88 percent return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, down from a return of about 9 percent for 2004 and 27 percent for 2003, according to a person briefed on the funds' results. (Returns for closed-end funds that he runs for institutions like the California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, have been slightly higher.)
 But once bankruptcies pick up, Mr. Lasry said he expected returns to rebound to around 20 percent. His investors are also optimistic.
 ''The distressed-debt market will crack sometime soon, and we want to be ready,'' said Panda Hershey, a portfolio manager with Calpers, which invests with Avenue.
 A native of Marrakesh, Morocco, Mr. Lasry has accumulated one of the largest pools of capital devoted to bankruptcy investing. And he has proved as nimble in his career moves as he has as an investor. A lawyer by training, he was an early investor in bankruptcies, managing a pool of capital for the billionaire Robert M. Bass in the late 1980's. 
 After making connections through his investor activities, Mr. Lasry saw an opportunity to set up a brokerage firm specializing in two obscure niches in which he had an edge -- bank debt and claims held by vendors and suppliers to bankrupt companies. 
 By the late 1990's, anticipating a surge in bankruptcies and a demand for funds specializing in the business, Mr. Lasry shifted his focus back to investing, setting up Avenue Capital. He was helped early on in his fund-raising by David Bonderman of the Texas Pacific Group, who had been his boss when he worked for Mr. Bass, who introduced Mr. Lasry to Calpers, among other investors.
 Today, Mr. Lasry and his sister, Sonia Gardner, also a lawyer by training, run a team of 150 employees on three continents. 
 He seems unperturbed by the stubbornly low rate of bankruptcies in the United States. ''Sooner or later, reality will prevail,'' he said. ''The cycle will turn, and we'll be ready.''

HEADLINE: More and More, Expert Witnesses Make the Difference

BYLINE: By Jonathan D. Glater

 BODY:
TRIAL lawyers may be the peacocks of the courtroom, strutting before a judge or jury and making arguments with a sense of drama and style, but often these days it's a tweedy professor, explaining some impossibly arcane subject in plain English, who may make the difference.
 Consider the six expert witnesses who testified in the legal war between the board of the Walt Disney Company and shareholders furious over the $140 million paid in severance to Michael S. Ovitz, who served as the company's president for 14 months.
 Chancellor William B. Chandler III described aspects of testimony and reports by the three plaintiffs' experts as of ''very little'' benefit, ''little value'' and ''unpersuasive'' respectively. Yet while one of the defendants' experts was ''troublesome,'' the other two were ''of significant value to the court'' and ''well supported by the evidence.'' 
 Last week the judge ruled that the Disney directors did not violate their duties to shareholders in allowing the severance payment. Although the defendants' victory was not solely because of experts' testimony, one lesson of the case is that experts do matter.
 ''The business problems that often result in litigations have just become more complicated, harder to understand, and the dollars involved are often very significant,'' said Martha Samuelson, chief executive of the Analysis Group, a consulting firm in Boston that provides litigation support and help with expert witnesses.
 Lawyers are also using experts in different ways, not just as academic resources, said Jack C. Auspitz, a lawyer in the New York office of Morrison & Foerster. For example, experts may argue that a lawsuit should not be converted into a class-action case because possible plaintiffs have different kinds of claims. 
 ''You can argue that there is no class,'' Mr. Auspitz said.
 Finding the right expert is not necessarily simple. A number of companies help law firms locate experts, either by referring a lawyer to an academic in the company's database or by recommending an expert on the company's own staff. Different companies have different strategies.
 One witness in the Disney case worked for National Economic Research Associates, known as Nera, a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan, the insurance broker. Nera's growth has been driven by providing expertise in support of litigation, said Richard T. Rapp, its president.
 Demand for Nera's services ''grows with refinements in the law and the requirement that courts use an understanding of how markets work in order to resolve complex litigation,'' said Mr. Rapp, who holds a doctorate in economics. The reports produced by Nera's economists -- the organization has about 400 of them -- do more than just express an opinion on, say, whether Disney's board complied with its duties. They might explore what impact Mr. Ovitz's hiring at Disney had on the company's stock price, for example -- a numbers-crunching task.
 The Round Table Group operates differently. Rather than retaining a staff of economists or doctors on staff, the company refers lawyers to experts of all sorts in its 65,000-person database, said Russ Rosenzweig, its chief executive and co-founder. Round Table is paid if one of its experts is hired.
 ''We do things like, we search New York Times archives for articles that may have been written on that topic, then we'll call the expert,'' Mr. Rosenzweig said. The company also sends out e-mail messages to university professors, asking if they would like to serve as experts, he said.
 But a good expert has more than expertise, and lawyers will spend considerable time getting to know potential witnesses to make sure they are clear and can hold up under questioning. A good expert witness, who can command $900 an hour or more, must be able to explain obscure subjects to a lay audience. 
 ''As the issues become increasingly complex, it's increasingly important to find experts who can simplify the issues,'' said Mark Kirsch, a lawyer at Clifford Chance who waged a successful legal battle against a Florida pension fund that sued his client, Alliance Capital Management Holding. A critical issue in the case was, How do investment managers normally choose what to buy? Mr. Kirsch was helped by the Analysis Group to find experts to answer that question.
 A tricky situation can arise if an expert does not reach a conclusion that supports the client's legal position. The lawyer can choose not to use that expert, in which case any work by the expert remains privileged, or can modify the arguments to be made in the case. But just ignoring a trusted expert's views is generally unwise, lawyers said.
 ''If you have an expert you believe in, who says your view of things is just dead wrong,'' Mr. Kirsch said, ''the first thing you do is strongly take that into consideration when reviewing your case.''

HEADLINE: Rice Warns China to Make Major Economic Changes 

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned this week that China must make significant structural changes in its economic policies, lest it remain ''a problem for the international economy.''
 In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Rice also laid out the administration's concerns about China's military buildup, its human rights record and its restrictions on religious freedom. Her unusually sharp criticism was a clear indication of the administration's ambivalence and frustration with China, even as officials prepare for a state visit next month by the president of China, Hu Jintao, his first visit since taking office in 2003. In her speeches and news conferences, Ms. Rice usually maintains a positive tone about China. She often says relations with the government in Beijing ''are at their best ever.'' 
During the interview this week at the State Department with reporters and an editor of The New York Times, which coincided with a review of diplomatic plans for the fall that she has been conducting with her top aides, Ms. Rice took time to explain why China seems to present such a diplomatic quandary.
 ''The relationship with China is just big and complicated, and it's got good parts and it's got not so good parts,'' she said. ''But what we are trying to stay focused on is the understanding that China is going to be influential in international politics one way or another. It's a major power, and it's going to be an even more major power.''
 In a separate interview this week, Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state who just returned from meetings with Chinese leaders in Beijing, said the Chinese leadership did not disguise its eagerness to maintain an amicable relationship with Washington. 
 ''The overwhelming sense I got was that they do not want a conflict with the United States,'' Mr. Zoellick said. But he said that he, too, ''tried to get them to see how their actions are perceived by the other side,'' particularly ''if they were not transparent, they would create uncertainties, and uncertainties lead people to hedge.''
 The United States is hedging to a degree, he acknowledged, by enhancing its relations with some of China's neighbors, including Australia, India and Japan. 
 ''India is a more striking example,'' he said. ''And you know these guys read history; they understand realpolitik.''
 For now, China appears to be on something close to probation with the Bush administration, with China's critics in Congress and with leaders of industry. One important measure is whether the Chinese will choose to revalue their currency further in the coming months. At its present value, American goods are more expensive than they should be in China, the Bush administration says, and Chinese goods are cheaper here. A 2.1 percent increase in the value of its currency in July was viewed in Washington as a start but inadequate by itself. 
 ''I think this will be an evolving thing,'' John Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said Thursday in an interview. ''We expect them to review this by fall, by October,'' he said. 
 ''A lot depends on what the Chinese do,'' Ms. Rice said, speaking more generally. She also made it clear that she was concerned about China's military buildup, which she said ''looks outsized for its regional interests.'' ''We're going to continue to press'' on ''human rights and religious freedom,'' she added.
 ''But on balance,'' she said, ''it is a good relationship'' that has ''a considerable benefit in the war on terrorism'' and ''in the North Korea proliferation issues,'' among others.
 Over the spring and summer, several actions by China, including its passage of the Taiwan antisuccession law and its efforts to buy the oil company Unocal oil company and the appliance maker Maytag, combined to send Washington into one of its periods of high anxiety over China. 
 As Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, put it in July, the capital was seized by a ''fever pitch of concern'' about China. 
 Since then, China dropped its effort to acquire Unocal. It ordered the small revaluation of its currency, the Yuan. It drafted a proposal to allow direct sales in China, responding to another business complaint. The administration also gave China significant credit for its work during the North Korea disarmament talks this month. As a result of those and other actions, several senior officials acknowledged, ''the temperature has dropped,'' as one put it. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, acknowledged Thursday in an interview that ''the ardor has cooled, but not permanently.'' He is cosponsor, with Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, of a measure that would impose a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese imports if China did not revalue its currency. Even the bill's sponsors were surprised when it got 67 votes in a test vote of sorts in April.
 Neither Mr. Schumer nor Mr. Graham says he believes China's 2.1 percent revaluation last month is enough, but China has said it plans no further revaluations. Both senators say they are watching and waiting.
 To stoke the debate, on Thursday Mr. Schumer's office made public a 15-page report that sets out the problems with China's economic and trade practices in language that ranges from caustic to accusatory.
 ''No American company would be able to take over a Chinese competitor in a way that Cnooc attempted to take over Unocal,'' it says. ''The rules simply don't allow it.'' Cnooc is the state-controlled Chinese oil company that bid for Unocal. 
 Elsewhere, the report notes, ''China blatantly extorts patented technology from American companies in exchange for market access,'' adding, ''Fairness or adherence to the normal rules of the free market is not the top priority of the Chinese government.''
 The American Embassy in Beijing depicts the same debate differently. While not minimizing the difficulties and unfair practices businesses face in China, in its current ''China Country Commercial Guide,'' the embassy notes that, ''entranced by the prospect of 1.3 billion customers, thousands of foreign firms have charged into the Chinese market'' without ''the necessary preparations.''
 Ms. Rice, like Mr. Zoellick, said she told China's leaders in her recent meetings with them that they should heed the warnings from Congress and elsewhere. Even though the administration opposes the Graham-Schumer bill, Ms. Rice said she told the Chinese leaders ''Don't ignore what people are saying to you about the problems of a Chinese economy that is both big and unreformed.
 ''We remind them that the president is a free trader, but he is a free trader who believes there has to be a level playing field for American workers and farmers and American goods.''

HEADLINE: Nominee's Early Files Show Many Cautions for Top Officials, Including Reagan

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM and JOHN M. BRODER; Todd S. Purdum reported from Washington for this article, and John M. Broder from Simi Valley, Calif. Reporting was contributed by John Files, Anne E. Kornblut, Neil A. Lewis, Robert Pear and Scott Shane from Washington and Jason Ebin and Carolyn Marshall from Simi Valley.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
As a young lawyer in the Reagan White House, it was John G. Roberts Jr. who often found himself urging caution on his elders -- including the president himself -- in an effort to shield them from not only legal errors but also political blunders and public relations missteps, great and small. 
 Newly released documents from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library reflect Mr. Roberts's repeated efforts to protect Mr. Reagan and his aides and supporters from some of their own most zealous instincts. He warned against excessive public presidential support for the Nicaraguan contra rebels. In 1984, he wrote a somewhat defensive note to his boss, the White House counsel Fred F. Fielding, arguing that it was all right for a presidential letter on minority business enterprise to speak of ''encouraging government procurements,'' adding, ''I do not think 'encourage' connotes anything in the nature of a set-aside or quota.''
In 1984, Mr. Roberts objected to the proposed draft of a presidential campaign speech that would have had Mr. Reagan refer to the United States as ''the greatest nation God ever created.'' Mr. Roberts wrote, ''According to Genesis, God creates things like heavens and the earth and the birds and the fishes, but not nations.'' He added that the phrase was ''a likely candidate for the 'Reaganism of the Week.''' 
 Like the thousands of pages of documents already released, the new files opened by the National Archives on Thursday show Mr. Roberts to be a faithful foot soldier in the conservative revolution that Ronald Reagan brought to Washington, embracing and echoing the administration's opposition to liberal programs like affirmative action and a controversial remedy for employment discrimination against women known as ''comparable worth.'' But they also reflect his unwavering penchant for caution -- and precision -- in language and thought. He corrected misuses of the words ''which'' and ''that'' in draft White House documents. And in reviewing a proposed economic message in 1986 in which Mr. Reagan was to say, ''I just turned 75 today, but remember that's only 30 Celsius,'' Mr. Roberts noted that 75 Fahrenheit is actually 23.9 Celsius.
 Usually, the issues were more serious. In a 1983 memo commenting on draft fair housing legislation, Mr. Roberts warned against referring to ''the fundamental right to be free from discrimination.'' Instead, he recommended language that invoked ''the basic right to be free from illegal discrimination,'' because ''there is no right to be free from discrimination, per se, and only some types of discrimination -- for example, on the basis of race -- are banned.''
 On Sept. 13, 1985, Mr. Roberts warned that the president's briefing materials for a forthcoming news conference should not include the statement ''As far as our best scientists have been able to determine, the AIDS virus is not transmitted through casual or routine contact.''
 ''I do not think we should have the president taking a position on a disputed scientific issue of this sort,'' Mr. Roberts wrote, adding, ''There is much to commend the view that we should assume AIDS can be transmitted through casual or routine contact, as is true with many viruses, until it is demonstrated that it cannot be, and no scientist has said AIDS definitely cannot be so transmitted.''
 In several 1983 memos, Mr. Roberts derided passage of a California law that required the order of layoffs to reflect affirmative action considerations and condemned another ''staggeringly pernicious law codifying the anti-capitalist notion of 'comparable worth' (as opposed to market value) pay scales.''
 He pronounced ''presumably unconstitutional'' a plan to charge women lower tuition at Florida state schools because they had less earning potential, and he doubted the merits of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution, arguing that it would ''ipso facto override the prerogatives of the states and vest the federal judiciary with broader powers in this area.''
 The latest documents appeared to contain no bombshells, but their simultaneous release at the main National Archives building here and the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., nevertheless produced fevered interest. When the archives site opened at 11 a.m., 30 news organizations and 40 other entities -- including Senate aides and advocacy groups -- were waiting to pore over the 71 boxes of material, and the usually sober reading room had the air of a football press box at kickoff time.
 Archives officials said some 1,708 pages of documents had been withheld on privacy or national security grounds, and the files contained slips noting the absence of documents relating to job applicants, personnel and disciplinary matters and other topics like Central America. In all, 50,000 pages have been released.
 In the latest documents, Mr. Roberts -- then in his late 20's and early 30's -- reflects a keen awareness of the eyes of history that would someday fall upon him and his colleagues. In a Sept. 9, 1985, memorandum, he warned of the potentially chilling effect on White House staff deliberations of the Presidential Records Act of 1978, the post-Watergate law making internal White House memorandums government property and requiring their release 12 years after an administration's end.
 ''Twelve years is a brief lifetime in public life,'' Mr. Roberts wrote. ''Many of the personalities candidly discussed in sensitive White House memoranda, and certainly many of the authors of the memoranda, will be active 12 years from now.''
 In a bit of foreshadowing, Mr. Roberts offered his views on the process of confirming Supreme Court nominees in a 1986 memo to Mr. Fielding, urging him not to respond to a review of a book about Supreme Court nominations authored by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard law professor, who had argued that presidents generally get what they expect from their Supreme Court appointments and that the Senate should more aggressively question potential justices.
 ''Some justices live up to the expectations of those who appoint them; some do not,'' Mr. Roberts wrote. ''The Senate is free under the Constitution to consider whatever it cares to consider in voting on a nominee.'' 
 Mr. Roberts weighed in on a controversial issue of the Reagan era, urging restraint. In 1986, he reviewed a draft of remarks to be made by President Reagan at a briefing on United States aid to rebels fighting the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Mr. Roberts said it would be inappropriate to compare the situation in Central America to the situation in Europe in the early 1940's, echoing Winston Churchill's famous declaration ''Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.''
 ''The analogy strikes me as the wrong one to draw, since England did not 'finish the job' on its own, as I gather we hope the contras will,'' Mr. Roberts wrote in a memorandum on March 12, 1986.
 Mr. Roberts also warned that the president should not urge people to send telegrams and letters to Congress in support of the ''freedom fighters'' in Nicaragua. Such an explicit appeal, he said, could violate restrictions on the use of federal money to lobby Congress.
 Mr. Roberts's erudition is apparent. In 1984, he wrote Mr. Fielding a memorandum entirely in French, summarizing the complaint of a French pop singer named Jacky Reggan, who wanted a letter from the president attesting that they were not related. Mr. Roberts volunteered to make a trip to Paris himself to investigate, but otherwise counseled no response, on the ground that Mr. Reggan would only use any reply for ''publicite.''
 At other times his humor was clearly old school. In a 1985 memorandum on whether an administration official could be nominated for an award recognizing her transition from homemaker to lawyer, Mr. Roberts said, ''Some might question whether encouraging homemakers to become lawyers contributes to the common good, but I suppose that is for the judges to decide.''
 Mr. Roberts showed particular concern for protecting the presidential image. He drafted an apologetic reply from Mr. Reagan to his old Hollywood friend Jimmy Stewart, declining to serve on the fund-raising board of a boarding school of which Mr. Stewart was chairman, noting that the president had decided to decline all such requests.
 Mr. Roberts submitted his resignation from the White House counsel's office on April 10, 1986, with a letter addressed to President Reagan. He stated that it had been ''a singular privilege, honor and delight'' to serve in the administration over the previous five years, first as a special assistant to Attorney General William French Smith, and then for four years as a junior lawyer in the White House counsel's office.
 ''I know you receive many letters like this, and I recognize that over time they must come to seem fairly routine,'' he wrote to Mr. Reagan. ''Please understand, however, that my years in your service will always be very special to me. The inspiration you have given me will burn brightly in my heart long after I have left the lights of the White House behind.''

HEADLINE: WELD TRIES AGAIN TO BE GOVERNOR, BUT IN NEW YORK 

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
William F. Weld, the colorful former Republican governor of Massachusetts, said yesterday that he planned to run for the same job in New York next year, hoping his platform of tax cuts and social liberalism will make him the first two-state leader since Sam Houston.
 Mr. Weld, a native New Yorker who is now an investment adviser in Manhattan, said he had been encouraged to run by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, an old friend, among others. Karl Rove, the White House political adviser, who worked for Mr. Weld in the 1990's, had also told him to consider running against Eliot Spitzer, the likely Democratic nominee, and the two men agreed that Mr. Spitzer was beatable, according to New York Republicans told about the exchange.
Yet Mr. Weld, who is barely known in New York outside of fund-raising, society and political circles, said his desire to run came strictly from ''personal motivation'' and a belief that New Yorkers had come to like moderate, tax-cutting Republican leaders. 
 ''My juices are really flowing for this race, and I want to return to public service,'' Mr. Weld said in a telephone interview from Kentucky, where he was on business with his firm, Leeds Weld & Company.
 With Gov. George E. Pataki stepping down next year and the Republican nomination wide open, Mr. Weld's affable and unpredictable brand of politics -- he once dived fully clothed into the Charles River to show that it was clean -- could prove an intriguing match for Mr. Spitzer, the popular state attorney general.
 Mr. Weld would face several challenges, political analysts say. His liberalism helped him in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, but it could drive away conservative upstate and suburban voters who can be crucial in statewide races in New York. Just yesterday, in fact, Mr. Weld came under attack from both the right and the left for his past support of gay marriage, which he says he now opposes beyond Massachusetts.
 Yet Mr. Weld's underdog victory as governor in 1990, and his landslide re-election in 1994, matter more than specific policy issues right now to New York's Republican leaders. Mr. Pataki has talked with Mr. Weld once and plans to meet with him soon, a Pataki spokesman said, and the state party chairman, Stephen J. Minarik, will meet with Mr. Weld today. 
 To party officials, Mr. Weld is seen as a possible blend of their biggest success stories of late: Mr. Pataki, Mr. Giuliani and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (who grew up in Massachusetts).
 Like those three men, Mr. Weld supports abortion rights and equal rights for gay people, and he also shares Mr. Pataki's fervor for environmental protection and lower taxes. He is also a former federal prosecutor and is seen by Republicans as strong on criminal justice and counterterrorism, two issues that Mr. Spitzer is likely to run on next year.
 Like Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Weld also has a distaste for ideological warfare, and his friendly style is gilded with the playful wit of a 60-year-old bon vivant who loves to quote the Grateful Dead. He got along well with the Democratic-controlled Legislature in Massachusetts, and he held a series of civilized, widely praised debates in 1996 in his race against Senator John Kerry, who defeated Mr. Weld.
 Mr. Weld can ''relate and talk to people, any kind of people, and make them smile and laugh and like him,'' said Stuart Stevens, a media consultant whose firm has agreed to advise Mr. Weld.
 Mr. Stevens said that Mr. Weld was even less well known in Massachusetts in 1990 than he is now in New York, where he was born and raised, on Long Island, and now owns several homes with his wife, Leslie Marshall, a writer.
 Yet people close to Mr. Weld acknowledge that he is also a largely unknown figure locally who, while wealthy, also does not have Mr. Bloomberg's personal fortune to use on television advertisements. And as a former Brahmin-like Bostonian, Mr. Weld does not have a natural ethnic or geographic base of support in New York, which has tended to favor Roman Catholic and Jewish candidates in statewide races.
 ''Will New Yorkers accept a guy who has had no public profile since he arrived here, no overwhelming issue to run on, and has to raise $40 million from nowhere to be competitive?'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who advised Mr. Spitzer in his 1998 campaign for attorney general, but does not work for him now.
 ''He'll have to spend half the time proving that he's really a New Yorker before he can even get to the issues,'' Mr. Sheinkopf said.
 Mr. Weld said he believed his years in Massachusetts would translate well here. Were he to win, he would follow in the footsteps of Sam Houston, who was governor of Tennessee and Texas in the mid-19th century. Mr. Weld moved back to New York in 2000.
 Mr. Weld said he would seek to cut New York's income and capital gains taxes, overhaul public education, aggressively protect the environment and crack down on Medicaid abuse. 
 During his tenure as governor from 1991 to 1997, he took aim at the state's ''Taxachusetts'' reputation and cut rates about 20 times, but an independent study concluded the reductions predominantly benefited the wealthy. He enacted tax credits for research, and helped cut in half the state unemployment rate of about 10 percent. He also supported a major education bill that included new statewide tests for students.
 Yet under Mr. Weld and the Democratic-controlled legislature, spending skyrocketed, and the tax burden remained relatively high. Many Democrats complained that he kept bankers' hours and eventually seemed bored with the job. (Mr. Weld said he would hardly be bored in Albany. ''Albany's my destination -- it's where I want to be,'' he said.) 
 He also retained Mr. Rove's direct-mail firm in his races for governor, and said yesterday that Mr. Rove ''is a friend and someone who knows me well.''
 But state Republicans, who declined to be identified because the conversation was private, said Mr. Rove expressed the view that Mr. Spitzer was untested as a candidate and potential governor, and that he is far ahead in polls only because of his strong name recognition. White House officials did not return phone calls and e-mail messages seeking comment.
 Mr. Giuliani, meanwhile, told Mr. Weld that he would be ''a good candidate,'' said an associate of Mr. Giuliani's, who confirmed this account with the former mayor.
 Mr. Weld resigned as governor in 1997 when President Clinton crossed party lines to tap him as ambassador to Mexico. But Mr. Weld's nomination died at the hands of Senator Jesse Helms, who said Mr. Weld was too liberal on drug legalization and other social issues like gay rights.
 Before that confirmation fight, Mr. Weld stopped short of endorsing gay marriage at one point, saying Americans were not ready for it. Yet out of office, Mr. Weld enthusiastically supported the Massachusetts court ruling in 2003 that allowed those marriages.
 But Mr. Weld said yesterday that he supported gay marriage only in Massachusetts, because the legal decision correctly interpreted the state's Constitution. He said he supported civil unions -- and not gay marriage -- for New York and elsewhere, which he also indicated to The New York Post on Wednesday.
 The State Democratic Party quickly attacked Mr. Weld for ''flip-flopping.''
 Michael Long, chairman of the state's Conservative Party, said he was concerned that Mr. Weld was still too enthusiastic of gay rights to win his party's endorsement. Indeed, other Republicans considering the governor's race are more conservative, like Secretary of State Randy Daniels and former Congressman Rick Lazio. ''Weld admitted over the phone that he and I might part ways on social issues,'' Mr. Long said. ''I think his social views make things pretty difficult for him.''

HEADLINE: Weakened British Unions Step Up Fight Against Airlines and Their Suppliers

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Sarah Lyall contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 19 

 BODY:
The labor battle that briefly crippled British Airways last week is shaping up as one of the nastiest scrapes of the summer as cost-cutting airlines and the companies that serve them face unrest from unions, whose waning influence is making them even fiercer fighters. 
 In Britain, the 900,000-member Transport and General Workers Union, which was once the largest union in the world but is now under pressure to merge with others as membership shrinks, is squaring off against Gate Gourmet, the money-losing in-flight caterer owned by the private equity group Texas Pacific.
Since official talks between the union and Gate Gourmet broke down on Tuesday -- after sympathy strikes by members of the Transport and General Workers Union left thousands of British Airways passengers stranded at Heathrow Airport for days -- friction has only increased. 
 Gate Gourmet employees accuse the company of practicing ''United States-style negotiating tactics'' that have no place in Britain. Perhaps more damaging, they are also accusing the company of health and safety violations and improper corporate activities, prompting Gate Gourmet to hire a forensic accountant to review its books. 
 On Thursday, the fight threatened to spread to Ireland, where Gate Gourmet workers voted to strike after being told the company would not honor promised pay increases. Gate Gourmet reinstated the pay increases, and the strike was called off Thursday evening. 
 British Airways, meanwhile, is investigating the Heathrow strike and has opened a confidential phone line, encouraging employees who participated to identify employees and union members who instigated the walkouts. Gate Gourmet is assisting in the investigation. 
 This may not be the last such bitter battle in Europe, experts say. Shrinking unions are expected to keep fighting with cost-cutting executives, particularly in the airline industry, where low-cost airlines have increased competition and high oil prices are eroding profits. The conflict is being intensified by private equity buyers, who are strictly focused on returning companies to profitability and less concerned about fostering good long-term relations within a country. 
 ''It's likely that you're going to have a period of turbulent labor relations for some time to come,'' said John Logan, a professor in the industrial relations department of the London School of Economics. 
 Union membership in Britain, and in most of Europe, has been declining for some time, just as it has in the United States. Fewer than a third of British workers are union members, down from 42 percent of men and 32 percent of women in 1991. In European Union countries over all, just one in four employees belongs to a union, down from 43 percent just two years ago. 
 But as the events of last weekend show, union members are still wielding power. In fact, some say they may be more willing to resort to extreme measures as pressure on their members increases.
 When Gate Gourmet brought on 30 seasonal nonunion workers on Wednesday of last week, after saying it needed to lay off 675 people, hundreds of the company's full-time workers left their stations and assembled in the company's cafeteria. ''People just wanted an explanation from the management and the union,'' said Mrs. Atwal, Gate Gourmet's former shop steward, who goes only by her last name. ''We had no intention to have a strike. We just wanted to know what was going on.'' 
 The situation became ugly immediately, both sides say. The employees, who are mainly women, contend they were not allowed to contact their union representatives and were locked into Gate Gourmet's kitchens without being allowed to use the bathroom. Later in the day, they were told they had been fired and that their cars would be towed if they did not leave. 
 Gate Gourmet's chief executive, David N. Siegel, the former US Airways chief executive who is no stranger to union actions, said the company pleaded with the employees to return to work and that the threat to tow their cars was made only because employees from the next shift could not find parking spaces. Employees were told they could be escorted to the bathrooms, but some chose to urinate in sinks instead, he said. 
 The company refused to remove the threat of dismissal, which unions wanted before they negotiated, he said. ''We said we can't do that,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''It was an illegal job action.'' By 2 p.m., Gate Gourmet had dismissed all the employees who had been working the shift, he said. 
 Gate Gourmet employees are unwilling to change with the times, Mr. Siegel said. For example, an increase in the number of short-haul flights, which generally travel on smaller aircraft, has changed the amount of time it takes a cart driver to stock each flight in recent years. But the number of flights the drivers are required to stock has not changed, resulting in inefficiencies, Gate Gourmet said. 
 ''We have a lot of guys who work for three hours and then go to the local pub and play snooker,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''We have drivers who make more money than members of Parliament.'' Most of Gate Gourmet's workers make $:12,000 to $:16,000 ($21,700 to $29,000) a year, Mrs. Atwal said. 
 British Airways ground crews working in Heathrow walked off the job last Thursday after hearing about the Gate Gourmet situation, bringing the airline to a halt for much of that day and Friday. The union did not condone the actions, but Gate Gourmet has been critical nonetheless, blaming the union for the failure of the talks and accusing it of 1970's-style labor practices. 
 Outside parties are less harsh. ''It's hard to characterize them as a throwback to the 1970's,'' Mr. Logan said. ''They're trying to perpetuate the notion of unions as dinosaurs, who don't recognize that times have changed. But that doesn't accurately describe T.&G. today.'' 
 This is the third consecutive summer that British Airways has been plagued by strikes, and some people have started to point the finger at the union's Heathrow representatives. 
 ''There are some elements out there who are very militant,'' said Barry Sheerman, a Labor member of Parliament who has publicly criticized the British Airways employees for irresponsibly striking and ruining holidays for other working-class people. ''Years ago we got rid of them in the Labor Party, but they are still active in the trade union movement. This is one of their last stomping grounds.''
 British Airways said it would not be appropriate to address allegations that union members were particularly militant at this time. A spokeswoman, Sophie Greenyer, said that the company had been successful in the past at cutting jobs and costs by working with unions. British Airways has trimmed 13,000 jobs and $:850 million in costs over the last three years. ''We've been able to work sensibly with the unions to achieve those savings,'' she said.

DATELINE: AQABA, Jordan, Aug. 19 

 BODY:
A rocket attack Friday missed two United States Navy ships in port here but killed a Jordanian soldier and hit Eilat, an Israeli town just across the border. 
 The assault raised fears that militants tied to Iraq's insurgency were operating in Jordan.
Three Katyusha rockets were fired from an industrial zone on the outskirts of town early Friday morning, the authorities said, apparently aimed at the American warships, the amphibious assault ship Kearsarge and the landing ship Ashland, which arrived here last week. 
 The first rocket sailed over the bow of the Ashland at 8:44 a.m. and hit a warehouse near the Kearsarge, killing a Jordanian soldier, said Lt. Cmdr. Charlie Brown, a spokesman for the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain. 
 The vessels left port shortly after the attack, the first against American military ships since the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Aden, Yemen, five years ago. Aden is near the southern reaches of the Red Sea, of which the Gulf of Aqaba is a northern branch.
 Another rocket exploded near an airport in Eilat, about 10 miles away, hitting a stretch of road and wounding a taxi driver. A third rocket landed in an open lot at a military hospital in Aqaba, causing little damage.
 Within hours of the attack, the Jordanian Army started an intensive search for six men, believed to be Egyptian, Syrian and Iraqi, who recently rented a workshop from which the rockets were fired, Jordanian television reported. 
 The men were believed to have fled in a car with Kuwait license plates, The Associated Press reported late Friday. 
 A palace spokeswoman said senior members of Jordan's government had flown to Aqaba. The spokeswoman said King Abdullah II, who is on an official visit to Russia, would not be cutting his trip short; in his place, Prince Faisal al-Hussein, the king's half-brother and regent during his absence, went to the scene. 
 Because of the style of the attack and the possible involvement of Iraqis, it stoked growing fear that insurgents from Iraq might be taking the fight against Americans to Jordan. 
 Katyusha rockets are crude and often inaccurate, but they can cause significant damage. They are a hallmark of insurgent groups in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Although militants have been caught with weapons seeking to cross into the West Bank over the years, there has not been such an attack on Jordanian soil in recent memory. 
 A group calling itself the Brigades of the Martyr Abdullah Azzam claimed responsibility for the attacks in an Internet posting, saying that the United States had ''corrupted the Earth'' and that the Jordanian ''devil'' had to stop jailing Muslim scholars, according to the SITE Institute, a group based in Washington that tracks terrorist messages on the Internet.
 But the authenticity of the message could not be confirmed, and many forums that originally posted the claim eventually removed it, citing doubts about its source. 
 A group with the same name took responsibility for the bombings in late July in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, which killed 68 people. 
 The two Navy vessels are with the Fifth Fleet, which has 45 ships, most of them operating off the shores of the Islamic world, from the coast of East Africa to Iraq and Pakistan. 
 The ships arrived Aug. 13, bringing in troops from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit to conduct routine exercises with Jordanian forces. The Ashland is carrying 350 sailors and 400 marines; the Kearsarge has 1,100 sailors and 1,800 marines.
 Cmdr. Jeff Breslau, a spokesman for Fifth Fleet headquarters, said he was unaware of any intelligence about heightened threats at Aqaba before the incident. 
 ''Pretty much every port in this region is at a higher threat level than anywhere else in the world,'' he said, adding that the ships were inside a security perimeter at Aqaba. 
 During the week the ships were in port, a small number of sailors had been allowed to go ashore every day on liberty, said a Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Todd Vician.
 The Ashland had been scheduled to leave Saturday, and the Kearsarge on Aug. 25. Although both ships were ordered to sea after the attack, the American-Jordanian exercise was continuing, Major Vician said. 
 The Navy provides ships with a threat assessment and security plan before they dock at foreign ports, a process that has grown more involved since the attack on the Cole in 2000. Commander Brown said security measures now included increased watches, better training and more crew-operated weapons mounted around the ships. In the bombing of the Cole, suicide attackers blew a 40-foot hole in the hull, killing 17 sailors. Last September, a court in Yemen sentenced two men to death and four others to prison terms for their roles in the bombing. The men were five Yemenis and a Saudi, Abd Rahim Nashiri, who reportedly directed Al Qaeda's operations in the Persian Gulf.
 Two American sailors and a Coast Guardsman attached to the Fifth Fleet were killed in April 2004 in the port at Basra, Iraq, when three suicide bomb boats tried to ram oil platforms. 
 The attack on Friday raised serious concerns in Jordan, which until now has generally been able to keep the violence in neighboring Iraq and the West Bank at bay. That militants were able to smuggle rockets into Jordan, or build them here, much less be able to set them up and fire them undetected in one of the most secured cities in the country, has shaken the security establishment here.
 ''Jordan's relative advantage for decades has been stability,'' said Mohammad Momani, professor of political science at Yarmuk University. ''Although there was not much collateral damage from this attack, symbolically this is very damaging to Jordan's reputation. And it may indicate a spillover of the American war in Iraq.''
 Aqaba, Jordan's only port, is its link to the world economy and a major source of tourism dollars at its beach resorts. Much of the city is a free-trade zone, and Aqaba has seen dramatic development in recent years as a beach resort. 
 But security has long been a delicate issue for the city, which is within miles of the Israeli border, the Saudi border and the Sinai. 
 Jordanian security has been on alert since the killing of an American diplomat, Laurence M. Foley, in Amman in October 2002. That assassination is suspected to have been directed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a major figure in Iraq's insurgency and an avowed ally of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. 
 Since then, Jordan has reported that it has thwarted many attacks, and some analysts said there had long been a feeling here that a successful attack was imminent. 
 ''There may be remnants of sleeper cells that have been holding the rockets and found an opportunity to use them, or the rockets may have been brought in from outside Jordan with coordination from the inside,'' said Fadel al-Sarhan, who served as director of Jordan's Public Security Department from 1989 to 1993. ''Perhaps they found that this was an opportunity to flex their muscles and do something. But they are not going to get the reaction they wanted.''

HEADLINE: The Trillion-Dollar War

BYLINE: By Linda Bilmes. 
Linda Bilmes, an assistant secretary at the Department of Commerce from 1999 to 2001, teaches budgeting and public finance at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
THE human cost of the more than 2,000 American military personnel killed and 14,500 wounded so far in Iraq and Afghanistan is all too apparent. But the financial toll is still largely hidden from public view and, like the suffering of those who have lost loved ones, will persist long after the fighting is over.
The cost goes well beyond the more than $250 billion already spent on military operations and reconstruction. Basic running costs of the current conflicts are $6 billion a month -- a figure that reflects the Pentagon's unprecedented reliance on expensive private contractors. Other factors keeping costs high include inducements for recruits and for military personnel serving second and third deployments, extra pay for reservists and members of the National Guard, as well as more than $2 billion a year in additional foreign aid to Jordan, Pakistan, Turkey and others to reward their cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill for repairing and replacing military hardware is $20 billion a year, according to figures from the Congressional Budget Office. 
 But the biggest long-term costs are disability and health payments for returning troops, which will be incurred even if hostilities were to stop tomorrow. The United States currently pays more than $2 billion in disability claims per year for 159,000 veterans of the 1991 gulf war, even though that conflict lasted only five weeks, with 148 dead and 467 wounded. Even assuming that the 525,000 American troops who have so far served in Iraq and Afghanistan will require treatment only on the same scale as their predecessors from the gulf war, these payments are likely to run at $7 billion a year for the next 45 years.
 All of this spending will need to be financed by adding to the federal debt. Extra interest payments will total $200 billion or more even if the borrowing is repaid quickly. Conflict in the Middle East has also played a part in doubling the price of oil from $30 a barrel just prior to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 to $60 a barrel today. Each $5 increase in the price of oil reduces our national income by about $17 billion a year.
 Even by this simple yardstick, if the American military presence in the region lasts another five years, the total outlay for the war could stretch to more than $1.3 trillion, or $11,300 for every household in the United States.

Takeover Bid for Nursing Home Chain
The nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises said that it had received an unsolicited $1.64 billion takeover offer from a group of investors that topped its existing $1.63 billion acquisition pact with North American Senior Care. An investor group led by Formation Capital had raised its offer for Beverly Enterprises to $12.90 a share in cash, which was higher than overtures it previously made and exceeded the $12.80-a-share deal the nursing home company sealed on Wednesday with North American Senior Care. Traders said that the two offers were so close in value that North American Senior Care could return with a higher bid, creating a bidding war for Beverly, which operates 345 nursing homes, and assisted-living and hospice centers. (Reuters)

Dillard's Posts Narrower Loss
The department store Dillard's said that its second-quarter loss narrowed, while AnnTaylor Stores said that profit declined and margins would widen in the second half. Shares of both companies rose. Dillard's net loss was $12.3 million compared with $26 million a year earlier on a 1.2 percent sales gain. Profit at AnnTaylor dropped 76 percent as revenue rose 7.6 percent. Dillard's same-store sales -- in stores open at least a year -- increased 1 percent, the first gain in five quarters, after it added upscale merchandise like lingerie by Calvin Klein. AnnTaylor's profit excluding a relocation expense exceeded analysts' estimates. Shares of Dillard's rose $1.49, to $22.09. AnnTaylor increased $1.56, to $26.60. (Bloomberg News)

KB Toys to Exit Bankruptcy
KB Toys said that it expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by the end of the month under new ownership and with two former Toys ''R'' Us presidents on its new management team. The announcement came after a bankruptcy judge in Delaware on Thursday approved KB's plan to reorganize debts and resume operating outside bankruptcy protection. KB Toys entered bankruptcy protection more than a year ago. (AP)

Guidant Defibrillator Approved
The Guidant Corporation said that the Food and Drug Administration approved its defibrillator with remote monitoring ability for heart failure patients, along with a next-generation programmer. The wireless system, which Guidant plans to introduce in the United States in the fourth quarter, is designed to save time during implant and at follow-up. (Reuters)

JDS to Sell Microlaser Unit
JDS Uniphase, the world's largest maker of parts for fiber optic networks, said it would sell a microlaser product line and plant to Teem Photonics of France. The agreement includes a line of microlasers used in the industrial and biomedical industries and a manufacturing plant in Grenoble, France. Terms were not disclosed. The sale will let JDS Uniphase devote more resources to solid-state laser products, which are desk-size devices that are more costly and use more energy. (Bloomberg News)

Bribery Accusation Hurts Brazil's Markets
Brazil's stocks and currency tumbled after Sao Paulo state prosecutors said the finance minister, Antonio Palocci, left, might have taken bribes as a mayor in the 1990's. Rogerio Buratti, an aide to Mr. Palocci when he was the mayor of Ribeirao Preto in the 1990's, testified to state prosecutors that Mr. Palocci received 50,000 reais ($20,362) a month from a company in charge of the city's trash collection. Mr. Palocci, who is considered the architect of Brazil's economic reform, denied the charges in a Finance Ministry statement. Ricardo Campos, who helps manage $4.1 billion of assets for Hedging-Griffo Asset Management, said, ''The problem is that Palocci is the man carrying the economic policy,'' adding, ''It's all that the market was concerned about.'' The currency weakened as much as 3.6 percent to the dollar, and settled down 2.1 percent to 2.4486. The benchmark Bovespa stock index fell as much as 2.9 percent, but ended down 0.9 percent, to 26,643.77. (Bloomberg News)

Home Depot Management Change
Home Depot, the home-improvement retailer, said that its chief of stores in the United States and Mexico, Tom Taylor, would replace John Costello as chief of marketing and merchandising. Mr. Taylor joined Home Depot in 1983. Mr. Costello, who was hired in November 2002, left to pursue other opportunities, the company said in a statement. (Bloomberg News)

Work-Hour Rules Revised
The Transportation Department issued revised work-hour rules for highway truck drivers, keeping provisions of earlier regulations that a federal court threw out last year. The department had to revise the rules, which raised maximum daily driving hours to 11, from 10, after groups like Public Citizen told a federal court in July 2004 that the government failed to show that drivers could stay alert with the added hour. The new regulations retain the 11-hour daily limit, as well as 10 hours of rest every 24 hours. (Bloomberg News)

Maytag to Cut 200 Jobs
Maytag, the appliance maker, is cutting about 16 percent -- about 200 jobs -- of the work force at its Newton, Iowa, washer and dryer plant. The job cuts stem from reduced demand for the factory's products and take effect on Sept. 6, a Maytag spokesman, John Daggett, said. (Bloomberg News)

HEADLINE: World Briefing Africa: Britain To Compensate For 'Brain Drain' 

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
Britain will seek ways to compensate African countries for the thousands of medical professionals who leave the continent to work in the British health service, the government said. The compensation could take the form of in-country training, provision of medicines and help with tackling infrastructure problems. 
But there are no plans to provide financial compensation. About 70,000 qualified Africans leave their home countries every year to work abroad, the Department for International Development said, with many going to the United Kingdom, other parts of Europe and the United States. The exodus is leaving some of the world's poorest nations battling epidemics of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis without sufficient qualified medical personnel. Britain is already financing a program to help Malawi improve health care pay and working conditions to help retain medical workers.

HEADLINE: Economic Clouds and No Shortage of Those Who See Silver Linings

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
ENERGY prices have started to drag on the economy. Or they haven't yet. The housing market is a bubble that is really poised to pop. Or it's not. As with many questions about the economy, it depends on who is being asked. 
 The federal budget deficit is another example. Congressional budget forecasters say the federal government is likely to overspend its income by less than previously estimated this year, but few agree whether that is a one-time quirk or the start of a trend. 
This much is for certain: As the summer travel season begins to wind down, some airlines will again be pushed to the brink of bankruptcy, and perhaps beyond.

OUT OF GAS? -- As oil prices ticked up quicker than the ''total sale'' dial on a gas pump, there were signs that higher energy costs were starting to pinch some parts of the economy. Wal-Mart, a harbinger of consumer spending, blamed high oil prices for its weak profit report, saying that customers have less to spend after filling their cars' tanks. Airlines howled at the latest jump in jet fuel prices, and fretted over waning inventories that threatened spot shortages -- at any price -- in some areas.
 Over all, consumer prices shot up in July at the fastest rate in three months, affirming the Federal Reserve's decision to continue raising short-term interest rates to keep inflation in check, even if that means reining in economic growth.
 And yet, some economists said that the economy was absorbing higher energy prices fairly well, and that in any case it is less dependent on energy than it was a generation ago. Excluding energy costs, for example, consumer prices are rising at a modest 2.2 percent annual rate, while industrial production continues to expand and the economy is forecast to grow.
 Regardless of the overall effect of higher energy prices, consumers should prepare to pay more for gasoline, heating oil and natural gas in the fall and winter. Contracts for the delivery of these commodities over the next six months are still trading higher than current prices, they said.

STILL STRONG -- One area of the economy that remains remarkably robust is the housing market. One widely watched measure of that market -- housing starts, or the number of houses that developers start to build in a particular month -- declined slightly in July, but was still 2.8 percent higher than a year ago, the Commerce Department reported.
 Even more encouraging, the number of permits issued for future residential construction, an indicator of where the market is headed, suggests that the housing market is maintaining some momentum. The number of permits issued last month was 1.6 percent more than in June, and 2.5 percent more than in July 2004. 
 In some areas, particularly the once white-hot markets in the West and near Washington, D.C., home sales appear to be slowing and prices leveling off, according to regional statistics and real estate agents. At the same time, however, activity still seems to be picking up in the South.
 Economists said they expected home sales and construction to remain strong until mortgage rates, which remain near historic lows, rise by at least half a percentage point. A tide of foreign investment has helped keep rates low by providing an ample supply of capital for lenders.

REFRAIN OF PAIN -- How bad off are some of the old-line airlines, even now? Consider this: Delta Air Lines, which is losing hundreds of million of dollars each month, now has to set aside hundreds of millions more in reserve, to assuage its skittish processor of credit card payments.
 The processor is worried the airline could tumble into bankruptcy court, leaving it liable to reimburse tens of thousands of stranded travelers. (The airline had recently started to seek the financing it would need if it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.)
 Delta, the third-largest domestic airline behind American and United, had about $1.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of June, according to regulatory filings. But its short-term obligations are even greater, so to raise cash it sold one part of its business -- Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a regional carrier -- for something approaching a fire-sale price. Other units are also up for sale.
 Along with raising a reserve for its credit card processor, Delta must make $135 million in pension contributions by the end of the year. It also faces $100 million in debt payments this quarter, and another $335 million in the fourth quarter.

A HOLE LESS DEEP -- Thanks to an unexpected surge in corporate income tax payments, the federal deficit may be as little as $331 billion this year, not the $412 billion forecast earlier, the Congressional Budget Office said. That's the good news.
 The bad news is that $331 billion would still be the third-biggest deficit ever, and Congress has increased spending significantly since the budget office made its last official forecast in March. (Federal subsidies paid to farmers, for example, doubled to almost $18 billion.) The agency now foresees annual deficits totaling $2.1 trillion from 2006 to 2015. That is more than double the total of $980 billion forecast in March.
 President Bush's plan to extend tax cuts beyond 2011 could increase future deficits by more than $250 billion a year from 2012 to 2015, the budget office said. Assuming permanent cuts, the cumulative deficit for the coming decade would balloon to $3.4 trillion.

FRAUD WATCH -- Just when it seemed that the river of corporate fraud indictments might be drying up, a federal prosecutor filed charges against F. David Radler, the former publisher of The Chicago Sun-Times, and Mark Kipnis, who was general counsel of the newspaper's owner, Hollinger International.
 Speculation quickly focused on the fate of their former boss, Conrad M. Black, a native of Canada who was made a life peer in England after building his newspaper empire, which at one point was the world's third largest by circulation. He was not indicted, but the Securities and Exchange Commission sued him last November, accusing him and Mr. Radler of diverting $85 million from the publicly traded Hollinger International through self-dealing transactions.
 Hollinger International's directors have also sued Lord Black -- as well as several others, including his wife, Barbara Amiel, a former director and Hollinger International executive -- accusing them of siphoning more than $300 million from the company. In interviews and court filings, Lord Black has previously said that the company's board authorized any money he took out of the company.
 Prosecutors are negotiating a plea deal with Mr. Radler, whose arraignment date has not been set. That he is negotiating a deal at all has fueled speculation that Lord Black may yet become involved in the criminal investigation.

HEADLINE: MBIA Says It May Face Suit From S.E.C. Over Insurance Deal 

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has notified MBIA, a financial services company that guarantees billions of dollars in bonds, that it may bring a civil suit accusing the company of securities law violations. The accusations center on an insurance deal MBIA struck in 1998 to minimize losses from the failure of a hospital group whose bonds it had backed.
 MBIA disclosed late yesterday that it had received a so-called Wells notice from the S.E.C. Companies typically respond to such notices by offering reasons a securities suit should not be filed against them. 
 The insurance deal struck by MBIA allowed the company to protect itself retroactively against losses related to the failure of the Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation, a Philadelphia hospital group that filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998. MBIA insured the bonds against default and lost $170 million as a result of the failure.
 Last March, MBIA said that it would restate its financial results for the last seven years as a result of improper accounting relating to the insurance deal. The restatement amounted to a $54 million reduction in profit over the period. MBIA's earnings were reduced in four of the seven years the insurance was in effect. Its profits were increased in two of those years and were unaffected in one year.
 MBIA said it was cooperating with the S.E.C. in its investigation of the matter. It is also cooperating with investigations by the New York attorney general's office and by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.
 ''The company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations of whether its current efforts to resolve them on a fair and appropriate basis will be successful,'' MBIA said. 
 Even as regulatory pressure appears to be mounting at MBIA, the company is facing increasing competition from new rivals, according to a report published last week by Fitch Ratings, an international ratings agency. Demand for credit-enhancing tools, like those offered by MBIA is also declining, the agency said, and rising interest rates are putting pressure on financial guarantors.
 ''The favorable environment for the financial guarantor industry has passed for the time being,'' the report noted.

HEADLINE: Businessman Battles the City For Power Plant

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
At a time when the United States Supreme Court has granted local governments free rein to condemn private property on behalf of commercial projects, an energy entrepreneur says he is going City Hall one better: he plans to condemn some prime Brooklyn waterfront land himself.
 Adam H. Victor, the president of TransGas Energy Systems, has sought for four years to build a $1.3 billion power plant on the East River in Williamsburg despite opposition from the community and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration. Mr. Victor ran up against a determined deputy mayor, Daniel L. Doctoroff, who preferred that the city condemn the land south of the Bushwick Inlet for a possible Olympic diving center and a waterfront park in the crumbling industrial neighborhood.
Then Mr. Victor found an obscure 1909 state law that lets utilities and railroads condemn and acquire land for their needs, including power projects. 
 The race to the courthouse was on. On June 26, Mr. Victor published a notice of his intention to condemn the eight-acre parcel where he hopes to build a 1,100-megawatt natural gas plant.
 Within weeks, the city filed a pre-emptive suit on July 19 in Brooklyn Supreme Court to condemn the same piece of land as part of its effort to establish a 35-acre park in Williamsburg.
 Both sides are predicting victory.
 ''We're confident that the court will grant our petition to acquire this property for park use,'' said Lisa Bova-Hiatt, a senior attorney at the city's Law Department. ''Once it's been acquired by the city, TransGas will be precluded from proposing another public use for the property.''
 But Sam M. Laniado, a lawyer for TransGas, said the city had failed to hold a required public hearing on its condemnation bid in its rush to short-circuit the TransGas condemnation. Mr. Victor is expected to challenge the city in court and pushed forward with his own proceeding.
 ''They got into the courthouse first,'' Mr. Laniado said, ''but they may get kicked out of court because they skipped some steps.'' 
 The TransGas plant got a boost recently when the New York Power Authority said it was on the short list of bidders for a license to build a plant within the city limits.
 The legal battle means there is no foreseeable end to the four-year dispute between Mr. Victor and City Hall.
 ''It is unconscionable that the city of New York would employ the most draconian of measures -- eminent domain -- to thwart economic development, rather than promote it,'' Mr. Victor said. ''The city would be better off fixing up the parkland it has on hand, rather than seeking to acquire more parkland for the sole purpose of stopping a project that's necessary for the city's economic future.''
 Bayside Fuel Oil Depot, which owns the land, prefers Mr. Victor's proposal to the city's, in part because the plant would pay more money, according to Vincent Allegretti, Bayside's senior vice president. 
 Some public officials acknowledged that the city needed power plants to meet the projected demands for reliable sources of electricity. But they contend that the TransGas project would stifle the redevelopment of the industrial waterfront along Williamsburg and Greenpoint, which offers spectacular views of Manhattan. The Bloomberg administration recently rezoned a 170-block swath of the neighborhood for high-rise residential and commercial development. A half-dozen developers have already put together large sites for projects.
 ''Approval of a big power plant in the waterfront area would jeopardize those projects,'' said City Councilman David Yassky, who represents the neighborhood.
 But Mr. Yassky said that Mr. Victor, who owns three Hummers, was both ''someone who believes strongly in energy consumption'' and a persistent entrepreneur.
 ''He's extremely tenacious,'' Mr. Yassky said. ''This project has already had six or seven strikes against it and he's still trying to get to first base.''
 In 2001, Mr. Victor, who made a fortune building a 2,500-megawatt power plant in Ithaca, first acquired an option to buy the grimy Williamsburg property from Bayside Fuel Oil for $50 million. Although power plants are about as popular as garbage transfer stations, he knew that state officials had identified a need for new generating plants within New York City that could help meet the growing demand for electricity.
 Mr. Victor initially designed a futuristic complex that included art galleries and a sculpture park, but continued to encounter opposition. After state energy regulators criticized Mr. Victor's plans last year, he redesigned the complex, putting the power plant underground, below a seven-acre park that he hoped would gain the support of city officials.
 But the city and Deputy Mayor Doctoroff, the architect of the city's failed bid for the 2012 Olympics, were unmoved.
 So in the spring, Mr. Victor jumped into the middle of the struggle over plans to build a football stadium for the Jets over the railyards on Manhattan's West Side. He outbid the Jets and threatened to undermine Mr. Doctoroff's plan for an Olympic stadium on the site, offering to pay the Metropolitan Transportation Authority $1.05 billion for the railyards. The M.T.A. ignored his offer.
 Mr. Victor vowed to persevere with his power plant. He said that he was not against a waterfront park, but that government has showed little ability to handle the parkland it already has. The state bought a five-acre parcel south of the TransGas site five years ago for the park that is little more than a rubble-strewn lot today. And the giant swimming pool at nearby McCarren Park has been closed since 1984, according to the Parks Department.

HEADLINE: Panel on Prison Rape Hears Victims' Chilling Accounts

BYLINE: By CAROLYN MARSHALL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 19 

 BODY:
T.J. Parsell was a lanky pimple-faced adolescent bent on mischief. So when he found a toy gun one evening in 1978 while wandering home from a high school party, he thought nothing of pointing it at a store clerk and grumbling, ''Your money or your life.''
 He got $50 for what he now calls ''a stupid impulsive prank.'' The incident landed the 17-year-old Parsell in an adult jail, where on his first night, an older inmate spiked his drink with Thorazine and sexually abused and raped him. 
''While my friends prepared for our high school prom, I was being gang raped,'' Mr. Parsell testified on Friday to a Congressional commission investigating prison sexual abuse and rape.
 Mr. Parsell, now 45, and a successful software executive who lives on Long Island, was one of six victims of prison rape to relate disturbing accounts with a bipartisan panel of The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission here. 
 ''What they took from me went beyond sex,'' Mr. Parsell said. ''They'd stolen my manhood, my identity and part of my soul.'' 
 The panel, which also heard from state and federal legislators, law enforcement and prison officials and mental health experts, has been investigating the prevalence, cause and possible solutions to a problem that many experts say has escalated as the prison system is collapsing. Overcrowding, staff shortages and budget cuts have contributed to an often taboo topic.
 ''As a society, we have an obligation to protect the people we lock up, even though they have harmed society,'' the commission chairman, Judge Reggie B. Walton of Federal District Court in Washington, said. ''Some people say inmates get what they deserve. But they don't think about the overall impact on society.''
 The body, created by the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, was appointed by President Bush in June 2004, focusing on questions like inmates' physical and mental problems after being released and economic burdens. 
 Judge Walton, speaking before the meeting here, the second in a national series, conceded in an interview that the government did not know the magnitude of prison rape.
 ''We don't really know the prevalence right now,'' he said. ''But I've been in the criminal justice system for 20 years and I have always believed the anecdotal evidence.''
 On July 31, the Justice Department released its first statistical report on prison rape and inmate sexual abuse, a report also required under the 2003 act. It estimated that there were at least 8,210 reported incidents of sexual abuse and rape a year within a prison population that exceeds 2.1million.
 According to the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, prison assaults rose 26 percent from 2000 to 2004.
 Kendell Spruce told the commission that he was infected with H.I.V. after having been raped at knifepoint in 1991 in an Arkansas state prison. Mr. Spruce, who was convicted of forging a check to buy cocaine, said that in one nine-month period he was raped by at least 27 inmates. He was 28 years old and weighed 123 pounds.
 ''The physical pain was devastating,'' he said. ''But the emotional pain was even worse.''
 A spokeswoman for the Arkansas Correction Department told The Associated Press that the accusations were untrue that that she believed that Mr. Spruce initiated the activity or was a willing participant. After his five-year term, Mr. Parsell returned to society as an addict of drugs, to ''drown out the memories and pain.'' 
 He continues to hold back tears as he says he still struggles with the emotional residue of rape, a crime that tarnished his self-esteem and ability to trust.
 Chance Martin, 50, an advocate for the homeless here, told the panel that he was incarcerated for 72 hours in April 1973, when he was arrested as an 18-year-old at a party where another guest had hashish. The charges were dropped, but Mr. Martin's three days in jail nearly ruined his life.
 ''On a purely emotional level,'' he said after testifying, ''I have issues with self-confidence and trust since that day.''
 Mr. Martin echoed others' statements when he faulted a deteriorating prison system and what he described as a society that is indifferent, and at times disdainful, of people who have been incarcerated.
 ''Prison rape is a symptom of American society's retreat from rehabilitation toward a system that relies purely on punishment,'' he said.
 The secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Roderick Q. Hickman, told the panel that California was trying to quantify the problem. But he said outdated prison designs, inadequate electronic surveillance systems and an antiquated computer database had stalled progress.
 The information technology ''system in California is completely inadequate,'' Mr. Hickman said. 
 ''We need a system that can report and handle the cultural classifications of the population.'' he added. 
 Mr. Hickman, appointed last month, said he was working to streamline and centralize procedures to investigate accusations of sexual abuse that were previously handled by individual prisons. 
 To address guard intransigence, the department has established training programs intended to break what Mr. Hickman called ''the code of silence'' among guards, behavior that has helped conceal prison rapes.
 Representative Barbara Lee, a California Democrat who was an initial co-sponsor of the 2003 law, equated prison rape with human rights violations. She and other prison rights advocates have stressed the need for ''zero tolerance'' and a corrections system that accommodates different sexual and cultural orientations.
 ''By doing nothing,'' Ms. Lee said, ''we condone this inhumane and abusive behavior. Indifference, deliberate or not, violates the Eight Amendment of the Constitution banning cruel and unusual punishment.''
 In the afternoon, the panel heard criminologists, law enforcement officials and leaders of transgender, lesbian, gay and bisexual groups about the need for better inmate classification.
 ''We don't want a first-time offender charged with drunken driving to be housed next to a guy who has committed multiple armed robberies, and who has been in and out of the system for years,'' said Bart Lanni, the sheriff's deputy for Los Angeles County.
 Mr. Lanni said misplaced inmates ran an increased risk of being a target of sexual abuse.
 ''Predators looking to rape someone tend to pick people without close ties or a gang affiliation,'' Dr. Terry A. Kupers, a psychiatrist and an expert on prison rape, said.
 All the victims testifying on Friday said that they might have escaped their rapes if the authorities had placed them with inmates of similar age, race, sexual orientation and the same categories of crime.

HEADLINE: The Oil Effect

 BODY:
Just when it was starting to seem as if consumers were really shaking off high energy prices, Wal-Mart announced this week that its profits stumbled in the second quarter, rising at their slowest rate in four years. Forced to choose between their closets and their gasoline tanks, Americans unsurprisingly chose their tanks. Wal-Mart warned that future sales would be curtailed as well, and no wonder: gasoline is now averaging $2.60 a gallon nationwide, nearly a 39 percent increase from last year. At the same time, natural gas prices are up 60 percent to 90 percent around the country, presaging steep home-heating bills in the months ahead on top of high prices at the pump. 
 With most other prices relatively tame, consumers could weather the energy squeeze if they had a cushion. They don't.
 Wage gains for most Americans are barely keeping up with inflation. And according to a recent Commerce Department report, Americans, on average, are now saving nothing each month, so they obviously cannot pay higher energy bills by reducing the amount they save. 
 That leaves rising home values to cover growing energy costs. According to a recent report by John Makin, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, the housing boom has offset the economic drag of higher oil prices by enabling homeowners to get cash through refinancing or selling at a profit, and by creating a ''wealth effect'': as their houses appreciate, homeowners feel rich and thus spend freely, even as they neglect to save.
 Mr. Makin estimates that a mere leveling off of housing prices would be sufficient to remove the economic boost from real estate. That would slow consumer spending and, with it, the economy. 
 No one knows when that leveling off will occur. But homes are already becoming increasingly unaffordable, and refinancings are slowing down. There are early signs that banks are beginning to tighten their lending standards. And the Federal Reserve, which has been trying for more than a year to push up mortgage rates, will probably succeed in that endeavor at some point.
 The pain that now seems imminent might have been avoided. Conservation could have reduced energy demand and prices, while properly targeted job growth and savings incentives -- not tax cuts for the rich -- could have built a stronger job recovery, helping to foster higher wages and new savings. Maybe next time around.

HEADLINE: Falling Costs of Big-Screen TV's to Keep Falling

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
In consumer electronics, as in much of life, good things happen to those who wait -- good things as in plunging prices.
 The cost of big-screen televisions, which have been steadily dropping by about 25 percent a year, are now expected to fall even more sharply this autumn, according to industry analysts. The coming markdowns reflect a singular confluence of business trends that will benefit consumers going into the holiday season.
''Prices are pretty much in a free fall,'' said David Naranjo, who tracks the television industry for DisplaySearch, a market research firm.
 The best evidence of this is the expectation of analysts that in the next few weeks the Panasonic unit of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company will announce that it is dropping prices as much as $500 on plasma-screen TV's that retail for around $3,500. 
 Panasonic officials refused this week to confirm or deny the speculation, but because it sells the most plasma screens in the United States, a potential downward adjustment would be considered a harbinger of a price war for all varieties of big-screen TV's. 
 The chief executive of the Syntax Groups, James Li, maker of the Olevia brand of flat-panel TV's, said, ''If they go to $3,000, I will go to $2,999.''
 All this spells good news for anyone thinking about upgrading from the old cathode-ray TV to screens that are 40 inches or larger in the three most popular formats. Full-featured plasma TV's with 50-inch screens that sold for $20,000 five years ago could edge close to $4,000 this season. A liquid-crystal-display version and a rear-projection TV with a digital light-processing chip will be considerably less, closing in on $1,800. 
 That does not mean choosing a TV will be easy. No longer is it just a matter of price and size. There are no fewer than eight competing technologies, as well as different screen sizes and display standards that force you to grapple with a shape-shifting matrix of at least a dozen dimensions.
 Let's try to cut through that. It used to be that liquid-crystal-display technology was for small screens, plasma for medium, and digital light processing for large. Though the TV's with digital light processing have been the best value, plasma had the technological advantage and could sell for more because screens were big and flat. Now L.C.D.'s are as large and D.L.P. TV's are flatter. 
 As the technologies overlap in the 32-inch to 46-inch screen sizes, the price differences narrow. A price cut in one technology forces cuts on the others, too.
 While these changes make any purchasing decision more complex, the resulting markdowns should compensate for the headaches. ''The consumer really holds the ace in this game,'' said Jonas Tanenbaum, director of flat-panel and direct-view marketing for Samsung Electronics North America. 
 The problem with buying any new technology is that tomorrow it will be cheaper -- and better. So why not wait some more? When you buy a depreciating asset, it always makes sense to wait as long as you can. But at this stage in the introduction of big-screen high-definition TV sets, consumers are unlikely to get whipsawed by radical new technology that leaves them regretting their purchase. 
 This year there are several compelling reasons for trading up to a bigger TV, especially one that offers high-definition. Nascar and the National Football League have begun broadcasting events in high-definition. (When it comes to $2,000 TV-purchasing decisions, surveys show men control the purse strings.) 
 The TV networks are broadcasting more high-definition content, but it isn't all that exciting to watch Paul Kangas read the ''Nightly Business Report'' on PBS in crisp clarity. Seeing the sweat knocked off the face of a sacked quarterback could be a thrill. 
 Content matters. ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' began broadcasting in 1961, but manufacturers recall that sales of color TV's did not take off until the mid-1960's, after the broadcasters put most of their programming in color. 
 Driving big-screen prices below $2,000 -- about what a color TV cost in the late 1960's, adjusting for inflation -- is also expected to increase demand this year. A number of factors are causing that to happen faster than anyone expected. Manufacturers in China and Taiwan, the so-called Tier 3 makers that few consumers have ever heard of like Vestel, Changchong or Xoceco, are dropping heavily discounted L.C.D. TV's into general merchandise stores like Costco and Wal-Mart or at online discounters.
 Manufacturers with high profit margins have as much to fear from Texas. Dell is applying to TV's the low-cost supply chain and direct-to-consumer sales model that struck such envy and dread in the personal computer industry. While others were selling 42-inch plasma screens for $7,000, it blasted into the market with one for $3,500. It can do that because it does well on margins around 16 percent. 
 The well-known Japanese and Korean manufacturers, with margins closer to 40 percent, are finding they must trim prices or lose sales. Some are trying to get retailers to trim their margins of about 10 percent to offer TV's for even less. Dell is now selling the 42-inch high-definition plasma screen for $2,600 and the company suggests it could go lower as it gets further deals on components.
 Michael Farello, Dell's vice president for United States consumer electronics, said he was recently looking at Dell ads from the mid-1990's comparing its $3,500 PC's with other makers' units at $6,000. ''This isn't the first time this has happened,'' he said.
 Amid all this new competition, new factories in Asia are cranking out flat-panel displays. Economic theory holds that as volumes go up, costs go down. TV manufacturers can lower prices and cover the cost of the expensive new plants with the increased volume of TV set sales. But too many of the big makers decided to build plants, so now there is an oversupply of plasma screens that threatens to grow even larger. That will force manufacturers like Panasonic, Philips Electronics, the Samsung Electronics Company and the Sony Corporation to cut prices even more to soak up some of that overproduction through the rest of this decade. 
 ''Price is being led by capacity,'' says Gary Merson, editor of the HDTV Insider newsletter.
 Aren't you glad you waited?


Liquid crystal display (L.C.D.): Voltage rearranges liquid crystal molecules, allowing light to pass though. Good in brightlight and tight-space environments.

Rear-projection digital light display (D.L.P.): Tiny mirrors on a chip bounce light onto the screen thousand of times a second, providing blackest blacks and detail of objects in motion.

Plasma: Gas in glass panel excited by electricity to produce color. Still the space-saving technology coveted most by couch potatoes.

What's on the market

Liquid crystal display (L.C.D.): 42-INCH SCREEN: $2,850-$6,600
Rear-projection digital light display (D.L.P.): 50-INCH: $1,170-$4,000

HEADLINE: This Bear Is Running (To the Bank)

BYLINE: By Conrad de Aenlle

 BODY:
THE stock market is supposed to climb a wall of worry, and there is no shortage of unsettling developments today to nip irrational exuberance in the bud. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates every chance it gets, job growth seems either too fast or too slow, the growth of the current-account deficit is just too fast, and don't forget $66 oil.
 David W. Tice is one fund manager who is not worrying. He is confident about the direction of the market, even though he has far less to show for the 50 percent-plus gains in the Nasdaq and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since the fall of 2002 than almost all of his peers. 
It's not that Mr. Tice thinks the fretters are agitated over nothing. It's that the direction he is confident that stocks will take is down.
 Mr. Tice runs the Prudent Bear fund, which seeks to benefit from declining share prices. There have been precious few of those for him to latch onto lately, but there is no need to pity him or his shareholders, especially after taking account of the fund's returns stretching further back than the recent period of outsize gains in equities.
 Prudent Bear is the best performer over five years among 23 bear-market funds tracked by Morningstar. The fund recorded an annualized gain of 12.31 percent, compared with a return of 0.76 percent for the average bear fund. The average domestic equity fund in Morningstar's database, the ordinary kind that seeks to profit from rising prices, shows virtually no five-year gain or loss.
 Mr. Tice says that we are headed for a period that will treat investors more like the miserable years of 2001 and 2002 than the more pleasant time since then.
 ''I'm as bearish as ever,'' he said. ''I'm all beared up.''
 Mr. Tice views stocks as being ''in a topping process within a correction in a secular bear market,'' the next phase of which will be propelled by several factors, in his opinion, but especially one.
 ''We're in a credit bubble that is going to cripple the economy,'' he warned. That bubble has been driving up prices of assets like stocks and real estate, while interest rates and prices of goods and services have remained stable, creating what he sees as a false sense of economic well-being. We have been here before, he noted.
 ''It's not that difficult a concept, but it's crucial,'' Mr. Tice said. ''Look at what happened in the United States in the 20's and Japan in the late 80's. There were asset bubbles with low interest rates that ended up in very bad economic periods for more than 10 years.''
 Investors are not prepared for such lean times, he said, questioning just how limited their enthusiasm really is. He suggested that there is palpable euphoria, much as in the late 1990's, only this time it is being churned up by the real estate market instead of Internet stocks.
 Mr. Tice is preparing for hard times by selling short financial issues -- Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and J.P. Morgan Chase are three he especially disdains -- as well as faded blue chips like General Motors and Eastman Kodak.
 He says he expects to add homebuilders to his list of shorts but is waiting for the right moment. Two sectors that he has no immediate intention of selling are technology and energy, and he is long precious metals stocks, which often rise when the broad market falls.
 Unlike the typical bear fund, which picks a stock index, then uses derivatives like futures and options contracts to achieve a return opposite that of the index, Prudent Bear is actively managed.
 So when the Internet bubble popped, he shorted dot-coms with both hands and let alone stable sectors that experienced a flight to quality. He was also able to lighten up on his short positions after the market bottomed out and started to recover.
 He likes to stress that he is not a permanent committed bear, no matter what the fund is called, and that even he will get excited about owning stocks one day. But not until imbalances in the economy are corrected and share prices have moved a lot lower.
 ''Eventually I can see myself turning bullish,'' Mr. Tice said, ''but it's going to be a long time from now.''

HEADLINE: JURY CALLS MERCK LIABLE IN DEATH OF MAN ON VIOXX

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

DATELINE: ANGLETON, Tex., Aug. 19 

 BODY:
In the first verdict of a personal injury lawsuit involving the pain drug Vioxx, a Texas jury found the drug's maker, Merck, liable and said the widow of a man who died in 2001 after taking the drug should be awarded $253.5 million.
 After deliberating for a day and a half, the jury gave Robert C. Ernst's widow, Carol, $24.5 million for mental anguish and economic losses. Jurors also said she should be awarded an additional $229 million in punitive damages after finding that Merck acted recklessly in selling Vioxx despite having knowledge of the drug's heart risks.
Under Texas law capping punitive damages, though, that part of the penalty will automatically be limited to $1.6 million, meaning the overall award would not exceed $26.1 million and could be reduced by Texas appellate courts. 
 With a flood of Vioxx lawsuits soon to reach juries, the verdict may have important implications for Merck, other makers of the similar painkiller drugs and the entire industry, lawyers and analysts said. [Page C1.] 
 In interviews after the decision, jurors said they had made the large punitive award to send a message that drug makers must disclose the risks of their medicines.
 ''Respect us, that's the message,'' said Derrick Chizer, a juror. ''Respect us.''
 Ten of the 12 jurors voted for the plaintiff, the minimum number required to make an award under Texas law. Judge Ben Hardin of the Texas District Court announced the verdict at the Brazoria County Courthouse in Angleton, about 40 miles south of downtown Houston. 
 When Judge Hardin finished reading, Mrs. Ernst, her family, and her lawyers erupted in cheers and began to hug one another. 
 ''The justice system in America works and it works very well,'' W. Mark Lanier, the lead lawyer for Mrs. Ernst, said outside the courtroom. 
 In a news conference after the verdict, Mrs. Ernst, 60, said that the case, which began three years ago, had been stressful but that she was pleased with the outcome.
 ''This has been a long road for me,'' she said. ''I just know that it was a road that I had to run and I had to finish.''
 Jonathan Skidmore, a lawyer for Merck, the nation's third-largest drug maker, said that the company would appeal and that it believed it had properly researched and marketed Vioxx.
 ''We believe the plaintiff did not meet the standard set by Texas law to prove Vioxx caused Mr. Ernst's death,'' Mr. Skidmore said.
 More than 4,000 Vioxx-related cases have already been filed, and lawyers say that they expect 20,000 to 100,000 will eventually be filed. 
 State trials are scheduled to begin in the next few months in New Jersey and possibly California and Alabama, with the first federal trial planned for November in New Orleans. Lawyers for both sides say the suits will probably be handled individually rather than as class actions.
 Merck has said it will fight every Vioxx lawsuit in court rather than settle cases and it reiterated that stance in a statement issued after the verdict was announced.
 But Friday's verdict illustrates the dangers of that strategy, especially because Mr. Ernst's case had been viewed as relatively weak, lawyers said. For Merck, the verdict is a severe blow, said Peter Bicks, a defense lawyer with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, a New York law firm not involved in the case.
 ''It is a very serious problem, because future plaintiffs' lawyers now have a road map for the case completely laid out for them,'' Mr. Bicks said. ''Apparently, Lanier was successful in painting the company as one that put profits over health and hid information.''
 Merck shares fell $2.35, or 7.7 percent, to close at $28.06 after the verdict was announced. The drop erased about $5 billion from Merck's market capitalization.
 Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., has not yet set aside any money to cover its Vioxx liabilities, but it has put aside $675 million to cover legal expenses related to its defense.
 More than 20 million people had taken Vioxx before the company took the drug off the market last September after a clinical trial indicated that Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks or strokes in patients taking it for longer than 18 months. The pain drug had annual sales of $2.5 billion until it was withdrawn.
 But critics had been saying for years that Vioxx posed safety risks. And during the trial, documents and e-mail messages from Merck scientists disclosed discussions of Vioxx's potential heart risks as early as 1997, more than two years before the company began selling the drug. 
 Similar concerns have shadowed Bextra and Celebrex, two other similar painkillers made by Pfizer. Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, stopped selling Bextra in April; Celebrex remains on the market but now has a prominent warning of its heart dangers.
 The jury's decision also highlights the legal dangers that drug makers face when they aggressively advertise their medicines to consumers, a practice that spread widely in the late 1990's.
 Mr. Lanier repeatedly attacked Merck's marketing practices during the trial, and jurors said that message resonated with them. 
 ''We expect accountability; we expect them to be open with us; we expect them to be honest with us,'' said Marsha Robbins, the forewoman of the jury.
 But Dr. Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School and frequent critic of the drug industry, said he did not expect that companies would necessarily cut back on advertising. Since 1997, Wyeth, another major drug company, has made payments it estimates will eventually total $21 billion to settle lawsuits related to deaths caused by its diet drugs, yet Merck did not seem to learn from Wyeth, Dr. Avorn said.
 ''It is almost as if the next-quarter, bottom-line sales mentality kicks in as soon as the shock of the verdict fades,'' he said.
 Still, he said, the decision might encourage companies to rethink the way they advertise. Already, some companies have said they will disclose risks more prominently when they advertise drugs directly to consumers.
 ''Maybe we will see incremental change,'' Dr. Avorn said.
 The case in Angleton pitted a team led by Mr. Lanier, a part-time Baptist preacher who is considered one of the top trial lawyers in the United States, against a small legal army for Merck that included lawyers from two major corporate law firms, Williams & Connolly and Fulbright & Jaworski.
 Throughout the trial, Mr. Lanier's folksy style seemed to resonate with jurors, while Gerry Lowry and David Kiernan, Merck's lead lawyers, appeared to struggle to connect.
 ''Merck's lawyers underestimated Lanier,'' said David Berg, a Houston lawyer and author of ''The Trial Lawyer: What It Takes to Win'' (American Bar Association, 2003). ''Those of us who've watched him in the courtroom know that win or lose, he is one of the best trial lawyers in the country.''
 Merck's defense in the case was centered on the fact that Mr. Ernst's autopsy found that he died of an arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. Clinical trials have not linked Vioxx to arrhythmias. For that reason, many lawyers had predicted that Mr. Lanier might have a difficult time winning the case.
 But Mr. Lanier argued that Mr. Ernst's fatal arrhythmia was actually produced by a heart attack that killed him so quickly it did not produce muscle damage visible in the autopsy. It was Vioxx, Mr. Lanier said, that caused a blood clot that produced the heart attack. 
 Jurors said they accepted Mr. Lanier's argument in part because of testimony from Dr. Maria Araneta, the coroner who conducted Mr. Ernst's autopsy. In a videotaped deposition played before the jury, Dr. Araneta said she believed that a blood clot killed Mr. Ernst, even though her autopsy report did not mention a clot.
 Some jurors also said they were alienated by Ms. Lowry's 90-minute-long cross-examination of Mrs. Ernst midway through the trial, asking questions the jurors found insensitive and irrelevant. They said they were also bothered by Ms. Lowry's contention in her closing argument that Mrs. Ernst would be happy with a verdict for Merck, because it would reduce her professed sense of guilt for having suggested to her husband that he ask his doctor about Vioxx. 
 ''That was wrong of them,'' said Matthew Pallardy, a juror.
 In its statement Friday, Merck said it might base its appeal on whether Judge Hardin had wrongly allowed irrelevant or scientifically flawed testimony.
 ''We believe that we have strong points to raise on appeal,'' Kenneth C. Frazier, Merck's general counsel, said in the statement. ''There are other Vioxx cases coming to trial and we will vigorously defend them.''
 Standing outside the Brazoria County Courthouse for a news conference after the verdict, Mr. Lanier said that he hoped to participate in the New Jersey case that goes to trial this fall and that he would be glad to try more cases if Merck will not settle.
 ''My message to Merck is: You want to go again?'' he said. ''We're just getting warmed up.''

 In the case of Ernst vs. Merck, the judge told jurors to ask themselves three basic questions on their way to a verdict. Here are those questions, with summaries of the plaintiff's position and Merck's defense.
 If the jury answered yes to any of these questions, they were then to decide how much money to award the widow of Robert C. Ernst for his lost wages and her mental anguish. The jury awarded the widow, Carol Ernst, $24.5 million.
 Having reached that point, the jury was to decide whether Merck had acted recklessly and with conscious indifference to human life, in which case jurors were to decide whether to award punitive damages. They awarded Mrs. Ernst $229 million.

QUESTIONS TO THE JURY
Did Merck fail to warn doctors about Vioxx's dangers, and did that failure cause the death of Robert Ernst?

MERCK'S POSITION
Merck properly disclosed all information about Vioxx's heart risks, including data from a 2000 clinical trial that showed Vioxx caused five times as many heart attacks as naproxen, an older painkiller.

PLAINTIFF'S POSITION
Merck hid data from clinical trials that did not back its position and failed to conduct studies that would have quickly proved Vioxx's risks.

QUESTIONS TO THE JURY
Could Vioxx have been designed in a way that made it less risky?

MERCK'S POSITION
All drugs, including Vioxx, have risks.

PLAINTIFF'S POSITION
Vioxx was far more dangerous than older drugs like naproxen, and Merck should never have sold it.

PLAINTIFF'S POSITION
Did Merck cause Robert Ernst to die?

MERCK'S POSITION
Mr. Ernst died of an irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, and no studies have ever linked Vioxx to irregular heartbeats.

QUESTIONS TO THE JURY
Mr. Ernst actually died of a heart attack that killed him so quickly it did not produce heart muscle damage visible on an autopsy. Vioxx has been linked to heart attacks.

HEADLINE: Sick and Scared, and Waiting, Waiting, Waiting

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Freddie Odlum spent two terrible days waiting by the phone for her doctor to call. She had had a CT scan to investigate a suspicious mass in her lungs and Ms. Odlum, a Los Angeles breast cancer patient, was all too aware that if the cancer had spread, her prognosis would not be good. 
 Her doctor, she said, informed her that he was going on vacation in two days and ''that we needed to 'wrap this up' before he left for a few weeks.''
''All those cliches when someone is facing a terminal diagnosis are used because they are true,'' she said. ''Racing pulse, dry mouth, total self-preoccupation with what-ifs to the point that real life doesn't exist, willing the phone to ring.'' 
 But her doctor did not call.
 The next day, the day he was leaving, she left phone messages at his office and sent an e-mail message saying, ''Don't leave without calling me with the results.''
 ''That night I waited,'' she said, ''jumping at every noise, not letting anyone use the phone, imagining every scenario.'' 
 Her doctor left for his vacation. He never called, not even when he returned.
 The scan did not show cancer, but she could not forgive her doctor.
 ''This internist had been my family doctor for years,'' Ms. Odlum said. ''This physician's wife had breast cancer and was treated by the same oncologist as me.''
 How could someone whose wife had breast cancer not realize the impact of being left hanging, she asked, adding, ''I never spoke to him again.''
 Waiting has long been part of medicine. Patients like Ms. Odlum wait for test results; others spend weeks or months waiting for appointments or stranded for hours in doctors' waiting rooms. 
 But health care researchers say the waiting problem has only gotten worse. Advances in technology have created more tests and procedures to wait for, and new drugs and treatments mean more people need more doctor visits. Doctors' appointments for people over 45 increased by more than 20 percent in the last decade, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Emergency room visits increased by 23 percent, although the number of hospitals declined by 15 percent.
 Some doctors say they doublebook appointments to make up for patient cancellations. And doctors say they are pulled in so many directions that, in many cases, long waits are unavoidable.
 ''There is nothing magic about waiting,'' said Dr. Charles K. Francis, president of the American College of Physicians. 
 ''Most of us have patients in the hospital and patients in the office,'' Dr. Francis said. ''Then the patient has to go to the lab, and medicine is unpredictable.''
 He added that insurance companies reimbursed doctors at lower rates than in the past, resulting in intense pressure to see large numbers of patients. ''You have to work long hours and see more patients just to keep your office open,'' he said.
 Recently, however, patients, some doctors and researchers have begun to ask why medicine cannot be as accountable to its customers as any other business. And some doctors' offices and hospitals are starting to solve their waiting problems by applying techniques that businesses use.
 Change cannot come too soon for irate patients like Howard Levine of Boca Raton, Fla., who endured a two-hour wait before storming out of a vascular surgeon's office. 
 ''I was in the restaurant business for 20 years, and if I made you wait in a restaurant for two hours, you would be pretty upset,'' Mr. Levine said. ''We're not coming there for social visits. We're coming because something is wrong.''
 While all waits can be frustrating or even infuriating, the worst, many patients say, are when they fear getting bad news. 
 ''The hardest waiting,'' said Pam Breakey, a cancer patient in Michigan, was the five weeks from when she initially suspected she had breast cancer until the day she started treatment. Cancer was always on her mind. And everything required waiting: appointments with the oncologist, the surgeon and ''test after test, I stopped counting at 20.''
 There was waiting ''to learn if the cancer had spread,'' she continued. ''It had. Then waiting to learn about the cancer cells themselves. Waiting, waiting, waiting.''
 Her friends would call, she said, ''and I have nothing to tell them.''
 Her husband looked at her with anxiety, her daughter's voice was tight with fear. It is, she said, ''like waiting to find out if a jury has convicted you of something awful.''
 Yet while little can be done about the fact that test results can be scary, health care researchers and doctors say a lot can be done to improve the delivery of results so patients are not left waiting for days or even weeks. And a lot can be done to improve waits for appointments and in doctors' offices and emergency rooms. 
 Everyone can change, says Dr. Mark Murray of Sacramento, whose company, Mark Murray & Associates, helps doctors eliminate waits. ''It goes back to motivation. The principles, the strategies are pretty basic.''

A Doctor Sees the Other Side
 As a physician himself, Dr. Philip Greenland, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at the University of Michigan, had always gotten deferential treatment from other doctors. If he wanted an appointment, he would page a colleague and ask to be seen that day. He never waited for test results or for doctors to call.
 His epiphany came when his 89-year-old mother broke her hip.
 Dr. Greenland and his brother flew to Maryland where their mother was hospitalized, arriving late on a Saturday night.
 ''On Sunday at 6 a.m., I said to my brother: 'We ought to get to the hospital. This doctor is an orthopedic surgeon, and he will make rounds early. If we're not there, we won't see him.'
 ''By noon,'' Dr. Greenland said, ''it was apparent to me that we won't see this guy.'' A nurse told him that the doctor had been there and gone.
 ''I was in total shock,'' he said. ''I said to the nurse: 'Get him on the phone. Page him, wherever he is.''' 
 The nurse paged the orthopedist, but he told her that he was going into surgery and that she should ask Dr. Greenland what his question was. When he had time, the orthopedist said, he would give the nurse his answer and she could relay it to Dr. Greenland. That only made Dr. Greenland madder. ''I said: 'That's not acceptable. My questions depend on his answers and I will not play telephone tag all day.'''
 Dr. Greenland never got the prompt attention he wanted from the orthopedist. And he was shaken.
 ''What was shocking about this experience to me is that it's almost the only time in my life since I've become a doctor 35 years ago that I ever experienced medicine directly, from the patient's point of view,'' he said. ''What this tells me is that the profession has lost sight of what medicine is all about. It's not about them. It's not about their schedule. It's about the patient.''
 He added: ''Doctors are not victims here. If they are unable to handle the workload, they need more help. If it means inconvenience, they have to live with it.''

No Waiting Here
 After five years of practicing medicine, Dr. L. Gordon Moore was miserable. His schedule was out of control, patients were piling up in his Rochester waiting room, and they were seething.
 ''I was starting every patient visit late and rushing to see the next patient,'' he said. ''I was staying two hours late at the end of the day. And I was thinking, This is my career?'' 
 But when Dr. Moore asked around to see if there was another way, he was told, he said, to ''suck it up.''
 When he heard about an idea to apply industrial engineering principles to doctors' offices, he investigated the flow of work in his own office. 
 For example, he asked, what happens when a patient calls needing a prescription refilled? A secretary writes a note. When a pile of notes accumulates, the secretary pulls the patients' charts and delivers them to a nurse. The nurse divides them into two piles, urgent and nonurgent. It could take a day and a half before a nonurgent refill is called in. Meanwhile, the chart could be in any of 39 places in the office.
 Dr. Moore opted for radical change. He quit his three-doctor practice and started a new one.
 ''I started with one room, an exam table and no employees, just me,'' he said.
 Instead of having about 2,000 patients, he cut back to 500. Not only did he get rid of waiting times, but, by getting rid of most of his office and all of his staff, he eliminated his overhead, making his practice affordable. 
 But few doctors are ready for such a solution. Most, Dr. Murray says, tell him, ''Waiting times are not bad, waiting times are acceptable.''
 That attitude, he noted, is part of the culture of medicine. 
 ''It grows out of that insularity that we get to decide who waits and who doesn't,'' Dr. Murray said. 
 He said that delays often started with the way an office was run. Doctors assume, he explained, that the most efficient office is filled with waiting patients, like a company making sure its warehouses are always full. But companies have learned that there is a cost to keeping warehouses full. The same principle applies to doctors' offices.
 People get mad, Dr. Murray said. And at some point, patients start to leave. 
 Long delays are why Roberta Weintraub left her doctor. Ms. Weintraub, of Beverly Hills, Calif., said that her internist was first-rate, but that the waits had become intolerable -- up to an hour and a half in the waiting room, then 20 to 30 minutes in the examining room. And, she said, there was the wait for testing and the wait to get test results. ''I got to a point in my life where I could afford not to put up with that,'' Ms. Weintraub said.
 Now she pays $1,800 a year to be a patient in a concierge practice, in which patients pay an extra fee and, in return, get prompt attention. Ms. Weinstein's new internist, Dr. Judith P. Delafield, says she was unable to prevent waits when she was part of a conventional practice and seeing 2,000 patients. 
 ''The handwriting was on the wall for me,'' Dr. Delafield said. ''It was that everyday packing of your waiting room because you have to see a certain number of patients.'' Now she restricts her practice to 600 patients. 
 ''All in all, you can control your life so you can be on time,'' she added. ''It's a matter of respect.''

Long Waits in the E.R.
 Last fall, on a day when her husband was restless and violent, Peggi Durand knew she had to take him to the hospital for a possible admission to the geriatric psychiatry ward. At age 59, John Durand has suffered from dementia for seven years and Ms. Durand has cared for him.
 She and her husband arrived at an emergency room near their home in Malden, Mass., at 9:30 a.m. They began their wait.
 ''John was agitated when we got there, and the longer we were there, the worse it got,'' Ms. Durand said. 
 ''We were still in the emergency room at 3:30 in the afternoon,'' she recalled. ''There were just waits -- waiting for a social worker to interview him, waiting for a psychiatrist. Then they had to get his room ready.''
 Their wait, while long, was not unusual, researchers say.
 In one study, Dr. Steven M. Asch, a health care researcher at the RAND Corporation and the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and his colleagues observed that 40 percent of emergency room patients waited longer than an hour to see a doctor.
 That, of course, is often only the beginning. Patients can wait for a bed, wait to be admitted, wait for a scan. Typically, Dr. Asch and others say, patients end up waiting for hours, even a day.
 Hospitals often ask for forbearance. Long waits arise, they say, because there are no beds or a flood of patients coming in.
 But increasingly, economic factors are causing hospitals to worry more about long delays. And some hospitals are paying for consultants to help them reduce waits. 
 The emergency room can be a lucrative source of patients, said Dr. Saum Sutaria of McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, with some hospitals making $2,000 to $3,000 for every patient admitted through the emergency room and $250 to $750 for each patient who is treated and goes home. But when hospitals get so backed up that they have no more intensive care beds, they go on diversion, sending patients to other hospitals. 
 ''That is very painful for the hospital,'' said Paul Mango, a McKinsey executive, but he added that some hospitals were on diversion 25 percent of the time.
 The result is a booming business for companies like McKinsey. The company finds problems everywhere. 
 For example, Mr. Mango says, over half the time, when surgery patients showed up for their operations, simple requirements, like taking a medical history, were not met. Mr. Mango has even seen patients arrive, as scheduled, at 5:30 a.m., only to have the admitting staff discover that they still need laboratory tests. But the laboratory does not open until 7 a.m.. So everyone waits.
 ''It costs $60 a minute for an idle operating room,'' Mr. Mango says. ''There will be three or four operating room technicians, an anesthesiologist and a surgeon waiting for a patient who couldn't get through the admissions process.''
 Another common problem is that doctors wait until the end of the day to discharge patients, locking up a bed all day. But discharging patients does not help an emergency room unless someone tells the emergency room that a bed is free. ''Rarely are there good communications,'' said Dr. Russ Richmond, also with McKinsey.
 For patients, these explanations are hardly enough.
 Pam Stephan of Austin, Tex., went to her local hospital near collapse. She had had chemotherapy, had developed a fever, and now she was gasping for breath. Her oncology center had put her off for days before she could get an appointment. Once there, she waited for hours, and then learned that she was dangerously anemic. ''Go to the hospital for a blood transfusion,'' she was told.
 She arrived at the hospital at 5 p.m., but all the rooms were full and the wait was expected to be several hours. Ms. Stephan and her husband went home, an hour's drive, returning hours later. 
 ''Then began a long stream of paperwork, and questions, and more blood tests, and by 2 a.m., I actually started the three-pint blood transfusion,'' Ms. Stephan said.
 ''I was glad to be through with waiting,'' she added. But by then, she said, she was so sick and so exhausted that ''dying would have been too much trouble.''

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about patients' growing waits for medical treatment and test results misstated the affiliation of Dr. Philip Greenland, who told of a frustrating effort to see an orthopedist when his 89-year-old mother broke her hip. He is chairman of the preventive medicine department at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern, not at the University of Michigan.
A front-page article on Aug. 20 about patients' growing waits for medical treatment and test results gave an outdated title for Dr. Charles K. Francis, who said doctors were pulled in so many directions that delays were often unavoidable. He is director of the Office of Health Disparities at the New York Academy of Medicine; his term as president of the American College of Physicians ended in April.

HEADLINE: The Breaking Point

BYLINE: By Peter Maass. 
Peter Maass is a contributing writer. He is writing a book about oil.

 BODY:
The largest oil terminal in the world, Ras Tanura, is located on the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia, along the Persian Gulf. From Ras Tanura's control tower, you can see the classic totems of oil's dominion -- supertankers coming and going, row upon row of storage tanks and miles and miles of pipes. Ras Tanura, which I visited in June, is the funnel through which nearly 10 percent of the world's daily supply of petroleum flows. Standing in the control tower, you are surrounded by more than 50 million barrels of oil, yet not a drop can be seen.
 The oil is there, of course. In a technological sleight of hand, oil can be extracted from the deserts of Arabia, processed to get rid of water and gas, sent through pipelines to a terminal on the gulf, loaded onto a supertanker and shipped to a port thousands of miles away, then run through a refinery and poured into a tanker truck that delivers it to a suburban gas station, where it is pumped into an S.U.V. -- all without anyone's actually glimpsing the stuff. So long as there is enough oil to fuel the global economy, it is not only out of sight but also out of mind, at least for consumers. 
 I visited Ras Tanura because oil is no longer out of mind, thanks to record prices caused by refinery shortages and surging demand -- most notably in the United States and China -- which has strained the capacity of oil producers and especially Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter of all. Unlike the 1973 crisis, when the embargo by the Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries created an artificial shortfall, today's shortage, or near-shortage, is real. If demand surges even more, or if a producer goes offline because of unrest or terrorism, there may suddenly not be enough oil to go around. 
 As Aref al-Ali, my escort from Saudi Aramco, the giant state-owned oil company, pointed out, ''One mistake at Ras Tanura today, and the price of oil will go up.'' This has turned the port into a fortress; its entrances have an array of gates and bomb barriers to prevent terrorists from cutting off the black oxygen that the modern world depends on. Yet the problem is far greater than the brief havoc that could be wrought by a speeding zealot with 50 pounds of TNT in the trunk of his car. Concerns are being voiced by some oil experts that Saudi Arabia and other producers may, in the near future, be unable to meet rising world demand. The producers are not running out of oil, not yet, but their decades-old reservoirs are not as full and geologically spry as they used to be, and they may be incapable of producing, on a daily basis, the increasing volumes of oil that the world requires. ''One thing is clear,'' warns Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, in a series of new advertisements, ''the era of easy oil is over.''
 In the past several years, the gap between demand and supply, once considerable, has steadily narrowed, and today is almost negligible. The consequences of an actual shortfall of supply would be immense. If consumption begins to exceed production by even a small amount, the price of a barrel of oil could soar to triple-digit levels. This, in turn, could bring on a global recession, a result of exorbitant prices for transport fuels and for products that rely on petrochemicals -- which is to say, almost every product on the market. The impact on the American way of life would be profound: cars cannot be propelled by roof-borne windmills. The suburban and exurban lifestyles, hinged to two-car families and constant trips to work, school and Wal-Mart, might become unaffordable or, if gas rationing is imposed, impossible. Carpools would be the least imposing of many inconveniences; the cost of home heating would soar -- assuming, of course, that climate-controlled habitats do not become just a fond memory.
 But will such a situation really come to pass? That depends on Saudi Arabia. To know the answer, you need to know whether the Saudis, who possess 22 percent of the world's oil reserves, can increase their country's output beyond its current limit of 10.5 million barrels a day, and even beyond the 12.5-million-barrel target it has set for 2009. (World consumption is about 84 million barrels a day.) Saudi Arabia is the sole oil superpower. No other producer possesses reserves close to its 263 billion barrels, which is almost twice as much as the runner-up, Iran, with 133 billion barrels. New fields in other countries are discovered now and then, but they tend to offer only small increments. For example, the much-contested and as-yet-unexploited reserves in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge are believed to amount to about 10 billion barrels, or just a fraction of what the Saudis possess. 
 But the truth about Saudi oil is hard to figure out. Oil reservoirs cannot be inventoried like wood in a wilderness: the oil is underground, unseen by geologists and engineers, who can, at best, make highly educated guesses about how much is underfoot and how much can be extracted in the future. And there is a further obstacle: the Saudis will not let outsiders audit their confidential data on reserves and production. Oil is an industry in which not only is the product hidden from sight but so is reliable information about it. And because we do not know when a supply-demand shortfall might arrive, we do not know when to begin preparing for it, so as to soften its impact; the economic blow may come as a sledgehammer from the darkness.
 Of course the Saudis do have something to say about this prospect. Before journeying to the kingdom, I went to Washington to hear the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, speak at an energy conference in the mammoth Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, not far from the White House. Naimi was the star attraction at a gathering of the American petro-political nexus. Samuel Bodman, the U.S. energy secretary, was on the dais next to him. David O'Reilly, chairman and C.E.O. of Chevron, was waiting in the wings. The moderator was an eminence grise of the oil world, James Schlesinger, a former energy secretary, defense secretary and C.I.A. director.
 ''I want to assure you here today that Saudi Arabia's reserves are plentiful, and we stand ready to increase output as the market dictates,'' said Naimi, dressed in a gray business suit and speaking with only a slight Arabic accent. He addressed skeptics who contend that Saudi reservoirs cannot be tapped for larger amounts of oil. ''I am quite bullish on technology as the key to our energy future,'' he said. ''Technological innovation will allow us to find and extract more oil around the world.'' He described the task of increasing output as just ''a question of investment'' in new wells and pipelines, and he noted that consuming nations urgently need to build new refineries to process increased supplies of crude. ''There is absolutely no lack of resources worldwide,'' he repeated.
 His assurances did not assure. A barrel of oil cost $55 at the time of his speech; less than three months later, the price had jumped by 20 percent. The truth of the matter -- whether the world will really have enough petroleum in the years ahead -- was as well concealed as the millions of barrels of oil I couldn't see at Ras Tanura.
For 31 years, Matthew Simmons has prospered as the head of his own firm, Simmons & Company International, which advises energy companies on mergers and acquisitions. A member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a graduate of the Harvard Business School and an unpaid adviser on energy policy to the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush, he would be a card-carrying member of the global oil nomenclatura, if cards were issued for such things. Yet he is one of the principal reasons the oil world is beginning to ask hard questions of itself.
 Two years ago, Simmons went to Saudi Arabia on a government tour for business executives. The group was presented with the usual dog-and-pony show, but instead of being impressed, as most visitors tend to be, with the size and expertise of the Saudi oil industry, Simmons became perplexed. As he recalls in his somewhat heretical new book, ''Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy,'' a senior manager at Aramco told the visitors that ''fuzzy logic'' would be used to estimate the amount of oil that could be recovered. Simmons had never heard of fuzzy logic. What could be fuzzy about an oil reservoir? He suspected that Aramco, despite its promises of endless supplies, might in fact not know how much oil remained to be recovered.
 Simmons returned home with an itch to scratch. Saudi Arabia was one of the charter members of OPEC, founded in 1960 in Baghdad to coordinate the policies of oil producers. Like every OPEC country, Saudi Arabia provides only general numbers about its output and reserves; it does not release details about how much oil is extracted from each reservoir and what methods are used to extract that oil, and it does not permit audits by outsiders. The condition of Saudi fields, and those of other OPEC nations, is a closely guarded secret. That's largely because OPEC quotas, which were first imposed in 1983 to limit the output of member countries, were based on overall reserves; the higher an OPEC member's reserves, the higher its quota. It is widely believed that most, if not all, OPEC members exaggerated the sizes of their reserves in order to have the largest possible quota -- and thus the largest possible revenue stream.
 In the days of excess supply, bankers like Simmons did not know, or care, about the fudging; whether or not reserves were hyped, there was plenty of oil coming out of the ground. Through the 1970's, 80's and 90's, the capacity of OPEC and non-OPEC countries exceeded demand, and that's why OPEC imposed a quota system -- to keep some product off the market (although many OPEC members, seeking as much revenue as possible, quietly sold more oil than they were supposed to). Until quite recently, the only reason to fear a shortage was if a boycott, war or strike were to halt supplies. Few people imagined a time when supply would dry up because of demand alone. But a steady surge in demand in recent years -- led by China's emergence as a voracious importer of oil -- has changed that.
 This demand-driven scarcity has prompted the emergence of a cottage industry of experts who predict an impending crisis that will dwarf anything seen before. Their point is not that we are running out of oil, per se; although as much as half of the world's recoverable reserves are estimated to have been consumed, about a trillion barrels remain underground. Rather, they are concerned with what is called ''capacity'' -- the amount of oil that can be pumped to the surface on a daily basis. These experts -- still a minority in the oil world -- contend that because of the peculiarities of geology and the limits of modern technology, it will soon be impossible for the world's reservoirs to surrender enough oil to meet daily demand. 
 One of the starkest warnings came in a February report commissioned by the United States Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory. ''Because oil prices have been relatively high for the past decade, oil companies have conducted extensive exploration over that period, but their results have been disappointing,'' stated the report, assembled by Science Applications International, a research company that works on security and energy issues. ''If recent trends hold, there is little reason to expect that exploration success will dramatically improve in the future. . . . The image is one of a world moving from a long period in which reserves additions were much greater than consumption to an era in which annual additions are falling increasingly short of annual consumption. This is but one of a number of trends that suggest the world is fast approaching the inevitable peaking of conventional world oil production.'' 
 The reference to ''peaking'' is not a haphazard word choice -- ''peaking'' is a term used in oil geology to define the critical point at which reservoirs can no longer produce increasing amounts of oil. (This tends to happen when reservoirs are about half-empty.) ''Peak oil'' is the point at which maximum production is reached; afterward, no matter how many wells are drilled in a country, production begins to decline. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members may have enough oil to last for generations, but that is no longer the issue. The eventual and painful shift to different sources of energy -- the start of the post-oil age -- does not begin when the last drop of oil is sucked from under the Arabian desert. It begins when producers are unable to continue increasing their output to meet rising demand. Crunch time comes long before the last drop.
 ''The world has never faced a problem like this,'' the report for the Energy Department concluded. ''Without massive mitigation more than a decade before the fact, the problem will be pervasive and will not be temporary. Previous energy transitions (wood to coal and coal to oil) were gradual and evolutionary; oil peaking will be abrupt and revolutionary.'' 
 Most experts do not share Simmons's concerns about the imminence of peak oil. One of the industry's most prominent consultants, Daniel Yergin, author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning book about petroleum, dismisses the doomsday visions. ''This is not the first time that the world has 'run out of oil,''' he wrote in a recent Washington Post opinion essay. ''It's more like the fifth. Cycles of shortage and surplus characterize the entire history of the oil industry.'' Yergin says that a number of oil projects that are under construction will increase the supply by 20 percent in five years and that technological advances will increase the amount of oil that can be recovered from existing reservoirs. (Typically, with today's technology, only about 40 percent of a reservoir's oil can be pumped to the surface.)
 Yergin's bullish view has something in common with the views of the pessimists -- it rests on unknowns. Will the new projects that are under way yield as much oil as their financial backers hope? Will new technologies increase recovery rates as much as he expects? These questions are next to impossible to answer because coaxing oil out of the ground is an extraordinarily complex undertaking. The popular notion of reservoirs as underground lakes, from which wells extract oil like straws sucking a milkshake from a glass, is incorrect. Oil exists in drops between and inside porous rocks. A new reservoir may contain sufficient pressure to make these drops of oil flow to the surface in a gusher, but after a while -- usually within a few years and often sooner than that -- natural pressure lets up and is no longer sufficient to push oil to the surface. At that point, ''secondary'' recovery efforts are begun, like pumping water or gas into the reservoirs to increase the pressure.
 This process is unpredictable; reservoirs are extremely temperamental. If too much oil is extracted too quickly or if the wrong types or amounts of secondary efforts are employed, the amount of oil that can be recovered from a field can be greatly reduced; this is known in the oil world as ''damaging a reservoir.'' A widely cited example is Oman: in 2001, its daily production reached more than 960,000 barrels, but then suddenly declined, despite the use of advanced technologies. Today, Oman produces 785,000 barrels of oil a day. Herman Franssen, a consultant who worked in Oman for a decade, sees that country's experience as a possible lesson in the limits of technology for other producers that try to increase or maintain high levels of output. ''They reached a million barrels a day, and then a few years later production collapsed,'' Franssen said in a phone interview. ''They used all these new technologies, but they haven't been able to stop the decline yet.''
The vague production and reserve data that gets published does not begin to tell the whole story of an oil field's health, production potential or even its size. For a clear-as-possible picture of a country's oil situation, you need to know what is happening in each field -- how many wells it has, how much oil each well is producing, what recovery methods are being used and how long they've been used and the trend line since the field went into production. Data of that sort are typically not released by state-owned companies like Saudi Aramco.
 As Matthew Simmons searched for clues to the truth of the Saudi situation, he immersed himself in the minutiae of oil geology. He realized that data about Saudi fields might be found in the files of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Oil engineers, like most professional groups, have regular conferences at which they discuss papers that delve into the work they do. The papers, which focus on particular wells that highlight a problem or a solution to a problem, are presented and debated at the conferences and published by the S.P.E. -- and then forgotten.
 Before Simmons poked around, no one had taken the time to pull together the S.P.E. papers that involved Saudi oil fields and review them en masse. Simmons found more than 200 such papers and studied them carefully. Although the papers cover only a portion of the kingdom's wells and date back, in some cases, several decades, they constitute perhaps the best public data about the condition and prospects of Saudi reservoirs. 
 Ghawar is the treasure of the Saudi treasure chest. It is the largest oil field in the world and has produced, in the past 50 years, about 55 billion barrels of oil, which amounts to more than half of Saudi production in that period. The field currently produces more than five million barrels a day, which is about half of the kingdom's output. If Ghawar is facing problems, then so is Saudi Arabia and, indeed, the entire world.
 Simmons found that the Saudis are using increasingly large amounts of water to force oil out of Ghawar. Most of the wells are concentrated in the northern portion of the 174-mile-long field. That might seem like good news -- when the north runs low, the Saudis need only to drill wells in the south. But in fact it is bad news, Simmons concluded, because the southern portions of Ghawar are geologically more difficult to draw oil from. ''Someday (and perhaps that day will be soon), the remarkably high well flow rates at Ghawar's northern end will fade, as reservoir pressures finally plummet,'' Simmons writes in his book. ''Then, Saudi Arabian oil output will clearly have peaked. The death of this great king'' -- meaning Ghawar -- ''leaves no field of vaguely comparable stature in the line of succession. Twilight at Ghawar is fast approaching.'' He goes on: ''The geological phenomena and natural driving forces that created the Saudi oil miracle are conspiring now in normal and predictable ways to bring it to its conclusion, in a time frame potentially far shorter than officialdom would have us believe.'' Simmons concludes, ''Saudi Arabia clearly seems to be nearing or at its peak output and cannot materially grow its oil production.''
Saudi officials belittle Simmons's work. Nansen Saleri, a senior Aramco official, has described Simmons as a banker ''trying to come across as a scientist.'' In a speech last year, Saleri wryly said, ''I can read 200 papers on neurology, but you wouldn't want me to operate on your relatives.'' I caught up with Simmons in June, during a trip he made to Manhattan to talk with a group of oil-shipping executives. The impression he gives is of an enthusiastic inventor sharing a discovery that took him by surprise. He has a certain wide-eyed wonder in his regard, as if a bit of mystery can be found in everything that catches his eye. And he has a rumpled aspect -- thinning hair slightly askew, shirt sleeves a fraction too long. Though he delivers a bracing message, his discourse can wander. He is a successful businessman, and it is clear that he did not achieve his position by being a man of impeccable convention. He certainly has not lost sight of the rule that people who shout ''the end is nigh'' do not tend to be favorably reviewed by historians, let alone by their peers. He notes in his book that way back in 1979, The New York Times published an investigative story by Seymour Hersh under the headline ''Saudi Oil Capacity Questioned.'' He knows that in past decades the Cassandras failed to foresee new technologies, like deep-water and horizontal drilling, that provided new sources of oil and raised the amount of oil that can be recovered from reservoirs.
 But Simmons says that there are only so many rabbits technology can pull out of its petro-hat. He impishly notes that if the Saudis really wanted to, they could easily prove him wrong. ''If they want to satisfy people, they should issue field-by-field production reports and reserve data and have it audited,'' he told me. ''It would then take anybody less than a week to say, 'Gosh, Matt is totally wrong,' or 'Matt actually might be too optimistic.'''
 Simmons has a lot riding on his campaign -- not only his name but also his business, which would not be rewarded if he is proved to be a fool. What, I asked, if the data show that the Saudis will be able to sustain production of not only 12.5 million barrels a day -- their target for 2009 -- but 15 million barrels, which global demand is expected to require of them in the not-too-distant future? ''The odds of them sustaining 12 million barrels a day is very low,'' Simmons replied. ''The odds of them getting to 15 million for 50 years -- there's a better chance of me having Bill Gates's net worth, and I wouldn't bet a dime on that forecast.''
 The gathering of executives took place in a restaurant at Chelsea Piers; about 35 men sat around a set of tables as the host introduced Simmons. He rambled a bit but hit his talking points, and the executives listened raptly; at one point, the man on my right broke into a soft whistle, of the sort that means ''Holy cow.'' 
 Simmons didn't let up. ''We're going to look back at history and say $55 a barrel was cheap,'' he said, recalling a TV interview in which he predicted that a barrel might hit triple digits. 
 He said that the anchor scoffed, in disbelief, ''A hundred dollars?'' 
 Simmons replied, ''I wasn't talking about low triple digits.''
The onset of triple-digit prices might seem a blessing for the Saudis -- they would receive greater amounts of money for their increasingly scarce oil. But one popular misunderstanding about the Saudis -- and about OPEC in general -- is that high prices, no matter how high, are to their benefit.
 Although oil costing more than $60 a barrel hasn't caused a global recession, that could still happen: it can take a while for high prices to have their ruinous impact. And the higher above $60 that prices rise, the more likely a recession will become. High oil prices are inflationary; they raise the cost of virtually everything -- from gasoline to jet fuel to plastics and fertilizers -- and that means people buy less and travel less, which means a drop-off in economic activity. So after a brief windfall for producers, oil prices would slide as recession sets in and once-voracious economies slow down, using less oil. Prices have collapsed before, and not so long ago: in 1998, oil fell to $10 a barrel after an untimely increase in OPEC production and a reduction in demand from Asia, which was suffering through a financial crash. Saudi Arabia and the other members of OPEC entered crisis mode back then; adjusted for inflation, oil was at its lowest price since the cartel's creation, threatening to feed unrest among the ranks of jobless citizens in OPEC states. 
 ''The Saudis are very happy with oil at $55 per barrel, but they're also nervous,'' a Western diplomat in Riyadh told me in May, referring to the price that prevailed then. (Like all the diplomats I spoke to, he insisted on speaking anonymously because of the sensitivities of relations with Saudi Arabia.) ''They don't know where this magic line has moved to. Is it now $65? Is it $75? Is it $80? They don't want to find out, because if you did have oil move that far north . . . the chain reaction can come back to a price collapse again.''
 High prices can have another unfortunate effect for producers. When crude costs $10 a barrel or even $30 a barrel, alternative fuels are prohibitively expensive. For example, Canada has vast amounts of tar sands that can be rendered into heavy oil, but the cost of doing so is quite high. Yet those tar sands and other alternatives, like bioethanol, hydrogen fuel cells and liquid fuel from natural gas or coal, become economically viable as the going rate for a barrel rises past, say, $40 or more, especially if consuming governments choose to offer their own incentives or subsidies. So even if high prices don't cause a recession, the Saudis risk losing market share to rivals into whose nonfundamentalist hands Americans would much prefer to channel their energy dollars. A concerted push for greater energy conservation in the United States, which consumes one-quarter of the world's oil (mostly to fuel our cars, as gasoline), would hurt producing nations, too. Basically, any significant reduction in the demand for oil would be ruinous for OPEC members, who have little to offer the world but oil; if a substitute can be found, their future is bleak. Another Western diplomat explained the problem facing the Saudis: ''You want to have the price as high as possible without sending the consuming nations into a recession and at the same time not have the price so high that it encourages alternative technologies.'' 
 From the American standpoint, one argument in favor of conservation and a switch to alternative fuels is that by limiting oil imports, the United States and its Western allies would reduce their dependence on a potentially unstable region. (In fact, in an effort to offset the risks of relying on the Saudis, America's top oil suppliers are Canada and Mexico.) In addition, sending less money to Saudi Arabia would mean less money in the hands of a regime that has spent the past few decades doling out huge amounts of its oil revenue to mosques, madrassas and other institutions that have fanned the fires of Islamic radicalism. The oil money has been dispensed not just by the Saudi royal family but by private individuals who benefited from the oil boom -- like Osama bin Laden, whose ample funds, probably eroded now, came from his father, a construction magnate. Without its oil windfall, Saudi Arabia would have had a hard time financing radical Islamists across the globe.
 For the Saudis, the political ramifications of reduced demand for its oil would not be negligible. The royal family has amassed vast personal wealth from the country's oil revenues. If, suddenly, Saudis became aware that the royal family had also failed to protect the value of the country's treasured resource, the response could be severe. The mere admission that Saudi reserves are not as impressively inexhaustible as the royal family has claimed could lead to hard questions about why the country, and the world, had been misled. With the death earlier this month of the long-ailing King Fahd, the royal family is undergoing another period of scrutiny; the new king, Abdullah, is in his 80's, and the crown prince, his half-brother Sultan, is in his 70's, so the issue of generational change remains to be settled. As long as the country is swimming in petro-dollars -- even as it is paying off debt accrued during its lean years -- everyone is relatively happy, but that can change. One diplomat I spoke to recalled a comment from Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the larger-than-life Saudi oil minister during the 1970's: ''The Stone Age didn't end for lack of stone, and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil.''
Until now, the Saudis had an excess of production capacity that allowed them, when necessary, to flood the market to drive prices down. They did that in 1990, when the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait eliminated not only Kuwait's supply of oil but also Iraq's. The Saudis functioned, as they always had, as the central bank of oil, releasing supply to the market when it was needed and withdrawing supply to keep prices from going lower than the cartel would have liked. In other words, they controlled not only the price of oil but their own destiny as well.
 ''That is what the world has called on them to do before -- turn on the taps to produce more and get prices down,'' a senior Western diplomat in Riyadh told me recently. ''Decreasing prices used to keep out alternative fuels. I don't see how they're able to do that anymore. This is a huge change, and it is a big step in the move to whatever is coming next. That's what's really happening.''
 Without the ability to flood the markets with oil, the Saudis are resorting to flooding the market with promises; it is a sort of petro-jawboning. That's why Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister, told his Washington audience that Saudi Arabia has embarked on a crash program to raise its capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day by 2009 and even higher in the years after that. Naimi is not unlike a factory manager who needs to promise the moon to his valuable clients, for fear of losing or alarming them. He has no choice. The moment he says anything bracing, the touchy energy markets will probably panic, pushing prices even higher and thereby hastening the onset of recession, a switch to alternative fuels or new conservation efforts -- or all three. Just a few words of honest caution could move the markets; Naimi's speeches are followed nearly as closely in the financial world as those of Alan Greenspan.
 I journeyed to Saudi Arabia to interview Naimi and other senior officials, to get as far beyond their prepared remarks as might be possible. Although I was allowed to see Ras Tanura, my interview requests were denied. I was invited to visit Aramco's oil museum in Dhahran, but that is something a Saudi schoolchild can do on a field trip. It was a ''show but don't tell'' policy. I was able to speak about production issues only with Ibrahim al-Muhanna, the oil ministry spokesman, who reluctantly met me over coffee in the lobby of my hotel in Riyadh. He defended Saudi Arabia's refusal to share more data, noting that the Saudis are no different from most oil producers.
 ''They will not tell you,'' he said. ''Nobody will. And that is not going to change.'' Referring to the fact that Saudi Arabia is often called the central bank of oil, he added: ''If an outsider goes to the Fed and asks, 'How much money do you have?' they will tell you. If you say, 'Can I come and count it?' they will not let you. This applies to oil companies and oil countries.'' I mentioned to Muhanna that many people think his government's ''trust us'' stance is not convincing in light of the cheating that has gone on within OPEC and in the industry as a whole; even Royal Dutch/Shell, a publicly listed oil company that undergoes regular audits, has admitted that it overstated its 2002 reserves by 23 percent.
 ''There is no reason for any country or company to lie,'' Muhanna replied. ''There is a lot of oil around.'' I didn't need to ask about Simmons and his peak-oil theory; when I met Muhanna at the conference in Washington, he nearly broke off our conversation at the mention of Simmons's name. ''He does not know anything,'' Muhanna said. ''The only thing he has is a big mouth. We should not pay attention to him. Either you believe us or you don't.''
So whom to believe? Before leaving New York for Saudi Arabia, I was advised by several oil experts to try to interview Sadad al-Husseini, who retired last year after serving as Aramco's top executive for exploration and production. I faxed him in Dhahran and received a surprisingly quick reply; he agreed to meet me. A week later, after I arrived in Riyadh, Husseini e-mailed me, asking when I would come to Dhahran; in a follow-up phone call, he offered to pick me up at the airport. He was, it seemed, eager to talk.
 It can be argued that in a nation devoted to oil, Husseini knows more about it than anyone else. Born in Syria, Husseini was raised in Saudi Arabia, where his father was a government official whose family took on Saudi citizenship. Husseini earned a Ph.D. in geological sciences from Brown University in 1973 and went to work in Aramco's exploration department, eventually rising to the highest position. Until his retirement last year -- said to have been caused by a top-level dispute, the nature of which is the source of many rumors -- Husseini was a member of the company's board and its management committee. He is one of the most respected and accomplished oilmen in the world.
 After meeting me at the cavernous airport that serves Dhahran, he drove me in his luxury sedan to the villa that houses his private office. As we entered, he pointed to an armoire that displayed a dozen or so vials of black liquid. ''These are samples from oil fields I discovered,'' he explained. Upstairs, there were even more vials, and he would have possessed more than that except, as he said, laughing, ''I didn't start collecting early enough.''
 We spoke for several hours. The message he delivered was clear: the world is heading for an oil shortage. His warning is quite different from the calming speeches that Naimi and other Saudis, along with senior American officials, deliver on an almost daily basis. Husseini explained that the need to produce more oil is coming from two directions. Most obviously, demand is rising; in recent years, global demand has increased by two million barrels a day. (Current daily consumption, remember, is about 84 million barrels a day.) Less obviously, oil producers deplete their reserves every time they pump out a barrel of oil. This means that merely to maintain their reserve base, they have to replace the oil they extract from declining fields. It's the geological equivalent of running to stay in place. Husseini acknowledged that new fields are coming online, like offshore West Africa and the Caspian basin, but he said that their output isn't big enough to offset this growing need.
 ''You look at the globe and ask, 'Where are the big increments?' and there's hardly anything but Saudi Arabia,'' he said. ''The kingdom and Ghawar field are not the problem. That misses the whole point. The problem is that you go from 79 million barrels a day in 2002 to 82.5 in 2003 to 84.5 in 2004. You're leaping by two million to three million a year, and if you have to cover declines, that's another four to five million.'' In other words, if demand and depletion patterns continue, every year the world will need to open enough fields or wells to pump an additional six to eight million barrels a day -- at least two million new barrels a day to meet the rising demand and at least four million to compensate for the declining production of existing fields. ''That's like a whole new Saudi Arabia every couple of years,'' Husseini said. ''It can't be done indefinitely. It's not sustainable.''
 Husseini speaks patiently, like a teacher who hopes someone is listening. He is in the enviable position of knowing what he talks about while having the freedom to speak openly about it. He did not disclose precise information about Saudi reserves or production -- which remain the equivalent of state secrets -- but he felt free to speak in generalities that were forthright, even when they conflicted with the reassuring statements of current Aramco officials. When I asked why he was willing to be so frank, he said it was because he sees a shortage ahead and wants to do what he can to avert it. I assumed that he would not be particularly distressed if his rivals in the Saudi oil establishment were embarrassed by his frankness. 
 Although Matthew Simmons says it is unlikely that the Saudis will be able to produce 12.5 million barrels a day or sustain output at that level for a significant period of time, Husseini says the target is realistic; he says that Simmons is wrong to state that Saudi Arabia has reached its peak. But 12.5 million is just an interim marker, as far as consuming nations are concerned, on the way to 15 million barrels a day and beyond -- and that is the point at which Husseini says problems will arise.
 At the conference in Washington in May, James Schlesinger, the moderator, conducted a question-and-answer session with Naimi at the conclusion of the minister's speech. One of the first questions involved peak oil: might it be true that Saudi Arabia, which has relied on the same reservoirs, and especially Ghawar, for more than five decades, is nearing the geological limit of its output?
 Naimi wouldn't hear of it.
 ''I can assure you that we haven't peaked,'' he responded. ''If we peaked, we would not be going to 12.5 and we would not be visualizing a 15-million-barrel-per-day production capacity. . . . We can maintain 12.5 or 15 million for the next 30 to 50 years.''
 Experts like Husseini are very concerned by the prospect of trying to produce 15 million barrels a day. Even if production can be ramped up that high, geology may not be forgiving. Fields that are overproduced can drop off, in terms of output, quite sharply and suddenly, leaving behind large amounts of oil that cannot be coaxed out with existing technology. This is called trapped oil, because the rocks or sediment around it prevent it from escaping to the surface. Unless new technologies are developed, that oil will never be extracted. In other words, the haste to recover oil can lead to less oil being recovered.
 ''You could go to 15, but that's when the questions of depletion rate, reservoir management and damaging the fields come into play,'' says Nawaf Obaid, a Saudi oil and security analyst who is regarded as being exceptionally well connected to key Saudi leaders. ''There is an understanding across the board within the kingdom, in the highest spheres, that if you're going to 15, you'll hit 15, but there will be considerable risks . . . of a steep decline curve that Aramco will not be able to do anything about.''
 Even if the Saudis are willing to risk damaging their fields, or even if the risk is overstated, Husseini points out a practical problem. To produce and sustain 15 million barrels a day, Saudi Arabia will have to drill a lot more wells and build a lot more pipelines and processing facilities. Currently, the global oil industry suffers a deficit of qualified engineers to oversee such projects and the equipment and the raw materials -- for example, rigs and steel -- to build them. These things cannot be wished from thin air or developed quickly enough to meet the demand.
 ''If we had two dozen Texas A&M's producing a thousand new engineers a year and the industrial infrastructure in the kingdom, with the drilling rigs and power plants, we would have a better chance, but you cannot put that into place overnight,'' Husseini said. ''Capacity is not just a function of reserves. It is a function of reserves plus know-how plus a commercial economic system that is designed to increase the resource exploitation. For example, in the U.S. you have infrastructure -- there must be tens of thousands of miles of pipelines. If we, in Saudi Arabia, evolve to that level of commercial maturity, we could probably produce a heck of a lot more oil. But to get there is a very tedious, slow process.''
 He worries that the rising global demand for oil will lead to the petroleum equivalent of running an engine at ever-increasing speeds without stopping to cool it down or change the oil. Husseini does not want to see the fragile and irreplaceable reservoirs of the Middle East become damaged through wanton overproduction.
 ''If you are ramping up production so fast and jump from high to higher to highest, and you're not having enough time to do what needs to be done, to understand what needs to be done, then you can damage reservoirs,'' he said. ''Systematic development is not just a matter of money. It's a matter of reservoir dynamics, understanding what's there, analyzing and understanding information. That's where people come in, experience comes in. These are not universally available resources.''
 The most worrisome part of the crisis ahead revolves around a set of statistics from the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the U.S. Department of Energy. The E.I.A. forecast in 2004 that by 2020 Saudi Arabia would produce 18.2 million barrels of oil a day, and that by 2025 it would produce 22.5 million barrels a day. Those estimates were unusual, though. They were not based on secret information about Saudi capacity, but on the projected needs of energy consumers. The figures simply assumed that Saudi Arabia would be able to produce whatever the United States needed it to produce. Just last month, the E.I.A. suddenly revised those figures downward -- not because of startling new information about world demand or Saudi supply but because the figures had given so much ammunition to critics. Husseini, for example, described the 2004 forecast as unrealistic.
 ''That's not how you would manage a national, let alone an international, economy,'' he explained. ''That's the part that is scary. You draw some assumptions and then say, 'O.K., based on these assumptions, let's go forward and consume like hell and burn like hell.''' When I asked whether the kingdom could produce 20 million barrels a day -- about twice what it is producing today from fields that may be past their prime -- Husseini paused for a second or two. It wasn't clear if he was taking a moment to figure out the answer or if he needed a moment to decide if he should utter it. He finally replied with a single word: No.
 ''It's becoming unrealistic,'' he said. ''The expectations are beyond what is achievable. This is a global problem . . . that is not going to be solved by tinkering with the Saudi industry.''
It would be unfair to blame the Saudis alone for failing to warn of whatever shortages or catastrophes might lie ahead.
 In the political and corporate realms of the oil world, there are few incentives to be forthright. Executives of major oil companies have been reluctant to raise alarms; the mere mention of scarce supplies could alienate the governments that hand out lucrative exploration contracts and also send a message to investors that oil companies, though wildly profitable at the moment, have a Malthusian long-term future. Fortunately, that attitude seems to be beginning to change. Chevron's ''easy oil is over'' advertising campaign is an indication that even the boosters of an oil-drenched future are not as bullish as they once were.
 Politicians remain in the dark. During the 2004 presidential campaign, which occurred as gas prices were rising to record levels, the debate on energy policy was all but nonexistent. The Bush campaign produced an advertisement that concluded: ''Some people have wacky ideas. Like taxing gasoline more so people drive less. That's John Kerry.'' Although many environmentalists would have been delighted if Kerry had proposed that during the campaign, in fact the ad was referring to a 50-cents-a-gallon tax that Kerry supported 11 years ago as part of a package of measures to reduce the deficit. (The gas tax never made it to a vote in the Senate.) Kerry made no mention of taxing gasoline during the campaign; his proposal for doing something about high gas prices was to pressure OPEC to increase supplies.
 Husseini, for one, doesn't buy that approach. ''Everybody is looking at the producers to pull the chestnuts out of the fire, as if it's our job to fix everybody's problems,'' he told me. ''It's not our problem to tell a democratically elected government that you have to do something about your runaway consumers. If your government can't do the job, you can't expect other governments to do it for them.'' Back in the 70's, President Carter called for the moral equivalent of war to reduce our dependence on foreign oil; he was not re-elected. Since then, few politicians have spoken of an energy crisis or suggested that major policy changes are necessary to avert one. The energy bill signed earlier this month by President Bush did not even raise fuel-efficiency standards for passenger cars. When a crisis comes -- whether in a year or 2 or 10 -- it will be all the more painful because we will have done little or nothing to prepare for it.

But there is a limit to how much you can ask of the earth, and it is fast approaching, some analysts say.

HEADLINE: George Weah's New Game

BYLINE: By Andrew Rice. 
Andrew Rice is writing a book about a Ugandan murder trial and the legacy of the dictator Idi Amin.

 BODY:

One morning in May, George Weah, arguably the world's most famous Liberian, sat in the back seat of a black Toyota Land Cruiser as it barreled by the burned-out skyscrapers of the ruined city of Monrovia. It was the start of the rainy season, and fat tropical raindrops splattered across the windshield. Weah, dressed in a dark blue suit, a Liberian-flag pin stuck in his lapel, was concealed behind tinted windows. But he did not travel unnoticed. In a city of rickety jalopies, his gleaming ride is known to all, in part because, until recently, his car bore a vanity license plate reading ''2 Phat.'' Since announcing last November that he's running for the presidency of Liberia, Weah has switched to something less conspicuous -- assassination is always a worry -- but on this morning no one was fooled. Along the cracked sidewalks, the grimy kids selling bootleg gas from glass jars shouted: ''Weah! Weah!'' as the Land Cruiser blew past.
 Weah is a powerfully built man of 38, commandingly handsome, with sharp cheekbones, intent eyes and brown skin so luminous that he sometimes seems lighted from within. During his prime in the 1990's, Weah thrilled millions on European soccer fields, blazing past hapless defenders to score goals and win championships for the game's elite clubs. Now in retirement, he seldom hurries anywhere, walking with a loping gait, his carriage conveying an easy majesty. In Liberia, they call him simply King George. On first introduction, he produces a business card that reads, ''Royal Communications,'' emblazoned with a little red crown. Weah calls himself ''a noble person,'' and he means it in every sense. 
 Weah's soccer exploits, and his charitable work off the field, have made him a hero to a country divided by tribe, politics and civil war. The day he announced he would run in the election, which is scheduled to be held in October, thousands of his fans danced in the streets of Monrovia. When Weah returned to Liberia this spring after a long sojourn in Florida -- his American wife and children live in Fort Lauderdale -- his arrival shut down the capital for the day. As traffic snarled, businessmen shuttered their shops, and screaming students lined the road in from the airport. ''Weah in town,'' they chanted. ''Politicians worry!'' 
 Two years after a peace agreement ended more than a decade of on-and-off warfare, Weah's campaign has generated an unaccustomed sentiment in many of his countrymen: a bit of hope. There are currently 27 candidates running for the presidency, ranging from experienced types, like Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a former finance minister who also worked for the World Bank, and Charles Brumskine, formerly a lawyer in Washington, to evangelists to erstwhile warlords. But none of them can match King George's star power.
 His outsider challenge has startled Liberia's insular political class. Some politicians have embraced Weah, hoping to ride his popularity to power. Others are attacking, questioning his lack of governing experience, his scant education and his rather fuzzy political platform. What everyone agrees is that, for now, the soccer star is the man to beat. (If no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote in October, there will be a runoff between the top two vote-getters.) ''His chances of winning -- by a landslide -- are very bright,'' said Jonathan Paye-Layleh, a veteran Liberian journalist who covered the war for the Associated Press. 
 Win or lose, Weah represents something new out of Africa: the continent's first celebrity campaign. Star power is electoral power, whether in California or Pakistan, where millions follow the populist politician Imran Khan, a legendary cricket bowler. But Weah's candidacy presents intriguing questions for a beleaguered continent. Can one man's fame succeed where ideologies have failed? Can celebrity unite a broken nation? 
 An election is not a coronation, of course, especially in volatile Liberia. And as Weah made his way through the rain to King's FM, the radio station he started last year, the candidate was preoccupied with a front-runner's worries: demanding supporters, prying reporters, plotting opponents, gestating scandals. A blue-helmeted United Nations peacekeeper waved the Land Cruiser through a sandbagged roadblock. Weah's driver turned off Broad Street, where a statue of Weah was erected a few years ago, and slowed down to pass a market. There, opposite a building speckled with bullet holes, a crowd materialized, swarming the car, and the journey was suddenly brought to a halt. 
 They were young men mostly, kids in flip-flops and threadbare T-shirts, the kind who get by selling bar soap from wooden wheelbarrows or, not so long ago, as gunmen in some warlord's army. As Weah's car inched through the throng, they fought to touch its rain-slicked windows. Should Weah win, he will owe his election to young Liberians like these. Roughly half the country's registered voters are younger than 30, and about a quarter are under 23. Their generation has come of age knowing nothing more of peace and democracy than what they've seen on television. To them, Weah symbolizes everything their country lacks: wealth, honest achievement, international prestige. ''He was European best, African best,'' said a young clothes peddler in the crowd, excitedly running off a list of Weah's soccer awards. ''The future is here.''
 The Land Cruiser edged into a parking space in front of the radio station. The car door opened, and the candidate emerged, shielded by a cordon of square-jawed security men. He strode purposefully up a set of steps, surveyed the crowd and gave a wide wave. Then he disappeared inside the office building, as his supporters chanted his name in the rain.
Liberia has been called America's stepchild. Founded by freed American slaves, it became Africa's first republic in 1847, with a red, white and blue flag and a constitution first drafted by a Harvard law professor. Over the last 25 years, as the country fell into dictatorship, the economy collapsed and war broke out, thousands of Liberians came to the United States to seek safety and jobs. These expatriates are relatively wealthy and influential in Liberian politics. Consequently, Liberia's presidential campaign is also being fought in America, with contenders campaigning in places like Philadelphia and Minneapolis.
 That was why, on a frigid January day, I found myself sitting with George Weah in a hotel room on Staten Island. Weah was sprawled on a king-size bed, with one stockinged foot dangling off the edge, half-watching a Jets playoff game on television. He wore a black turtleneck and a Swiss watch and a gold ring shaped in the image of a lion. ''The lion is strong,'' he explained. Through the afternoon and evening, members of Weah's entourage came and went, tying ties, spritzing cologne and pouring themselves paper cups of Hennessy cognac. 
 It was an important day in Weah's weeks-old campaign. That evening, he would make his first speech as a candidate before a group of Liberian expatriates at a nearby banquet hall. He had almost no experience campaigning, and his handlers, thinking like Broadway producers, wanted his debut to be out of town, in front of a forgiving audience. Weah has a network of friends and family members in America. He met his wife, Clar, at a Chase bank. (She worked in customer service; he was opening an account.) For years, he had a home in North Woodmere, on Long Island, before the family relocated to Florida. 
 ''I know I have a successful career, a successful life,'' he told me at the hotel. But, he added: ''if I sit and say, 'Look, I have a comfortable life,' and I . . . just think about myself, I don't think that would be fair. That would be very selfish. Because everything I do in my life is to benefit my people.''
 Weah's entire campaign is suffused with a similar sense of noblesse oblige. He didn't decide to run, he says. The people demanded it. Questions about his own desires and ambitions, even his specific plans for the country, are dismissed with perfunctory platitudes. He says he'll build roads, hospitals and schools and take food to the hungry and electricity to run-down Monrovia. Details? He'll hire smart, honest people to figure them out. As for the country's tribal and religious tensions, the guns floating around, the specter of renewed war, Weah says that his election itself would mend all rifts. ''I am a unifier,'' he said, ''the only one who can bring peace to my country.''
 He continued: ''I was here'' -- meaning in the U.S. -- ''when Schwarzenegger was coming to power. If I say I am not a politician, it is because I did not go to school to do political science. But at the end of the day, I think we are all born politicians. It's practical. All you gotta do is practice.''
 Practice began that night, when Weah entered a banquet hall where about 200 Liberian emigres, decked out in their Sunday finery, swayed and clapped rhythmically to greet the candidate. Replete with songs and prayers, the event had the air of a revival meeting. A plummy-voiced preacher compared Weah to Jesus. 
 Liberians are a devout people -- their ancestors brought evangelical Christianity from the American South -- and in this election there is much talk of searching for a redeemer. Looking at Liberia's recent history, you can see why they might request divine intervention. For a quarter-century, the country alternated between brutal dictatorships and bloodier anarchy, as adolescent gunmen, high on ''brown brown,'' a mixture of cocaine or heroin and gunpowder, raped and pillaged, and destroyed the country's paltry economy. The last time Liberia was stable enough to hold an election, the voters chose the rebel leader Charles Taylor, whose infamous campaign slogan, chanted by young supporters, was: ''He killed my ma; he killed my pa; I'll vote for him.'' Taylor kept on killing, fomenting wars all over West Africa. New rebel movements arose to oppose him, and insurgents were waging battles with government troops in the streets of Monrovia when Taylor finally fled the country in 2003. 
 Since Taylor's ouster, Liberia has essentially been a U.N. protectorate, with more than 15,000 peacekeepers maintaining order. In this election season, Liberians at home and abroad sense that, perhaps for the first time in their nation's history, they will have a real choice of rulers. Weah's strength, analysts say, is that as a newcomer to politics, he's not implicated in the past's depravity. ''Weah is enjoying a protest vote against corruption, bad government and misrule,'' says Jerome Verdier, a human rights lawyer who has advised the Congress for Democratic Change, the soccer star's new political party. 
 That night on Staten Island, Weah stepped forward uncertainly to the lectern, his lordly bearing undermined by an uncharacteristic bout of nerves. He spoke in a rushed monotone, keeping his eyes fixed down on his speech. The audience didn't seem to care, interrupting him with ecstatic shouts of ''Oh, say!''
 ''Fellow partisans, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, tonight, let's donate generously to a worthy cause,'' Weah said, warming up. ''We have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth. Or we will sentence them to the last step into a thousand years of darkness.''
 When Weah was done, Dominic Brapoh, a former Liberian soccer player, lip-synched and performed a hip-shaking dance. Audience members showered Brapoh with dollar bills, which Weah's aides snatched up off the dance floor. At 1:30 a.m., when Weah left, the music was still thumping.
 His speech's call to a ''rendezvous with destiny'' had a familiar ring, so later, back at my computer, I checked out the passage. It was taken nearly verbatim from a televised address, made in 1964 on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. This didn't mean much in itself, but it was intriguing to learn that Weah's words came from another, quite successful celebrity politician: Ronald Reagan.
On a sunny afternoon in April 1980, George Weah, then 13, stood on a beach and watched as 13 men were stripped to their underwear, tied to telephone poles and machine-gunned by a firing squad. The men were government officials, members of some of Liberia's most prominent families and allies of President William Tolbert, who was assassinated -- literally eviscerated -- during an army coup nine days before. After the men were dead, according to David Lamb's firsthand account in his book, ''The Africans,'' a cry went up from the thousands in the crowd: ''We got our freedom at last!''
 Liberia's trials began with that coup in 1980. But the origins of its disaster were always there, embedded in its founding irony. The freed slaves who fled America to escape inequality came to Africa and ruled as capriciously as any white colonial regime. With their plantation manners and light brown complexions, the American immigrants disdained the darker-skinned indigenous people. Liberia's constitution excluded all but the free slaves' descendants from the rights of citizenship. Intermarriage with the natives was discouraged. The colonists, less than 5 percent of the population, came to form an impenetrable elite, mimicking the culture of the antebellum South. Until the 1970's, Liberian leaders still dressed in top hats and tails. 
 Tolbert was a descendant of a South Carolina slave. His killer and successor, Samuel Doe, was a semiliterate sergeant from an indigenous tribe. Doe bankrupted Liberia, stole an election and murdered his political opponents. Nonetheless, many Liberians, including Weah, still remember him fondly. The execution of Tolbert's cronies, Weah recalled, ''was not beautiful to see.'' But Tolbert's overthrow, Weah said, ''empowered us in a positive way. After the coup, everything was open in Liberia. We could find jobs.''
 Weah grew up in a shack built over a drained mangrove swamp on Monrovia's Bushrod Island. ''George has seen what it means to be in hardship, what it means to be poor, what it means to be denied certain opportunities,'' said his brother-in-law Koffa M. Nagbe. Weah's parents split up when he was a baby, and his grandmother raised him. He learned to play soccer in the slums. By his late teens, Weah was starring for the league-champion Invincible Eleven, helping to support his grandmother and siblings with his earnings. Weah might have remained in Liberia, a talented but unschooled local player, were it not for the personal intervention of President Doe. 
 In Liberia, a leader is supposed to be a patron, a father figure -- a papay, as Liberians say. (The word literally means ''daddy.'') The president loved soccer. He built a massive stadium in Monrovia and insisted on driving the national team onto the field in a Cadillac convertible. Doe made Weah the national team captain and invited him to the presidential palace to talk soccer strategy. After victories, he would distribute a briefcase full of cash to Weah and his teammates. At a time when Liberia's economy was collapsing, Doe sent the national team, including Weah, to Brazil for advanced training. ''When they first thought of sending them, the citizens said no, they are foolish boys, don't send foolish boys to Brazil, use our taxes,'' recalled Sylvester Williams, Weah's business manager and closest confidant. ''But Doe did not listen. He sent them, $100,000 he spent. George says he owes that to the Liberian people . . . so that's why he's giving back to the society.''
 For Weah, at least, Doe's investment paid off. In 1988, the French club A.S. Monaco signed him to a contract. At first, Weah was out of his league; he was like a street-ball player in the N.B.A., all talent and no teamwork. But he worked hard and developed into a ferocious striker, winning league titles with teams in France and Italy. ''It was certainly the biggest change I ever saw in a player,'' said Arsene Wenger, the manager who signed him to Monaco and who now coaches Arsenal, an English club. ''He looked useless at the start. . . . But he had such a desire, such an ambition, such a burning wish to become a star, that he made it.''
 Young and suddenly rich, Weah acquired a taste for fast cars and fancy clothes. Meanwhile, Liberia burned. Warlords carved up the country. In 1990, rebels captured Doe and videotaped themselves dismembering him alive. After Doe's death, the country descended further into anarchy. But Weah kept winning. In 1996, he became the first African to be named World Player of the Year by soccer's governing body. Shortly thereafter, he traveled with the Liberian national team to a tournament in South Africa, where he met Nelson Mandela, who hailed him as ''the pride of Africa.'' The encounter stirred a political awakening. Weah began talking to sportswriters about his homeland's misery. That spring, Weah gave an interview to an American newspaper, saying that it was time for the United Nations to intervene. 
 After the story appeared, troops loyal to Charles Taylor, then a rebel leader, ransacked and torched Weah's beachfront mansion in Monrovia. They also raped two of his cousins. Afterward, a Taylor aide was spotted driving Weah's prized Mercedes. The attack sent King George a message: Stick to soccer. 
 After Taylor was elected president, Weah warily came to terms with him. He took over as player-manager of Liberia's national team. In 2001, he led his tiny nation on a Cinderella run through the World Cup qualification rounds, and giddy fans started saying he could be president. Weah denied interest, but Taylor sensed a rival. When the World Cup bid fell short, Weah fled Liberia, fearing imprisonment or worse. 
 With Taylor out of power, Liberia is safer for Weah. Still, he says his wife and three children were worried that politics could get him killed. ''At first they were a little bit afraid,'' he said. ''But at the end of the day, they said, 'What God is doing, let no man go against it.'''
 Clar Weah grew up in a Jamaican immigrant family in Brooklyn. George and Clar have just bought a new house in Fort Lauderdale, where Clar is opening a Caribbean restaurant and grocery. She says she'll move to Monrovia if her husband is elected. But she admits she's uneasy. ''Since I've known George, I've known that the country was not stable, and I've heard of other presidents getting killed, so that was and will always be a fear of mine,'' she says. ''But in talking to many different people and to George in regard to his political aspirations, I've gotten somewhat used to the idea. I'm just praying now that everything works out . . . and that it doesn't end up being a disaster for any of us.''
Weah's Liberian home is in a Monrovia suburb, down a pitted dirt road marked by a billboard bearing his painted image. Behind a high concrete wall topped by razor wire, he lives a jock's dream life. Weah employs a full-time chef, relaxes in his air-conditioned, four-bedroom house and owns a silver Porsche Boxster. He is surrounded at all times by a gaggle of old friends and former teammates. Mornings they shoot pool; evenings they play basketball on Weah's backyard court. When their middle-aged muscles ache, a servant attends to them with a tube of Ben Gay. 
 Outside the wall, the scene is different. Every day, glum people sit on concrete blocks in the enervating heat, waiting for an audience. There are old women in colorful wrap dresses, blind men carrying canes, students in ragged clothes. They need money: for tuition, for an operation, for a dead sister's coffin. As Doe was to him, he is to them.
 ''Once you take care of people, people respect you,'' Weah told me one afternoon as he reclined by his swimming pool and a houseboy served him a plate of steaming cassava. ''They call you Papay.''
 Every Liberian knows about Weah's public work. Over the years, he advanced the national team a reported $2 million of his own money. He has financed scholarships for promising students, sent bags of rice down to the old neighborhood, visited camps for demobilized rebels, exhorting them to trade their guns for soccer balls. One day, outside Weah's gate, I met a spindly 22-year-old named Garbleejay Gbotee, who was edging the grass along the wall with a machete in the hope that Weah might notice and help with his schooling. Gbotee showed me his thumb, which was blackened with indelible ink, a sign that he had registered to vote. ''I think Weah is the only one who can bring happiness to the Liberian people now,'' he said. ''He will bring us joy and help us rebuild our lives again.''
 At first, Liberia's political class scoffed at the prospect of a soccer-star president. Now his opponents have gone on the attack. They want him thrown off the ballot on the grounds that he once carried a French passport. Other aspects of Weah's jet-set lifestyle are becoming an issue. In July, Monrovians tittered when a newspaper published a photograph of Weah cavorting with several young women. His more virulent critics whisper of other, more embarrassing pictures, all in support of their general characterization of Weah as a callow playboy, well meaning but susceptible to manipulation. Sotto voce, they talk of sullied characters surrounding Weah, including old Taylor cronies. Weah recently had to replace the chairman of his political party, a former truck driver with rebel-group ties, after he came under investigation for corruption. Weah's newly announced running mate, Rudolph Johnson, was the dictator Doe's foreign minister.
 Most persistently, Weah's opponents say that he lacks education, that he is not a ''book man,'' as they say in Liberia. He attended high school on soccer scholarships, but by all accounts he was an indifferent student. The Daily Observer, a Liberian newspaper, recently revealed that his bachelor's degree came from an unaccredited diploma mill. More than 40 percent of Liberians are illiterate, so these attacks may only burnish Weah's populist credentials. But Weah grows furious whenever he senses someone is slighting his intelligence or sophistication. ''He's very conscious of his limitations and what people are saying about that,'' said Verdier, the attorney who has advised Weah. Samuel Kofi Woods, a prominent human rights lawyer who considered a run for the presidency, said that when some of his supporters proposed that Weah run as his vice president, Weah was enraged. ''I think he sees himself as an idol the people must worship,'' Woods said.
 When I asked Weah about his thin-skinned reputation, he bristled. Woods, he said, ''tried to disseminate false information that I was supercilious, truculent, in our encounter. It was not true. I treated him like a brother.'' It was a Friday afternoon, and we were at his small, crowded office. In one corner stood a carved wooden throne. As his suited aides nodded in unison, Weah said he could take criticism. ''This is politics, of course,'' he said. ''Nobody expected the older people to just give up. If you come to a team that has never functioned well, you bring in new players, of course, there will be a lot of resentment.'' 
 The real issue, it seemed to me, isn't education or temperament; it's class. To Liberia's old elite, Weah is just too plain-spoken, too dark-skinned, too African. Weah loathes their snobbery. His voice goes low and contemptuous when he talks about lawyers and Ph.D.'s. ''They have never developed the country, they have never created any jobs, they never built any schools, they never built any hospitals,'' Weah said. He leaned forward across his enormous desk, peering over rectangular glasses. ''They make the world to know that I don't know how to read and write, I don't know how to speak. . . . I have proven to the world that I am articulate, I am very intelligent, I'm well exposed. So I don't got to mind all these people.''
 Weah paused, produced a bottle of Guinness from beneath his desk and took a deep, ostentatious swig. ''But you see,'' he continued, ''right now, Liberia needs people of common sense, people of virtues, people that are willing to empower Liberians, people that are willing to work in the interest of the country. We don't need people who have degrees, and then they can't perform. No!''
 For all Weah's talk of change, though, it is not clear whether his campaign represents a populist departure or just a television-age rebranding of Liberia's perennial ways of leadership. Weah's wealth, and his generosity with it, is an asset to his campaign, most obviously because voters figure he won't rob the country blind. But it also taps the paternalistic vein in Liberian politics. A song written in tribute to one midcentury president went: ''Tubman is the father of us all/the father of the whole nation/He builds us roads/brings water/Tubman gives us food to eat.'' Weah's rank-and-file supporters sound the same themes: not about how he will rule, but about how he will provide.
 After our interview, I followed Weah downstairs to the crowded street below his office. Out on the sidewalk, a clutch of men in makeshift wooden wheelchairs sat waiting. Their legs were amputated or shriveled by polio. They begged for help. Weah pulled a thick wad of Liberian dollars from his pocket.
 As the candidate climbed into his Land Cruiser, the disabled men shouted, ''Thank you, Papa!'' 
The first annual George M. Weah Tournament, sponsored by a Liberian old-timers' league, took place on a rainy Sunday morning in May. George M. Weah provided the trophies and, only naturally, took part in the games, starting at striker for a team called the Kings. The matchup hardly seemed fair -- like Mark McGwire showing up for a friendly game of softball. Before the match, some awestruck members of the opposing team, the Wizards, jockeyed to have their pictures taken with Weah. But any illusions that the legend might take it easy were dispelled at the opening whistle. Weah made fluid runs up the field, embarrassing defenders by putting passes through their legs. The Kings scored three quick goals, but Weah kept pressing, scowling at bad passes and berating his less-talented teammates. It was a steamy day, and his white shirt soon shone through with sweat.
 Politics, Weah told me, is a game. ''You form your team. I form my team.'' I don't think he was speaking metaphorically. No matter how many ways I phrased the question, I never felt that he told me precisely why he was running for the presidency. But no one who knows the man can escape the impression that he sees his current occupation as a natural extension of his previous one -- that politics, like soccer, is just a sport to be mastered.
 But there's one crucial difference: In politics, winning is only the first stage of the game. The next president of Liberia will inherit a nation that is emotionally scarred and desperately poor. The economy is in shambles. Nearly a third of the country subsists on U.N. food aid. Hundreds of thousands live in mud-wattle refugee camps. Monrovia has no running water or electricity. The official unemployment rate is 85 percent. Deprivation fuels war, and even now, there are rumors of new armies forming in the bush. The warlord grudges and tribal rivalries that underlay the last conflict have not dissipated. Even Charles Taylor, exiled to Nigeria and a fugitive from a U.N. war crimes indictment, is said to be plotting his return. For the time being, peacekeepers are holding the angry factions at bay. But one day, perhaps not too far in the future, the blue helmets will leave, and Liberians will have to find a way to live with themselves.
 Weah comes to this struggle armed only with his supreme confidence. Yet he is drawing his support mainly from the Liberians who live closest to the margin between war and peace: the young, and especially the tens of thousands of battle-hardened youths who are tired of dying in the service of older men's ambitions. They don't care if Weah is not a ''book man.'' At rallies, they chant a variation of Charles Taylor's old slogan: ''You know book; or you not know book; I'll vote for you.'' They have put their trust in Weah because they believe his celebrity can be a weapon just as powerful as a gun.
 As the semifinal match wore on, the sidelines swelled with spectators, most of them young men from the nearby slums. Behind the splintery grandstand, I met a teenager, Elkaneh Daywe, who was kicking around a soccer ball with his younger brother. I asked him what he thought of Weah. ''He'll right the wrongs,'' Daywe said, assuredly. ''He's a world-famous man.'' 
 Hours later, Weah collected the trophy of the George M. Weah Tournament, as well as the M.V.P. award. Bone-weary, he trudged back to his Land Cruiser and took a back-jarring trip down the dirt road home.
 Weah arrived to find dozens of women gathered around his gate, singing songs, banging drums and waving tree branches in celebration of his victory. They were peddlers from the local market, and they wanted money to start a kickball team for their daughters. Weah gave his aides a look -- do we have to? -- and then, grimacing, got out of the car. He gave a brief speech, wiped his bald head with a handkerchief and accepted the women's prayers and blessings. Then he blew a kiss to everyone and shuffled through his gate. Tired, triumphant, King George was becoming a politician.

 To the Editor:
 Richard A. Posner has a famously prodigious and provocative mind. I always pick up a Posner essay expecting to be challenged by an original argument. So it was disheartening that his review of the latest crop of press-bashing books was mostly a regurgitation, as tendentious and cynical as the worst of the books he consumed. 
 First, and weirdly, he makes almost no distinctions within the vast category of American media, between those that are aggressively partisan and those that strive to keep opinion sequestered from news, between outlets that invest in serious reporting and those that simply riff on the reporting of others, between the sensational and the more high-minded, between organizations that hasten to correct errors and those that could not care less, between the cartoonish shout shows on cable TV and the more ambitious journalism of, say, the paper you are holding in your hands.
 Then he swallows almost uncritically the conventional hogwash of partisan critics on both sides: that ''the media'' (as accused from the right) work in tireless pursuit of a liberal agenda, and that they have (as accused from the left) become docile house pets of the Bush administration because they fear offending the powers that be.
 Finally, to explain the workings of this undifferentiated ''media,'' simultaneously liberal and supine, he applies his trademark theory of market determinism. Whether conspiratorially or instinctively (Posner is unclear on this), the media have changed course in response to economic threats. The liberal news organizations, he says, have become even more liberal in order to protect their market share -- to secure their base -- in times of mounting competition from blogs and conservative cable upstarts. At the same time they have grown more timid for fear of offending the ''social consensus, however dumb or even vicious the consensus.'' (He may despise the media, dear reader, but Posner doesn't think much of you, either.) In his view, the news media are ''just satisfying a consumer demand no more elevated or consequential than the demand for cosmetic surgery in Brazil or bullfights in Spain.'' In this, Posner the polemicist is sadly consistent with Posner the federal appeals court judge, who has been notably hostile to the idea that the First Amendment affords journalists special protections. (See his opinion in McKevitt v. Pallasch, 2003, disavowing any right to protect confidential sources.)
 Of course we serve a market, and respond to our economic interests. Our economic interests lie with readers (of many political colors, contrary to blogospheric conventional wisdom) who have high standards, who care about the same things we do and who would quickly desert us if they thought we were one-tenth as unprincipled as Posner implies. We are unquestionably in the business of satisfying a customer demand, but our customers -- both readers and advertisers -- come to us precisely in the expectation of receiving something ''more elevated or consequential'' than cosmetic surgery in Brazil. And we're proud to be able to give it to them.
 The saddest thing is that Judge Posner's market determinism leaves no room for the other dynamics I've witnessed in my 35 years in newspapers: the idealism of reporters who think they can make the world better, the intellectual satisfaction of puzzling through a complicated issue, the competitive gratification of being first to discover a buried story, the pride in striving to uphold a professional code of fair play, the quest for peer recognition and, yes, the feedback from attentive and thoughtful readers. He makes no allowance for the possibility that conscientious reporters and editors are capable of setting aside their personal beliefs or standing up to their advertisers (and the prejudices of their readers) to do work they believe in.
 Would he be so cynical about a world he actually knows? Is the behavior of the American judiciary explainable purely as a response to economic self-interest? Should we assume that all judicial rulings are panderings, either to the voting public or to the executives who hand out judicial appointments? Or should we allow that reverence for the law, a respect for how democracy functions, a sense of fairness, the satisfaction of a well-reasoned argument -- judgment -- have some relevance to how judges behave?
 I suppose the best refutation of the view that ''the media'' are guided solely by narrow self-interest, however, is this: We published Posner.

 Viewed from our hyperpower perspective, the decades between the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 were so precarious they seem to belong almost to the history of another country. And in many ways they do. The ''United States'' at that time was to the east coast of North America what Chile now is to the west coast of the southern cone: a long and ribbonlike territory with indistinct or disputed frontiers, caught between mountains and the ocean. Three large European empires -- British, French and Spanish -- exerted immense influence on the rest of the continent, and on the Atlantic and Caribbean approaches to it. The new Republic had a tenuous and fluctuating relationship with France, a hostile one with Britain and a competitive one with Spain. It had no army or navy to speak of, and a Constitution that was skeptical about, if not antagonistic to, the maintenance of permanent armed forces. The two human symbols of this vulnerability were the American sailor seized from his ship and ''impressed'' into the British or French Navy, and the sailor or passenger taken at sea by marauding Muslim pirates and delivered into slavery.
 Each of three new books treats a different aspect of that vertiginous period. The word ''corsair,'' which can mean either pirate ship or pirate, became inextricably and incorrectly linked with the Romantic as a result of Byron's 1814 poem of that name. But corsairs ruthlessly kidnapped and plundered, whether in Africa (the Barbary Coast) or the Gulf of Mexico. We may still harbor a slight sympathy for the smuggler and the bootlegger, but there was little romance in living at a time when such people had state power.
 Finally resolving the question of how the Laffite/Lafitte/Laffitte family actually spelled its name (it evidently never quite made up its mind and wasn't much of a nursery of literacy), William C. Davis in ''The Pirates Laffite'' takes us to New Orleans in the period immediately following Thomas Jefferson's acquisition of the Louisiana territories. Nobody quite knew where the new frontiers were; it was not clear whether Spain had accepted Napoleon's right to dispose of such a vast area; the status of Florida was undecided by the sale; and in the meantime the city was ruled by a few American officials and judges presiding over rather than governing a mass of slaves, free blacks, Creoles, Spaniards and Frenchmen. On islands in the neighboring bay of Barataria (quixotically named after the ''isle'' acquired by Sancho Panza in ''Don Quixote'') a more or less self-governing pirate republic had established itself. 
 Here the Laffite half brothers, Pierre and Jean, who had standardized the signatures they used, disposed of substantial numbers of slaves and vast quantities of contraband, confident that many respectable citizens of New Orleans would not scruple to avoid the 1808 prohibition on importing the first, and the tiresome duties payable on the second. Rebecca West once described a Serbian peasant who was stopped by the king and asked how he was doing. The honest fellow's response -- that the pigs thrived and the smuggling trade flourished also, thank you -- would summarize the relationship between authority and organized crime in Lousiana then. 
 The piratical idyll was, however, threatened by two variables: ever-changing alliances among Madrid, Paris and London meant that pirates never quite knew which empire had the upper hand; and, at the same time, Washington was determined to establish its own monopoly of force and trade at the mouth of the Mississippi. The Laffites are wrapped in myth -- Davis continually resorts to formulations like ''they may have'' -- but in the War of 1812 they emerged into real history. The British had sent a ship to Barataria, to see if the corsairs might join their attack on the United States, and the Laffites brilliantly parlayed this offer into an approach to the American authorities: in exchange for immunity from innumerable potential prosecutions, might they enlist their ruffians under the Stars and Stripes? 
 This daring early instance of plea-bargaining brought, among other things, 7,500 much-needed flints for muskets to General Andrew Jackson's armory for the defense of New Orleans. Small though their forces were, the Baratarians performed relatively well under fire during the Battle of New Orleans and were soon after granted a pardon by President James Madison. This freed the Laffites to resume slaving and pirating in the disputed territories around Mexico, Texas and Cuba, and to meet their deaths (Pierre by fever and Jean by enemy action) by 1823. Davis fills out this squalid footnote to our past with great skill, though as a historian of the Confederacy he should have been more fastidious than to write that when Jean Laffite caught a runaway slave, ''he arrested the black for return to its owner.'' 
 Slavery of another type was part of the subtext of the Laffite affair. The American officer most determined to close down Barataria was a 25-year-old naval lieutenant, Daniel Tod Patterson, who had spent unpleasant time as a captive in Tripoli (today's Libya). His experience was not uncommon. The evidence of the best modern historians -- Linda Colley's ''Captives'' being the most salient work -- is that upward of a million Americans and Europeans were kidnapped or enslaved by the Barbary States, the North African provinces of the Ottoman Empire, in the 17th and 18th centuries. Command of the Strait of Gibraltar gave the Barbary monarchs a huge strategic advantage. They kidnapped human property not only on the high seas but also from towns as far north as Iceland as well as from Ireland and the western peninsula of Britain.
 More recent angst between the United States and the Arab and Muslim world has revived interest in the half-forgotten Barbary wars, during which Jefferson and Madison dispatched successful naval expeditions to punish the piratical regimes in Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis and Morocco. (The words ''to the shores of Tripoli'' in the first line of the Marine Corps hymn enshrine the memory of the first conflict in which American troops were deployed overseas.) In ''The Barbary Wars,'' Frank Lambert deals with the macro element of this campaign: the economic imperative underlying it. In ''White Gold,'' Giles Milton takes a more micro approach, generalizing the story of the many victims through the horrific experience of one English captive. 
 The whole enterprise of American independence, as Lambert shows, was predicated on free trade versus mercantilism, and the related idea that American vessels should be able to trade with whomever they pleased. This aspiration was hampered during the first decades of independence by conflicts and compromises rising from Anglo-French rivalry in the Atlantic. But it was flat-out negated by the Barbary policy of extortion, ransom, blackmail and slave-taking. 
 When London's protection was withdrawn from the ships of the upstart former American colonies, their crews and cargoes were at the mercy of Muslim raiders who, often incited by the British, captured them with relative ease. (Anyone wanting to protest Jefferson's naval expedition against these slave states would have had to employ the slogan ''No blood for free trade'' or else ''No blood for manumission.'') Lambert is uneasy about comparisons to more recent combats, and wants to insist on the struggle for free navigation, but this leads him into the error of denial. He says religion had little or nothing to do with the matter. That may have been true as far as the United States was concerned but was emphatically not the case with the Ottoman enemy. Barbary leaders, while they were interested in gain, still explicitly claimed that the Koran gave them the right to enslave infidels, and on one occasion they told Jefferson and John Adams this to their faces. 
 Under American naval pressure, including bombardment, most of the Barbary States finally agreed to abandon slavery and piracy during the Jefferson administration. But a new despot in Algiers was induced by British perfidy to revive the business during the War of 1812. Intended to weaken and divert American resistance to the British Navy on the other side of the ocean at New Orleans, this cynical tactic had the opposite effect. A battle-hardened American fleet under Stephen Decatur secured a complete capitulation in Algiers, and also the release of many wretched slaves. The reign of Barbary terror was finally over. This triumph in late 1815 was somewhat eclipsed by other world-shaking events at Waterloo and the Congress of Vienna, but a shrewd European or North African would still have noticed that a whole new maritime and political and economic power had stepped firmly onto history's stage. 
 Giles Milton's title, ''White Gold,'' is clearly intended as an answering echo to the vile term ''black gold'' that was used by the slave traders operating farther down Africa's western coast. There is nothing essentially illegitimate in this equivalence, except that the Barbary traders would often redeem slaves for hard cash, and there was no ''Middle Passage'' in which a third of those captured were considered expendable. To the captives themselves, however, such distinctions would have seemed irrelevant. The Cornishman John Pellow, seized and placed on the auction block in Morocco in 1716, along with his 11-year-old nephew, felt all the pangs of forced labor and sadistic treatment. The fact that he and others were able to read and write, and sometimes to get letters home, is a boon more to historians than it was to themselves. James Thomson's famous ditty, ''Rule Britannia,'' with its refrain about ''Britons never will be slaves,'' derives from the vast public agitation that developed against the Barbary atrocities. It was to take a little time before the outraged English (or the outraged Americans, for that matter) decided to look in the mirror and to abolish their own slave systems. But this only proves again that history is ironic and that our barbarous species evolves in uneven ways.

HEADLINE: Down Off the Farm

BYLINE: By Stephen Munshin.

DATELINE: Sag Harbor 

 BODY:
THIS coming weekend, the East End of Long Island will be the site of the first Hamptons Wine and Food Festival. With our waters teeming with seafood; our fields overflowing with corn, melons and tomatoes; and our wines gaining national recognition, this is the perfect setting. 
 And you would think that with all this abundance, the festival (of which this newspaper is one of the sponsors) would be a celebration of the area's bounty. Unfortunately, that's not the case. 
Unlike the Bridgehampton Country Fair, which took place in almost the exact same spot more than a century ago as a harvest celebration where farmers from Sag Harbor, East Hampton and Montauk paraded prize-winning hogs and showed off blue-ribbon pies, this festival is taking its cues from flashy foodie events in places like South Beach, Fla., and Aspen, Colo. 
 Despite claims on the festival's Web site that the event will feature ''the best local'' celebrity chefs and winemakers, it will not showcase the East End's agricultural heritage. And that's a shame because the organizers are missing an excellent opportunity to boost the area's next generation of farmers, who, rather than selling their land for tons of money, are devoting their creative energies to finding innovative ways to keep the family farm alive. 
 To be sure, there are a few regional events. My magazine, Edible East End, is organizing some seminars spotlighting local people like Marilee Foster, a member of one of the oldest potato-farming families on the East End who has made the leap from spuds to chips, and Prudence Wickham, whose North Fork farm shifted its focus to growing fruit when that's what the market dictated. And we'll also have seminars by local cheese makers and beekeepers. Unfortunately, these local folks are a sideshow to the festival's main attractions. Of the more than 40 events scheduled, only seven have a regional focus. The beer from the nationally renowned Publick House brewery in Southampton and the legendary pies from Briermere Farms in Riverhead would have been palette pleasing additions to the main stage. 
 What you'll see at the Hamptons Wine and Food Festival are Moet & Chandon and Johnny Walker seminars, a Tuscan wine and meat tasting and a seminar on the pleasure of pairing Kentucky Fried Chicken with a sparkling wine from California. California! Furthermore, most of the celebrity chefs hail from New York City. 
 The price of admission, from $150 to $650 per person, isn't cheap. It's clear that at that price during the final days of August, the organizers are trying to attract the upper-income, part-time Hamptonites, not the locals. But why not lower the price so that locals can attend and feature local talent and produce? Marketing an event to the community by focusing on its own is good for the economy and makes sense -- and trust me, a festival with a local slant will still draw the weekenders looking to discover the simple pleasures of country life. 
 So while it's too late to change the program this year, let's think about next year's festival. For starters, let's change the focus to local. Give attendees an insight into the history of the area. Teach them about ''Bridgehampton loam'' -- the perfect combination of sand, clay and silt -- that still occupies the top position in the Department of Agriculture's soil classification system. Show them that while the East End is no longer the breadbasket of New York City, it is certainly the supplier of choice for Long Islanders. 
 And have the families who have worked this land for generations -- the Halseys and the Lathams to name just two -- supply the fare. Look to the remaining baymen for seafood. Channing Daughters Winery and Wolffer Estate Vineyards pour nationally recognized wines within a mile of the festival and could play the role of wine educators. And finally, instead of holding the festival in August, when local people are the busiest, have it in early October to coincide with the harvest and the availability of seasonal favorites like apples, pumpkins and Peconic Bay scallops. 
 It may take a few years for people to catch on and for festivalgoers to appreciate the region's wines, cheeses, seafood and produce as much as the high-profile imports. But it will build strong local and regional relations over the long term, and the hard work just might yield the festival everyone wants.

HEADLINE: South Korea, in Turnabout, Now Calls for More Babies

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: WANDO, South Korea 

 BODY:
After Park Pil Soo's second child was born nine years ago, he followed national family planning entreaties to limit families to two children by undergoing a free, government-sponsored vasectomy.
 Then, in April, Mr. Park took advantage of a new policy, and had the vasectomy reversed, also at the state's expense. He and his wife, Yang Eun Hwa, 36, are now trying to have a third child.
 After decades of promoting smaller families, South Korea -- like several other Asian countries facing plummeting birthrates -- is desperately seeking ways to get people to have more babies. 
 In South Korea, the decline has been so precipitous that it caught the government off guard. Policies devised to discourage more than two children, like vasectomies and tubal ligations, were covered under the national health plan until last year. This year, the plan began covering reverse procedures for those two operations, as well as care for a couple's third or fourth child.
 ''I'd been thinking about getting the operation for a while, but was concerned about the cost,'' said Mr. Park, 37, who runs the Samsung Electronics store in this seaside town on the southern shore of the Korean Peninsula. 
 In South Korea, as in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, quick economic growth and social changes have produced disturbingly low birthrates that are transforming their societies and threatening their economic strength. In this ethnically homogenous nation, as in Japan, there is no support for the kind of immigration that has increased birthrates in some Western nations, including the United States. 
 ''In the next two or three years, we won't be able to increase the birthrate,'' said Park Ha Jeong, a director general in the Health Ministry. ''But we have to stop the decline, or it will be too late.''
 Young couples in Seoul and other cities are choosing to have few babies, but the low birthrate has hit rural places like Wando County hardest. Within less than a decade, it has transformed South Korea's rural landscape, shuttering schools, shrinking class sizes, setting off villagewide celebrations for the rare birth of a baby.
 Growing up here, Park Pil Soo has watched family sizes shrink to fewer than two children from as many as eight, and Wando's population decreases year by year. People have grown richer here. At his Samsung store, residents began buying air-conditioners four years ago, and they expect television sets in each room and a refrigerator just for kimchi.
 ''People now want a higher living standard instead of children,'' he said, as he and his wife attended to customers on a recent Saturday.
 Wando's was the first local government to supplement the national health insurance to make reverse vasectomies and tubal ligations entirely free. So far, five men and two women have had the surgeries, said Hwang Dae Rae, the county official who came up with the idea and regularly calls the couples to inquire about possible ''good news.'' (None has been reported so far.) 
 Ms. Hwang acknowledged that the new policy would not solve the low birthrate problem, which, here and in the rest of Asia, is rooted in women's rising social and economic standing. ''In the past, women thought it was their obligation to have children, but not anymore,'' she said.
 Still, she said, the new policy is symbolic of the change in the national government's approach, whose longtime, single-minded focus on small families had put social pressure on South Koreans.
 Choi Hyung Soon, 40, one of the two women to undergo a reverse tubal ligation, now wants a third child. After she had had two sons in her 20's, she underwent a tubal ligation because it seemed the right thing to do.
 ''The campaign at the time was to have only two children,'' she said, at a barbecue restaurant she runs here. ''So one day a lot of my friends in the neighborhood decided to go have the operation, and I went along. I felt it was a foolish decision.''
 South Korea began aggressively promoting family planning in the 1960's, fearing that overpopulation would impede its economic growth. Slogans at the time warned South Koreans, who averaged six children per family, that they would become ''beggars without family planning.'' Even in the 1980's, slogans declared that ''even two are a lot.''
 Successful family planning, coupled with changing mores, led the birthrate to drop below the ideal population replacement level of 2.1 in the 1980's and then more precipitously in the mid-1990's. Now on average a South Korean woman will have 1.19 child in her lifetime -- a rate lower than Japan's birthrate of 1.28, comparable to Taiwan's 1.22, and higher than Hong Kong's 0.94. Mr. Park, of the Health Ministry, said the government committed itself to raising the birthrate only last year. ''We should have started these policies in the late 1990's, but we had been focused on decreasing the birthrate for 40 years and it was hard to change directions,'' he said.
 But some of the measures aimed at reversing the trend have done little more than suggest the government is still out of step with the times. A campaign earlier this year urged women to have at least two children by joining the ''1-2-3'' movement: have one child in the first year of marriage and a second before turning 30. It ended after many young women and men, who have been delaying marriage until their late 20's or later, said the campaign's expectations were unrealistic in this age.
 Mr. Park said the government was considering new measures to tackle some of the biggest reasons cited by couples for not having children, including the high costs of after-school education and the lack of day care. The government also wants to give tax breaks to couples with several children and encourage paid maternity leaves.
 Local governments are not waiting, though. In April, Seocheon, a west coast county whose population has declined from 150,000 in the 1960's to 65,000, began giving out bonuses for babies: $300 for the first or second child, $800 for the third.
 ''Some villages haven't heard babies crying in 18 years,'' said Lee Kwon Hee, the county deputy chief. At the Masan Elementary School, the population of 56 students is less than a tenth of what it was in the 1970's. Back then, pupils were packed together so that schools had what were called ''bean sprout classrooms,'' said Kim Deok Sang, the principal. Nowadays, Masan's students have to join those at the two nearest schools for sporting and other events. There was some good news, though, in at least one corner of Seocheon County. Last winter, the village of Seokdong celebrated its first newborn in four years -- twins, in fact, born to Lee Ji Yun, 28, and her husband, Park Dae Soo, 32. Their 4-year-old daughter had been the last child born there.
 The young couple own 10 cows and farm potatoes, rice, garlic and chilies. Although the county gave them a total of $1,100 for the twins, they emphasized that the cash incentive played no role in their decision. Mr. Park said he doubted that the bonus would bolster the birthrate.
 His wife, a nurse who stopped working when the twins were born, nodded. ''If I hadn't had twins, I would have kept working,'' she said, citing inadequate medical and day care. ''The government should look at this society's fundamental problems,'' her husband said, ''instead of just handing out money.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Pact Divides the Central Americans, With Farmers and Others Fearful

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: BIJAGUA, Costa Rica 

 BODY:
Bolivar Elizondo barely ekes out a living on his 25-acre farm in the mountains near Bijagua, where he raises chickens, pigs, pineapples and a dozen cows. But his biggest worry these days is a free trade agreement with the United States. 
 A man who must do everything by hand with a machete or knife, Mr. Elizondo depends on selling about 50 pigs a year to finance the rest of his tiny operation. He says he can never compete with the large mechanized meat producers from the United States that are expected to invade the market over the next 20 years if Costa Rica's legislature approves the accord.
''Without selling the pigs, I don't know how to survive,'' he said as he fed plantains to his swine. ''I can't support myself. I will have to sell this. Who is going to buy it? Not another Costa Rican. It will be a multinational corporation.'' 
 The Central America Free Trade Agreement, known as Cafta, was barely passed by Congress in late July after President Bush put on a masterly display of logrolling and arm-twisting. But even in this region the agreement is far from a done deal. It has become a toxic political issue here in Central America's richest economy as well as in several others, including countries where the pact has already passed the legislatures. 
 Mr. Bush argues that the deal will shore up political stability in the region and reduce a $2.3 billion deficit with the countries involved. But negotiators for the region did not have enough leverage to pry many concessions from the United States, critics and even some supporters said. 
 A high-ranking Costa Rican official, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of offending his American counterparts, said the implicit threat was that temporary trade preferences enjoyed under old agreements would not be renewed. Central American countries had to get on board with the new pact or risk watching their exports dwindle. 
 United States trade officials say they argued that a permanent agreement was a better deal for smaller countries than the two-decade-old, one-way trade preferences that could disappear at the whim of Congress. But they did not dispute that reluctance to extend the preferences past 2008 might have spurred countries to join the new pact. 
 ''If a country chooses not to ratify Cafta and open its markets to U.S. goods and services, it should not automatically assume that Congress would continue to provide it preferential one-way access into the U.S. market,'' said Neena Moorjani, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, Rob Portman.
 As such, the treaty has divided Costa Ricans and others in the region, with people both for and against it now warning of impending doom if they do not get their way. 
 If the pact is approved, small farmers like Mr. Elizondo say they will be wiped out. If it is not, Costa Rican manufacturers like Luis Gamboa, whose factory produces stoves and refrigerators, say they may move to another country. 
 Labor leaders threaten strikes and scream that the treaty will force public-sector layoffs and drive up health care costs. Flower growers say they will go out of business without it.
 The accord arouses such passions that the Costa Rican president, Abel Pacheco, dismissed all the negotiators and postponed sending it to the legislature for nearly 18 months. Most political analysts say he plans to let the next president deal with the issue, which is already defining the presidential race this winter. 
 Alberto Trejos, the former trade minister, negotiated the deal for Costa Rica and then resigned last year in protest, saying the president lacked the stomach to face down the unions here. ''The president and government have at this late stage of their administration lost the nerve for a big fight,'' he said in an interview. 
 Nor have Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic passed the accord yet, for similar reasons. 
 Even in Guatemala, where the legislature did approve the agreement, there were violent demonstrations against it. In El Salvador, one of the United States' closest allies, health care workers marched to protest the pact before it passed. 
 Critics across the region, mostly laborite or leftist in their views, see the pact as a one-way street, benefiting United States multinational corporations at the expense of Central America's small businesses and farmers. 
 ''Where is the evidence that this is going to develop us?'' said Otton Solis, an economist who is running for president in the Citizen Action Party. ''This is going to create more poverty and Central America will expel more people toward the U.S.A.''
 ''I never imagined Cafta was going to be so one sided,'' he added. ''The law of the jungle benefits the big beast. We are a very small beast.''
 Opponents like him point to the experience of Mexico, whose 10-year experiment in free trade with the United States has depopulated much of the countryside and sent waves of migration north of the border.
 With that in mind, perhaps no Costa Rican region has more at stake than Guanacaste, where tens of thousands of small farmers like Mr. Elizondo raise beef, pigs, rice and sugar cane. 
 Rice farmers here see the agreement as an unmitigated disaster. Even though they have 10 years before the 35 percent duty on imported rice begins to disappear, most say they will never be able compete with rice farmers in the United States, who have better technology and receive huge subsidies. 
 It costs about $250 to produce a ton of rice in both countries, but the Americans sell it on the world market for much less, farmers here said. 
 ''It's impossible for is to be competitive with all the subsidies that the North Americans have,'' said Emilio Rodriguez Pacheco, 48, who farms about 25 acres of rice here. ''For the rice sector it's a tragedy.''
 At the same time, critics point out that vulnerable parts of the United States economy remain protected, even in areas where Central American negotiators managed small inroads, like sugar and textiles. 
 The agreement, for instance, leaves in place the price supports for American sugar, while opening the door only a crack, letting in imports equal to 1 percent of United States production. 
 The part on textiles was also written to protect United States fabric and yarn factories, this time from Chinese competition. It requires that 90 percent of apparel turned out by Central America makers use American fabrics, which they can buy duty free. 
 ''If we are in Cafta, we can survive,'' said Maria A. Quirce, the executive director of the Chamber of Textile Exporters. ''If we are out of Cafta, we are out of business.'' 
 Defenders of the pact say most of the complaints are baseless and born of fear of change. Freer access to the North American market is the only way, they maintain, for Central American economies to grow. 
 Meanwhile, if the structure of the Costa Rican economy changes, then so be it. Ruined farmers will shift to export crops or find other kinds of work. Foreign investment will bring more jobs. 
 ''We are condemned to be traders,'' said former President Oscar Arias, who is running for president again this year and supports the treaty. ''We produce what we do not consume and we consume what we do not produce.''
 He added, ''It is essential for us to have access to the market.''
 Flower growers, for instance, say they have no choice but to support the new pact. Losing the low tariffs they have lived under in recent years, in part ushered in under agreements like the Caribbean Basin Initiative in 2000, would be disastrous for them. 
 ''The free trade treaty, for us, would just keep up the status quo,'' said Michael Thomas, the general manager of the American Flowers Corporation, in Alajuela.
 The same holds true for Sardimar S.A., a seafood processing company in the pacific port of Puntarenas, said Gabriella Munoz, an executive with the company, and for Atlas Electrica S.A., the stove and refrigerator maker that Mr. Gamboa owns. 
 Mr. Gamboa said he would like to enter into the American market, but would not risk plunking down the money to expand his factory unless he knew the treaty was in place. ''The United States market is what all the manufacturers are looking for,'' he said.
 Some of the biggest winners are expected to be American companies who already have manufacturing plants here, like Intel, Conair, subsidiaries of Lee and Wrangler jeans, and Rawlings Sporting Goods, which makes major league baseballs in Costa Rica.
 But for many Costa Ricans, the most difficult points in the treaty are provisions that open the telecommunications market and protect the property rights of big American pharmaceutical companies from generic drug makers here. 
 Both steps are expected to raise prices in parts of the economy that are treasured, in effect, as social equalizers. The state telephone and electricity company, for instance, has provided subsidized service for decades, giving Costa Ricans the cheapest telephone service in Latin America. 
 The unions representing the utility's 10,000 workers contend that the treaty will let big companies drive their operation out of business in a few years. A vast strike and street protests are likely if the treaty is passed, said Mauricio Gonzalez, president of a union representing professionals in the state telephone and energy monopoly. 
 ''We see the free trade treaty as an instrument used for many things that don't have anything to do with business,'' he said, ''but with dismantling our model of social development.''

HEADLINE: Summer's Rebels: Hell No, We Won't Go 

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton. 
E-mail: eaton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ABOUT 4 o'clock this afternoon, I can almost guarantee that I will be standing on the porch of my house upstate, trying to ignore the little demon on my shoulder. 
 ''It's so beautiful here,'' the devil will whisper in my ear. ''The drive back to the city will be so long. The apartment will be soooo hot and stuffy. Why don't you just stay.'' 
 Leave the zucchini on the vine; leave the last sweet peas in the jug; leave all the windows open. Just don't leave. Ever.
 I suspect this temptation is experienced by many New Yorkers lucky enough to own, rent or borrow a place outside the city, even for a week or two. Especially in the last days of August, when the streets are hot, the air is soggy, and we are tired of seeing other people's tattoos.
 It must be especially acute in places that are jammed with weekenders and vacationers and tourists. If you live in East Hampton in the off-season, you can see the beaches that artists fell in love with, long before the onslaught of bling and investment bankers. Crowding is not a problem in my part of the state, unless you count the Wal-Mart parking lot on a rainy Saturday morning. The north part of Delaware County, my vacation spot, is on the far side of the Catskills, a good three hours outside the city.
 Delaware County is known for its beautiful countryside, its quaint villages and its almost complete lack of places to go and things to do, at least by big-city standards. There are a lot of cows. But the temptation to stay can be fierce. In the country, my daughter can play outside unchaperoned. My husband can keep bees. My dog can roam the hayfields; I don't have to clean up after it. And my cellphone seldom works.
 In the years I have spent upstate, I have learned to mark the passing of the seasons in minute detail, and I mourn every change that I miss while I am back in the city. That's true even at this hot, slow time of year. Will my Alma Potschke asters bloom while I am away? Will the sweet corn turn tough? Will there be any wild blueberries left to pick? 
 I know people who have given up the city without turning into characters from ''Green Acres'' (or ''The Simple Life''). On a rare evening out on the town in Delhi, our county seat, I ran into an old friend, an artist who had always seemed firmly rooted in SoHo. But the loft has been sold, and she and her husband are now living full time near Delhi in the converted barn that was once their weekend place.
 She seemed really happy. She said she had lots of friends, had lots to do -- and in Delaware County, she said, it was possible to live on very little money.
 ''Drawbacks?'' I asked. Having to find a new dentist and doctor, she said. The dearth of dry cleaners. The winter, although they inherited a place in Florida where they can retreat in the bleak months after Christmas.
 That got me thinking. If I stayed upstate, I'd have to take up lace-making, or fly-tying, or putting tiny ships in tiny bottles to keep myself sane from November through March. I'd probably have to home-school my unfortunate child. And where in the world would I get my hair cut? 
 Then there's the little matter of earning a living. The unemployment rate is low in the county, but not because the job market is booming; quite the reverse. The unemployment rate measures the percentage of the population looking for work and failing to find it; my impression is that people who are looking for work look elsewhere. Many of my neighbors are elderly, their children and grandchildren having long since moved, drawn by opportunity elsewhere. I don't think dairy farming is my calling.
 Perhaps it would be possible to telecommute, especially if I had a great computer and a satellite dish. Maybe someday, that is what I will do. Maybe, when my child is grown and I no longer think it is fun to roam around the boroughs even when I have to take the N train. Maybe, if I can persuade someone to pay me.
 But the truth is, I love my city, with all its irritating gridlock and annoying ads and horrendous expenses. I still think it's cool to hear Korean and Urdu and Spanish, all on the same block. I can't quite imagine living in a place where you cannot pay people to bring food to your door. 
 Then there's this. At the end of tonight's long, slow drive, as we plow through a stretch of New Jersey, Manhattan's skyline will suddenly sparkle on the horizon. ''Look,'' one of us will say, ''there's our city!'' And my heart will lift.

HEADLINE: Indiana Jones, With a Trowel

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL

 BODY:
NICHOLAS BELLANTONI'S schedule reads like a new C.S.I. series with a madcap tinge.
 In one episode, he uses ground-penetrating radar to scour the Harriet Beecher Stowe estate in Hartford for clues about the final years of the author's life.
In another, he digs for evidence of Colonial settlers around a collapsed pile of rocks in Danbury. And in the season finale, he uses his forensic skills to assist Fairfield County police in a murder investigation. 
 Dr. Bellantoni is no fictional detective. His title is Connecticut State Archaeologist, and that list of activities is just a sampling of his duties last month. 
 Since 1987, Dr. Bellantoni, 56, has been the primary protector of historic and archaeological sites on the state's private land. Whether preserving a 17th-century Pequot Indian cemetery found on a construction site, confirming the authenticity of Revolutionary War artifacts discovered in East Haddam, or searching for unmarked African graves in the Little Liberia section of Bridgeport, he is a spokesman for 11,000 years of Connecticut's past.
 Almost every state has an officially designated archaeologist, as mandated by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Connecticut has two. The other, David Poirier, is the staff archaeologist with the Connecticut State Historic Preservation Office in Hartford; he works with federal and state agencies on public projects on public land. 
 Dr. Bellantoni, who also teaches archaeology at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, reports to 169 Connecticut municipalities. He focuses on privately owned shopping malls, subdivisions, golf courses, parking lots and the like. That means much of the time he works with developers and lawyers who are not necessarily convinced that preservation plays a role in multimillion-dollar economic development plans. 
 ''We try not to hold up construction,'' he said. ''We don't like to work that way because if we create hardships or stop things, people are less likely to want to work with us.''
 Dr. Bellantoni's office is based at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, home of the natural history museum and the archaeology center. But most of the time he is in the field.
 On a recent Monday morning, he was tromping through the woods near a private home in Danbury, his wispy gray hair slicked back with sweat, a cellphone and two tape measures in his belt, a trowel in his back pocket. The knees of his jeans were covered in dirt, his T-shirt soaked through. In his palm, he held a tiny shard of glazed blue porcelain, no bigger than his pinky nail. 
 ''We have an artifact,'' he said. 
 His volunteer crew -- two high school students, one college student, an anthropology professor and the chairman of the Connecticut natural history museum -- gathered around. 
 ''The ceramic is 19th century, I'm anticipating, because of the coloration and where it was found,'' Dr. Bellantoni said. ''It might give us an indication that this was a residential setting.''
 For Dr. Bellantoni, tiny clues like these can conjure the landscape of an entire culture. 
 ''He has a respect for people who lived in Connecticut 8,000 years ago that most people don't even have for their great-grandparents,'' said Leanne Kennedy Harty, director of the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History and the Connecticut Archaeology Center. 
 That imaginative involvement in his fieldwork, she said, also makes him a popular professor. His annual undergraduate archaeology survey course for 250 students is almost always over-enrolled. 
 ''People come to Nick's class who aren't signed up for it and stand in the doorways and sit in the aisles,'' Ms. Harty said. It is tempting to think of Dr. Bellantoni as a kind of Indiana Jones: a dreamy professor, handy with a pick axe, who can also outrun a boulder 10 times his size. But Dr. Nick, as his students call him, cuts more of a Chaplin-esque profile. Standing about 5 feet 6 inches and weighing 140, he has a narrow gray mustache and a slightly crooked smile. ''Being an archaeologist, it helps to be close to the ground,'' he said jokingly.
 He lost about half his hearing working as a Navy signalman on the U.S.S. Wasp, an anti-submarine aircraft carrier that hunted for Russian submarines in the Vietnam era, and now wears two hearing aids. Often, while working on a dig or crawling into caves, he can be heard singing a Frank Sinatra ballad.
 He was born in Port Chester, N.Y., in 1948 to a ''classic old-time Italian barber'' and an office worker at the Connecticut aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. His family moved to Hartford when he was 4, and since then he has spent most of his life in Connecticut. He attended Middlesex Community College on the G.I. Bill, and matriculated from Central Connecticut State College in New Britain. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Connecticut in 1987. 
 That was the year the Connecticut Legislature reconfigured the office of state archaeology, making it a much more active post. He got the job right out of graduate school, and has held it since. Married, with two grown stepchildren, he plans to stay there until he retires, he said. In this state, he will never be short on work. 
 ''We've got places like Stonington, Conn., one of the earliest Colonial farm areas going back to the 1640's,'' he said. ''And on top of that, Native American sites that go back thousands of years and African-American sites. It's a rich cultural story, and not all of it is documented yet. Part of that story is still in the ground.''

HEADLINE: The Trickle-Down Costs of Higher Oil

BYLINE: By GREG CLARKIN

 BODY:
WITH gasoline prices reaching $2.50 a gallon and climbing, and prices for petroleum-related products rising as well, Connecticut retailers and business owners say they are struggling to keep pace with rising gas bills and price increases from manufacturers. And, they say, they are beginning to pass along these costs to consumers.
 ''It's finally beginning to dawn on people that $65-a-barrel oil is here to stay,'' said Fred Cartensen, a professor of economics at the University of Connecticut. ''It's slowly sinking in that this is a permanent change.'' 
 Crude-oil costs are showing up in higher prices for items and goods throughout the economy, Dr. Cartensen said.
 ''It's the value chain,'' he said. ''They're all getting things based on the petrochemical process.'' 
 Edward Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University, said, ''It's what I tell my students on the very first day of class, that of all the resources we have at our disposal, probably the one with the widest impact is petroleum.'' 
 Glen Rega owns two local businesses, the Stratfield IGA Supermarket in Fairfield and Beachside Supermarket in Milford. ''Every vendor that delivers to my stores, their fuel charges are going up and they're passing the costs along to us,'' he said. ''They're just raising everything, flat out raising everything across the board.''
 Mr. Rega said he just received notice of a price increase from his linen company, which cleans the aprons and smocks used by deli workers and cashiers. The reason, he said, was higher gas costs for the company's fleet of vehicles.
 The same day, he said, he was notified of a price increase from the cutlery company that sharpens the knives and slicing machines in the stores.
 Like other retailers, Mr. Rega is facing the dilemma of whether to pass these higher costs along or absorb them.
 ''Some of it I have to eat, and some of it I have to pass on,'' he said.
 Larry Buck, manager of Feinsod Hardware on Sound Beach Avenue in Old Greenwich, says he feels the pinch of higher fuel costs every time he looks out the door to the store and sees, on the sidewalk, a garbage-can shed for sale. The wholesale price on it went up $27 recently, an increase of more than 10 percent, Mr. Buck said.
 Part of that is being passed along to the consumer, he said, through a new $10 delivery charge for that item, which was tacked on to an existing $15 assembly fee.
 Mr. Buck said that while some customers may grumble about the new delivery charge, most understand.
 He said that he had also begun charging for delivery of some other items, but that some delivery requests were just too small to justify the gas used.
 ''Sometimes I just can't afford to send somebody out,'' Mr. Buck said. ''I'm not going to use $10 in gas to make $12 in profits.''
 Some wholesale prices have increased only a little, Mr. Buck said, like Rubbermaid's recently increased charges for an array of household items like garbage cans and storage bins. This raises are too small to pass on to the consumer, he said, so he must absorb them.
 ''If something goes up a quarter, I can't raise it a quarter,'' he said. ''You start nickel-and-diming customers, and they'll never come back.
 Marty McCarthy, owner of Marty's Pizza and More in Bridgeport, said he feared alienating customers with a delivery charge. He said pizza customers usually have three or four stores from which they can order, and he did not want to give them a reason to switch.
 ''Customers are eating out less, and you don't want to start charging them for deliveries,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''You bite the bullet.''
 He is not directly absorbing the higher gas prices anyway, because his drivers have to buy their own gas.
 ''Hopefully people will tip them,'' he said.
 But he does have to deal with the rising costs of the ingredients, all of which are dropped off by truck. Mr. McCarthy said the business was too competitive to raise prices, so he was considering adding items to the menu.
 ''We might add higher-end items that have higher profit margins,'' he said.
 In the floral business, delivery charges are well established. But because of rising gas prices, some Connecticut florists are considering increasing those charges.
 ''So far we've just been more or less living with it, but we're getting ready to make an adjustment,'' said Rick Crays, owner of Hansen's Flower Shop in Fairfield.
 Hansen's has four delivery vehicles that combined make up to 60 deliveries a day, Mr. Crays estimated. The delivery charge is $6 now, but he may raise it to $6.50 or $7.
 ''We're trying a lot of different ways to save in other areas,'' Mr. Crays said. But, he added, if the talked-about $3-a-gallon gas becomes a reality in Connecticut, he may have to raise the charge.
 David Anton, 27, owns Vanguard Moving and Storage in Norwalk. He said his fuel charges were so high that customers inevitably question them when he hands over the estimate.
 ''They look at me like, 'Why am I paying for the fuel?''' Mr. Anton said. His standard reply is ''because we're doing the job for you.''
 The gas bill for a local move is between $25 and $30, Mr. Anton said. He calculates the bill based on a charge of $2 an hour with the average local move averaging about 14 hours. But that $2-an-hour fee will probably be raised soon, he said, to keep up with the increase at the pumps.
 The real cost, he said, is in fuel charges for long-distance moves. A year ago, when he bought Vanguard, fuel was calculated as an extra 9 percent of the total cost of the move; today, it is 13 percent. This means that on a $5,000 move, the fuel alone is an additional $650.
 With a fleet of five trucks and two vans, Mr. Anton said his fuel and gas bill for July was $4,800, with his largest truck costing $240 to fill up. 
 ''It's killing us,'' Mr. Anton said.
 Home builders have also been hit by the rising cost of crude. A number of home-building products from tar paper to roofing shingles are made from derivatives of petroleum, and all have risen significantly in price, builders say.
 Tom Casey, of P. Casey & Son in Shelton, said it was becoming harder to stick to an estimate on a job as the customer decides whether to go ahead with the work or not. While customers may take months to decide, the prices for raw materials keep rising.
 ''Usually the higher costs hit manufacturers quite a while before it trickles down to us, but what we're starting to see now are materials deliveries that are starting to have a fuel surcharge,'' Mr. Casey said. He said the surcharges run from $20 to $40 and in some cases higher.

HEADLINE: Addressing Matters Of Eminent Domain

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''When the Bulldozers Never Arrive,'' you referred to ''a swampy park'' that the Oak Street Connector-Route 34 road would have had to cross. This is a tidal wetland along the West River that is home to ospreys, has canoe access to the river, and connects a string of parklands extending miles inland. Your designation did not do justice to the environment that has been preserved by not building the highway.
The future of these blocks of undeveloped land along Route 34 is at risk as well. Clearly, the land will not be returned to the people from whom it was taken. But it has potential as a public resource, with, perhaps, a bicycle path and other amenities for the abutting neighbors. 
 At the moment, though, it appears more likely to be used for commercial building sites. If that happens, eventually the traffic that now flows smoothly westward will become congested, as it was before urban renewal, while the neighborhood will still be among the ones in New Haven with the least access to parkland.

HEADLINE: Stock Market Listens to Retailers' Warnings

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
Profit warnings and slipping oil prices more than offset signs of continued economic growth, leading the major stock market indexes to end lower last week. 
 Retailing shares fell sharply after Limited Brands warned of slowing sales. Limited shares fell 8.6 percent on the week, while its rival, Gap Inc., declined 8.7 percent. Gateway, the computer maker, fell 16.8 percent for the week, after it cut its sales and profit forecasts. 
Energy shares also fell, though the price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange spiked on Friday after attacks on United States warships in Jordan. Crude oil closed Friday at $65.38, down $1.48 for the week.
 Agilent Technologies, a scientific-equipment maker, climbed more than 16 percent for the week after it said it would eliminate 1,300 jobs and sell a unit as it restructures. Delphi, an auto parts maker in the midst of its own restructuring, gained 14.4 percent for the week. 
 For the week, the Dow industrials fell 41.08 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 10,559.23. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.68 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 1,219.71. The Nasdaq composite index lost 21.34 points, or 1.0 percent, to close at 2,135.56. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.21 percent from 4.24 percent the previous week. MARK A. STEIN

HEADLINE: Developers Find Newest Frontier On the East Side

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Lower Manhattan and the West Side may have occupied the headlines for the last few years as New York City has plotted the direction of its growth. But it is the East Side riverfront of Manhattan that may be about to undergo the city's most imminent transformation.
 Developers are now moving forward with three large projects on the far East Side between 42nd and 23rd Streets, demolishing the last vestiges of the area's industrial past to make way for one of the city's tallest residential buildings and several large office towers and bioscience buildings. As many as 4,000 new apartments would house at least 8,000 residents in the area.
A series of related projects would also reweave the neighborhood's fabric, eliminating the 42nd Street ramp to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in favor of a pedestrian bridge over the highway that would provide public access to the waterfront. The city also plans to fill in the missing links in the grassy esplanade that runs along the East River. 
 Long ago, the area's breweries, slaughterhouses, coal yards and warehouses began yielding ground to the United Nations and other residential and commercial buildings. But the latest round of projects represent the biggest development surge on the far East Side since the early 1980's, according to architects, real estate lawyers and neighborhood planners.
 The projects include a 35-story office building for the United Nations on First Avenue between 41st and 42nd Streets and a $700 million medical research center called East River Science Park, which would be built on 4.5 acres along First Avenue, between 28th and 29th Streets. 
 Perhaps the most significant project lies in between those two and involves one of Manhattan's largest swaths of undeveloped land, 9.2 acres south of the United Nations, where Con Edison's 105-year-old Waterside Steam Plant is scheduled for demolition. There has been little information released publicly about plans for the site up to now.
 According to lawyers and architects working on the project, Sheldon H. Solow, the developer who bought the property from Con Edison for $600 million last year, plans to build a commercial tower and an apartment building south of 41st Street, each of which would rival the height of Trump World Tower, the city's tallest residential tower. 
 Mr. Solow's residential tower is being designed by Richard Meier, the architect whose glass-and-steel towers in the West Village have attracted public attention and celebrity tenants. David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill is designing the commercial tower, which may include apartments and a rooftop restaurant.
 Mr. Solow is also proposing three other residential towers east of First Avenue and a roughly two-acre public park between 39th and 40th Streets that would offer unobstructed views of the East River and Queens. The developer plans to unveil his proposal after Labor Day and to begin the city's seven-month land-use review process later this year, or in early 2006.
 ''If we weren't doing ground zero and the West Side yards,'' Mr. Childs said, ''this would be called the project of a century. There will be real questions about height and density and shadows and all those things that communities worry about. But it's too important a piece of property not to do it right. We want to do a superb project with really outstanding architecture.''
 Some neighborhood groups and members of Community Board 6, whose district embraces the far East Side, are wary of the project's scale, the proposed height of the buildings and plans for a commercial tower in what is now a residential neighborhood. They complained that they have not been able to get much information up until now. 
 ''We supported East River Science Park,'' said Edward Rubin, chairman of the community board's land-use committee. ''We supported the United Nations tower. We're not an anti-development board. But we do want planning input. We don't look kindly on commercial, nor on buildings taller than the U.N. Secretariat.''
 Mr. Rubin said he and other members of the community board met on Thursday with Mr. Solow's development team and city planning officials to schedule a series of meetings. 
 The Con Ed property is actually three parcels, the largest stretching from 38th Street to 41st Street, east of First Avenue. Demolition of the generating stations, where Mr. Solow has plans for three residential towers, a commercial building and the park, has already begun. At this time, the plan is to construct the tallest building on the west side of First, between 39th and 40th Streets. All told, the developer is planning five million square feet of buildings with about 4,000 apartments.
 Mr. Childs said that work is not as far along on the third parcel, which sits on the east side of First, between 35th and 36th Streets. That project could include a variety of uses, a school and housing for New York University Medical Center among them, he said.
 The real estate boom in the late 1990's largely bypassed the far East Side. But during the mid-1980's, the neighborhood experienced a building boom as developers created nearly 2,500 apartments in what had been a largely industrial area, between First Avenue and the East River.
 Bernard Spitzer, father of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, built the Corinthian, a 57-story apartment building at 38th Street and First Avenue, where the East Side Airlines Terminal once stood.
 At the site of a Coca-Cola bottling plant, Donald Zucker built Rivergate, a 34-story apartment house on First, between 34th and 35th Streets. And Jeffrey Glick replaced a series of garages and warehouses on First Avenue with Manhattan Place, a 35-story building between 36th and 37th Streets, and the Horizon, a 44-story tower between 37th and 38th Streets.
 The three projects now being proposed, Mr. Rubin said, could produce twice as many apartments as the earlier towers, along with workspace for thousands of new office workers, in a neighborhood that could use more schools and the long-delayed Second Avenue subway. While the three apartment buildings built in the 1980's were no taller than 44 stories, Mr. Solow is proposing one, and possibly two, 68-story towers.
 ''Those towers would put Tudor City in complete shadow,'' said Jack Lester, a lawyer and community activist who is running for the City Council, referring to the apartment complex at the end of East 42nd Street, ''and create a whole new neighborhood character. And it would bring an additional 14,000 people to a community hard pressed for services.''
 The United Nations, with the support of the Bloomberg administration and Congress, has also proposed building a 35-story, one million-square-foot tower in what is now known as Robert Moses Playground, a 1.3-acre asphalt park on the south side of 42nd Street, east of First Avenue. Diplomats and staff members would move into the building while the United Nations conducts a renovation of the Secretariat building. Afterward, the building would become office space for the United Nations. 
 The United Nations, which pumps $2.5 billion a year into the city's economy, agreed to build an esplanade along the river for public use. But in a setback to the Bloomberg administration and the United Nations, the State Senate has blocked the project for the time being, with legislators complaining about the unpaid parking tickets of diplomats and anti-Israel votes in the General Assembly. 
 The Bloomberg administration announced earlier this month that Alexandria Real Estate Equities would build a long-sought bioscience research center on the campus of Bellevue Hospital Center, farther south on First Avenue. Work is set to begin next year and the city hopes the project will encourage growth of the biotechnology industry in New York.
 Farther south in Manhattan, a residential tower designed by Santiago Calatrava is proposed for a South Street site near the Brooklyn Bridge. The tower's concrete core will rise 835 feet, with 12 four-story town houses cantilevered from its sides. 
 In June, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also announced a $150 million beautification effort for the East Side waterfront from East River Park, near 14th Street, south to Battery Park. The project would include bike paths, a link in the East Side promenade, a marina and a sandy beach.

HEADLINE: Parkgoers Have Seen Green, but That Market Part Is Something New

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
It may be that, aside from money, traffic, team sports, sex, real estate, the subway, the weather, politics and how lame Los Angeles can be, the average New Yorker's favorite topic of discussion is food. Here, then, is a food story -- mainly about fruits and vegetables.
 A new greenmarket opened last month at 106th Street and Central Park West. It is the first greenmarket to operate in Central Park since the markets first started coming to New York in 1976. 
Set in a plaza outside Stranger's Gate, the market -- open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturdays from July to November -- offers your basic farm-fresh produce, everything from just-picked plums to basil. There are six stalls, which include a guy selling beef and another selling cut flowers. There was supposed to be a vendor with all sorts of exotic lettuces yesterday, but he was on his honeymoon. 
 ''Last week, we got some truly excellent post-run peaches,'' said Jeff Wang, 28, a lawyer, referring to the fruit that he bought after a run. He was back this week with his wife, Amy Lief. The couple, having just come off a run in Central Park, were sweating profusely as they hauled home their purchases -- a pint of plums and a bag of peaches.
 ''The big grocery stores leave something to be desired,'' said Mr. Wang, who lives in the neighborhood. Ms. Lief, 31, agreed, saying she does not like the produce at chain stores like D'Agostino or Gristedes.
 There are certain reasons to shop at one of the city's 40 greenmarkets, supporting the local economy among them, the shoppers said. 
 ''We feel like we should get our produce here,'' said Mr. Wang, glancing over at a stall run by Red Jacket Orchards from Geneva, N.Y. 
 ''Theoretically, they're local producers, although I don't know where Geneva is.'' (It is in the Finger Lakes.)
 The Stranger's Gate market opened on July 9, the same week that seven other new markets opened across the city, from Jackson Heights in Queens to Richmond Town on Staten Island. The markets are run by the city's Council on the Environment and can be found in all five boroughs, from outside a PATH station on Church and Vesey Streets in downtown Manhattan to outside Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. Vendors pay $60 a day for a stall. 
 It took more than a decade of off-and-on conversations for local residents to convince the Parks Department and Community Board 7, which serves the neighborhood near Stranger's Gate, to allow the council to open a market in Central Park, said Jackie Wildau, vice president of the Duke Ellington Boulevard Neighborhood Association.
 There were initial concerns about the farmers' delivery trucks creating noise and blocking views, Ms. Wildau said, but a deal was struck under which the farmers agreed to drop their wares off early in the morning and park their trucks elsewhere.
 Tom Kitson said he was glad it finally worked out.
 Mr. Kitson, 37, a graduate student of Slavic literature at Columbia University, said he tries to purchase all his produce from local greenmarkets. Each week, he makes his rounds from the Stranger's Gate market to others on West 97th Street and upper Broadway.
 ''I used to live in Ohio,'' he said, ''where I got involved with food co-ops and organic farming. I like the smaller scale. I like eating seasonally.''
 Kathleen Isacson, who lives near the market, said she liked almost everything about greenmarkets except the prices -- though even they were a worthwhile tradeoff. 
 ''You don't come here to buy for the price,'' Ms. Isacson said. ''You come here to buy local.'' As a cook, she said that food, grown locally and sold fresh, makes all the difference in a meal.
 ''It's more expensive, but it's worth it,'' she said. ''There's nothing like having your produce taste like what it's supposed to.''

HEADLINE: Out of Uniform and Into Business, With Help

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AFTER an off-duty injury forced him to retire prematurely from the New York City police force, David Legaz plunged full time into the real estate business that he and his wife had already begun. But he soon realized that he was short on the savvy needed to make the brokerage operation grow.
 When Wallace Zeins retired from the force because ''it was time after 30 years,'' as he puts it, he and two other men opened a firm specializing in private investigations and law enforcement consulting. Mr. Zeins, too, found that he needed to know more about running a business. 
Mr. Legaz and Mr. Zeins, two former police sergeants, are among the first people to sign up for free business mentoring under a new campaign by two nonprofit organizations that specialize in different types of counseling. 
 One is the New York City chapter of Score, a nationwide group of volunteers that has worked with the federal Small Business Administration for more than 40 years to provide free counseling to owners and aspiring owners of small businesses. Once made up entirely of retired businesspeople, Score nowadays also has counselors who are still active in business, and it no longer uses its long-familiar name, Service Corps of Retired Executives.
 The other group is the New York Disaster Counseling Coalition, which was formed the day after the Sept. 11 attack. Its early purpose was to provide referrals for free mental health counseling to members of the uniformed services who had responded to the attack on the World Trade Center and to those who, it was clear, would be working in recovery operations there for a long time.
 The group has since expanded into education, retirement and family strengthening programs, and has opened all its programs to all members and retired members of the uniformed services, whether or not they were at ground zero, and to their families.
 Officials of the two organizations said the joint campaign they began last month involves a special effort to reach out to current and former members of the Police and Fire Departments, Emergency Medical Service and other first responders in the city to inform them of the aid Score offers and to provide it to those interested. 
 ''Over time, we realized that many of the first responders we were seeing needed career and life alternatives to their uniformed service,'' said Janet Lee Bachant, chief executive of the Disaster Counseling Coalition. Guidance about what it takes to open and run a business and the prospect of free mentoring can widen the alternatives, she said.
 Al Korn, the chairman of the New York City chapter of Score, said he had formed a special unit for members of the uniformed services that would be sensitive to their needs, including the fact that most of them ''have little or no professional experience other than their uniformed life.'' 
 He said those seeking the unit's help did not have to be referred by the coalition but could call his office at (212)264-4507.
 Mr. Legaz, 42, who left the Police Department in 2002 after 17 years, said he had learned about Score through the coalition, where he had signed up for a program to help strengthen marital communications. These suffered in his family, he said, after an officer who had been a close friend died in the collapse of the World Trade Center and he grew depressed.
 From Score, he said, he hopes to get advanced marketing ideas and advice on topics like incorporating the brokerage business he and his wife, Nancy, operate within an agency, Re/Max Universal, in Bayside, Queens.
 Mr. Zeins, 58, who retired in 2003 as night commander of Manhattan detectives and as a supervisor of the department's hostage negotiating team, heard about Score from a former police colleague rather than from the Disaster Counseling Coalition, whose services he said he had not used. He had been involved with ground zero for a year and a half.
 He is looking to Score, he said, for guidance on matters like ''how to set up a budget and whether it's best to invest in advertising or personnel.''
 He said that though he and his partners had the knowledge to establish their firm, Northshore Investigative Group, based in Jericho, N.Y., ''there's more to know'' to make it survive and thrive.
 Mr. Zeins is also seeking advice on another matter. ''After 30 years of knowing you'll have a weekly paycheck,'' he said, ''how can you reduce the stress when you don't know where the next paycheck, the next business, will come from?''

HEADLINE: The Buck Stops Quite Squarely At the Gas Pump

BYLINE: By Paul Vitello; Doug Kuntz for The New York Times

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE in the great unconscious of American drivers there must be a guilt-ridden little voice keeping them from complaining too loudly about the rising price of gas. ''What did you expect? All good things must pass, guzzler boy,'' the voice must be saying.
 What else would explain the docility in the public's reaction to the rising prices of the last 15 months? Gas broke the $2-a-gallon barrier in May of last year. It now hovers around $2.75, and like an express elevator leaping from the mezzanine to the midsection of a skyscraper, it has already topped $3 in some places, including Long Island. 
 Professional explainers blame about everything on the crust of the earth -- the superheated Chinese economy, last year's hurricane season, broken pipelines in eastern India, the war in Iraq, oil refinery problems in Texas, the death of King Fahd -- for the increases. Just about everything, in other words, except that Americans, the world's leading oil consumers, remain unrepentant fossil-fuel addicts.
 ''You still got to get around, so what are you going to do?'' said Christopher Angelico, a 24-year-old Hauppauge man in a light truck, pausing at the rest stop near Exit 51 of the Long Island Expressway on Tuesday. ''It doesn't bother me that much, to tell you the truth.''
 He had to shout to be heard above the noise of the expressway beside him -- the noise of billions of R.P.M.'s moving past, almost every vehicle carrying just one person, almost every person enfolded in the comfort of air-conditioning, music and that lovely illusion of control that comes with driving fast in pursuit of one's daily business.
 And illusion it is. Prices may come down again, and they may not. ''My guess is that the oil companies are using this opportunity to see how far they can go,'' said Mike Lynch, owner of a service station in Garden City, where the price of regular unleaded was $2.75. ''They don't know what the breaking point is for the consumer. They want to find out.''
 Is the American breaking point $4 a gallon, $5 a gallon? In France, they pay close to $6.
 ''I would say that at $5 a gallon, I'm out of business,'' said Andy Cinque of Lindenhurst, a partner in a small entertainment company. To fuel the five trucks he operates cost about $1,000 a week last summer. This summer, it's about $2,000. ''I'm absorbing that,'' he said. ''My customers don't want to hear about my transportation expenses.''
 In random interviews about gasoline prices the last week, motorists' responses ranged from indifferent to angry to fatalistic, but almost never approached defiant -- a finding, although unscientific, that seemed to reflect an obvious fact of suburban and national life: there are few alternatives to getting around by car, and the deck is pretty much stacked against the serious development of any alternatives. Supporters of road-building, automaking and petroleum-producing have controlled federal transportation spending for the last half-century and are likely to keep controlling it.
 ''What did Exxon Mobil make last year, $23 billion?'' said Mr. Lynch, the service station owner. ''That's obscene.'' (The actual figure was $25.3 billion.)
 Bob Kneer, a Massapequa landscaper, said: ''The oil companies don't have to answer to anybody in this country. They do what they like.''
 Is that true that the oil companies do what they like, perhaps even taking advantage of the geopolitical uncertainties in Iraq, a spokeswoman for the industry's lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, was asked. 
 ''That's an interesting question,'' the spokeswoman, Rayola Dougher, replied. ''It's true that the industry is making billions, but they are also spending billions'' on new exploration, new refineries and new regulations.
 Pren Nair, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, which reported a second-quarter profit this year of $7.6 billion, said that much of its widely publicized profit was related to businesses other than gasoline. ''Gasoline is just the part of our business that is very visible to the consumer,'' he said. ''We are in other businesses. Chemicals, for instance. It's natural that people assume we make huge profits on gas at the pump. But in fact, our profit margins are very thin.''
 And in fact, that hypothetical little voice in the American soul is probably right. It's all our own fault.
 Americans have let the exurbs sprawl farther and farther afield, built houses that devour bigger and bigger bites of energy, sustained a decadelong appetite for cars that look and consume gas like military assault vehicles. In short, they have demanded energy greatly. And energy suppliers have responded according to the holy laws of the market.
 What did we expect?

HEADLINE: Finding Trout in Iowa's Restored Streams 

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: DORCHESTER, Iowa 

 BODY:
Iowa brings to mind pork, a grand state fair, presidential caucuses and Meredith Willson in ''The Music Man.'' Four wild brown trout in 20 minutes were quite unexpected. 
 Despite my good luck on Waterloo Creek, fly fishing for trout is not a major element in Iowa recreation. A state Web site lists bait dealers by county, and recommends using ''chicken liver and stinkbaits'' for walleyes. 
But in the northeast corner of the state, in the driftless area that the glaciers never reached, there are some coldwater creeks where stocking and stream-bank restoration has produced lively trout ready to take dry flies.
 John van Vliet and I fished in one of the most ambitious restoration areas, the 98-acre Prairie Song Farm. Mike Osterholm, with help from federal and state agencies, Trout Unlimited and other groups, is seeking to restore the area to the prairie grass and oak savannah vegetation that greeted the first settlers in the 1830's. 
 With cultivation, and the end to the annual burns the American Indians practiced, the land changed. By last year, when restoration began, the field held cornstalks, some beans, many scrub-invasive plants and box elders. Plantings of prairie grasses, whose roots go down 10 feet, hold moisture and bind the soil. 
 Along with some work with bulldozers and biodegradable netting on stream banks, the grasses have produced colder water, less erosion and more redds -- pits for spawning trout.
 The work continues. Despite last fall's burn, there are still plenty of non-native species. While we were there, Jessica Nanke and Elizabeth Ward, college students holding summer jobs with the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, were pulling out wild garlic, a highly annoying invasive species that can cause a rash like poison ivy's.
 We fished during an early-summer heat wave, with the water very clear from an absence of rain, and the trout were spooky wherever we went on Waterloo and other streams in the region. But the action on Osterholm's section was much better than on Waterloo's upper reaches, which have muddier bottoms from steep, collapsing banks. 
 Not that there are no big fish there; I saw a five-inch vole (a creature like a mouse), swimming earnestly downstream pushing nesting materials, vanish as a huge trout gulped him underwater. After a meal like that, the big fish had no interest in my size 14 caddis. 
 The fish we caught on Osterholm's stretch (and van Vliet took several bigger browns on a hopper pattern one morning even though there were no grasshoppers in the fields yet) were wild descendants of browns stocked upstream, where we also caught some rainbows.
 I caught my four trout casting elk-hair caddis flies upstream into a riffle as naturals hatched. This stretch, a mud bank last year, now went down to bedrock. The burn, removal of the box elders with their shallow roots, and cordgrass planting made the banks firmer. Natural stream flow had cleared the silt off the rocks, which sheltered insects before they hatched.
 Osterholm has a no-trespassing sign posted at a gate to the property, but allows friends to fish as the restoration goes on. And he fished quite a bit himself, taking browns longer than 20 inches this year. But fishing, even the catch-and-release variety he and his guests practice, is not the be-all and end-all of this project.
 His piece de resistance at Prairie Song Farm will be a stream for brook trout. Around 1951, a small limestone stream was ditched to provide more farmland. Its course has been recreated with bulldozers with the help of old aerial photos by the Department of Agriculture. 
 The stream runs into Duck Creek, also on Osterholm's property, and then to Waterloo. Fed by two 50-degree springs from a limestone bluff, it holds small fish like dace and clack-nosed sculpin, but the browns seem to find it too cold and have not entered it.
 Osterholm, an epidemiologist who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, fished some of these streams as a boy, but not this one. It did not exist then.
 The Iowa Department of Natural Resources plans to stock it with the state's only surviving native brook trout, the South Pine heritage strain. Osterholm has graded the reinvented stream to match South Pine Creek (about nine miles southwest) and create a similar habitat. But if the trout thrive, he will not allow any fishing in what he has already named for its future tenants: Brook Creek. 
 ''This should be an ideal sanctuary for these brook trout,'' he said. ''We hope to use this stream to help sustain the population, and let D.N.R. use it to stock other streams. Anything that can survive what we did to decimate the prairies of the Midwest over the last 150 years deserves all we can do.''

THE really good writers do not write ''about'' their subjects so much as use them to tell a story. The topic of free trade would not seem to offer much in the way of storytelling material, but Pietra Rivoli has proved otherwise. In ''The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy'' (John Wiley & Sons, $29.95), Ms. Rivoli, an economist at Georgetown University, has mined a subject known for dry polemics and created an engaging and illuminating saga of the international textile trade. 
 Her book's subtitle is ''An Economist Examines the Markets, Power and Politics of World Trade,'' and the author acknowledges that, at the outset, she shared her profession's bias in favor of free trade and, in particular, its ''somewhat off-putting tendency to believe that if everyone understood what we understood'' then ''they wouldn't argue so much.'' But then, as she says in one of her many beguilingly titled subchapters, ''Student Protests Sent a Business Professor Around the World.'' 
The protests occurred on ''a cold day in February 1999.'' Ms. Rivoli was watching as students gathered at the gothic centerpiece of Georgetown to demonstrate against the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and other putative villains of international trade. The crowd, Ms. Rivoli noticed with characteristic acuity, had ''a moral certainty, a unity of purpose'' that permitted it to distinguish black from white and good from evil ''with perfect clarity.'' One woman seized the microphone and asked: ''Who made your T-shirt? Was it a child in Vietnam? Or a young girl from India earning 18 cents per hour? Did you know that she lives 12 to a room? That she shares her bed and has only gruel to eat?''
 Ms. Rivoli did not know these things, and she wondered how the woman at the microphone knew. But she decided to find out. In the rest of her narrative, the author tells the story of ''her'' T-shirt, which she purchased for $5.99 by the exit of a Walgreen's in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ''It was white and printed with a flamboyantly colored parrot, with the word 'Florida' scripted beneath.'' A company in Miami had engraved the front, after buying the shirt from a factory in China. The Chinese manufacturer had purchased the cotton used to make the shirt from Texas. Eventually it will end up as part of a large but little-known market for used clothing destined for resale in East African ports.
 Ms. Rivoli follows her T-shirt along its route, but this is like saying that Melville followed his whale. In Texas, she plumbs the reasons for America's pre-eminence in the cotton trade. This leads to a fascinating inquiry into the pre-Civil War South and its use of African slaves, whose cheap labor was an early example of ''the ability to suppress and avoid competition'' that she finds at every stage -- not least in today's Asian sweatshops -- of her T-shirt's journey. Even today, Texas owes much of its success to factors outside the ''free market,'' like universities and other institutions that have helped to integrate ginning, packaging and shipping, and programs to familiarize farmers with technology.
 Most of all, American farmers benefit from government subsidies, whose effect is to disenfranchise lower-cost cotton from poor nations of West Africa. When Ms. Rivoli informs us that these subsidies amount to more than the United States' entire development aid budget for the continent of Africa, we are ready to cut the Chinese a little slack, recognizing that they are hardly alone in departing from the virtuous fantasy of free and unrestricted competition. Given the absurdly arcane (and infuriating) knot of import restrictions that will confront her shirt when it attempts to reenter the United States, it isn't clear, she observes dryly, ''whether the best negotiators, or the best T-shirts, would win.'' 
 By looking across history to the shifting center of textile manufacturing from Manchester, England, to Lowell, Mass., to South Carolina to Japan and, finally, the developing nations of Asia, Ms. Rivoli discovers a universal truth. Without making light of the horrors experienced by workers, she asserts that their jobs were a little better than other available options (usually farm work) and, what's more, that textile factories led to advances in industrialization and, just as dependably, in living standards. It is not too much to say that she uses the T-shirt to tell the story of progress. 
 Similar points have been made before, but in the abstract dialect of economists. Ms. Rivoli does her best work at ground level, introducing us to a family farmer outside Lubbock, Tex.; a young woman on the assembly line in Shanghai; a reseller of shirts in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; a K Street lobbyist in Washington; not to mention figures from history. We learn of an earlier generation's exploitation from an Alabama sharecropper; of the mangled limbs suffered by factory workers in 19th-century Manchester from Friedrich Engels; and of the hazards of sweatshops from a survivor of the infamous fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company in lower Manhattan in 1911 that killed 146 employees.
 THE book sparkles with short, happy sentences like ''Unlike French wine or Florida oranges, Texas cotton doesn't brag about where it was born and raised.'' Stationed outside a shopping center in Bethesda, Md., where a Salvation Army truck is accepting donations of used clothing, the author tartly observes, ''It is a Saturday morning, and soccer moms are in a race to throw things away.''
 Ultimately, she concludes that the argument for free trade is as strong as ever, and it is a moral case as well as an economic one. She advises the activists not to disperse, but to refocus their efforts on including people, like repressed factory workers in China, in the political process ''rather than shielding them from markets.'' Her nuanced and fair-minded approach is all the more powerful for eschewing the pretense of ideological absolutism, and her telescopic look through a single industry has all the makings of an economics classic.

HEADLINE: Why Invest in a Strip Mall If You Can Own a Prison?

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
MANY real estate investment trusts specialize in one property sector or another, like office buildings, shopping centers or hotels. Some specialize in a region. And then there are those that really specialize -- as in car dealerships, movie theaters, timberland, even prisons.
 Single-purpose, or specialty, REIT's -- which buy properties within a particular business niche, often with a single tenant -- make up just a tiny portion of the industry. But they have been garnering attention lately, particularly among institutional investors, given the unevenness on Wall Street. 
''There's an increasing demand to own commercial real estate,'' said Ralph L. Block, senior portfolio manager for the Phocas Financial Corporation, an asset management company, and author of ''Investing in REIT's'' (Bloomberg Press, 2002). ''And I think that it's certain that we are going to see more specialties.'' 
 REIT's, companies with portfolios of commercial property that disburse the bulk of their profits in dividends, have been outperforming most stocks and bonds in recent years. The specialty REIT sector, in particular, yielded 5.53 percent, on average, for the 12 months that ended on June 30, and 26.85 percent for 2004, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. By contrast, the average yield on the association's composite index of all REIT's was 4.90 percent at the end of June and 30.41 percent for 2004. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.32 percent for the 12 months ended on June 30 and returned 10.8 percent last year. 
 Specialty REIT's come in many flavors. Seven of them are tracked by the trade association: 
 Capital Automotive of McLean, Va., which buys auto dealers' properties. 
 Entertainment Properties Trust, Kansas City, Mo., multiplex cinemas. 
 Rayonier, Jacksonville, Fla., and Plum Creek Timber, Seattle, timberland.
 Global Signal, Sarasota, Fla., telecommunication towers. 
 Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railroad, Charleston, W.Va., railroad properties and equipment.
 Correctional Properties Trust, Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., prisons.
 There are also REIT's that buy real estate portfolios from financial institutions, including bank branches (American Financial Realty Trust of Jenkintown, Pa.), and others that buy gasoline stations and petroleum distribution terminals (the Getty Realty Corporation of Jericho, N.Y.). 
 Alexandria Real Estate Equities of Pasadena, Calif., though generally listed in the office buildings category, specializes in leasing properties to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and scientific research companies. 
 Three REIT's that invest in college housing were recently formed: American Campus Communities of Austin, Tex.; Education Realty Trust of Memphis; and GMH Communities Trust of Newtown Square, Pa. 
 Keven Lindemann, director of real estate for the research firm SNL Financial, said he believed the prospect for REIT's that own student residences was bright. ''You have a guaranteed rental income stream,'' he said. 
 Many successful specialty REIT's have what are known as triple-net leases, in which the tenants agree to pay all the ongoing operating expenses, including the property taxes and insurance premiums. Most net leases are long term (10 to 25 years) with cost-of-living increases in the rent. Of course, they are only as good as the creditworthiness of the tenants. 
 THERE are other risks with specialty REIT's: not only are they subject to the market conditions that affect commercial real estate in general, like interest rates, but their performance may also be tied to a mix of industry-specific variables. Because of those uncertainties, ''they tend to trade at higher dividend yields than traditional properties,'' Mr. Block said.
 ''A lot depends on the industry they're involved in and the competition within the industry,'' he added, ''and whether they can find a niche that allows them some degree of pricing power or special relationships where they can capture returns on investment that were better than traditional commercial owners.'' 
 But specialty REIT niches aren't easy for the average investor to master. Most of these stocks operate in sectors with few, if any, peers that can be used as a basis for comparison. ''The typical investor should be prepared to spend more time understanding the dynamics of the particular industry in which they specialize,'' Mr. Block said. 
 Many specialty REIT's have come and gone, he said, like Golf Trust of America of Charleston, S.C., which bought upscale golf courses; its shareholders agreed four years ago to liquidate the portfolio. Another former REIT, Prison Realty Trust, built prisons on speculation, an approach that resulted in high vacancies.
 ''There's a wide range of outcomes for specialty REIT's,'' Mr. Block said. ''It's like the nursery rhyme: when they're good, they can be really good, but when they're bad, they're horrid.'' 
 The secret to success for specialty trusts, said Philip J. Martin, a senior vice president who follows REIT's at Stifel Nicolaus of St. Louis, ''is a niche business model that provides stable, predictable cash flow through economic cycles.''
 Mr. Block says he worries, too, that ''a lot of properties may not have alternate uses -- you just can't go out and find a different tenant in a different industry and lease to them.'' So if there are high vacancy rates, he added, ''they may not be able to restructure to a different use.'' 
 It is for that reason that Cohen & Steers Capital Management, which specializes in REIT mutual funds, usually sticks with specialty REIT's that ''behave much more like core properties'' that lend themselves to other uses, said David Oakes, a senior research associate at the investment firm.
 Entertainment Properties, the largest movie theater landlord in North America, is one of them. ''It's not that different from owning a shopping center,'' Mr. Oakes said.
 The company's $1.3 billion in holdings include specialty restaurants and retail stores at properties anchored by multiplex theaters. Even though box-office sales have been slipping, Entertainment Properties continues to expand as it regularly doles out dividends. Last month, it reported that net income to common shareholders for the second quarter had jumped 39 percent.
 Capital Automotive is another standout. While domestic automakers grapple with poor earnings, downgraded debt and soaring employee health care costs, Capital Automotive prospers. The company paid its 30th consecutive increased shareholder dividend this month, and it recently reported second-quarter profits more than doubled from a year ago. ''It's a very good company; the dealers are in good shape,'' said Mr. Martin of Stifel Nicolaus.
 David S. Kay, chief financial officer at Capital Automotive, says his company focuses on high-traffic locations within the biggest markets. ''We're continuously mixing the brands'' depending on regional tastes, he said. Tenants are generally unaffected by Detroit's problems, he added. ''People still need service and repair -- that's the main thrust of their profits,'' he said.
 But the company doesn't seem to be taking any chances. In the last quarter, Capital Automotive began providing mortgages, a strategy that it says could provide new sources for capital and help build better relationships with dealers.

HEADLINE: Victories for Open Government

 BODY:
The news from Yonkers city government last week was all good, at least as it relates to increasing accountability and working in plain sight for the benefit of the public.
 First came the announcement from Mayor Philip Amicone that the Ridge Hill Development Corporation, a private nonprofit entity, would seek to sell to a developer an 84-acre parcel it owns in northern Yonkers, give the money to the city -- and disband. Then came public hearings on proposed revisions to the city charter that would strengthen Yonkers's much-ridiculed ethics code. 
 Together, these developments point the city in a positive direction -- into the sunlight, as it were. Many things need to happen before ground is broken on Ridge Hill, an ambitious mini-city overlooking the New York State Thruway that would include a hotel, conference center, offices, stores and hundreds of housing units. 
 The development has many critics who are bothered by its size and potential traffic problems, but for now it is worth celebrating the removal of one of the most serious objections -- that a huge project on one of the most valuable tracts in Westchester would be under the control of a secretive agency not subject to open-government laws. 
 Mr. Amicone deserves credit, we suppose, for bowing to relentless criticism over his handling of the Ridge Hill proposal and allowing his city to control the expected windfall, not the cadre of insiders known as the Ridge Hill Development Corporation. The corporation's original plan had been to hold on to the sites and use some of the lease payments for unspecified ''economic development'' projects -- a tempting recipe for cronyism and shady dealing.
 Mr. Amicone says that a ''large part'' of the revenue from the Ridge Hill sale would go to the Yonkers school system, which is facing another of its multimillion-dollar budget chasms next year. The money is only part of the benefit -- the real victory is for openness. 
 There are similar reasons to welcome an overhaul of the Yonkers ethics code. The revisions, proposed by a panel appointed by Mr. Amicone and available at cityofyonkers.com, would enlarge the ethics board and have it do all sorts of things its predecessor did not -- like meet regularly, issue subpoenas, punish violators and prevent the revolving-door, friends-and-family hiring that has been a hallmark of Yonkers government for too long.

HEADLINE: Hospital Errors And Regulatory Failure

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Quick, What Do You Do for a Heart Attack?'' (July 31) reported on a New England Journal of Medicine study revealing that some Westchester hospitals could not be relied upon to provide the established standard of care to heart attack patients. There are hospitals close to home that do not follow protocols for heart attack victims -- beginning with a standard bite of aspirin. Some hospitals in New Rochelle, Mount Vernon, Yonkers, Bronxville and White Plains fail 30 percent of the time.
Comptroller Alan Hevesi's audit of the state Department of Health's performance found that hospitals were not reporting adverse incidents, as required, despite a 62 percent increase in such incidents between 1999 and 2001. While at least 44,000 Americans are dying because of hospital errors, the Department of Health, despite its considerable power and resources, was failing to do its share, according to the comptroller. 
 In addition to inadequate supervision of hospitals, the department has also failed to enforce existing laws leading to the recovery of millions of dollars of Medicaid fraud for the benefit of county and state taxpayers. 
 Worse still is the deteriorating performance of the Health Department's bureaucracy, which is supposed to police medical misconduct and discipline licensed physicians. When the agency finally issued a single report this year, purporting to cover three missing years of required annual reports, it revealed that the agency's performance in protecting us against dangerous doctors was on a downhill slide. 
 We face substantial evidence of death, pain and economic waste resulting from hospital mismanagement and regulatory failure by the Health Department, failures that are not being adequately addressed in a timely manner by either the governor or the legislative committees with the authority to do so.

HEADLINE: How India Reconciles Hindu Values And Biotech

BYLINE: By PANKAJ MISHRA. 
Pankaj Mishra, an Indian novelist and journalist, is the author, most recently, of ''An End to Suffering: The Buddha in the World.'' He lives in London and India.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
IN 2001, President Bush restricted federal financing for stem cell research. The decision, which was shaped at least partly by the Republican Party's evangelical Christian base, and which disappointed many American scientists and businessmen, provoked joy in India. The weekly newsmagazine India Today, read mostly by the country's ambitious middle class, spoke of a ''new pot of gold'' for Indian science and businesses. ''If Indians are smart,'' the magazine said, American qualms about stem cell research ''can open an opportunity to march ahead.'' 
 Just four years later, this seems to have occurred. According to Ernst & Young's Global Biotechnology Report in 2004, Indian biotechnology companies are expected to grow tenfold in the next five years, creating more than a million jobs. With more than 10,000 highly trained and cheaply available scientists, the country is one of the leading biotechnology powers along with Korea, Singapore, China, Japan, Sweden, Britain and Israel. 
A top Indian corporation, the Reliance Group, owns Reliance Life Sciences, which is trying to devise new treatments for diabetes and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and create human skin, blood and replacement organs genetically matched to their intended recipients. Some scientists have even more ambitious ideas. Encouraged by the cloning of a sheep by British scientists in 1996, they plan to do the same with endangered species of Indian lions and cheetahs. 
 American scientists and businessmen note enviously that religious and moral considerations do not seem to inhibit Indian biotechnologists. But this indifference to ethical issues would have certainly appalled Gandhi, father of the Indian nation. Gandhi accused Western medicine, along with much of modern science and technology, of inflicting violence upon human nature. His vegetarianism and belief in nonviolence were derived from Indian traditions, mainly Hinduism, which is also the faith, though loosely defined, of most Indian scientists and businessmen. 
 Indeed, most evangelical Christians, who believe that the embryo is a person, may find more support in ancient Hindu texts than in the Bible. Many Hindus see the soul -- the true Self (or atman) -- as the spiritual and imperishable component of human personality. After death destroys the body, the soul soon finds a new temporal home. Thus, for Hindus as much as for Catholics, life begins at conception. 
 The ancient system of Indian medicine known as Ayurveda assumes that fetuses are alive and conscious when it prescribes a particular mental and spiritual regimen to pregnant women. This same assumption is implicit in ''The Mahabharata,'' the Hindu epic about a fratricidal war apparently fought in the first millennium B.C. In one of its famous stories, the warrior Arjuna describes to his pregnant wife a seven-stage military strategy. His yet-to-born son Abhimanyu is listening, too. But as Arjuna describes the seventh and last stage, his wife falls asleep, presumably out of boredom. Years later, while fighting his father's cousins, the hundred Kaurava brothers, Abhimanyu uses well the military training he has learned in his mother's womb, until the seventh stage, where he falters and is killed. 
 But the religions and traditions we know as Hinduism are less monolithic and more diverse than Islam and Christianity; they can yield contradictory arguments. Early in ''The Mahabharata,'' there is a story about how the hundred Kaurava brothers came into being. Their mother had produced a mass of flesh after two years of pregnancy. But then a sage divided the flesh into 100 parts, which were treated with herbs and ghee, and kept in pots for two years -- from which the Kaurava brothers emerged. 
 Indian proponents of stem-cell research often offer this story as an early instance of human cloning through stem cells extracted from human embryos. They do not mention that ''The Mahabharata'' presents the birth of the hundred Kaurava brothers as an ominous event. 
 Other Asian scientists have also pressed myth and tradition into the service of modern science and nationalism. In South Korea, where a third of the population is Buddhist, a scientist who cloned human embryonic stem cell lines claimed that he was ''recycling'' life just as reincarnation does. 
 But spiritual tradition cannot solve all the ethical issues raised by science's progress through the third world. Ultrasound scans help many women in India to abort female fetuses; a girl child is still considered a burden among Indians. The trade in human organs, especially kidneys, remains a big business, despite growing scrutiny by the police. It is not hard to imagine that, as stem cell research grows in India, and remains unregulated, a small industry devoted to the creation of human embryos would soon develop. 
 IN any case, biotechnology may offer only pseudo-answers to many of India's urgent problems. For one thing, if and when lions and cheetahs emerge from biotechnology labs, the steadily deforested Indian countryside may not have a place for them. Stem cell research is also expensive, and seems glaringly so in a country which does not provide basic health care for most of its people. The advanced treatments promised by biotechnology are likely to benefit the rich, at least for the first few years. 
 In the meantime, the poor may be asked to offer themselves as guinea pigs. In an article on biotechnology last year, India Today asserted: ''India has another gold mine -- the world's largest population of 'naive' sick patients, on whom no medicine has ever been tried. India's distinct communities and large families are ideal subjects for genetic and clinical research.'' 
 Scientism has few detractors in India; and the elites find it easy to propose technological rather than political and moral solutions to the problems of poverty, inequality and environmental damage. Obsessed with imitating Western consumer lifestyles, most middle-class Indians are unlikely to have much time for Gandhi's belief that ''civilization consists not in the multiplication of wants but in the deliberate and voluntary reduction of wants.'' They subscribe to a worldly form of Hinduism -- one that now proves to be infinitely adjustable to the modern era, endorsing nuclear bombs and biotechnology as well as India's claim to be taken seriously as an emerging economic and scientific superpower.

HEADLINE: North Korea Pledges to Open More of Its Historic Sites to Tourism 

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG HUN

 BODY:
North Korea has agreed to open more of its corners to foreign tourists, as its cash-strapped government is realizing that tourism is one of the quickest ways to earn money. 
 In July, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il told Hyun Jeong Eun, chairwoman of Hyundai Asan, the South Korean company that already runs tours to the North, that Hyundai would also be allowed to go to Mount Paektu. Straddling the central border between China and North Korea, the mountain is regarded by Koreans as the birthplace of their nation, and South Koreans go there through China. 
''About 100,000 South Koreans visit Mount Paektu annually, traveling up the Chinese side of the mountain,'' said Kim Jong Min, president of the South Korean National Tourism Organization. ''The trip to the mountain from the North Korean side will bring the money spent in China back to Korea.'' 
 Hyundai said it would run a pilot tour to Mount Paektu, which has a lake on its peak created by a volcanic eruption, as early as late August. South Korean tourism officials are renovating an airfield near the mountain. 
 Also this month, Hyundai plans to begin day trips to Kaesong, a town at the southwestern tip of North Korea. A couple of hours' drive from Seoul, Kaesong is the capital of an ancient Korean kingdom and home to palaces and other historic sites. 
 Since 1998, over a million South Koreans have visited the scenic Mount Kumgang, or Diamond Mountain, (above) on the North's southeastern tip in a joint tourism project that has brought in hundreds of millions of dollars. The Kumgang trip is open to tourists from Europe and the United States, though they have accounted for less than 1 percent of the tourists visiting the mountain. 
 A limited number of foreigners also visit Pyongyang, the North's capital, on highly regimented trips arranged by the country's state-run tourism agency, which has an office in Beijing. 
 The tourism projects are the most visible result of South Korea's policy of engaging North Korea. The South hopes economic and other exchanges will help dissipate political mistrust and help rebuild the economy in the North, where up to two million people have died of hunger since the mid-1990's. 
 For North Korea, these ventures at the corners of its territory allow it to conduct capitalist experiments while limiting its tightly guarded population's exposure to outside influence. Detractors in South Korea, including its conservative political opposition, have criticized the tourism projects as a coddling of the Communist regime.
 Hyundai says it has yet to turn a profit for its $1 billion investment in a resort complex at Mount Kumgang. CHOE SANG HUN

HEADLINE: DEBTORS IN RUSH TO BANKRUPTCY AS CHANGE NEARS

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN; Maureen Balleza contributed reporting for this article from Houston.

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho 

 BODY:
Rushing to beat an October deadline when the biggest overhaul of the bankruptcy law in a quarter century goes into effect, rising numbers of Americans have filed for protection in the four months since the law was changed, seeking to have their debts erased.
 Since President Bush signed the new law in April, bankruptcy filings have jumped, particularly in the heartland. Filings in the four months through July are up 17 percent this year over last in Cleveland, 14 percent in Milwaukee and 22 percent in northern Iowa, according to court filings, matching similar patterns in the Midwest and parts of the South and rural West.
Nationwide, bankruptcy filings for April, May and June were up by 12 percent over the same period last year, according to LexisNexis, the data collection service, which tracks filings ahead of the quarterly reporting done by the federal courts. The rise is coming after bankruptcy had leveled off and even started a slight decline last year. 
 Under the revised law, debtors who earn more than the median income in their state and who can repay at least $6,000 of their debt over five years will no longer be able to have their debts wiped out for a fresh start under the more generous provisions of Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. Instead, they will have to seek protection under Chapter 13, which requires a repayment schedule. In addition, under the new provisions, they will have to enroll in a court-supervised financial counseling program.
 The rise, which lawyers and bankruptcy experts say is driven in large part by people who say they fear that it will become much more difficult to escape debt and seek a clean slate under the new law, appears to have caught some bankers and lawyers by surprise. 
 When the new bankruptcy bill was passed by Congress last spring, bankers predicted it would turn many people away from the protection of the courts by making it harder to extinguish debt. That may still turn out to be the case. But thus far, it has been a rush to the courts in many places. 
 Here in Idaho, the soundless wave of Americans going broke washes up at the clerk's office in bankruptcy court, with nearly 20 fresh declarations of desperation every working day. 
 There is the Moore family of Boise, Kevin and Linda, listing a $10 cat and a $5 toaster among their meager assets against a medical bill of more than $18,000. There is Delores Hawks, going into debt to learn a skill, and never getting out because of endless credit card interest on the self-loan that once looked so manageable. 
 ''Someday, I think we'll eventually get ahead,'' said Linda Moore, a 41-year-old part-time school bus driver who said she did not know of her husband's medical bills when she married him. ''I don't know when that day will be.''
 Bankruptcy filings rose eightfold over the last 30 years, from 200,000 in 1978 to 1.6 million last year. Although filings vary from month to month, the pace for this year, if it holds up, projects to about 1.8 million bankruptcies. The overwhelming majority of them are personal, not business. 
 Economists say bankruptcy has become more likely as household debt has continued to rise while the savings rate has fallen precipitously. The Federal Reserve reported that household debt hit a record high last year, relative to disposable income. 
 ''Bankruptcies historically have risen with debt, and a lot more people are now living near the edge,'' said Henry J. Sommer, president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys. ''What we're seeing now is a rush to get in before October. After that, a certain amount of people will be priced out of bankruptcy.''
 Courts in Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin, among other places, report that people are hurrying into bankruptcy in numbers rarely seen.
 ''I'm probably about four times more busy than normal,'' said Merv Waage, a bankruptcy lawyer in Denton, Tex. ''People are saying, 'Honey, we can't pay our bill. We have no choice. We can't live under the stringent new rules. Let's file now before it's too late.'''
 Idaho, a state with an otherwise prosperous sheen to its economy, is among the per capita leaders in a category that no state will brag about. Filings were up 11 percent for July over the same period last year -- on a record pace for the year. 
 Gordon Barry, a bankruptcy lawyer in Toledo, Ohio, where filings are up 21 percent this year, said: ''We've been busier than ever. People are running in, trying to beat the deadline.''
 The new requirements are an incentive to seek protection now, perhaps the last chance for a relatively hassle-free bankruptcy, some of the newly bankrupt say. 
 Certainly that was case of Ms. Hawks, who is 56, and lives in Ontario, Ore., just over the Idaho state line. After years of odd jobs, she took out loans on credit cards to go to business school and learn office skills. Once out of school, she found she had a rare nerve disease that she said kept her from holding a job. The debts piled up, even after she got rid of her credit cards. 
 She paid just enough to satisfy the credit card minimum payment, she said, but never advanced out of the loop of perennial debt on the interest.
 ''I was paying interest on the interest,'' Ms. Hawks said, ''it was $5,000, and I never got ahead of it. Month after month after month. Finally, I just got tired of it. I said, 'I've had enough.'''
 She had heard enough about the changes in the bankruptcy law to feel that it was important to file this summer rather than wait until all provisions of the new law took effect in October, she said. ''I had to do something,'' said Ms. Hawks, who now lives on $656 a month in Social Security disability. ''I decided to do it now rather than later.''
 Families with children are three times more likely to file as those without, according to studies done by Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School and others, and more than 80 percent of them cite job loss, medical problems or family breakup as the reason.
 Ms. Moore, an Air Force veteran of the Persian Gulf war who married a carpenter and inherited his outstanding medical bills, said those old debts forced the couple into bankruptcy. Both Ms. Moore and her husband had been divorced before. 
 But she admits that they brought on some of the problem themselves. 
 ''My husband, he's the kind of guy who when he gets a bill that he can't pay, he just puts it aside,'' Ms. Moore said. 
 The monthly math of the Moore family budget leaves little room for unplanned events. Mr. Moore makes about $1,200 a month as a carpenter. Ms. Moore, a mother of three children, drives a school bus part time, and makes $11 an hour. She also receives $300 a month in alimony. Their rent is $700 a month. Their food costs are $400 a month. Their cars, insurance and upkeep are $200 more. 
 Most months, they barely break even, she said. But what pushed them into bankruptcy were bills from the past, which kept growing with interest -- a mountain that finally turned into an avalanche. They detailed the bills in their court filings. 
 The biggest was an $18,000 medical bill, for Mr. Moore, from a severe knee injury. He also owed $2,469 to a hospital where he went for care during a bout of depression. There was a $205 bill to DirecTV, and a $600 bill to Money Tree and a $615 debt to Capitol One -- both lending services. And he owed child support, for $542. 
 Ms. Moore said she did not know about most of her new husband's debts until she started getting her wages garnished from her bus-driving job. She has health insurance from her Air Force days, but it has not been enough to keep them out of bankruptcy. 
 ''My husband's old medical bills -- that's what killed us,'' she said. Bankruptcy was a chance to start clean, she said. Bankers say the surge in filings is driven in part by misinformation about how the new law will work. They say it will force only the small percentage of people who abuse the system into regular payment schedules, while keeping an open door of debt forgiveness to the vast majority of bankruptcy filers, who are individuals rather than businesses.
 ''I would hope that consumers are not getting the rush-rush because they're afraid they won't have the same protection in a few months,'' said Wayne Abernathy, an executive at the American Bankers Association, which lobbied heavily for the new law. 
 Consumer groups say the law will only make matters worse for the large number of families who are not abusing the system. They say families will be stuck in ''debtor's prison without walls,'' as the Consumer Federation of America, which fought the new bill, calls it.
 Many economists and legal experts say that once all provisions of the law take effect in October, bankruptcies should fall again. And some experts say people will be caught in an endless cycle of debt repayment.
 Ms. Hawks, who said that she declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month to get out of the endless interest payments on credit cards she had long given up, is puzzled by the financial industry's continued interest in her.
 ''Couple of times a week, I get a phone call or something in the mail trying to get me to accept a new credit card,'' she said. ''I don't get it -- because I'm broke.''

HEADLINE: As Oil Prices Soar, Is It Time to Bail Out?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
IF energy producers are not raking in enough cash from record-setting crude oil prices, they can always look forward to the tax breaks packed into a bill that President Bush signed into law earlier this month to promote new production. Such an embarrassment of riches has been luring investors into the sector, but some professionals are counseling caution and warning that it may be time to take profits while energy markets are still bubbling.
 The oil and gas index of the American Stock Exchange has more than doubled since early 2003, easily beating the broad stock market. The run-up conceals concerns among some investment advisers that energy prices will start to retreat -- if not sooner, then later -- leaving shares of oil and gas producers vulnerable to a pullback. 
But such doubts only serve to embolden those keeping faith with the sector. They point out that Wall Street has continued to underestimate the staying power of the rally in crude, repeatedly creating pleasant surprises that keep share prices buoyant.
 ''They didn't believe that $40- or $50-a-barrel oil was sustainable,'' David Spika, a strategist at Westwood Management in Dallas, said of the investing public, ''and now they don't believe that $60 oil is sustainable.''
 He is not certain it is, either, although he contends that ''as long as demand grows at a pace that outstrips supply, we're going to see prices stay above $50.''
 Doug Sheres, a portfolio manager at Rice Hall James & Associates in San Diego, is one of the skeptics, but he is a skeptic with a fat wallet. He said his firm was overweight in its energy investments, ''but we're not buyers'' right now. ''The stocks that we have owned, we have owned for a long time. Now we're looking to take some money out.''
 Valuations have reached a point where ''it's becoming more difficult to make the case for owning any of them,'' Mr. Sheres said. ''The way the stocks are valued now, you really need the oil price to go up to justify owning them.''
 His firm's dwindling portfolio of energy stocks is concentrated in companies that drill for oil or provide equipment for the task, including Patterson-UTI Energy, National Oilwell Varco and Tidewater.
 H. Giles Knight, senior portfolio manager at Gartmore Global Investments, has been an owner of drilling stocks, but he, like Mr. Sheres, said he was not going to hang around much longer. He said his firm had a large position on drillers, but would start trimming those holdings.
 ''With the energy spike, these stocks have been on a tear,'' Mr. Knight said. ''They will trade up as long as oil goes up, but oil is in nosebleed territory.''
 One reason he has held on until now, and has no plans to close out his positions entirely, he said, was that drillers and makers of drilling equipment would keep producing strong earnings as long as crude stayed above $40 a barrel. At present prices, that leaves plenty of room to maneuver.
 Congress helped this segment of the industry when it passed the energy bill on July 29, Mr. Knight added. President Bush signed it on Aug. 8. It contains an estimated $14.5 billion in tax breaks to encourage oil production. The incentives, he said, ''favor oil drilling, so you have got to be positive, all things being equal.''
 His picks include Transocean, which focuses on offshore drilling; BJ Services, whose specialties are producing from land-based wells and making drilling tools, and Halliburton, an industry giant that also engages in construction and engineering.
 One of the few oil companies outside of the drillers that Mr. Knight likes is Occidental Petroleum, which is involved in production of oil, natural gas and chemicals. It also may become a takeover candidate. ''If anybody is interested in acquiring another oil company, it could be a good choice,'' he said.
 Mr. Spika, being especially bullish on energy, is content to maintain his heavy investment because ''stock prices are not reflecting the true fundamentals'' of the business, he said. Companies ''regularly exceed earnings estimates,'' he said, and that is one reason ''why we are still very bullish.''
 He questions whether energy ''is still a cyclical business,'' rising and falling with economic growth -- and sometimes precipitating or exacerbating those ups and downs. Demand is likely to continue growing, he said, thanks to the voracity of two manufacturing powerhouses, China and India. 
 Supply is another story, Mr. Spika said. In past periods of high energy prices, ''companies would have used cash flow to ramp up production,'' he said. ''Now they are being very disciplined with capital,'' returning profits to shareholders through stock buybacks and higher dividends and not engaging in as much exploration and production.
 Westwood's energy holdings are extensive and diverse, befitting Mr. Spika's sanguine view. As at so many other firms, they include drilling stocks. Two that Mr. Spika prefers are Baker-Hughes and the much smaller FMC Technologies.
 No matter their specialty, Mr. Spika said he looked for ''well-managed companies with good cash flow and increasing levels of production.'' Two of his favorites are Apache and Burlington Resources. ''They are more leveraged to crude and natural-gas prices than the integrateds, which have their hands in a lot more businesses,'' he said.
 Several of those integrateds, the major energy conglomerates, appeal to him, too, however. He mentioned Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and two of the minor majors, Occidental and Murphy Oil. Those five, he said, ''have done a good job increasing production over the last few years.''
 Another attraction is the contribution that refining makes in the mix of these companies' activities. Refining is a lucrative undertaking these days, Mr. Spika said. The ''cracking'' spread -- the difference between the prices of crude oil and the finished products made from it -- is especially high now.
 There is agreement among investors that the energy bill may help the drillers, but it is not expected to alter the outlook for most shares materially. The incentives in the bill are thought to be insufficient to tip the balance of supply and demand in the massive energy industry, at least not significantly. The process of finding new fuel sources, then producing reliable, ample and lasting supplies from them, is time-consuming and painstaking; any major increase in production stimulated by the bill is years away.
 MR. SHERES lamented what he viewed as a dearth of encouragement in the bill for power from alternative sources like wind and solar, saying that ''the world is driven by short-term politics and quick fixes.'' Instead, he said, the bill contained ''more incentives for oil production.''
 Mr. Spika conceded that those incentives could eventually put a crimp in the high life that the energy industry has been leading if it results in extensive new production -- but only a small crimp.
 ''There will be things society will do'' to try to bring energy costs under control, he said, ''but we don't see any big factors over the next three to five years to alter our thesis. The stocks are still attractively valued, and we still see significant opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Young Students Become the New Cause for Big Donors

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
In the world of education philanthropy, colleges and universities have traditionally received about twice as much grant money as elementary and secondary schools. 
 But in the last few years there has been a quiet revolution in education giving, as a new generation of wealthy entrepreneurs, concerned about high dropout rates and low achievement levels, has begun pouring so much money into projects for kindergarten through 12th grade that such grants now outpace foundation giving to higher education.
 According to the Foundation Center, which tracks and analyzes foundation giving, large foundations gave $1.23 billion in grants to elementary and secondary schools in 2003, the latest year for which data is available. That same year, higher education grants totaled $1.12 billion. It was a sharp turnaround from five years earlier, when K-12 grants were about $620 million, compared with $1.07 billion for higher education. 
 But it is not only the size of the grants that has changed. The nature of the philanthropy has undergone a profound shift.
 ''A lot of the old philanthropy was devoted to helping schools do what they were already doing,'' said Richard Lee Colvin, director of the Hechinger Institute at Teachers College at Columbia University. ''The new group is saying, 'Let's try something different.' It's a lot of young, active entrepreneurial people -- Bill Gates, Eli Broad, the Waltons, Dell, Milken -- who want to change the schools, who want to use their money to support specific school reforms.''
 Many of these entrepreneurs turned philanthropists talk passionately about a fundamental injustice in public education, with poor minority children getting nowhere near the educational opportunities of wealthy white ones. 
 And they are not shy about using the philanthropic podium to preach the gospel of school overhaul, as Mr. Gates did earlier this year when he appeared at a National Governors Association meeting in Washington and delivered a blistering critique of how obsolete high schools are ruining the lives of millions of Americans every year.
 ''A number of us have come to believe that the biggest problem America has is the state of our schools,'' said Mr. Broad, the entrepreneur from Los Angeles who founded KB Home, a maker of prefabricated housing, and SunAmerica, an insurance company. He started the Broad Education Foundation in 1999, and has made it the centerpiece of his $1.2 billion network of foundations. 
 ''The world has changed dramatically, with globalization and free trade, moving from an industrial economy to an information economy,'' Mr. Broad said. ''But while that's been happening, K-12 education hasn't changed at all. Meanwhile, China's graduating five times as many engineers as we are, and you look at India and you get alarmed.''
 Many foundations, espousing different approaches, are putting huge sums of money into K-12 education, but not always in existing public schools. 
 The Walton Family Foundation, created by Wal-Mart's founder, Sam Walton, and his wife, increased its annual K-12 giving almost tenfold from 1998 to 2003, to $45 million, mostly to support charter schools and tuition vouchers for low-income students. 
 Many foundations focus on attracting and training good teachers, principals and administrators. The Milken Family Foundation has spent more than $100 million on programs to attract and reward new teachers. The Wallace Foundation committed $150 million over five years to improve school leadership. The Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, founded in 1999 with assets of more than $1 billion, has given large sums to Teach for America, which places recent college graduates as teachers in urban and rural schools, and New Leaders for New Schools, which helps train people to become urban school principals.
 But the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is by far the largest player in the field, investing $1.2 billion in K-12 education over the last five years, including $100 million to New York City to help create small high schools, $100 million for a network of early-college high schools in dozens of states, and $36 million to support the conversion of 20 large Ohio urban high schools into 75 autonomous small schools.
 Some urban school superintendents say that support from the Gates Foundation has allowed them to move ahead with plans for change far more quickly than they could have without it.
 ''When I first got the job, Gates put in $20 million to help us break up some large high schools,'' said Arne Duncan, who became head of the Chicago Public Schools four years ago, adding that the money had been important in creating momentum for the changes he sought. ''It's allowed me to take some risks I wouldn't otherwise have been able to. 
 ''We have a real partnership with them, and I expect that it will be long term. At the same time, we say no to people who want to fund things that aren't part of our core strategy.'' 
 The San Diego schools also got a burst of foundation money after a new superintendent, Alan Bersin, announced an aggressive overhaul. When he took over the 140,000-student district in 1998, it was receiving less than $2 million a year in foundation grants. 
 Since 2000, however, the San Diego schools have gotten more than $53 million in grants, including $17 million from Gates, $13.5 million from Hewlett, $6.5 million from Broad and $6.4 million from the Carnegie Corporation. 
 Mr. Bersin left San Diego this year to become secretary of education for the State of California.
 Over all, it is too soon to say how much impact the outpouring of new giving will have in the sprawling, locally run $400 billion enterprise of educating the nation's children.
 ''Even with the Gates money, it's still a drop in the bucket,'' said William Porter, the executive director of Grantmakers for Education, an organization of 180 foundations that makes gifts to educational programs.
 The last big K-12 push, the five-year, $500 million Annenberg Challenge, announced with a flourish at the Clinton White House in 1993, stands largely as a cautionary tale of money spread widely and with little focus. Some of the projects it supported were successful, but it had little overall impact.
 ''Annenberg didn't do much to change the bloodstream of public policy,'' said Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ''It did make ripples, but they were so spread out that there was only a small impact on education in this country.''
 The lesson has not been lost on the new philanthropists.
 Indeed, most of today's education donors are far more focused in their efforts, whether it be the Walton Foundation's backing of parental choice through charter schools and scholarships to private schools, or the Broad Foundation's emphasis on school management, or the Gates Foundation's push for high school change.
 ''I think about Annenberg every week,'' said Tom Vander Ark, executive director of the Gates Foundation's education program. 
 But even with a sharp focus, Mr. Vander Ark has found, getting results is not so easy. ''The biggest lesson learned to date?'' he said. ''It is even harder than we thought to create widespread improvement. My dad is a brain surgeon; this is more complicated.''
 While Gates-backed projects may achieve obvious success in improving vaccines, or in conquering malaria, Mr. Vander Ark acknowledged, there is no silver bullet that will assure all American children a good education.
 Small high schools alone, he said, will not begin to solve the problem of getting all students to graduation and ready for college. Even in the foundation's work with small schools, it has been more successful with the new high schools that it started than in improving the existing schools it has converted.
 Recently, bumping up against the limits of working with individual school districts, the Gates Foundation broadened the scope of its grants, adding a pool of money so states can apply for assistance.
 Few of the new education donors sit back and simply review grant applications; most go out and seek partnerships in which they can play an active role.
 ''If you create a foundation and wait for people to come with grant applications, that's easy,'' said Mr. Broad, whose foundation has given more than $135 million to school districts for management and training projects. ''But unless you come up with a business plan and monitor it, and see results, it's very easy to throw away millions of dollars.''
 Ultimately, philanthropists are accountable only to themselves. And despite the huge amounts of money involved, there is little discussion of what role private money should play in shaping basic matters of public policy.
 ''What many people, especially on the left, are concerned about is whether these folks are buying a piece of public policy,'' said Mr. Hess, who was the moderator at a conference last spring on K-12 philanthropy. ''It's a reasonable question, since the political economy of this is that their work is usually evaluated only by people they hire, and the findings, which tend to be positive or mixed, are disseminated in glossies that play up the positive aspects.
 ''Philanthropists are used to being applauded for their work, not criticized as people with extraordinary resources taking it on themselves to shape public policy,'' he continued. ''At the conference it was just astonishing to see all these national figures, one after another, kowtow to the philanthropists.''
 So how should philanthropy shape K-12 education?
 ''The role of philanthropy should be to try new ideas,'' said Mr. Colvin, of the Hechinger Institute. ''School boards are not very good at innovation. They don't have a lot of extra money to try new things.''

HEADLINE: An Investor Gingerly Returns To Treasuries

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THOMAS H. ATTEBERRY, a manager of the New Income Fund at First Pacific Advisors in Los Angeles, is inching back into the Treasury market. That's news from a portfolio manager who had as much as 40 percent of his fund in money market funds as recently as February.
 For Mr. Atteberry, the move means that he thinks the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its cycle of raising interest rates, which has seen the central bank's benchmark short-term interest rate rise 1.5 percentage points to 3.5 percent in the last 14 months. 
But inching is the operative phrase. He is buying only two-year Treasury notes, which as of Friday had a yield of 4.01 percent. His reasoning is that even if the Fed increases its benchmark short-term interest rate enough to push the two-year yield up a percentage point to 5 percent in the next year, he would still have an annual total return from his two-year notes of 3.1 percent.
 That, says Mr. Atteberry, could be just around the rate of inflation and, therefore, finally enough to compensate him for the risk of tiptoeing back into Treasuries.

FAREWELL -- Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, makes his farewell appearance Friday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. His speech topic: Reflections on Central Banking.

DATA CHECK -- Orders for durable goods, including washing machines and cars, are forecast to have fallen 1 percent in July, according to Bloomberg News.
 The durables report, due Wednesday, is expected to show that automobile, airplane and other transportation orders deepened the overall decline for the month. Without orders from the transportation sector, forecasters expect the durables data to show a 0.7 percent decline.
 The role of transportation has been up and down all year, acting as a drag in January, March and June and as a big lift in April and May.
 Two data thermometers for the housing market are expected to show a slight dip in temperature in July.
 Existing home sales, due Tuesday, are expected to have slipped 1.1 percent to an annual rate of 7.25 million. New-home sales, due Wednesday, are forecast to have dropped 3.6 percent to an annual rate of 1.325 million.
 But those declines don't mean that much because these housing sectors are already at a fever pitch. In June, existing home sales were at their highest level since the National Association of Realtors began counting in 1968, and new-home sales in June were at their highest level in Census Bureau data that goes back to 1963.
 The University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence for August is expected to be at 92.7, down from 96.5 in July, in part because of rising gasoline prices.

HEADLINE: Foolishness on Fuel

 BODY:
There are few better illustrations of the disconnect between what lawmakers in Washington know and what they do than an incident that occurred during committee debate on the energy bill in May:
 Senator Dianne Feinstein offered an amendment to strengthen fuel economy standards for S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickups. When James Talent, a Missouri Republican, opposed the amendment with an argument about potential lost jobs, he drew a sharp response from Pete Domenici, the committee chairman. What's really costing jobs, Mr. Domenici said, is Detroit's failure to make the fuel-efficient cars that can compete on world markets. 
 Mr. Domenici then voted against Ms. Feinstein's amendment. So did most of his colleagues. 
 This contradiction between the ability of smart people like Mr. Domenici to recognize an obvious problem and their failure to embrace an obvious solution is traceable to the political influence of the automakers and their unions, to ideological hostility to regulation, and to inertia. Congress has voted so often against improved fuel economy standards that it seems incapable of doing anything else. 
 That does not make it any less culpable. Soaring gasoline prices, the treacherous situation in the Middle East and the evidence of global warming all tell us that we need to act quickly to cut down on imported oil. While over time the country is going to need a range of approaches to deal with its growing dependency, there is no better short-term answer than a more efficient transportation fleet. 
 Cars and light trucks -- S.U.V.'s, vans and pickups -- account for roughly 40 percent of all United States oil consumption, which now amounts to about 20 million barrels a day. The same vehicles also account for more than one-fifth of the country's emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. Yet two recent and authoritative reports show that industry and policy makers are headed in exactly the wrong direction.
 One is from President Bush's own Environmental Protection Agency. Its main findings -- that America's cars and trucks are significantly less efficient, on average, than they were in the late 1980's, and that leaps in technology have been used to make vehicles more powerful but not more fuel efficient -- might have briefly discomfited legislators about to vote for an energy bill that would do nothing to improve matters. That might explain why the report was delayed until after the bill was in hand.
 The second report, from Environmental Defense, an advocacy group, makes the same points in much greater detail. It notes that even the Japanese -- basking in the public relations glow provided by the Prius, Toyota's gas-electric hybrid -- are doing poorly on a fleetwide basis. The culprit in all cases was the increasing market share of minivans and S.U.V.'s, which are held to more lenient fuel economy standards than other passenger vehicles.
 Where do we go now? The efficiency standards enacted 30 years ago after the Arab oil embargo made a huge difference in consumption (and, some believe, saved Detroit in the bargain). But history clearly means little to this Congress or this administration. Proposals expected later this month, calling for modest improvements in fuel efficiency for S.U.V.'s and other light trucks, are unlikely to make any serious dent in consumption. 
 Some environmentalists are beginning to think that the best hope for more efficient cars may lie with mandatory caps on global warming gases, like those contained in a bill sponsored by Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman. Once caps are in place, the reasoning goes, every sector of the American economy, including transportation, will be required to do its part to meet the overall goal. 
 That is essentially the thinking behind rules adopted last year by the California Air Resources Board. The rules will require a 30 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions from cars and light trucks by 2016, a target that will most likely be met by big increases in fuel efficiency.
 The Bush administration hates the California plan, and industry has challenged it in court. But George Pataki of New York and other Eastern governors have pledged to emulate it -- which means the states may end up carrying a ball that Congress dropped. That would not be a bad thing at all.

HEADLINE: Productivity Is Up. Or Down. Pick Your Statistic.

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
EVERY day, economy watchers are bombarded with seemingly contradictory indicators. Inflation is either contained, or it's about to explode. The price of oil is poised to drop, or to spiral higher. Lately, we've received seemingly contradictory figures on a crucial statistic: productivity. 
 When the growth rate of productivity -- the amount of output an hour the economy can produce -- falls sharply, it's frequently a sign that dreaded inflation could be on the rise. When productivity growth rises smartly, it may indicate that companies are figuring out how to make more goods and services while keeping costs under control. 
That's why Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, closely watches the productivity figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over his 18-year tenure, Mr. Greenspan has managed to puzzle most observers with Fedspeak -- a monotone patois that conveys small amounts of information in convoluted, carefully hedged sentences. But when he appeared before Congress in July, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that he was a little puzzled by the recent productivity figures. ''The traditional measure of the growth in output per hour,'' he said, ''has slowed sharply in recent quarters.'' (Translation: productivity growth is way down, look out for inflation.) ''But,'' he continued, ''a conceptually equivalent measure that uses output measured from the income side has slowed far less.'' (Translation: maybe not.) 
 The ''traditional measure'' to which Mr. Greenspan referred is nonfarm business productivity. This broad measure of the economy calculates productivity based on examining the output and production of the vast American corporate sector. And as Mr. Greenspan noted, that figure had fallen sharply in recent quarters. The year-over-year growth rate of nonfarm business productivity fell from an impressive 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2004 to a less impressive 2.3 percent in the second quarter of 2005. 
 The ''conceptually equivalent measure'' to which Mr. Greenspan referred is an alternate figure published by the bureau: the productivity of nonfinancial corporate businesses. This less broad measure excludes the gigantic financial sector and gauges productivity by examining the incomes of corporations, not their output. And revised figures released after Mr. Greenspan's July 20 testimony show the year-over-year growth rate of nonfinancial corporate productivity has risen sharply, to 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2005 (second quarter statistics for this measure are not yet available) from 3.2 percent in the second quarter of 2004.
 In theory, the two measures of productivity should match up, even though they employ somewhat different methodology and data. And over the long term, they do. ''Between 1965 and 2004, both figures grew at about 2 percent per year on average,'' said Phyllis Otto, supervisory economist at the bureau. But recently, they've gone their separate ways. And that makes the job of detecting the underlying trend in productivity more difficult.
 In principle, economists say, the figure that represents the broadest possible swath of the economy is preferable. That would seem to weigh in favor of the more pessimistic nonfarm business number. But there may be good reasons for giving careful weight to the measure of productivity that excludes the financial world. In some ways, it may be more accurate.
 After all, it's much easier to calculate productivity for companies that produce widgets than it is for companies that produce less tangible goods like insurance policies. While the productivity of a factory worker doesn't vary radically from month to month, the productivity of a hedge fund manager can swing wildly from week to week. 
 What's more, it strikes some economists as strange that including the dynamic financial sector would somehow make the economy seem less productive. ''If you see productivity being dragged down by the inclusion of the financial sector, you have to be a little suspicious,'' said David Altig, vice president and associate director for research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. (Mr. Altig speaks for himself, not for the Fed.)
 The divergence could mean there's a big problem with productivity in the financial sector. And the recent sharp rise in short-term interest rates has cut into the profits -- and hence the productivity -- of banks. Or it could mean that there's something fishy about the numbers themselves, or that some as-yet-undetected trends are muddling the productivity picture. ''This is a source of puzzlement,'' said J. Bradford DeLong, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.
 BUT the tale of the two productivity figures isn't merely of academic interest. This conundrum has the potential to make the remaining months of Mr. Greenspan's tenure more difficult. ''If productivity is in fact slowing, the Fed will have to be more aggressive in raising rates to slow growth,'' Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, said. Otherwise, inflationary forces will develop, especially if labor costs rise. On the other hand, if productivity growth is stronger, then the Fed doesn't need to be as hawkish.
 As is frequently the case when two figures tell seemingly contradictory stories, the true picture may lie somewhere in between a drastic fall and an impressive rise. ''Given the divergence between these two readings,'' as Mr. Greenspan put it in his inimitable way, ''a reasonably accurate determination of the extent of the recent slowing in productivity growth and its parsing into cyclical and secular influences will require the accumulation of more evidence.'' (Translation: ask my successor about this next year.)

HEADLINE: Politicized Scholars Put Evolution on the Defensive

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN; Jack Begg, David Bernstein and Alain Delaqueriere contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
When President Bush plunged into the debate over the teaching of evolution this month, saying, ''both sides ought to be properly taught,'' he seemed to be reading from the playbook of the Discovery Institute, the conservative think tank here that is at the helm of this newly volatile frontier in the nation's culture wars.
 After toiling in obscurity for nearly a decade, the institute's Center for Science and Culture has emerged in recent months as the ideological and strategic backbone behind the eruption of skirmishes over science in school districts and state capitals across the country. Pushing a ''teach the controversy'' approach to evolution, the institute has in many ways transformed the debate into an issue of academic freedom rather than a confrontation between biology and religion.
Mainstream scientists reject the notion that any controversy over evolution even exists. But Mr. Bush embraced the institute's talking points by suggesting that alternative theories and criticism should be included in biology curriculums ''so people can understand what the debate is about.'' 
 Financed by some of the same Christian conservatives who helped Mr. Bush win the White House, the organization's intellectual core is a scattered group of scholars who for nearly a decade have explored the unorthodox explanation of life's origins known as intelligent design. 
 Together, they have mounted a politically savvy challenge to evolution as the bedrock of modern biology, propelling a fringe academic movement onto the front pages and putting Darwin's defenders firmly on the defensive.
 Like a well-tooled electoral campaign, the Discovery Institute has a carefully crafted, poll-tested message, lively Web logs -- and millions of dollars from foundations run by prominent conservatives like Howard and Roberta Ahmanson, Philip F. Anschutz and Richard Mellon Scaife. The institute opened an office in Washington last fall and in January hired the same Beltway public relations firm that promoted the Contract With America in 1994.
 ''We are in the very initial stages of a scientific revolution,'' said the center's director, Stephen C. Meyer, 47, a historian and philosopher of science recruited by Discovery after he protested a professor's being punished for criticizing Darwin in class. ''We want to have an effect on the dominant view of our culture.''
 For the institute's president, Bruce K. Chapman, a Rockefeller Republican turned Reagan conservative, intelligent design appealed to his contrarian, futuristic sensibilities -- and attracted wealthy, religious philanthropists like the Ahmansons at a time when his organization was surviving on a shoestring. More student of politics than science geek, Mr. Chapman embraced the evolution controversy as the institute's signature issue precisely because of its unpopularity in the establishment. 
 ''When someone says there's one thing you can't talk about, that's what I want to talk about,'' said Mr. Chapman, 64.
 As much philosophical worldview as scientific hypothesis, intelligent design challenges Darwin's theory of natural selection by arguing that some organisms are too complex to be explained by evolution alone, pointing to the possibility of supernatural influences. While mutual acceptance of evolution and the existence of God appeals instinctively to a faithful public, intelligent design is shunned as heresy in mainstream universities and science societies as untestable in laboratories.

Entering the Public Policy Sphere
 From its nondescript office suites here, the institute has provided an institutional home for the dissident thinkers, pumping $3.6 million in fellowships of $5,000 to $60,000 per year to 50 researchers since the science center's founding in 1996. Among the fruits are 50 books on intelligent design, many published by religious presses like InterVarsity or Crossway, and two documentaries that were broadcast briefly on public television. But even as the institute spearheads the intellectual development of intelligent design, it has staked out safer turf in the public policy sphere, urging states and school boards simply to include criticism in evolution lessons rather than actually teach intelligent design.
 Since the presidential election last fall, the movement has made inroads and evolution has emerged as one of the country's fiercest cultural battlefronts, with the National Center for Science Education tracking 78 clashes in 31 states, more than twice the typical number of incidents. Discovery leaders have been at the heart of the highest-profile developments: helping a Roman Catholic cardinal place an opinion article in The New York Times in which he sought to distance the church from evolution; showing its film promoting design and purpose in the universe at the Smithsonian; and lobbying the Kansas Board of Education in May to require criticism of evolution.
 These successes follow a path laid in a 1999 Discovery manifesto known as the Wedge Document, which sought ''nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and its cultural legacies'' in favor of a ''broadly theistic understanding of nature.'' 
 President Bush's signature education law, known as No Child Left Behind, also helped, as mandatory testing prompted states to rewrite curriculum standards. Ohio, New Mexico and Minnesota have embraced the institute's ''teach the controversy'' approach; Kansas is expected to follow suit in the fall.
 Detractors dismiss Discovery as a fundamentalist front and intelligent design as a clever rhetorical detour around the 1987 Supreme Court ruling banning creationism from curriculums. But the institute's approach is more nuanced, scholarly and politically adept than its Bible-based predecessors in the century-long battle over biology. 
 A closer look shows a multidimensional organization, financed by missionary and mainstream groups -- the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provides $1 million a year, including $50,000 of Mr. Chapman's $141,000 annual salary -- and asserting itself on questions on issues as varied as local transportation and foreign affairs.
 Many of the research fellows, employees and board members are, indeed, devout and determinedly conservative; pictures of William J. Bennett, the moral crusader and former drug czar, are fixtures on office walls, and some leaders have ties to movement mainstays like Focus on the Family. All but a few in the organization are Republicans, though these include moderates drawn by the institute's pragmatic, iconoclastic approach on nonideological topics like technology.
 But even as intelligent design has helped raise Discovery's profile, the institute is starting to suffer from its success. Lately, it has tried to distance itself from lawsuits and legislation that seek to force schools to add intelligent design to curriculums, placing it in the awkward spot of trying to promote intelligent design as a robust frontier for scientists but not yet ripe for students.
 The group is also fending off attacks from the left, as critics liken it to Holocaust deniers or the Taliban. Concerned about the criticism, Discovery's Cascadia project, which focuses on regional transportation and is the recipient of the large grant from the Gates Foundation, created its own Web site to ensure an individual identity. 
 ''All ideas go through three stages -- first they're ignored, then they're attacked, then they're accepted,'' said Jay W. Richards, a philosopher and the institute's vice president. ''We're kind of beyond the ignored stage. We're somewhere in the attack.''

Origins of an Institute
 Founded in 1990 as a branch of the Hudson Institute, based in Indianapolis, the institute was named for the H.M.S. Discovery, which explored Puget Sound in 1792. Mr. Chapman, a co-author of a 1966 critique of Barry M. Goldwater's anti-civil-rights campaign, ''The Party That Lost Its Head,'' had been a liberal Republican on the Seattle City Council and candidate for governor, but moved to the right in the Reagan administration, where he served as director of the Census Bureau and worked for Edwin Meese III.
 In late 1993, Mr. Chapman clipped an essay in The Wall Street Journal by Dr. Meyer, who was teaching at a Christian college in Spokane, Wash., concerning a biologist yanked from a lecture hall for discussing intelligent design. About a year later, over dinner at the Sorrento Hotel here, Dr. Meyer and George Gilder, Mr. Chapman's long-ago Harvard roommate and his writing partner, discovered parallel theories of mind over materialism in their separate studies of biology and economics.
 ''Bruce kind of perked up and said, 'This is what makes a think tank,''' Dr. Meyer recalled. ''There was kind of an 'Aha!' moment in the conversation, there was a common metaphysic in these two ideas.''
 That summer of 1995, Mr. Chapman and Dr. Meyer had dinner with a representative of the Ahmansons, the banking billionaires from Orange County, Calif., who had previously given a small grant to the institute and underwritten an early conclave of intelligent design scholars. Dr. Meyer, who had grown friendly enough with the Ahmansons to tutor their young son in science, recalled being asked, ''What could you do if you had some financial backing?''
 So in 1996, with the promise of $750,000 over three years from the Ahmansons and a smaller grant from the MacLellan Foundation, which supports organizations ''committed to furthering the Kingdom of Christ,'' according to its Web site, the institute's Center for Science and Culture was born.
 ''Bruce is a contrarian, and this was a contrarian idea,'' said Edward J. Larson, the historian and author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning book on the Scopes Monkey Trial, who was an early fellow at the institute, but left in part because of its drift to the right. ''The institute was living hand-to-mouth. Here was an academic, credible activity that involved funders. It interested conservatives. It brought in money.''

Support From Religious Groups
 The institute would not provide details about its backers ''because they get harassed,'' Mr. Chapman said. But a review of tax documents on www.guidestar.org, a Web site that collects data on foundations, showed its grants and gifts jumped to $4.1 million in 2003 from $1.4 million in 1997, the most recent and oldest years available. The records show financial support from 22 foundations, at least two-thirds of them with explicitly religious missions.
 There is the Henry P. and Susan C. Crowell Trust of Colorado Springs, whose Web site describes its mission as ''the teaching and active extension of the doctrines of evangelical Christianity.'' There is also the AMDG Foundation in Virginia, run by Mark Ryland, a Microsoft executive turned Discovery vice president: the initials stand for Ad Majorem Dei Glorium, Latin for ''To the greater glory of God,'' which Pope John Paul II etched in the corner of all his papers. 
 And the Stewardship Foundation, based in Tacoma, Wash., whose Web site says it was created ''to contribute to the propagation of the Christian Gospel by evangelical and missionary work,'' gave the group more than $1 million between 1999 and 2003.
 By far the biggest backers of the intelligent design efforts are the Ahmansons, who have provided 35 percent of the science center's $9.3 million since its inception and now underwrite a quarter of its $1.3 million annual operations. Mr. Ahmanson also sits on Discovery's board. 
 The Ahmansons' founding gift was joined by $450,000 from the MacLellan Foundation, based in Chattanooga, Tenn.
 ''We give for religious purposes,'' said Thomas H. McCallie III, its executive director. ''This is not about science, and Darwin wasn't about science. Darwin was about a metaphysical view of the world.''
 The institute also has support from secular groups like the Verizon Foundation and the Gates Foundation, which gave $1 million in 2000 and pledged $9.35 million over 10 years in 2003. Greg Shaw, a grant maker at the Gates Foundation, said the money was ''exclusive to the Cascadia project'' on regional transportation.
 But the evolution controversy has cost it the support of the Bullitt Foundation, based here, which gave $10,000 in 2001 for transportation, as well as the John Templeton Foundation in Pennsylvania, whose Web site defines it as devoted to pursuing ''new insights between theology and science.''
 Denis Hayes, director of the Bullitt Foundation, described Discovery in an e-mail message as ''the institutional love child of Ayn Rand and Jerry Falwell,'' saying, ''I can think of no circumstances in which the Bullitt Foundation would fund anything at Discovery today.''
 Charles L. Harper Jr., the senior vice president of the Templeton Foundation, said he had rejected the institute's entreaties since providing $75,000 in 1999 for a conference in which intelligent design proponents confronted critics. ''They're political -- that for us is problematic,'' Mr. Harper said. While Discovery has ''always claimed to be focused on the science,'' he added, ''what I see is much more focused on public policy, on public persuasion, on educational advocacy and so forth.''
 For three years after completing graduate school in 1996, William A. Dembski could not find a university job, but he nonetheless received what he called ''a standard academic salary'' of $40,000 a year.
 ''I was one of the early beneficiaries of Discovery largess,'' said Dr. Dembski, whose degrees include a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Chicago, one in philosophy from the University of Illinois and a master's of divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary.

Money for Teachers and Students
 Since its founding in 1996, the science center has spent 39 percent of its $9.3 million on research, Dr. Meyer said, underwriting books or papers, or often just paying universities to release professors from some teaching responsibilities so that they can ponder intelligent design. Over those nine years, $792,585 financed laboratory or field research in biology, paleontology or biophysics, while $93,828 helped graduate students in paleontology, linguistics, history and philosophy.
 The 40 fellows affiliated with the science center are an eclectic group, including David Berlinski, an expatriate mathematician living in Paris who described his only religion to be ''having a good time all the time,'' and Jonathan Wells, a member of the Unification Church, led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, who once wrote in an essay, ''My prayers convinced me that I should devote my life to destroying Darwinism.'' 
 Their credentials -- advanced degrees from Stanford, Columbia, Yale, the University of Texas, the University of California -- are impressive, but their ideas are often ridiculed in the academic world. 
 ''They're interested in the same things I'm interested in -- no one else is,'' Guillermo Gonzalez, 41, an astronomer at the University of Iowa, said of his colleagues at Discovery. ''What I'm doing, frankly, is frowned upon by most of my colleagues. It's not something a 'scientist' is supposed to do.'' Other than Dr. Berlinski, most fellows, like their financiers, are fundamentalist Christians, though they insist their work is serious science, not closet creationism.
 ''I believe that God created the universe,'' Dr. Gonzalez said. ''What I don't know is whether that evidence can be tested objectively. I ask myself the tough questions.''
 Discovery sees the focus on its fellows and financial backers as a diversionary tactic by its opponents. ''We're talking about evidence, and they want to talk about us,'' Dr. Meyer said.
 But Philip Gold, a former fellow who left in 2002, said the institute had grown increasingly religious. ''It evolved from a policy institute that had a religious focus to an organization whose primary mission is Christian conservatism,'' he said.
 That was certainly how many people read the Wedge Document, a five-page outline of a five-year plan for the science center that originated as a fund-raising pitch but was soon posted on the Internet by critics. 
 ''Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions,'' the document says. Among its promises are seminars ''to encourage and equip believers with new scientific evidence that support the faith, as well as to 'popularize' our ideas in the broader culture.''
 One sign of any political movement's advancement is when adherents begin to act on their own, often without the awareness of the leadership. That, according to institute officials, is what happened in 1999, when a new conservative majority on the Kansas Board of Education shocked the nation -- and their potential allies here at the institute -- by dropping all references to evolution from the state's science standards.
 ''When there are all these legitimate scientific controversies, this was silly, outlandish, counterproductive,'' said John G. West, associate director of the science center, who said he and his colleagues learned of that 1999 move in Kansas from newspaper accounts. ''We began to think, 'Look, we're going to be stigmatized with what everyone does if we don't make our position clear.'''
 Out of this developed Discovery's ''teach the controversy'' approach, which endorses evolution as a staple of any biology curriculum -- so long as criticism of Darwin is also in the lesson plan. This satisfied Christian conservatives but also appealed to Republican moderates and, under the First Amendment banner, much of the public (71 percent in a Discovery-commissioned Zogby poll in 2001 whose results were mirrored in newspaper polls). 
 ''They have packaged their message much more cleverly than the creation science people have,'' said Eugenie C. Scott, director of the National Center for Science Education, the leading defender of evolution. ''They present themselves as being more mainstream. I prefer to think of that as creationism light.''
 A watershed moment came with the adoption in 2001 of the No Child Left Behind Act, whose legislative history includes a passage that comes straight from the institute's talking points. ''Where biological evolution is taught, the curriculum should help students to understand why this subject generates so much continuing controversy,'' was language that Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, tried to include.
 Pointing to that principle, institute fellows in 2002 played important roles in pushing the Ohio Board of Education to adopt a ''teach the controversy'' approach and helped devise a curriculum to support it. The following year, they successfully urged changes to textbooks in Texas to weaken the argument for evolution, and they have been consulted in numerous other cases as school districts or states consider changing their approach to biology.
 But this spring, at the hearings in Kansas, Mr. Chapman grew visibly frustrated as his supposed allies began talking more and more about intelligent design.
 John Calvert, the managing director of the Intelligent Design Network, based in Kansas, said the institute had the intellectual and financial resources to ''lead the movement'' but was ''more cautious'' than he would like. ''They want to avoid the discussion of religion because that detracts from the focus on the science,'' he said. 
 Dr. West, who leads the science center's public policy efforts, said it did not support mandating the teaching of intelligent design because the theory was not yet developed enough and there was no appropriate curriculum. So the institute has opposed legislation in Pennsylvania and Utah that pushes intelligent design, instead urging lawmakers to follow Ohio's lead.
 ''A lot of people are trying to hijack the issue on both the left and the right,'' Dr. West said.
 Dr. Chapman, for his part, sees even these rough spots as signs of success.
 ''All ideas that achieve a sort of uniform acceptance ultimately fall apart whether it's in the sciences or philosophy or politics after a few people keep knocking away at it,'' he said. ''It's wise for society not to 
punish those people.''

 controversy.'' The amendment was later stricken from the act.

Earlier this month, President Bush said ''both sides ought to be properly taught.''

Major donors include Howard and Roberta Ahmanson, who continues to finance a quarter of the center's annual budget.

Bruce K. Chapman and Stephen C. Meyer of the Discovery Institute, founded in 1990 and now the intellectual home of intelligent design, the idea that life is too complex to be explained entirely by natural selection.

Some donors have been alienated by the center's activities. Denis Hayes, director of the Bullitt Foundation, which used to finance Discovery, has called the organization ''the institutional love child of Ayn Rand and Jerry Falwell.''

Mr. Chapman and Dr. Meyer met after Mr. Chapman clipped a 1993 article by Dr. Meyer about a university biology professor who was ordered to stop teaching intelligent design.

An ''aha'' moment came at an early 1995 dinner with the economist George Gilder, Mr. Chapman's former Harvard roommate and a Discovery senior fellow, and the institute decided to devote itself to the growing debate over evolution.

The Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture has produced at least 50 books and several DVD's on intelligent design.

40 fellows are associated with the center, including William A. Dembski (left), author of ''The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance Through Small Probabilities,'' and Jonathan Wells, author of ''Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth?'' (pg. 22)

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about the Discovery Institute, which promotes the concept known as intelligent design to explain the origins of life, referred incorrectly to the religious affiliation of the institute's fellows. Most are conservative Christians, including Roman Catholics and evangelical Protestants -- not fundamentalist Christians. 
 The article also referred incorrectly to recent changes in science standards adopted by Ohio, Minnesota and New Mexico. While those states encourage critical analysis of evolution, they did not necessarily embrace the institute's ''teach the controversy'' approach. The article also misstated the university affiliation of Guillermo Gonzalez, a teacher of astronomy who is a senior fellow at the institute's Center for Science and Culture. He is an assistant professor at Iowa State University, not the University of Iowa.
 In some copies a picture was published in error in a grouping of key people, places and writings on the subject. The picture showed Howard Ahmanson Sr. -- not Howard F. Ahmanson Jr., a major donor to the Center for Science and Culture.

HEADLINE: Roberts's Roots As Conservative

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
John G. Roberts Jr. arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1973, a nascent conservative from a Catholic boarding school in the Republican Midwest, transplanted to Cambridge, Mass., at a time when campus conservatism seemed to be in hibernation. Prep school Marxists blustered about armed struggle, and students picketed liquor stores for carrying a boycotted wine. Conservatives were casually dismissed as a joke. 
 Judge Roberts, President Bush's Supreme Court nominee, spent the next six years at Harvard and Harvard Law after Watergate and before the election of President Ronald Reagan --when it was almost possible to graduate from Harvard without ever encountering a card-carrying conservative in a seminar or a dining hall or having seriously to confront a conservative position.
''Conservatives were like the queers on campus,'' said Eric Rofes, a classmate of Judge Roberts who later became an organizer on gay issues. ''People made fun of them. They mocked them and saw them as jokers or losers. I don't think in the moment many people realized this was the start of an ascending movement. People felt it was like the last cry of the 1950's.'' 
 In fact, a striking number among the small cluster of conservatives at Harvard in Mr. Roberts's era went on to become important figures in the conservative resurgence, which began gaining momentum around the time of the 1980 election. Some of them now say that being a part of that often ridiculed minority left them with skills that have been essential in their movement's subsequent success. 
 The group includes Spencer Abraham, a law school contemporary and former secretary of energy under President Bush who helped found the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group seen as increasingly influential; and Grover G. Norquist, who was a class behind Mr. Roberts in college and is president of Americans for Tax Reform and a major figure behind Mr. Bush's tax cuts. 
 Stephen H. Galebach, another law school classmate and friend of Mr. Roberts, went to work in the Reagan White House and wrote an article that became the basis of an effort to have Congress declare that life begins at conception. Hugh Hewitt, a conservative radio talk show host and political blogger, was at Harvard in the same period. 
 ''There was a 'Boy Named Sue' quality to being a libertarian or conservative at Harvard,'' said Mr. Norquist, referring to the Johnny Cash song and Shel Silverstein poem (''Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean,/ My fist got hard and my wits got keen.'') Conservatives at Harvard, he suggested, learned to be ''tougher than anyone else.'' Unlike students on the left, he said, they were constantly being challenged.
 ''There was this cowardice of the center to criticize the left,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''Somebody would make some left-wing comment and no one would challenge it, whereas if you made some right-wing comment, you'd get 20 questions. We grew up and we built tougher, smarter, better advocates on the right than the left did. You see this all the time: The left gets frustrated if somebody asks a second question.''
 While Mr. Roberts was in law school, Mr. Abraham and several other law students founded a conservative and libertarian law journal, The Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, to serve as a forum for conservative voices and give conservative scholars nationally a better chance at publication and tenure.
 The journal went on to publish the proceedings of what turned out to be the first conference of the Federalist Society, which was founded in 1982. The society, now with chapters in 60 cities and nearly every law school, has created a network of conservative lawyers seen as increasingly influential in judicial appointments and policy.
 Asked how the experience of being a conservative in the Ivy League at that time influenced what he did afterward, Steven Calabresi, one of the Federalist Society's founders and a 1983 Yale Law School graduate, said: ''Enormously. I think in retrospect it was probably one of the most important things that happened to me as I was growing up. We were inspired to start the Federalist Society because of that.'' 
 Friends and classmates of Judge Roberts remember him as conservative at Harvard but say he was neither outspoken nor actively involved in conservative groups. They describe him as affable and circumspect. They recall no moment of political awakening -- just an orientation that one law school friend and former roommate, Richard Lazarus, attributed to family, upbringing and community values.
 Morton J. Horwitz, a professor of American legal history at Harvard, who never taught Mr. Roberts, said he was struck recently when reading excerpts from a paper Mr. Roberts wrote as a college senior, ''The Utopian Conservative: A Study of Continuity and Change in the Thought of Daniel Webster.'' It seemed apparent to him that Judge Roberts ''was a conservative looking for a conservative ideology in American history.'' 
 ''It was interesting to me how self-conscious it was in terms of his own discovery of where he stood,'' said Professor Horwitz, a self-described liberal. ''My guess is he came to Harvard College with conservative prejudices and tried to educate those prejudices whenever he had the opportunity.'' Some students lose their prejudices, he said. ''But others, especially the more intellectual types, actually educate their prejudices.'' 
 The culture of the campus where Judge Roberts arrived in 1973 was not what it had been four years earlier around the time of the Harvard student strike. There was a shifting away from student activism, some say, and a turning inward. Even so, people on each side of the political spectrum recall the environment as overwhelmingly and outspokenly liberal or leftist, among much of the faculty as well as the student body.
 Peter Ferrara, a college and law school classmate of Judge Roberts, arrived from Phoenix as a conservative/libertarian Republican. He joined The Harvard Crimson, the daily newspaper, then a bastion of left-wing ideologies. As he recalls it, being a Democrat was passe; coolness lay further left. One editor bragged, he said, that she had relatives in terrorist training in East Germany -- as though it were a badge of honor. 
 ''You were considered a reptile if you were a Republican,'' said Mr. Ferrara, a senior fellow with the Institute for Policy Innovation, a free-market research group in Texas, and a founder of the American Civil Rights Union, which he describes as a conservative antidote to the American Civil Liberties Union. ''The spectrum at Harvard ran from the right wing, which would be the Democratic Party. The far left would be advocates of open revolution.'' 
 The tiny cadre of active conservatives did their best to get attention. The Republican Club awarded its political newcomer of the year award to Fanne Fox, the stripper whose leap into the Tidal Basin in Washington in 1974 led to the downfall of Wilbur D. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Libertarians leafleted an Economics 10 lecture, saying it was biased toward Marxist theory. 
 On the left, Mr. Rofes recalled marches in support of abortion clinics and student pickets outside University Liquors for selling Gallo wine, which was being boycotted in support of farm workers.
 ''The left was still coming off of the Sixties energy and hadn't yet split up into identity-based movements,'' he said. At the same time, he said, ''There started to be this questioning of activism in general, left or right. There was a dawning 'Let's not get involved, let's look at our careers.'''
 In the fall of 1973, the Harvard Young Republican Club said that 250 freshmen registering for classes had signed a list expressing interest in the club -- up 25 percent from the previous year. (When The Crimson covered the story, however, it gave the last word to Students for a Democratic Society, the radical group from the 1960's: it was the fault of the admissions office, the group said, for admitting too many preppies.) 
 There was less political posturing in law school than in college, classmates of Judge Roberts said. There was no time, especially for those who, like him, held jobs on The Harvard Law Review that could swallow up 50 to 60 hours a week. In interviews, some said they sensed other students' political leanings less from any stated positions on national policy issues than from what those students said about the law. 
 ''A lot of what went by the name conservative at Harvard Law School in the 1970's was simply an attitude of restraint about the role of judges and the role of the law,'' said Mr. Galebach, one of the more vocal conservatives, who had arrived at Harvard from the Marine Corps. ''In a large sense, the conservatives were the ones who did not jump on the bandwagon for liberal causes.''
 There was a minuscule Republican club, Mr. Abraham said, and a handful of law professors with Republican connections, among them Charles Fried, who became solicitor general under Mr. Reagan, and Douglas H. Ginsburg, who withdrew in 1987 from consideration for the Supreme Court after it was revealed that he had smoked marijuana.
 William J. Kayatta Jr., a law school classmate, described the period as one of transition, an unpolarized time between the aftermath of the antiwar movement and the rise of a more militant conservatism. In marathon doughnut-fueled discussions around the conference table in Gannett House, the law review building, Mr. Kayatta said, impressions of other people's politics took shape. 
 ''I would have described John as on the conservative side but with really no sense of sort of a dogmatic approach,'' he said. ''He was someone I found not only persuasive but eminently persuadable. John was the type of person who, if in a conversation you raised a point that caused him to rethink his position, his immediate reaction was to smile. He would actually enjoy the sense of 'Aha, that's a new way to look at something.'''
 Robert Kantowitz, who as executive editor of the law review shared an office with Mr. Roberts the year he was managing editor, said, ''What he projected was, 'I may have some strong feelings, and they may influence the way I think about things, but I'd much rather convince you on the basis of legal argumentation than on the basis of political philosophy.'''
 Mr. Roberts had grown up mostly in Long Beach, Ind., an affluent enclave on Lake Michigan then favored by Bethlehem Steel executives like his father. He attended La Lumiere, a Catholic boarding school near La Porte, Ind., where the dress code and culture were conservative and where Judge Roberts is remembered as brilliant, hard-working and without any obvious political inclinations.
 David Kirkby, who taught him math and theology and coached him in football and wrestling, described him as ''intellectually the most gifted student that the school has ever had'' and a person with ''this insatiable thirst to learn.'' Christopher Balawender, who taught him American and modern European history, said, ''I don't think he showed a leaning in high school one way or another. He was so bright that he could argue any side of a position.''
 Many families at the school at the time were somewhat conservative, while the faculty was ''somewhat on the liberal side,'' said Lawrence Sullivan, a former headmaster. He said he assumed that Judge Roberts's conservatism found its roots in his family. ''I wouldn't see the school as a place that was going to lay that foundation,'' he said.
 Mr. Lazarus, who roomed with Mr. Roberts in Washington for three years after graduation, said: ''John was politically conservative. He was comfortable with it, but it didn't define his friendships. He was very thoughtful, very open talking about ideas. For some people, it's really a defining characteristic of how they define their lives. That just wasn't the case back then.''

HEADLINE: Be Warned: Mr. Bubble's Worried Again

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
ABBY JOSEPH COHEN, the Goldman Sachs strategist then making a name for herself as Wall Street's optimist in chief, sat directly to Alan Greenspan's right. One chair away was Robert J. Shiller, a largely unknown Yale economist.
 As they ate lunch in a stately dining room at the Federal Reserve that day in December 1996, Mr. Shiller argued that the stock market had risen to irrational levels. In a soft, Midwestern-tinged voice, he asked Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, when the last time was that somebody in his job had warned the public that the stock market had become a bubble.
 Mr. Greenspan listened without giving his opinion, and Mr. Shiller went home assuming that he had been farther away from Mr. Greenspan than Ms. Cohen in more ways than one. Three days later, however, driving his son to school in the family Volvo, Mr. Shiller heard on the radio that stocks were plunging because Mr. Greenspan had asked in a speech whether ''irrational exuberance'' was infecting the markets. 
 ''I may have just started a worldwide stock-market crash,'' the professor told his wife, Virginia, who accused him of delusions of grandeur. 
 Today, nine years after his lunch with Mr. Greenspan and five years after the markets finally did crash, Mr. Shiller is sounding the same warning for real estate that he did for stocks. In speeches, in television and radio interviews and in a second edition of his prophetic 2000 book, ''Irrational Exuberance,'' he is arguing that the housing craze is another bubble destined to end badly, just as every other real-estate boom on record has. 
 These, in short, are his second 15 minutes of gloom. He predicts that prices could fall 40 percent in inflation-adjusted terms over the next generation and that the end of the bubble will probably cause a recession at some point. 
 Despite being a boyish-looking 59-year-old academic economist with a halting speaking manner, he has become the bugaboo of the multibillion-dollar real-estate industry. Its executives, like many Wall Street economists, say that low interest rates and a growing population will keep house prices rising, even if future increases are smaller than recent ones. On Monday, the National Association of Realtors reported that the median home price climbed to $208,500 in the second quarter, up 14 percent from a year earlier. 
 ''Shiller is predicting the mountain goes into the sea,'' Robert I. Toll, the chief executive of Toll Brothers, a home builder, said in a recent interview, without having been asked about the economist. ''He's selling himself.''
 To Mr. Shiller, though, it is a question of history, not salesmanship. Most people have never looked at decades and decades of home prices, because such data have been almost impossible to find. Stock-market charts often go back almost a century. Housing charts typically start sometime in the distant decade of the 1970's.
 But Mr. Shiller has unearthed some rare historical housing data for other countries. Using old classified advertisements, he was then able to fashion a chart for the United States that goes back to the 19th century. 
 It all points to an unavoidable truth, he says. Every housing boom of the last few centuries has been followed by decades in which home values fell relative to inflation. Over the long term, the portion of income that families spend on their shelter stays about the same. 
 Builders become more efficient, as they are doing today. Places that were once sleepy hinterlands, like the counties south of San Francisco or a patch of desert in southern Nevada, turn into bustling centers that take pressure off prices elsewhere. Even now, the United States remains a mostly empty nation. 
 ''This is the biggest boom we've ever had,'' said Mr. Shiller, who bought into the boom himself in 2002, with a vacation home near one of Connecticut's Thimble Islands. ''So a very plausible scenario is that home-price increases continue for a couple more years, and then we might have a recession and they continue down into negative territory and languish for a decade.
 ''It doesn't even attract that much attention,'' he continued. ''There will be many people thinking it was a soft landing even though prices may have gone down in real terms by 40 percent.''
 MR. SHILLER begins his story 400 years ago, in the country that helped invent the idea of a bubble. In 1585, workers in Amsterdam began to dig a canal through the city. It became known as the Herengracht, or gentlemen's canal, for the fashionable row houses that soon sprang up on its banks. Merchants moved into many of them, and the canal remains one of the city's finest addresses today.
 In recent years, a Dutch economist named Piet M.A. Eichholtz heard about a book from the 1970's that traced the Herengracht's history, including records of every sale. But his efforts to track down a copy failed -- until he was browsing through a secondhand bookstore in Amsterdam almost a decade ago, not long after Mr. Shiller's lunch with Mr. Greenspan, and stumbled across one.
 It had all the details Mr. Eichholtz wanted. 
 To translate the sales into an index of prices over the years, Mr. Eichholtz turned to a method invented by Mr. Shiller and a colleague. The United States government uses the same process for its best-known measure of house prices, which is published every quarter by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the chief regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 The beauty of the method is that it does a better job of capturing the experience of homeowners than a simple average of house prices does. That average can rise when a bunch of new McMansions get built, even if existing houses have become no more valuable. The Shiller index, by following the same set of houses over many years, tracks the actual financial return that houses produce for their owners.
 On the Herengracht, those returns have often been fantastic for 25 or even 50 years at a time. Home prices soared in the first half of the 17th century, around the time of the tulip mania. But they came crashing down in the 1670's, when the prime minister was killed, and partially eaten, by a mob of angry Dutch, and the country nearly disintegrated. Prices lagged inflation during the Napoleonic wars but surged after William became king in 1814 and the country industrialized. 
 Again and again, the cycle repeats itself. But there is essentially no long-term trend, beyond a general rise in house prices that roughly matches gains in peoples' incomes. As Amsterdam became a global city and its population exploded, demand for homes increased -- but so, too, did supply.
 PRICES have hardly become more stable over the last 400 years; in fact, they've jumped up and down more in the 20th century than they did during the 18th and 19th. Only the 17th century, that time of cannibalized prime ministers, was more volatile.
 ''A whole lot of the price increases you see in houses is imaginary, because it's just inflation,'' said Mr. Eichholtz, a professor at Maastricht University. ''People say, 'I have a house. It protects me against the economic imbalances or misfortunes of the country.' The big lesson is that real estate does not give you the protection that people think it does.''
 A history of Norwegian house prices that Mr. Shiller has found shows the same pattern. As does his index of American house prices, until the blastoff of the last decade. In chart form, it looks eerily similar to the stock chart from his 2000 book.
 But this is actually a happy story in many ways. Over the long course of history, families have not been forced to devote an ever-larger chunk of their money to the roof over their heads. They instead can afford better health care, new technologies and -- as Mr. Shiller pointed out during lunch this month at a steakhouse in midtown Manhattan -- leisurely restaurant meals.
 Still, history is easy to forget during times like these. Mr. Shiller says that a steady shift toward freer markets around the world has caused people to think much more about the importance of what they own. The best description, he said, comes from President Bush, who often talks of ''an ownership society.'' (Mr. Shiller has tried, without success, to find out who in the White House had coined the phrase.)
 When his undergraduates were reading through old newspapers, they found that stories about house prices were once confined to the back pages of business sections. Today, real estate often seems to be topic A in the national conversation. 
 Many people have made huge profits from selling homes, and many more have paper profits. When people get together with friends, they want to find a subject that makes others happy, Mr. Shiller says, and real estate fits the bill, just as stocks did in the 1990's.
 ''It's very much like studying a disease epidemic. It's a contagion,'' Mr. Shiller said. ''When it goes in an up direction, it's very impressive. But it can also work in the down direction.''
 This psychological approach has been at the core of his work for years. In the 1970's, when his wife was studying psychology, he would soak up the discussions that she and her fellow graduate students had over dinner at the Shillers' house in Delaware. A decade ago, his beliefs about herd behavior led him to his lunchtime conversation with Mr. Greenspan.
 Mr. Shiller takes no credit for the phrase ''irrational exuberance.'' He does not remember using it during the conversation. He recently searched through his daily diary, which he keeps on a computer, from the early 1990's and found only one phrase that was at all similar. In 1991, he used ''overexuberant'' to describe an exercise that had left him feeling sore.
 His good friend, Jeremy J. Siegel, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, stumbled upon a 1959 quotation from Fortune magazine in which Mr. Greenspan discussed ''over-exuberance'' in the financial community. The phrase is probably his. He may even have to dust it off again soon. He recently called some local markets ''frothy'' but emphasized that there was no national bubble. 
 Even so, Mr. Shiller has little company for his radical notion that house prices could fall by 40 percent. Many economists say that interest rates are low enough and demand for housing in big urban areas is high enough to keep from prices from falling very far. Mr. Shiller himself confesses to some doubt.
 ''I don't have any certainty,'' he said. ''I have a lot of humility'' about any prediction. 
 ''We do have a shortage of land in the prestige areas, and so there is a potential for them to go up,'' he added. ''But I just know that the trend over the last century has been for new prestige areas to appear.''
 If he is right, the Herengracht also looks due for one of its occasional corrections. Prices there have doubled, even accounting for inflation, over the last decade or so. It almost seems like they might never fall again.

HEADLINE: Democrats Jab In 2nd Debate In Mayor Race

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
Showing new aggressiveness, the four Democrats running for mayor mounted sharp, sometimes snide attacks on one another yesterday at their second major debate, as each sought to appear as the candidate most capable of beating Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg this fall.
 More than at any previous encounter, the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, and Representative Anthony D. Weiner in particular challenged each other's ideas and even honesty, from taxes and spending to Medicaid and school-testing policies. The barbed exchanges highlighted how the two men now see an open race to become the alternative to Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, who is leading in the polls.
As they sat side by side in a WCBS-TV studio on the West Side in a debate sponsored by WCBS and The New York Times, Mr. Miller denounced Mr. Weiner's proposed tax cut for middle-class workers as a ''gimmick'' -- a word he used four times yesterday -- and challenged him to explain how he would pay to reduce rates. 
 Mr. Weiner, whose campaign centerpiece is a 10 percent cut for those earning $150,000 or less a year, responded that he would raise taxes on millionaires and repeated his promise to cut the city budget by 5 percent.
 Mr. Miller was dubious. ''The congressman's cut is frankly paid for by gimmicks -- $500 million of the proposed financing is from the capital budget,'' he said, asserting that savings for proposed construction could not be used to pay for tax cuts.
 ''Gifford, waste is waste,'' Mr. Weiner said, showing his trademark for short, blunt sentences that helped him stand out from his wordier colleagues. ''This is the problem with the status quo of our party. If you think we can't cut out waste at least 5 percent like I've proposed, you shouldn't be mayor.''
 The debate showed the candidates in rare fighting form in a contest in which they have until now been reluctant to attack each other. But recent polls have shown that not only are undecided voters starting to make up their minds before the Sept. 13 primary, but three candidates -- Mr. Miller, Mr. Weiner and C. Virginia Fields -- enjoy roughly the same level of support behind Mr. Ferrer, adding pressure for them to try to break from the pack. 
 Mr. Weiner tried to draw the brightest rhetorical lines to separate himself from the other candidates, promising to break with the ''Democratic orthodoxy'' and ''status quo'' that he blamed for 11 1/2 years of Republican rule at City Hall.
 ''We have lost three straight municipal elections -- the same old rhetoric will not work,'' Mr. Weiner said.
 A moment later, charging that his rivals were only rehashing vague Democratic pledges on city spending and taxes, Mr. Weiner complained: ''It is not enough just to say, 'Get it where we can get it,' or 'try to find it later on,' or 'raise taxes,' or 'don't cut waste.' I think we need to have alternatives.''
 ''No, no, no -- hold on a second,'' Mr. Miller said. Referring to Mr. Weiner's tax cut plan, Mr. Miller said: ''There's nothing new about making a bunch of promises that you can't keep, that aren't painful to anybody. That's the oldest trick in the book.''
 At times during the hourlong debate, it was hard to overlook the similarities between the two: both white men with a youthful, energetic appearance who debated crisply in their pursuit of undecided voters. The two other candidates -- Mr. Ferrer, who is Hispanic, and Ms. Fields, who is black -- have been most identified with their ethnic bases during this race, and an important unknown is which candidate will cobble together a sufficiently diverse coalition of voters to win the nomination.
 Mr. Ferrer, who has been playing it relatively safe this summer to preserve his lead in the polls, spent the first third of the debate repeating his concerns about the lack of affordable housing and school dropout rates. Then the moderator, Andrew Kirtzman of Channel 2, jumped in and asserted that Mr. Ferrer was an absent player during the last three and a half years in city politics. ''Where were you?'' Mr. Kirtzman asked.
 While noting that he had been out of office but still speaking up, Mr. Ferrer turned a bit scrappier in his debating style after that. A couple of times, he tried to rise above the Weiner-Miller cross-talk by listing what he called the crises that he saw in New York, from housing and schools to high unemployment rates for black and Hispanic men.
 ''This isn't the time for baby steps, this is the time for bold solutions,'' Mr. Ferrer said.
 ''Not bold tax increases, Freddy,'' Mr. Weiner quipped, referring to Mr. Ferrer's ideas for tax increases, including a stock-transfer tax to help pay for his education plans.
 Ms. Fields, the Manhattan borough president, often seemed to be reduced to jumping into the fray from her spot at the end of a curved table. After the three men jousted over how to pay police trainees more than $25,000, she interjected that the answer lay in the ''negotiation process.''
 Ms. Fields, who was repeatedly pressed for specifics yesterday, was asked how she would pay for the higher salaries. She said, ''The question is often asked how do you get money and I just want to point out: Budgets reflect priorities of any mayor who sets them.''
 As she continued, Mr. Weiner jumped in.
 ''But where? Virginia, where do you get the money?'' he asked. 
 ''Anthony, you get it out of the budget, that's where you get it from,'' she said.
 Their back-and-forth led Mr. Weiner to say in some frustration, ''This is what's wrong.'' This prompted Ms. Fields to object to his reaction and put her hand on his as if to calm him.
 But throughout the debate, Mr. Weiner hammered away at the idea that the Democratic Party in the city needed a course correction, and that it could serve as a lesson for a national party that has become a minority in Congress and lost the last two presidential elections.
 ''One thing I'll say to my Democratic brothers and sisters, the campaign for 2006, 2008, starts today: We have to start articulating what the vision of our party is,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''It's not just enough to say, 'I'm a Democrat, vote for me,' or 'I'm not Mike Bloomberg' or 'I'm not George Bush.' We have to articulate a view.''
 For Mr. Weiner, that image for the city centers on tax cuts for midlevel wage earners, a 5 percent cut in the city departments, higher teacher salaries coupled with work rules that ensure teachers are qualified for tenure, greater attention to the boroughs beyond Manhattan and, almost certainly, a frenetic and tough-talking leadership style that has more in common with Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani than with Mr. Bloomberg.
 The challengers to Mr. Ferrer are not seeking to overtake him as much as hold him below 40 percent in the primary. If he finishes first but does not reach that threshold, he will face a runoff against the runner-up, which is why the combat between the other candidates is expected to intensify, especially as they hone their messages with new television ads.
 No candidate rose above the attacks yesterday. Ms. Fields tweaked Mr. Miller for the $1.6 million in campaign-style mailings that his office sent to voters at taxpayers' expense. She said that money ''would have gone a long way'' to providing meals to the elderly, for instance.
 Mr. Miller later counterattacked when Ms. Fields said that as mayor-elect, she would ask Mr. Bloomberg to help direct his commissioners to present her with a list of possible cuts and savings.
 ''You would ask this mayor to give you a set of cuts?'' Mr. Miller asked, sounding a little incredulous.
 The four descended into a bit of squabbling when asked if they would continue Mr. Bloomberg's policy of holding back public school students who do not pass new academic tests. Mr. Miller said yes; Mr. Ferrer said he would keep the test but rethink Mr. Bloomberg's approach; and Ms. Fields said she would keep the test because under a Fields administration, ''they will pass the test.''
 ''Everybody will pass the test?'' Mr. Miller asked.
 Mr. Weiner said that he supported tests, and then jabbed: ''If you guys are the nominee, I'm going to vote for you over Mike Bloomberg, but I don't know what you're talking about. This is a simple yes or no question. Are tests important, should we keep them? Yes, we should keep them.''
 ''But that wasn't the question, Anthony, just to be fair, because I answered the question,'' Mr. Miller retorted.
 Even delicate issues like protecting New Yorkers, which typically unite Democratic candidates, seemed fair game yesterday. When Mr. Miller was asked by one of the three debate panelists, Marcia Kramer, a WCBS-TV reporter, if he had broken a promise by not allocating city money to reopen firehouses, he argued that Mr. Bloomberg had tied his hands in budget negotiations.
 ''I said I would fund it,'' Mr. Miller acknowledged. ''Unfortunately, I don't have the power.''
 And Mr. Weiner again pounced.
 ''You can't in the same campaign say, I passed these tough budgets but I'm not accountable for the bad things in them,'' he said. ''Frankly, the firehouses were closed under your watch. They should not have been.''


CORRECTION-DATE: August 24, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the debate among Democratic candidates for mayor in New York referred incompletely to a response by one candidate, Gifford Miller, to a question about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's policy of holding back students who do not pass new academic tests. While Mr. Miller said he would continue testing students, he added that he would use other criteria to determine if they should advance to the next grade or be held back.

HEADLINE: In Florida, a Big Developer Is Counting on Rural Chic

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: WEST BAY, Fla. 

 BODY:
What is a striving Florida developer to do when most of its vast holdings are not beach chic but rural, remote and mosquitoey? 
 The St. Joe Company, which owns 800,000 mostly inland acres here in the scrubby pine forests of the Panhandle, is invoking Thoreau.
The company, Florida's largest private landowner, is pushing ''new ruralism,'' a concept it hopes will entice city and suburban dwellers who are weary of civilization and long to own a tractor, a pickup truck, or at least a kayak and a few large dogs. 
 At developments called RiverCamps, where homes in a design proudly called ''Cracker Modern'' will sit on lots of up to four acres lots near marshes, creeks and conservation areas, ''camp masters'' will tutor residents in bird watching and flats fishing and organize ''owl prowls'' and ''star parties.'' At WhiteFence Farms, on 5- to 20-acre lots near fields and ponds, ''farmhands'' will gas up an owner's tractor and help mow the meadow. A third category, Florida Ranches, will have up to 150 acres and cater to hunters. 
 Recent sales of RiverCamps on Crooked Creek, the first project under way, average $342,900 for the land alone. Projects farther inland will most likely cost far less per acre.
 The idea is a corporate reinvention of new urbanism, an antisprawl movement that advocates compact, old-fashioned towns where residents can commune in parks, shops and restaurants within walking distance of their homes. Instead of connecting with neighbors, new ruralism promotes connecting with the land -- though these cabins in the woods come with wireless Internet access and porches with screens that unfurl by remote control. 
 The target market is people 42 to 60 who, tired of coastal hurricane threats or the beach scene in general, want something more like Walden Pond or Walton's Mountain. Most are expected to use these ranches, camps and farms as second homes, though a surprising number of prospective buyers want full-time rusticity, St. Joe executives said.
 Brainstorming sessions at St. Joe's headquarters in Jacksonville produced scraps of paper scrawled with phrases like ''wind in the trees,'' ''stars, no lights,'' and ''slamming, squeaking screen doors.'' In June, the company published a white paper quoting Thoreau (''I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately'') and defining new ruralism -- a concept that developers elsewhere have also seized on -- as rising with the sun, fishing with the tides and resting with the moon. 
 ''People are trying to get back to a time they remember,'' said Peter S. Rummell, St. Joe's chairman and chief executive, who grew up in rural upstate New York and oversaw theme parks for the Walt Disney Company before moving to St. Joe in 1997. ''A moderated ruralism seems pretty attractive.'' 
 It had better, if St. Joe is to succeed in the real estate business. The company's founder, Alfred I. duPont, bought huge tracts of land in the Panhandle in the 1930's, after which the company became a paper maker with banking and railroad interests. But the land was strictly for timber farming until the 1990's, when St. Joe sought to reinvigorate by switching to land development. 
 Though the company has been developing property ever since, about 99 percent of its holdings -- as much as all the developed land between Miami and Fort Pierce -- remain wild. It first focused on its 30 miles of Gulf of Mexico coastline, creating resort towns like WaterColor and SummerCamp with multimillion-dollar vacation homes. Making inland holdings attractive is far more complicated, requiring not just market research but also a tricky makeover for land that has long been inhospitable. 
 ''A big, thick pine forest with a lot of undergrowth is a pretty forbidding place,'' Mr. Rummell said. ''It scares a lot of people.''
 At RiverCamps on Crooked Creek, which is near Panama City Beach and offers two-acre lots for up to $1 million, the overhaul involved thinning the forest and burning the thick underbrush so that softer, greener grasses would emerge. With the land reworked, a landscape architect identified 54 ''environmental jewels'' -- Spider Lily Marsh and the like -- and mapped them out for prospective buyers. Brochures promise homes in the ''Cracker Modern'' style: lots of wood, metal roofs, broad roof overhangs to block the sun and screened porches. 
 With construction yet to begin, 145 buyers, mostly from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Texas, have closed on plots at RiverCamps on Crooked Creek, the first of three such developments. 
 ''We honestly asked ourselves, 'Will people live in this environment?''' said Kevin Fox, the St. Joe executive overseeing RiverCamps. ''We've got critters, we've got heat, we've got humidity.''
 More problematic is the isolation of St. Joe's land, most of which lies in the barely traveled region between Tallahassee and Panama City Beach. Gulf County, where St. Joe owns 230,000 acres, has but 15,200 residents, and Liberty County, where it owns 112,000 acres, has 7,300. A lot of St. Joe land surrounds the swampy Apalachicola National Forest and Tate's Hell State Forest, where a farmer named Tate supposedly was lost for days and emerged snakebitten and delirious. The company is lobbying to move and expand the small Panama City airport, while moving sections of a coastal highway inland, widening other roads and donating land for a new hospital.
 Though St. Joe has worked to win over the counties its land is in, some residents and environmental advocates worry about the scope of its ambition and have fought some of its projects. Charles Pattison, executive director of 1000 Friends of Florida, a nonprofit environmental group, said St. Joe's latest plan ''could be positive'' but that the company must take pains not to force wildlife off the land and to add enough infrastructure.
 ''This is an area of the state that typically has one of the lowest population densities,'' Mr. Pattison said. ''Issues like protection of habitat, hurricane evacuation routes and service provisions have got to be addressed.''
 At the first WhiteFence Farms site, southeast of Tallahassee, St. Joe is preparing 373 acres of former watermelon and peanut fields for ''people who have always wanted to live on a farm but don't see themselves as farmers,'' Mr. Fox said. They must also be willing to pay $20,000 to $45,000 an acre for the land alone. The company is digging ponds and smoothing pastures for buyers it imagines dabbling in horse riding, beekeeping, wildflower growing and field plowing. 
 Deborah Dudley, a lawyer who is trading her home in nearby Rosemary Beach for one here at RiverCamps on Crooked Creek, said beach towns had grown too crowded with commercial distractions. 
 ''You lose the whole basic feel of the land,'' Ms. Dudley said. ''I don't want to use the word 'backwater,' that sounds too negative, but RiverCamps has this whole underpinning of past Florida -- a rural history.''
 Ms. Dudley said she wanted to emulate Florida's early rural settlers, known as crackers, who, wrote a British traveler in 1857, ''lived among the pines, raised a few hogs and cows, grew a little patch of corn, and just barely survived.'' Yet Ms. Dudley said she also expected the comforts that cracker settlers sorely lacked. 
 ''Absolutely I want that privacy and those woods,'' she said. ''Yet at the same time, I want to be able to invite a neighbor over for a glass of wine and I want a nice kitchen with a Sub-Zero refrigerator.''

HEADLINE: Promises, Promises

 BODY:
In 1947, when 23 nations agreed to start a new international organization to promote trade and arbitrate disputes, the wants of poor countries mattered little. Industrialized nations were rebuilding after World War II, and remained the colonial masters of Asia and Africa. Over the next half-century, that club -- now known as the World Trade Organization -- aggressively dismantled barriers against trade in industrial goods and services, areas in which its members hold a comparative advantage. 
 But when it comes to areas where poor countries could flourish, such as textiles and agriculture, it has been a different story. American tariffs on textiles and apparel are among the nation's highest. Europe, Japan and the United States continue to resist facing global competition in agriculture on fair terms. The very same representatives of the club of rich countries who go around the world hectoring the poor to open up their markets to free trade put up roadblocks when those countries ask the rich to dismantle their own barriers to free trade in agricultural products. 
Last month, negotiations at the W.T.O.'s Geneva headquarters once again brought this sad reality into stark relief. The group is supposed to finally be taking up the issue of agriculture subsidies. Four years ago, in Doha, Qatar, poor countries demanded -- and supposedly won -- a promise that Europe, Japan and America would slash agricultural subsidies, in addition to further liberalizing world trade in services and manufactured goods. One year ago, the W.T.O. gave itself until July 2005 to draw up a plan for how it would do all this.
 Since then -- surprise, surprise -- negotiators have made big strides toward agreeing how to cut tariffs on manufactured goods, and, to a lesser extent, services. Both of those are important to rich countries. 
 And guess where negotiations have stalled? The European Union and the United States are busily fighting over how little they can get away with when it comes to liberalizing farm trade. Listening to these two economic powerhouses snipe about who should be doing what is revolting; neither is doing anything real. 
 The developed world funnels nearly $1 billion a day in subsidies to its own farmers, encouraging overproduction, which drives down commodity prices. Poor nations' farmers cannot compete with subsidized products, even within their own countries. In recent years, American farmers have been able to dump cotton, wheat, rice, corn and other products on world markets at prices that do not begin to cover their cost of production, all thanks to politicians and at the expense of American taxpayers. Europe's system, meanwhile, is even more odious: United States farm subsidies are equal to only a third of the European Union's.
 Farm tariffs are also a problem. Take cocoa. European tariffs on raw material are lower than tariffs on final products. That means that cocoa-producing countries like Ghana can't export chocolate to Europe, and are forced to export the raw material, cocoa, instead. 
 It was with great fanfare five years ago that the United States and some 188 other countries signed the United Nations Millennium Declaration, a magna carta to eradicate poverty and hunger and disease among the one billion people in the world who subsist on barely anything. Chief among those goals was for the rich world to finally put muscle behind that overused phrase ''level the playing field,'' when it comes to trade. 
 But so far it has been nothing but talk, talk, talk on trade. While the rich continue their shameful obfuscating, poor countries are priced out of the market. A few weeks ago, the European Union's trade envoy, Peter Mandelson, actually complained to reporters that Europe had been making more than its fair share of compromises in the W.T.O. talks. ''This process of compromise has been a one-way street for well over a year,'' he said. 
 Mr. Mandelson and his counterparts in America and Japan would do well to remember what happened in Cancun, Mexico, in September 2003, when a bloc of poor nations, led by West African countries upset about cotton subsidies, helped torpedo an international trade deal. Big business on both sides of the Atlantic dearly wants a trade pact that liberalizes the rules on manufactured products and services. But for poor countries, the process of compromise has been a one-way street for more than half a century. It's time for the rich world to start doing a little compromising.

HEADLINE: Success in Iraq Depends on Services and Jobs, General Says 

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
An American general who commanded 38,000 soldiers in the securing and rebuilding of Baghdad writes in a new essay that success in Iraq cannot be achieved solely by training local security forces. He says the military must also work to provide essential city services, create jobs and promote local governmental control.
 The officer, Maj. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, commander of the Army's First Cavalry Division, said that military missions must not shortchange reconstruction and democratization efforts, even while it is necessary to combat the insurgents. 
''A gun on every street corner, although visually appealing, provides only a short-term solution'' and ''does not equate to long-term security grounded in a democratic process,'' the essay says. 
 ''The cultural reality is that no matter what the outcome of a combat operation, for every insurgent put down, the potential exists to grow many more if cultural mitigation is not practiced,'' says the essay, which was co-written by Maj. Patrick R. Michaelis, an operations officer with one of the division's cavalry squadrons. 
 ''If there is nothing else done other than kill bad guys and train others to kill bad guys, the only thing accomplished is moving more people from the fence to the insurgent category,'' the essay says. ''There remains no opportunity to grow the supporter base.''
 The essay, which was circulated and discussed in advance of its publication soon in Military Review, argues that the American armed services suffer from a cold war mentality that organized the chaos of wartime missions into an orderly progression from combat to stability to withdrawal. The insurgency capitalized on that step-by-step process, it says. 
 In recent weeks, the public debate over the war effort has focused on the necessity of training new Iraqi security forces to allow for an eventual American withdrawal. Even so, commanders across Iraq said in interviews this week that they were not ignoring economic and political developments. 
 The essay, ''Winning the Peace: The Requirement for Full-Spectrum Operations,'' is a detailed report of the First Cavalry Division's yearlong mission in Baghdad, which ended this year.
 The editor in chief of Military Review, Col. William M. Darley, said in an e-mail message that the essay was part of a series initiated by Lt. Gen. William Wallace, commander of the Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where the journal is published. General Wallace asked that the journal focus on lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, Colonel Darley wrote. 
 In the new essay, General Chiarelli cautions against any military plan that ''solely concentrated on establishing a large security force'' and relegated efforts to promote municipal services, democratic local governments and a free market economy to a secondary status. 
 Any plan that would delay the economic and political mission ''would have waited too long,'' he says, letting insurgent leaders ''gain a competitive advantage.''
 The essay calls for balancing military efforts across five areas. Aside from combat operations and the training and hiring of Iraqi security forces, the other areas are improving city services through the use of local contractors and labor, establishing local governance and building a varied economy.

HEADLINE: 'So What Do You Do?'

 BODY:

Following are excerpts from a transcript of the debate yesterday between the Democratic candidates for mayor of New York City: Fernando Ferrer, a former Bronx borough president; C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president; Representative Anthony D. Weiner; and City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, as recorded by The New York Times.

(At one point, Ms. Fields was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for raises for police officers.)

FIELDS -- It is important that we increase the starting salary beyond $25,000 because we are not going to be able to recruit the caliber of people, and we understand that. And that is a negotiation process.

Q. So what do you do? How do you get the money?

FIELDS -- But you know, the question is often asked how do you get money --

Q. I mean these people are going to come into the academy now.

FIELDS -- -- and I just want to point out: Budgets reflect priorities of any mayor who sets them.

Q. Ms. Fields, where --

FIELDS -- And as a priority --

Q. -- where do you get the money for this?

FIELDS -- As a priority within the existing budget.

WEINER -- But where? Virginia, where do you get the money?

FIELDS -- Anthony, you get it out of the budget, that's where you get it from. We have a $50 billion budget.

WEINER -- But this is money you're adding to the budget. Where do you get the added money?

FIELDS -- You can reorder priorities within a budget.

WEINER -- This is what's wrong. O.K.

(At another point, Mr. Ferrer's plan for a stock transfer tax to improve the schools came under attack from Mr. Weiner.)

FERRER -- There are three crises facing this city: high dropout rate, affordability in housing, unconscionably high unemployment rate, especially among African-American and Latino males. And with all due respect, again, this isn't the time for baby steps. This is the time for bold solutions. We've got to put forward --

WEINER -- Not bold tax increases, Freddy.

FERRER -- -- we've got to put forward solutions that deal with these crises. And if you don't think that high dropout rate -- more than 50 percent -- brings this city down --

Q. Well, let's stay with this --

FERRER -- -- then we do have a difference of opinion.

Q. -- let's stay on this issue. Let's stay with this issue --

WEINER -- A big tax increase does not -- I don't consider a big tax increase to solve education, especially a stock-transfer tax from the 1970's isn't a bold idea, it is a bad idea. And that's what this debate should be about, not whether we solve problems --

FERRER -- Let's discuss that --

WEINER -- -- it's whether or not we do it --

FERRER -- -- let's discuss that.

WEINER -- -- in a smart way that makes our party the electable party for the generation moving forward.

FERRER -- -- because, Congressman, you keep on, time after time, confusing a mom-and-pop investor with the global investment community. But here's the question: Ask any one of those mom-and-pop investors, would you rather pay a half a penny a share --

WEINER -- But not people who work on Wall Street.

FERRER -- Excuse me a second. Excuse me a second, I didn't interrupt you, Anthony.

WEINER -- Oh, I'm sorry. You were the only one who hadn't interrupted today, you're right.

FERRER -- Thank you. Here's the question: Ask any one of them, would you rather pay a half a penny a share, a transaction, or would you rather pay thousands of dollars a year in tuition to a private school? I think I know the answer --

WEINER -- Freddy, you know who I agree with on this?

FERRER -- -- because I've asked them.

WEINER -- I agree with you, who said it wasn't the greatest idea in the world. I agree with your supporter, Eliot Spitzer, who reportedly said it was crazy. I agree with people who say that taxing --

FERRER -- You can't make things up, Anthony. Come on.

WEINER -- -- Wall Street is like someone in Wisconsin proposing a dairy tax. It hurts everyone.
