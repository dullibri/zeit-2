HEADLINE: 3 IN COUP FEARED U.S. DEPENDENCY

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Plotters who tried to overthrow President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in August acted partly because they feared that he was making the Soviet Union dependent on the United States, according to the confession of one plotter published in the German news magazine Spiegel.
"Gorbachev often traveled abroad in recent years, and frequently we had no idea what important issues he discussed there," former Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov reportedly told interrogators. 
 "Take Gorbachev's report to the G-7 meeting in London -- none of us knew what he said there," Mr. Yazov said, referring to the Soviet President's meeting with leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized countries in London in July. "We were naturally not ready to increase our political, economic and even military dependence on the United States."
 
Excerpts From Videotapes
 In its issue to be distributed on Monday, Der Spiegel published what it said were excerpts from videotaped interrogations of Mr. Yazov and two other organizers of the coup, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, former K.G.B. chief, and Valentin S. Pavlov, former Prime Minister. Advance copies of the article were made available today.
Der Spiegel did not say how it had obtained the material, but in the past it has paid for exclusive information.
According to the article, Mr. Yazov cited the Soviet Union's economic decline and internal unrest as other factors that motivated the coup plotters.
The accounts reportedly given by the three imprisoned plotters suggest that their coup was haphazardly planned. Mr. Pavlov, for example, said the plotters simply hoped that the Supreme Soviet would approve their action and that afterward "things would be worked out."
Mr. Yazov said that at a key meeting on Aug. 18 at which the coup was planned, he, Mr. Kryuchkov and a third plotter, Boris K. Pugo, former Interior Minister, who later committed suicide, were all drunk.
Mr. Pavlov told his interrogators that he also consumed "quite a decent amount of alcohol" at that meeting.
Of the three plotters, Mr. Yazov, formerly a senior military officer, was the most contrite. All three men face trial and possible death sentences for their roles in the coup.

HEADLINE: Pressing for United Front in Regional Vying for Companies

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
It has become a familiar scene of seduction: other cities and states trying to lure businesses from New York City, wooing them with promises of lower taxes and a better quality of life.
Now a few officials are trying to make the case that New York City is not the only loser when a company leaves the city but that the economy of the whole region is undermined. The solution, they say, is for officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to stop competing among themselves and to begin to forge policies that present a united front. 
 "It's not farsighted vision that's changing people's actions, it's economic reality," said Thomas M. Downs, New Jersey's Transportation Commissioner. In a competitive world economy, he said, a company considering where to have a new plant or office does not think in terms of Manhattan versus Jersey City. It considers alternative metropolitan areas, like New York versus Philadelphia or Los Angeles or Dallas. Truly global companies think even more broadly: New York versus Tokyo versus London versus Hamburg, for example.
"Our real competitors aren't each other," said Mr. Downs of New Jersey's immediate neighbors. "It's other big urban areas that are attempting to steal the bacon." Just recently, Saab Automobile said it was moving its United States headquarters from Orange, Conn., to Atlanta, citing opportunities to reduce overhead through reduced costs, tax rates and property values.
Getting public officials to approach policy issues from a regional perspective is difficult in the best of economic times, when resources are plentiful and budgets are expanding. But getting them to do so in a recession is a significant challenge.
Over the last few years, bidding wars have been common, with New Jersey, New York and Connecticut all offering generous tax breaks and other incentives to keep companies from leaving or to persuade others to stay.
In what was perhaps the most striking example of this every-state-for-itself approach, New Jersey and New York made a series of offers and counteroffers to the commodities exchanges, even though the building the exchanges were planning to leave, 4 World Trade Center, is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, an agency created by the two states to promote commerce and to operate the area's major airports, bridges and tunnels.
And Jersey City's Mayor, Gerald McCann, acknowledged on a recent television talk show that he kept raising his bid for the exchanges despite serious doubts that they would ever move to New Jersey -- just to make the process more expensive for New York. He said that although he favored regionalism, he engaged in the bidding war out of spite because he thought New York City officials were instrumental in getting the Hartford Life Insurance Company to reverse its decision to move its regional office with 140 employees from Manhattan to Jersey City.
Speaking of the exchanges on the WABC-TV program "Heart of the Matter," Mayor McCann said, "We knew they weren't moving to New Jersey, but we figured that New York did it to us on the Hartford, so we're going to do it to them on the commodities exchanges." Convinced that the exchanges were serious about moving, officials of New York City and New York State ended up offering them a package of tax breaks and other incentives worth more than $145 million.
"I don't know of any area in the country where there's more cutthroat competition than here," said Ted M. Levine, president of Development Counsellors International, a New York City-based company that advises states and municipalities on how to attract business.
In one of the first formal efforts to reverse this trend, the economic development agencies of the three states, as well as some cities and counties within them, have agreed to meet today to try to put aside their differences and concentrate on policies that will help promote the region as a whole.
 
A Barge-Ferry Link
 "We all have the same problem, which is we ain't cheap," said Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development for New York City, whose idea it was to convene the meeting. "Unless we make a concerted effort to join forces, we will be increasingly at a competitive disadvantage."
Among the hoped-for outcomes of the meeting are a pact to avoid all negative advertising by one local government against another, and commitments to promote the region internationally and seek to retain companies in the region, rather than in an individual state.
So far, examples like that are rare. New York City and New Jersey did work together on a package to encourage the company that produces Maxwell House coffee, Philip Morris, to keep its coffee-roasting operation in Hoboken, N.J., principally because most of the coffee beans it processes there comes through Brooklyn. But the effort, which would have involved incentives like a barge-ferry link between Brooklyn and Hoboken, was not enough to keep the company from deciding to move to Jacksonville, Fla.
By and large, it is easier to find cooperation in areas like transportation and the environment, where geographic boundaries are more obviously irrelevant. Both New Jersey and New York, for instance, are considering a shift to electronic toll cards that would be installed on windows or windshields of cars and trucks to allow drivers to be billed as they pass through certain toll points, without stopping their cars.
 
Emission Control Standards
 The system is intended to reduce traffic congestion while simplifying the toll-collection process, both of which would make the region more attractive to companies transporting goods. But until the two states and the many transportation authorities within those states agreed to use the same technology, drivers could have found themselves needing different cards for roads operated by different authorities.
Similar efforts toward regionalism are are coming on the environmental front. New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania are moving to adopt California's strict auto-emission standards, and lately there has been more cooperation between New York and Connecticut on the water pollution problems of Long Island Sound.
"We're now finding many efforts at regional cooperation," said Thomas C. Jorling, New York State's Environmental Conservation Commissioner.
Perhaps the greatest test of regionalism involve tax policy. New York City's Finance Commissioner, Carol O'Cleireacain, feels that she is working at a distinct disadvantage. The city's economic base covers at least 10 counties in 3 states. Yet despite the benefits that businesses and residents in those states derive from New York City, either directly or indirectly, Ms. O'Cleireacain has little authority to tax them. On the contrary, companies and individuals in New York City always have the constant option of moving from the city to flee its taxes.
"There are real border-issue problems here," she said. "If you were in Chicago, you'd only have to go to two neighboring counties, and they're in the same state."
The model for tax revenue-sharing is Minneapolis and St. Paul in Minnesota, where the concept was first introduced in the early 1970's. It was seen as a way to combat flight by businesses and residents from the inner cities to the suburbs, by eliminating tax rate discrepancies among the various communities and allocating more revenues to poor urban areas despite their lack of high-income taxpayers. Since 1975, when the revenue-sharing plan began, governments in the Twin Cities area -- seven counties, all told -- have been putting part of their property-tax revenues into a pool and distributing them according to population and need.
Of course, the seven counties that undertook this unusual policy are all within one state. Ms. O'Cleireacain, the New York City finance chief, believes that such regional cooperation is unlikely to occur in the New York area, pointing out that the city could not even get its own State Legislature to accept an increase in the city's 0.45 percent commuter tax on wages, which is one of the lowest in the country.
And Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, has proposed that the three states consider a regional gasoline tax, which would raise revenues for infrastructure projects without creating disparities that one state or another could try to exploit for its own advantage.
"Fiscal problems do not stop at the New York City line," he warned in a speech in late May.
Mr. Vallone has proposed that greater emphasis be placed on regional planning, with some areas in the region encouraged to specialize in making themselves more attractive to manufacturers, for instance, and others focused on doing the same for, say, the computer industry or telecommunications. "We need to think more about what unites us rather than what divides us," he said.

HEADLINE: Room for Differences;
Amid Accord Over Tactical Nuclear Arms, Less Progress to Cut Long-Range Weapons

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
The American and Soviet arms control initiatives have left the superpowers in agreement on eliminating their battlefield nuclear weapons, but the two sides still have major differences about how to cut their long-range, intercontinental nuclear arms.
In responding to President Bush's arms control initiative, the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said he would match the American move to destroy or withdraw from service most tactical nuclear weapons on land and at sea. 
 And in what might be an important reversal of Moscow's adamant opposition to anti-missile defenses, Mr. Gorbachev was surprisingly warm to President Bush's proposal to discuss the deployment of limited defenses.
But on strategic arms -- the intercontinental missiles and bombers that make up the heart of each side's nuclear deterrent -- Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush are, for the most part, still talking past each other.
Put simply, Mr. Gorbachev's agenda is deep cuts in long-range nuclear arms, a proposal that is likely to have considerable appeal on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers see arms control as a way to pare military spending.
In contrast, the Bush Administration has argued that the important thing is not to make reductions in strategic arms for their own sake, but to ban one category of weapons: land-based missiles with more than one warhead.
 
Room for Compromise
 Such a step would reduce each side's ability to carry out a first strike, but it would have a larger impact on Moscow, since land-based missiles are its strong suit in strategic forces. The proposed ban is the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's plan on strategic arms, but it was pointedly ignored by Mr. Gorbachev. While the Soviet President announced a variety of steps to halt the strategic arms race, he did not foreclose the option of building new multi-warhead land-based missiles.
Administration officials said that they expected Mr. Bush's sweeping initiative to prompt Mr. Gorbachev to propose more drastic cuts and that a compromise might ultimately be fashioned between the two approaches.
"There is clearly a different emphasis in their plan, but the two views are not necessarily at odds with each other," a senior Administration official said. "My sense is that based on their overall response on tactical weapons and on defenses, there is reason to think we have got beyond the comparative advantage approach of the past, where everything was looked at in terms of who got the edge over the other side," the official added.
 
More Talks Needed?
 But melding the two approaches would appear to require detailed, and perhaps protracted, negotiation, a process President Bush hoped to avoid when he announced his arms control initiative on Sept. 27. The differences on strategic forces should not diminish the significance of the convergence in the superpower arms control initiatives on tactical weapons, the main focus of concern for the Bush Administration.
In a change of the United States' traditional arms control priorities, President Bush labeled most tactical, or battlefield, nuclear weapons dangerous and obsolete and moved to eliminate them. This reflects a worry that some of the thousands of tactical nuclear weapons that are widely dispersed throughout the Soviet Union might fall into the wrong hands as Soviet central authority is reduced.
Mr. Gorbachev's move on tactical nuclear weapons is just about everything Mr. Bush could have hoped for. Mr. Gorbachev pledged to eliminate all nuclear artillery shells, nuclear mines and nuclear warheads for tactical surface-to-surface missiles. Washington would have preferred that Mr. Gorbachev also agree to destroy all nuclear warheads for Soviet anti-aircraft missiles, instead of keeping some in storage. But that is a small point and may reflect Moscow's disapproval of NATO's plans to keep an arsenal of nuclear bombs in Europe.
Mr. Gorbachev also agreed to match Mr. Bush's decision to remove all tactical nuclear weapons from ships and submarines. The Soviet President suggested that all of these weapons be destroyed instead of keeping some in storage, as Mr. Bush proposed. But Mr. Gorbachev was careful not to make this a condition for carrying out Mr. Bush's plan. The Pentagon wants to keep its nuclear-tipped sea-launched cruise missiles in storage, as a hedge against Soviet cheating and a deterioration of American-Soviet relations.
The Soviet response on anti-missile missiles has also encouraged Administration officials, who are accustomed to long Soviet diatribes against American plans to erect a "Star Wars" anti-missile defense. In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Gorbachev said that Moscow was prepared to consider American proposals on non-nuclear anti-missile systems and suggested that the two sides consider developing joint space-based and land-based systems to warn of a missile attack.
Talking about missile defenses and deploying them are two different things, and it is possible that Moscow is looking for a polite way to turn down Washington at a time when the Soviet Union has become increasingly dependent on the West for economic support. But it is also possible that Moscow has rethought its position as "Star Wars" has shrunk from Ronald Reagan's vision of a strategic umbrella designed to nullify the Soviet deterrent to the Bush Administration's concept of a limited system intended to protect against accidental launches of missiles and potential missile threats from third world countries.
 
Concerns on Early Warning
 Another Soviet consideration may be that its network of large early-warning radars on the periphery of its territory may be made less effective by a partial breakup of the Soviet Union, Administration officials said. Concern over the degradation of the network, some American officials say, may have prompted the new Soviet interest in sharing early-warning information and in discussing missile defenses.
From the Pentagon perspective, nuclear testing does not look like a promising area for bold new steps in arms control. Mr. Gorbachev's announcement of a one-year moratorium on testing comes as the number of American nuclear tests has declined for budgetary reasons. Nonetheless, Pentagon officials insist that testing is needed to insure the safety and reliability of old weapons and to develop new ones.
But the Pentagon is not the only audience. Congress, of course, will have the last word on "Star Wars" spending, funds for nuclear tests and the costly modernization of the American long-range nuclear forces. But the Soviet Union's arms cuts, its proposals for further reductions in strategic weapons and its interest in or opposition to anti-missile defense will influence the Congressional debate on the future of the American arsenal.

HEADLINE: Gates's Task: Restoring Confidence and Purpose

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Robert M. Gates appears close to winning a grueling fight this week to head the Central Intelligence Agency, but the battle has left both the man and the organization weakened, and the rush of history in the Soviet Union and elsewhere threatens to diminish them further.
The C.I.A. was a more vital place only last May, when Mr. Gates was nominated to become Director of Central Intelligence. Months later, he stands to inherit an organization whose primary purpose is vanishing, whose innermost conflicts have been aired for three weeks, and whose worst excesses under the former Director, William J. Casey, he has come, rightly or wrongly, to symbolize. 
 Within the agency that he served for 20 years, opinions of Mr. Gates are deeply divided, public testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence demonstrated last week.
And if confirmed, Mr. Gates would have to shoulder the responsibility of healing and rebuilding an agency at perhaps the most wrenching hour in its 44-year history.
 
The Romance Is Gone
 The Central Intelligence Agency still commands an important role in national security, and most experts call it more responsible, professional and effective than ever before. But its image is suffering.
Gone forever is the romantic notion of a dashing, omniscient, slightly roguish vanguard in the war against Communism. The war is over and the C.I.A. has been demystified, accused of sleeping at the switch of history and pummeled almost weekly by assaults on its purpose and its credibility.
The demise of Soviet Communism in August all but obliterated the agency's primary mission of tracking Moscow's nuclear and conventional military movements. Its other major duty, insuring that Moscow is complying with arms-control treaties, lost some of its importance with President Bush's nuclear-weapons initiative in September and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's response on Saturday.
This month, new indictments in the criminal investigation of the Iran-contra affair are widely expected to involve former agency officials and resurrect old questions about the honesty and integrity of the C.I.A.'s clandestine operators during the Reagan years.
Mr. Gates's confirmation hearings touched all those exposed nerves. Then they laid bare doubts about the quality and objectivity of the intelligence analyses that the agency supplies to the White House and Congress, and on which major policy decisions are sometimes based.
The agency has survived criticism many times before. Congressional hearings in 1976 exposed what officials then called "the skeletons" -- botched assassination plots, domestic break-ins and wiretaps against American citizens. That devastated the C.I.A.'s clandestine service. It rebounded under Mr. Casey and his successor, William H. Webster, with record budget increases, renewed Congressional support and largely successful operations against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
But the sweep and speed of this autumn's developments have prompted accusations that the C.I.A. failed to predict the political collapse of the century and the rise of third-world threats like Iraq.
Even some Government officials who work closely with the agency admit to a growing conviction that the glory days of spying and covert operations are past.
"Intelligence is particularly important when you're dealing with forbidden countries," one senior official in the Reagan and Bush administrations said in an interview. "The comparative advantage of the intelligence community is going to go down, because more and more of the world is open."
Even Mr. Gates admits to a share of botched predictions. On Friday, he said the agency's most painful recent failures included flawed assessments of Iraq's thirst for military conquest, the full depth of the Soviet Union's economic troubles and the likelihood in 1982 that Israel would invade Lebanon.
But he argues, and many experts agree, that current suggestions that the C.I.A. simply overlooked the death throes of Communism are unwarranted. Although the agency did understate the crisis, the drift of Soviet politics and the likelihood of an upheaval in Eastern Europe were clear to analysts years before they climaxed in the late 1980's.
While the assertions sting, C.I.A. officials insist that their morale is high and that there is no shortage of espionage work to be done. What is missing, and has been since the first cracks in Communism's facade appeared in 1989, is a sense of purpose.
"We set up an intelligence apparatus in the 1940's for a specific purpose, to monitor a military and political challenge from the Soviet Union, a closed society," said one expert, a former intelligence official who advised the Government on espionage issues in the Gulf war. "It required us to stretch, to innovate, to do things we hadn't been capable of doing and to think in new ways. And we did it very well.
"When we were planning to meet this challenge, our assumption was that it would come in the form of war. But it didn't; it came in the form of peace. And we are basically unprepared to deal with it."
 
Agency's New Purpose
 Mr. Gates argued last week, and others agree, that the agency still has a purpose. It will now be freer to address concerns about rising military powers such as China and India and emerging security threats like nuclear proliferation, drug trafficking and foreign spying on American business and science.
Mr. Gates has said that his first order of business would be to prepare a new list of intelligence priorities for the next 15 years and then rebuild the C.I.A. around them.
"What's interesting now is to watch the shift from East-West conflict to North-South issues," one senior Administration intelligence official said in an interview. "Look at narcotics: The imagery technology" -- the use of satellite photographs -- "is the same as for spotting a Soviet missile silo. Our collection on the economic and social milieu in which drug trafficking survives, our analyses of trafficking organizations, are all on the same level that we use when analyze the enemy order of battle."
Mr. Gates's most urgent tasks, however, may be to rebuild confidence in the C.I.A. and to restore the image of integrity that Mr. Webster brought to the agency and which Mr. Gates's own confirmation hearings have damaged.
 
Obstacles Ahead
 He faces obstacles on several fronts. "Whatever his ability, his nomination was a terrible political judgment for Bush," said one official, in a comment typical of judgments about Mr. Gates's liabilities. "Casey's name still carries such a taint that it's difficult to believe that the President would nominate someone so closely associated with that era and expect it to sail through."
The same is true within the C.I.A., where Mr. Gates would begin with several black marks. His difficulties with the agency's intelligence analysts are now a matter of record. He may fare little better with the C.I.A.'s other major unit, its clandestine operations division, which has always viewed intelligence analysts with disdain. The first career analyst to be nominated to head the C.I.A., Mr. Gates is known for his dislike of covert actions.
Mr. Gates has already learned how closely his potential subordinates are watching his moves. After having made casual remarks about the reduced demand for analysis of Soviet conventional forces, he danced around the issue on Friday. "I have to be careful here. I got a call last night," he said."Now everybody in the theater forces division at C.I.A. is worried they're going to lose their jobs."

HEADLINE: Rocky Point Journal;
Students Are Sidelined By High Cost of Sports

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCKY POINT, L.I., Oct. 3

 BODY:
The soccer players are the lucky athletes at Rocky Point High School this fall. They still have teams -- even if their parents have to pay up to $340 a season so they can play.
But 200 other athletes are on the sidelines, victims of a nasty budget fight that has disrupted after-school routines for hundreds of students and has polarized this blue-collar Suffolk County community that was once generous with money for schools and sports. 
 "You have parents not talking to teachers, and relatives not talking to relatives," said Joe Spallina, a party store owner who paid $1,100 so his three teen-age sons could play soccer. "People are being belittled at board meetings. Friendships are breaking up."
The split occurred when voters here rejected the $25.4 million school budget in May and again last month because it included a 28.4 percent property tax increase, about $680 on the average assessed home. The vote meant the loss for now of the high school's yearbook, newspaper, drama club, math team, 220-member marching band, about three-dozen after-school clubs and much of the school bus system used by many of the Rocky Point School District's 2,600 pupils.
In past years, residents say, the school budget raised property taxes by 6 or 7 percent a year, which they were willing to pay. But with property taxes ranging from $3,500 to $5,000 a year and a deepening recession, residents were unwilling to support the new budget. Anti-budget posters popped up for the first time in recent memory on telephone poles. Foes staged rallies in parking lots of the mini-malls. Shouting matches erupted at Board of Education meetings.
"These aren't normal times -- 300 homes are for sale here," said Stephen Romano, the 38-year-old head of the main opposition group, Cease, which stands for Citizens for Economically Affordable Sound Education. "Guys are taking wage cuts, people are losing their jobs, taxes are ruining property values."
The Rocky Point School Superintendent, Dr. Ray V. Kwak, said the increase was necessary because New York State reduced education aid to Rocky Point by $1.6 million, to $10.8 million. After residents rejected the school budget, Dr. Kwak said, the school board decided to cut after-school programs, including salaries for coaches, placing the costs directly on those who participate.
To provide enough money for the sports programs and other after-school activities, Cease asked coaches and advisers to volunteer their time and appealed to teachers to give back half of their 8 percent pay increase for this year. Both refused, said Mr. Romano, whose group contends that other cuts could have been made in the budget.
"They haven't changed one thing one iota," Mr. Romano said. "They're still not listening to us. I don't know how they can be so insulated. We'll have to continue to hound them."
The fallout from the budget fight seemed most evident at Pizza Times, the after-school hangout near the high school. Many idle athletes in street clothes lingered about, while a few of the 105 boys and girls playing soccer grabbed snacks before games.
One victim of the budget defeat, a 10th-grade girl, said her parents could not afford the money for her to play soccer. "Now I just hang out or go to the handball courts and watch or go home and do my homework," she said. "We shouldn't have to pay for our sport if we want to play it."
A ninth-grade boy wanted to play soccer this fall and lacrosse in the spring. "But we'd have to pay nearly $1,000," he said. "So my parents said, 'Pick a sport.' I picked lacrosse."
Some residents worry about the stigma "pay to play" poses for the less affluent student-athlete.
"I don't want to see it perpetuated," said the high school athletic director, Dennis Desmond. "It becomes elitist, and only the best-off can play."
Although state education policy bars school boards from requiring students to pay fees for extracurricular programs -- on the theory that public education is free -- the practice is commonplace when voters reject school budgets.
Parents in school districts that cut extracurricular activites often skirt the state ban on such fees by collecting money and "donating" it to a high school. But this fall the costs per athlete have become too high for many parents here since the school board has refused to pay coaches' salaries. For instance, parents would have had to pay $610 for their child to play tennis, $400 for field hockey and $275 to run cross-country.
Pro-budget residents have gathered enough signatures on petitions to force a new vote on restoring $383,613 for winter and spring sports and all other extracurricular programs and $521,416 for the bus system. The vote will be on Wednesday.
Jim Colaneri, 60, said he would vote for both. But he said he wished that state law did not limit his voting options.
"What I'm really against is the overloading of administrators," Mr. Colaneri said. "Dump some of those guys with big salaries and you can pay for sports and buses."
Gene Waldman, 73, disagreed. "We're in a recession," he said. "Let the kids be like kids in Japan -- concentrate more on education and cut some of the sports out."

HEADLINE: Ghost of Reykjavik;
Soviets Are Not Just Shedding Arms, But an Emblem of Superpower Status

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Reading his response to President Bush's arms initiative on Saturday, Mikhail S. Gorbachev seemed unusually terse and solemn. The reason, perhaps, was that he was presiding not only over the dismantling of nuclear weapons, but also of his superpower.
It was, after all, Soviet nuclear arms that had confirmed the nation as a superpower and backed its claim to parity with the United States at the helm of world affairs. 
 The grand arms-control deals were always the glory of the Kremlin leaders. Sitting alongside an American President to sign pacts limiting strategic arms or issuing initiatives that transfixed the world, a Soviet leader was at the peak of power and influence.
It was no different for Mr. Gorbachev, and he tried bravely in his speech to reclaim some of that glory, suggesting perhaps one more summit meeting with President Bush and declaring that matched reductions really were descendants of the pioneering disarmament process started at the meeting with Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik back in 1986, at the glorious dawn of perestroika.
 
From Strength to Weakness
 Maybe the parallel reductions in tactical weapons announced by Mr. Bush a week ago and Mr. Gorbachev on Saturday night did derive from those earlier efforts, but in a way far different from whatever Mr. Gorbachev may have foreseen or wished.
The Reykjavik summit meeting, like those before and after it, was a meeting of the undisputed leaders of two indisputably great powers. The long and complex negotiations required to control or reduce nuclear arsenals in those days testified to the respect and fear each had for the other.
Yet the very processes Mr. Gorbachev set loose back in 1986 finally led to the abortive coup in August that sealed the collapse of Communism and the dismemberment of the old empire.
So this time, the driving force behind Mr. Bush's initiative was Soviet weakness, not strength. He could afford to withdraw most American tactical weapons from Europe not because of any elaborate arrangement with the Kremlin, but because a Soviet invasion of Europe was now implausible.
Moreover, Mr. Bush's readiness to act unilaterally was not a measure of trust in a Soviet land now free of Communists, but a measure of concern over a disintegrating superpower in which it was now unclear who really was in charge of nuclear weapons, or who would own them tomorrow.
And rather than negotiate, the Americans thought it was safer and simpler to lead by example, reckoning that the bankrupt remnants of the Soviet empire would have little choice but to follow suit.
This is not to say that the Soviet Union stands to lose its nuclear muscle. Mr. Gorbachev's pledge to reduce strategic warheads to 5,000 within seven years demonstrates that this is still a country with a vast and deadly arsenal that the world would long have to take into account.
Yet for the Soviets, that force is now more a burden than a shield, swallowing precious resources without yielding any discernible clout. In cutting armies and arsenals, Mr. Gorbachev was searching less for military security than for economic survival.
Some of Mr. Gorbachev's counterproposals to the Americans seemed only to underscore his plight. His declaration of a moratorium on nuclear tests, formerly a powerful propaganda weapon in Moscow's "peace campaign," reflected the fact that the armed forces have nowhere to test their weapons just now, when both the Russian federated republic and Kazakhstan oppose tests on their soil.
Mr. Gorbachev was also compelled to concede that he was no longer the paramount chief of his empire, stating at the outset of his address that the Russian republic's president, Boris N. Yeltsin, and the leaders of other republics had endorsed his action.
 
A Bold Response
 Yet none of that really detracted from the boldness or scope of Mr. Gorbachev's response. The world had never before experienced the dismantling of a nuclear superpower, and the fact that it was being undertaken peacefully, almost amicably, was ultimately a tribute to Mr. Gorbachev.
President Bush deserved credit as well. If the bankruptcy and breakup of their empire left the Soviets little choice but to radically reduce their armed might, Mr. Bush's initiative at least offered them a way to do it with dignity and without undue fear for their security.
And if Mr. Gorbachev was no longer in full control, the matching reductions in arms at least showed him to be the man with whom the West still has to deal. There was something almost wistful in Mr. Gorbachev's surprise call for a new summit with Mr. Bush -- "Obviously, the question also arises of a new Soviet-American summit meeting" -- as if a touch of the old bravado could still recoup the old glory.

4th Generation Tries to Be Last In Welfare Chain

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
I told him, 'Look at you -- you was 18 when my mother got pregnant. How are you going to get on my case about having a baby?' It's like life repeats itself, you know?
Leticia C. will be 25 years old next month. She is a high school dropout, former crack addict and fourth generation teen-age mother. 
 She is also on welfare, like more than one in eight New York City residents. Statewide, relief rolls have hit a high; in New Jersey and Connecticut, they are growing again. Sometime soon, the city's welfare population is likely to surpass one million for the first time in 15 years. A million people standing in line could form an unbroken chain from New York to Washington.
I know he was very happy he had a baby, a little boy, but still he was wanting to do his own thing. He didn't want to grow up and face his responsibility.
Urban analysts once calculated the "tipping point" at which whites would flee an increasingly black and Hispanic school, neighborhood or city. But is there an economic tipping point, too -- at which there are not enough taxpayers of any racial or ethnic group left in a city to support the growing number of dependents?
All that New York City's one millionth welfare recipient can hope to win is sympathy. Even that, like hope itself, is becoming scarcer.
My father's mother had seven kids of her own. And she's raising another seven, cause her oldest daughter died and she had four daughters. And her other daughter's not doing so hot now from drugs either. So that makes another three. And her youngest son, Drake, her baby, he's in prison . . . They gave him 3 to 7 years about three years ago. And he's got two daughters now, cause he got married in jail. And his wife is having another baby. And they've broke up.
Each of Leticia's three children had a different father. She and her progenitors are profiled in "Before Their Time: Four Generations of Teen-Age Mothers" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), a nonjudgmental oral history by Joelle Sander, the associate director of continuing education at Sarah Lawrence College. When Mrs. Sander met them, Leticia (her real name) was 20 years old, her mother was 39, her grandmother was 63 and her great-grandmother was 83.
The recession has driven people to welfare, but the proportion of poor New Yorkers was rising even during the 1980's economic boom. If Leticia's testimony may be grist for some preconceptions about poverty, it is also evidence of why dependence has endured, what may shrink it, if only at the margins, and why a more ambitious commitment to do so may be beyond the capacity of any single city.
People make welfare seem so bad. I don't know why, but I don't feel it is. It's something to help you out for the time being until you're able to take care of yourself. It's true that there are some people who sit and wait for checks, who stay on welfare for years. But a lot of them do have children, and you can stay home until your child is six years old. Until your child goes to school and you can go to work. But I don't know how people can just live on welfare. They have to be getting money in somehow. They're doing something illegal or something, cause it's just not enough.
Lawrence Mead, a New York University political scientist, writes that job discrimination may be a lesser handicap than a broken family: "What matters for success is not whether your father was rich or poor but whether you had a father at all." Senator Daniel P. Moynihan estimates that five in six black and Hispanic children born in 1980 will be on welfare by age 20.
That night I saw Gavin, who is the father. His whole attitude changed. At the beginning of all this, he said, 'If it's my child, I'll help you pay for stuff.' But now he just said: 'You wanted a child. You kept her. Now it's your child.'
A new study by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation concludes that Ohio's Learning, Earning and Parenting program shows promise and potential savings. It focuses on teen-age parents, the group most likely to remain on welfare. It couples child care with financial incentives: For attending school regularly, a teen-ager who heads a household and has one child gets a $62 monthly bonus -- raising her welfare grant to $336. With too many unexcused absences, the grant can be cut to $212.
It's like what I tell Terry now. I say, 'I want to raise you to be a man that I would want to marry. Kindhearted. Understanding. Someone who would sympathize.' . . . He'd be able to compromise. Not get everything he wants. But I'm weird. I want a whole lot in a little bit of time.
Leticia is studying for a high school equivalency diploma again. She married a security guard and is seeking a job as a school crossing guard. In July, 7-year-old Terry was killed in an automobile accident. Leticia, who regained custody of her 4-year-old daughter after enrolling in a drug-treatment program, lives in Harlem with her husband. They have a 1-year-old daughter.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Plays Its Tax Card;
Hartford Fury Offers Big Payoffs and Risks

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 6

 BODY:
They gathered by the tens of thousands because they are enraged about the state's new income tax and mad about much else in Connecticut today.
The question they left behind for the Republicans, who organized what may have been the largest and angriest protest in modern state history, is whether members of Connecticut's all-but-perpetual minority party can ride the tax-repeal tiger they helped create, or whether they will be gobbled up too, along with every other politician. 
 Repeal leaders acknowledged today that the movement had taken on a life of its own and would probably go where it wished despite its handlers. The protesters are so numerous -- the police estimated that more than 1 percent of the state's population of 3.3 million jammed the Capitol lawn on Saturday -- and are angry about so many things, from working-class resentment toward the wealthy to frustration about the economy, that the ultimate expression of their anger is difficult to predict.
And there is another danger for the Republicans: What happens if the repeal effort succeeds?
 
Veto Fight Looms
 Lawmakers in both parties say a bipartisan majority in the legislature now stands ready to repeal the new income tax at a special session this month or next. But since Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has already said he will veto a repeal bill, regardless of the public mood, final victory or defeat for the repeal effort will really be determined by the vote to override that veto, which requires a two-thirds majority.
For the Republican leaders, the movement creates a predicament. If they win and the tax law is rescinded, the burden will be on them to come up with a budget that replaces nearly $1.5 billion in new income-tax revenues, probably through some unpopular combination of deep spending cuts and steep increases in other taxes, especially the sales tax.
Taxes were increased by $1.2 billion altogether under the new law, by far the biggest increase in state history. The increases were coupled with spending cuts in many areas, and more than 3,700 state workers are in line to be laid off even with the new revenues. Republican leaders say their alternative plan, which has not been fully worked out, will feature deeper spending cuts -- and possibly more layoffs -- than any budget yet contemplated.
If repeal succeeds, the Republicans will also lose what many politicians feel could be a devastating issue against the majority Democrats in the next statewide elections in 1992, when every member of the General Assembly is up for re-election and the public anger about the income tax could be tapped at the polling booths. Democrats in the General Assembly produced the majority of votes for the income tax.
 
Class Consciousness
 Until the passage of the income tax, the sentiments of the mainly middle- and working-class people represented at the rally had been more ably captured and articulated by Democrats in recent years -- notably by former Gov. William A. O'Neill, who squelched even the consideration of a wage tax. And many of the tirades against Mr. Weicker on Saturday centered on the fact that he is a rich man who protesters said did not understand middle-class concerns -- another mood that Democrats have tapped to their advantage.
But the crowd that seemed so ripe for the picking on Saturday could turn its rage on Republicans if voters come to believe that Republican orchestration of the repeal drive was just a cynical calculation, designed to fail but to promote party interests.
Repeal leaders said today that they realized the risks. They said that in self-defense they stood ready to openly attack any within their own ranks who might be considered less than zealous.
 
Two Missing Votes
 There was already evidence that members might soon be at each other's throats. A former Republican State Senator, Thomas Scott, who organized the rally and gave its keynote speech attacking the "craven deals in the gutter" that he said were used to ram the tax through the Legislature, has publicly questioned the commitment of the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, Edward C. Krawiecki Jr.
Mr. Krawiecki, a leading opponent of the income tax, allowed two of his party's members to go home on the day the tax was passed in August, thus removing two potentially pivotal "no" votes, and the decision has haunted him since. One of the lawmakers who missed the vote, Representative Robert J. Bogue, addressed the rally on Saturday and said in effect that he wouldn't get fooled again.
Mr. Krawiecki dismisses such talk. He said today that he knew of no Republicans who might secretly want repeal to fail so the issue could be used against the Democrats next year.
"I don't think it's the kind of an issue you can play games with," Mr. Krawiecki said. "The feelings run entirely too deep."
Both he and Mr. Scott said they believed the public anger against the income tax was so visceral that any alternative budget, almost regardless of how it was put together, would be more popular than the new a 4.5 percent flat-rate income tax.
Another unsettled question for the Republican Party is how successful its members will be in distancing themselves in voters' minds from Mr. Weicker, a third-party independent governor who proposed the tax early this year as the only alternative that would stimulate the economy and balance the budget. For more than 20 years, including three terms in the United States Senate, Mr. Weicker was one of the highest-profile Republicans in the state.
Party lines were further blurred during the budget deadlock as every alternative rose or fell on bipartisan votes.
The only consistent theme in the long battle since an income tax was first proposed has been discontent. United States Representative Gary A. Franks, a Republican from Waterbury, brought roars when he reminded protesters of Mr. Weicker's statement during last year's campaign for governor that imposing an income tax during a recession would be like pouring gasoline on a fire. He paused and looked out over the bristling sea of signs.
"Well, here's the fire!" he shouted.

HEADLINE: For 200 in the Tenzer Family, Grandpa's Circle Is Unbroken

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
In 1883, a 14-year-old youth named Michael Tenzer arrived in New York City from Europe with only $4 in his pocket and, even worse, not a scrap of family.
He soon made up for both, most strikingly with a clan of Biblical proportions, begetting seven children who produced 15 grandchildren, 32 great-grandchildren, and a fifth generation that now numbers 29. 
 What makes his story different from those of most other immigrant Americans is that his more than 200 descendants and other relatives have managed to stay in touch, even as they have scattered across much of America. They have done so through a little known but historically significant institution called the family circle or association, a phenomenon that began in the mid-19th century as families of the early American settlers found themselves dispersing ever westward.
 
Formality, Burials and Salami
 Experts say there are hundreds of these associations still functioning. Cutting across many ethnic groups, they hold regular meetings with parliamentary formality at which they assist faltering relatives, resolve family crises, arrange burial plots, trace clan history, and, in the case of Mr. Tenzer's family, dispense charity.
During World War II, for example, the Tenzers wrapped packages of salami and candy to send their sons fighting overseas, and they rescued dozens of relatives in Poland from the Nazis.
At a time when every day brings startling news of families sundered by violence and abuse, when nuclear families are dwindling almost as fast as nuclear weapons, the Michael Tenzer Family Circle has clung together. They have done so in a way that recalls a time when families had their social life, not in front of a television set or at nightclubs, but simply with each other.
So yesterday, 75 Tenzer relatives gathered in a midtown Manhattan kosher restaurant, Lou G. Siegel's, to celebrate the family circle's 65th anniversary and their enduring affection for one another.
"Not only do we have relatives, but our relatives are our very good friends," said Bernard Tenzer, a 70-year-old grandson of Michael.
Fred Wilson, a fourth-generation cousin, said: "You know your roots; you know the people who make up your family. "If you need help you know they're there."
As they sang the American and Israeli national anthems and lunched on stuffed cabbage and matzoh ball soup, they shared stories about the clan's stern but tender patriarch and the gentle matriarch, Rose. They marveled again at how vigorous the three surviving children, Eva Pion, 96, Estelle Schiff, 89, and Herbert Tenzer, 86, continue to be.
They remembered the Passover seders when 50 relatives, living within blocks of each other in Crown Heights and Flatbush, would crowd into a Brooklyn apartment, and a scorching glance from Grandpa Michael would silence all mischief.
They remembered how Grandpa would teach them to count "onezer, twozer, threezer" all the way to "tenzer," the number that always drew delighted cheers. They remembered how Grandma Rose would bake challahs -- braided Sabbath loaves -- for each of her children every week and insist they go to her house to pick them up as another pretext to see them.
"There wasn't a weekend we didn't go to Grandpa's and Grandma's," said Bernard Tenzer. "Those brothers and sisters were inseparable. It was almost incestuous. All of their social life was in each other's houses."
 
Virtues and Eccentricities
 The family stories, capturing the virtues and eccentricities of their relatives, have served to thicken the family bond, even if some have been considerably embroidered with time.
The monthly family circle meetings were carried out with near-Congressional protocol. There was a salute to the American flag and the reading of minutes. There were officers, including a sergeant-at-arms who disciplined unruly children. There were dues -- at first $5, now $10 -- that along with bequests and funds raised through parties added up to thousands of dollars, which was dispensed to organizations like the Jewish National Fund and Fight for Sight. And there was a periodic newsletter, the Standard Bearer, currently edited by Estelle Schiff, that kept everyone informed about weddings, illnesses and deaths.
With nourishment from Aunt Eva's and Aunt Estelle's sandwiches of egg salad and tuna salad, there were also games of pinochle and gin rummy, funny hat parties and shows produced by the children, who met separately in a family "junior league."
"It was to make sure that the children inherited the sense of family," said Bernard's wife, Shelley Kitzes Tenzer. "Naturally, it doesn't happen. You have to get together and do things as a family."
 
A Circle for Vanderbilts
 Mrs. Tenzer comes from a family circle herself. Indeed, there are hundreds of family circles, says Harry Macy, information director for the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, including one for the descendants of Cornelius Vanderbilt, the railroad magnate. A family circle was a chief motif in the recent film "Avalon," about an immigrant clan.
"I think it helps present-day descendants know where they came from and what their connection is to this country," Mr. Macy said. "So many Americans live an essentially rootless existence."
Bernard Tenzer, who was president of his circle for 16 years, suggested that his family's experience could serve as a model for the current wave of immigrants from Latin America and Asia, though some groups like the Chinese have long sustained such associations here.
"For family units to be tied together they have to work at it," he said.
 
Humble Origins in Poland
 Many active family circles have origins as humble as that of Michael Tenzer's. A sturdily built man with penetrating eyes, who was born missing a left ear, he was born in the Polish region of Galicia that was then under Austrian rule. Some relatives claim he fled to the United States to escape the draft; others say it was to elude rabbinical school. One version says he left a sealed note to his Orthodox Jewish parents on a Friday before sundown because he knew they could not open the note until after the Sabbath.
In this country, his daughter Eva recalls, he peddled bobby pins, needles and combs from a back pack, climbing flights of stairs to earn pennies to buy a herring and a piece of bread. He met Rose because she was the daughter of a family with whom he roomed.
Soon Michael and Rose were able to open a small candy stand, and it eventually burgeoned into a prosperous wholesale candy business run out of a tenement at 191 Broome Street on the Lower East Side. Family legend has it that Michael Tenzer once loaned Milton Hershey $1,000 to start making chocolate bars. But the family also knows that Michael eventually lost much of his fortune.
The family circle was born at Eva Tenzer Pion's 10th wedding anniversary in 1927, which she celebrated, of course, with her entire family.
 
Charity, Not Just Lunch
 "We decided it was such a lovely gathering that we ought to have a family circle," Eva Pion remembered.
Michael Tenzer had always emphasized charity. He was a founder of a Lower East Side synagogue, Chasam Sopher, and Yeshiva Talmud Torah of Crown Heights, and, his children say, as the landlord of six buildings he deliberately slipped part of the rents back so tenants could buy food. So the Tenzer children decided charity would be the circle's mission.
"We weren't wasting our time just getting together and having lunch or dinner," Eva Pion said.
The family ethos stuck. At 96, Eva Pion is a volunteer clerk at the library of the Peninsula Hospital Center in Far Rockaway. Herbert Tenzer, who was a Congressman from Long Island, has a been a leading philanthropist for institutions like Yeshiva University.
The numbers of circle meetings, held in recent years at the America-Israel Friendship League in midtown Manhattan, have dwindled from monthly to three or four a year as more members, heeding the call of marriage or career, have settled in places like Wisconsin and Alaska. Robert S. Herbst, a 33-year-old Manhattan lawyer who is a fourth-generation cousin, points out that with the tribe's growing affluence and education, "we don't need the support of family because people are making it on their own."
And Eva, who has a great-granddaughter at Brown University and a great-grandson at Vassar, lamented: "Unfortunately the younger generation is not as interested. They have the time, but they devote their time to other things."
But at the celebration yesterday, relatives like Mr. Herbst and Gloria Batkin Kahn, a Westchester psychologist, suggested that they would work to keep the circle going. Beyond necessity and economics, Ms. Kahn said, it's simply "good to have cousins and family around."
Mr. Herbst added: "I have my wife, my friends. I watch the Giants on Sunday. Life goes on without it. But it's a treat to have something like this."

HEADLINE: To Avoid Deficit, Michigan Ends Welfare to Some Adults

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 4

 BODY:
For Ruth Williams, a middle-age grandmother who says she has asthma, high blood pressure and phlebitis, the welfare check for $87.50 she received twice a month from the State of Michigan "was like a life raft."
"I'm poor, very poor" she said. "The check wasn't much, but it gave me a chance to feel like a human being." 
 On Tuesday, the checks stopped coming.
Faced with a budget deficit and hoping to end "welfare dependency," the State Legislature eliminated the general assistance welfare program for more than 80,000 adults who are so poor that they can typically have no more than a car worth $1,500.
 
Aid for Able-Bodied
 Most states have some form of general assistance welfare program for poor, able-bodied adults without children. Now Michigan, after years of providing some of the nation's broadest welfare coverage, has rescinded welfare benefits for such people, joining a small but growing number of states that deny them aid.
"We don't have the money to pay for everything anymore," said John Truscott, a spokesman for Gov. John Engler, a Republican. "And it's forcing us to make some very painful and difficult decisions."
It is a refrain that can be heard across the country. Next month, Maryland, faced with budget problems of its own, will also eliminate its general assistance program, cutting off payments to 24,000 adults.
Many recipients of general assistance, experts on welfare issues say, are the walking wounded of society. They fall through the cracks of other programs; either they are too young for Social Security or too healthy for disability. They are often homeless, and many have been in and out of mental institutions or drug treatment centers.
Typically, recipients are single men with poor educations and few job skills, the experts say. But in Michigan, 46 percent of the recipients were women, many of them divorced or widowed homemakers in their 40's and 50's.
 
'Program of Last Resort'
 As the economy darkens, many recipients are low-level workers, like Richard Burnell, 49 years old, a Detroit florist's assistant, who have lost their jobs and have exhausted unemployment benefits.
"A lot of people coming into welfare offices are people who have never been on aid before," said Julie Strawn of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a not-for-profit research organization in Washington. "They're not necessarily all people who fit public sterotypes. But I don't think the public really understands how important G.A. is as the program of last resort. There is nothing else for people when G.A. goes away. Nothing."
Governor Engler's Administration, which pressed for the elimination of the general assistance program, repeatedly uses the words "able-bodied" and "employable" to describe those who have been taken from the welfare rolls. But Mr. Truscott acknowledged that not all recipients fit into those categories; he said several thousand former aid recipients could start receiving checks again if they were determined by a doctor or psychiatrist to be physically or mentally unable to work. The state's average monthly payment for general assistance was $144 plus food stamps.
New Jersey's general assistance program provides a maximum income of $270 a month, said Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Human Services. If the recipient is employable, job searches and, in some cases, training are offered.
New York State's program, called home relief, provides up to $352 a month, said Patricia Smith, deputy commissioner for income support programs. If eligible, a person can also receive additional food stamps of about $100. Most can also receive medical benefits, she said.
 
No Programs in 6 States
 Before Michigan and Maryland eliminated their general assistance programs, the Federal Health and Human Services in 1990 listed six states that deny all benefits to single adults: Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, West Virginia and Louisiana. In the last year, several other states have debated reducing their welfare programs. Illinois and Ohio have either cut or limited their general assistance programs to reduce costs and to help balance state budgets. And in Massachusetts this spring, the Legislature overhauled its general relief program and significantly reduced its scope. Officials there are still haggling over the program's budget but it appears it will be reduced by nearly $60 million, to $160 million from $220 million.
Ending the program in Michigan is expected to save the state $240 million. In addition, the Legislature, in which Democrats control the House and Republicans the Senate, cut $260 million from other social service programs.
Saving money is only one motive for eliminating the general assistance program, which has long long been a target of conservatives. Mr. Truscott said the Governor hoped to end "welfare dependency" by forcing "thousands of able-bodied people to find work."
"The jobs are out there," he said. "They may be minimum wage, but most people will be able to find one. And if they work full time at just minimum wage they could make twice as much as they did on G.A."
Currently, there are more than 400,000 unemployed people in Michigan, a rate of 9.7 percent.
 
Adding to Those Seeking Work
 "The state has just increased the number of people looking for work by a fourth," said Sharon Parks of the Michigan League of Human Services in Lansing. "And this is during a recession when jobs are scarce. It's crazy."
The public perception of general assistance, Mrs. Parks said, is of welfare rolls filled with able-bodied people too lazy to work.
State Representative David Jaye, Republican of Shelby Township, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying: "The most important thing is we took $300 million out of welfare for single, healthy employable adults and said, 'Get a job or hit the road, Jack.' We can't afford it anymore. These people are going to have to go cold turkey."
Of the more than 80,000 Michigan residents who lost their benefits on Tuesday, only about half had completed high school. They come from all racial and ethnic backgrounds and from farms as well as cities. Forty percent are more than 40 years old. Nearly half live in Detroit but have limited access to transportation to travel to job-rich suburbs. Sixty-one percent have never worked, many of them newly widowed or divorced who did not work because their husbands did.
"To call these people employable when there are so many educated people unable to find a job is insane," said Ed Rowe, the pastor of Cass Community United Methodist Church. "It's a lie. The real reason this is happening is that the poor are powerless."
Down the street from the church, one door down from a plasma center where type AB negative blood, a relatively rare type, will fetch $15 to $20 a pint, Jessi Young, a former welfare recipient, stood in a dimly lit homeless shelter and watched the place fill up with men, women and children.
"You think it's crowded now?" he said. "Wait a couple of days. Then it'll be packed because of these cuts. We can spend a trillion dollars fighting a war in some third world country
Mr. Young, 40, dropped out of school after the 10th grade. He said he had a ruptured disc in his back from a work accident in 1973 and a steel plate in his left hip after he was shot by a stray bullet a few years ago.
"With my present-day education, I guess I could get a job distributing hand bills," he said. "Cutting grass, washing windows. This is a slow death."
Mr. Young and his family moved to Detroit from Mississippi when he was a baby. His father had a third-grade education but quickly found a job at the General Motors Corporation, where he stayed for 40 years.
"Those days are gone, long, long gone," Mr. Young said. "Those jobs are gone. Robots do that work now."
Evert Vermeer, director of social services in Kent County in western Michigan, said it was too early to judge the full impact of ending the general assistance program. He said more than half of the 90,000 recipients were "hirable, if there was anything out there for them to get."
"There isn't," he said from his Grand Rapids office.
On the streets of a dilapidated Detroit neighborhood, Cass Corridor, the other day, rumors were running fast about evictions from apartments and about former welfare recipients slitting their wrists to avoid becoming homeless again.
People say they are selling their foods stamps to pay telephone bills and rent. Others mumble about "doing whatever it takes to survive."
Shirley Johns, director of the Community Service and Referral Center in Lansing, recently told the A.P. the advice she gives to those left without food or shelter: "I tell them to commit a simple larceny. Especially if they're sick, I tell them to do that. I explain to them it's a roof over their head. It's free food, free medical treatment for their pneumonia."
As a drizzle fell over the city, Mrs. Williams and several other former recipients talked about "how we're ever going to survive without G.A."
"I'm going to pray," Mrs. Williams said. "I'm also going to fight back. I'm willing to go to jail over and over until we get treated right. G. A. was all we had to get by."
Joyce Pelcher, 62, said: "If I have to, I'll sell my food stamps to pay my rent. Then when I run out, I'll go to the mission to eat."
"No, you won't," Mrs. Williams said. "The missions are turning people away. The missions are closing, too."

That Championship Feeling!

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 6

 BODY:
As a hushed crowd sat primly in anticipation of the Southeastern Savoyards Light Opera Company's performance of "H.M.S. Pinafore" Saturday night, the music director, in white tie and tails, turned to the orchestra and raised not a baton, but a tomahawk.
In Atlanta, where gleeful crowds lined Peachtree Street this weekend exchanging Indian war chants and the Braves' signature "tomahawk chop" salute with passing cars, nothing is immune from the giddy euphoria set loose by the Atlanta Braves' unlikely ascent from perennial doormats to National League West champions. 
 But in addition to celebrating this journey from worst to first, which was completed Saturday afternoon when the Braves won and the Dodgers lost, Atlanta is in no small way celebrating itself. From Tara to tomahawks, from the prospect of the 1994 Super Bowl to that of the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta is reveling in its sense of itself as a city that's on a winning streak like that of no other place in the country.
"It seems like everything keeps happening here," Gary Laboda said this afternoon as he lounged in the back of his 1974 Chevrolet pickup truck, which was painted in Braves slogans and equipped with two plastic-foam tomahawks, before the Braves' regular-season finale, a loss to the Houston Astros. "All this money, fame and excitement has to be good for a city. It has to be real good."
Or, as John Sherman, a 21-year-old Georgia Tech student who joined a group of Saturday night revelers, many of them in headdresses and war paint, immodestly put it: "Atlanta is the center of the universe."
Truth to tell, the economy here is shaky, the crime rate is consistently among the nation's highest, and the bright image often masks one of the nation's poorest central cities.
But if, as the ad says, "Image Is Everything," Atlanta seems to have hit yet another home run in a remarkable two-year winning streak. The immediate cause of the most recent outbreak of fever was the Braves' feat of becoming the second team this century to go from the worst record in baseball one year to a division championship the next. The other team, the Minnesota Twins, also did it this year.
The Braves did it despite losing two of their best hitters, David Justice and Sid Bream, to injuries for most of the summer, and their leadoff man, Otis Nixon, for the season's last three weeks after he was suspended for drug use.
It was a feat sweetened by its coming at the expense of haughty and hated Los Angeles and accented by the euphoric support of fans starved for a winner. Even players seemed a bit taken aback by it all.
 
'Want It to Go On Forever'
 "It's hard to believe the season's over," second baseman Mark Lemke said as he listened to a packed house roaring in glee during batting practice on a crisp fall afternoon today. "This season has been so special, you want it to go on forever."
Much of the excitement is attributable to the travails of the long-suffering Braves, who have yet to win a post-season game in 26 seasons in Atlanta and went into the regular season with the worst record in baseball for that period. The combination of past futility and ever-more-elaborate tribal pageantry transformed baseball here from a game to an event.
"This has been incomparable; I've never seen anything like it," said John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager, who has received much of the credit for putting a winner together and who was general manager in Kansas City when the Royals twice went to the World Series in the 1980's. "The fans in Kansas City were great fans, I don't want to put them down, but I can't imagine any fans being more emotional or more demonstrative than the fans here have been this year."
 
Talk of the Town
 Atlanta has always had a particular interest in the national spotlight.
Last week, topic A was "Scarlett" fever, the excitement brought on by the publication of the best-selling sequel to "Gone With The Wind." The local news is still dominated by plans for the Olympics, and the city has also been chosen as host for the 1994 Super Bowl.
"It's very much a part of the whole booster ideal," said Dana White, an urban historian at Emory University. "Back in the 19th century when Atlanta was a city of a few thousand people, it was comparing itself with New York or Chicago, and it goes on from there. Atlanta has always had a history of setting a goal that seems unachievable and then managing to achieve it."
But White says that more relevant than the expectations of the past century is probably a history of entrepreneurial success dating back to the years after World War II. In that sense, the excitement of the last two years is mostly an extension of the progress made in that era.
 
Here Come the Tomahawks
 He notes that recent surveys had found a substantial degree of economic pessimism, which indicates that sports and cultural events can only go so far in shaping the public mood.
But for now, the main number that seems to matter in town is 8:39, Oct. 9. That's when the Braves will take on the Pirates in Game 1 of the National League playoffs in Pittsburgh.
Atlanta has never had a team go the World Series, the Super Bowl or the National Basketball Association finals. But for now, in a city where grown men find themselves doing a goofy tomahawk version of the hokeypokey, anything seems possible.
The most difficult thing may be holding on to a good war bonnet.
"I bought about 10 of them at Toys 'R' Us for $4," said John Fitts, a student at Georgia State University. "People keep grabbing them away. They see feathers and they go crazy."

BYLINE: By Joseph R. Biden; Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Mikhail Gorbachev, with Boris Yeltsin's backing, took only a week to match President Bush's cuts in nuclear arms and up the ante. We should not hesitate to raise the stakes even higher. Unlike poker, this is a game both sides can win.
For all President Bush's new thinking on short-range nuclear weapons, his proposal reflected a large dose of old thinking about intercontinental missiles and "Star Wars" -- and not enough thinking about a world order free of Armageddon arsenals and third-world nuclear threats. 
 The President said we should "dramatically shrink" the world's nuclear arsenals and "effectively discourage the spread" of nuclear arms. But this will require us to abandon policies to which the Administration still clings.
Having jettisoned tactical weapons as obsolete, the Bush team resists applying similar logic elsewhere. The current treaty permits each side 9,000 strategic warheads -- far more than most experts think deterrence requires. With Moscow ready to halve these levels, Washington can no longer spurn talk of radical cutbacks.
So far, the Administration has focused on an old priority -- "crisis stability" for rivals poised for mutual annihilation. It stresses cuts in land-based intercontinental missiles with multiple warheads, the area of Soviet strength. It claims exemption for sea-based missiles and bombers, including the extravagantly expensive B-2, which dominate the U.S. arsenal. It rejects a test ban as incompatible with the need for improving nuclear warheads. And it continues promoting the anti-missile defenses, which even in a cooperative climate are a barrier to cuts in offensive arms.
Why hasn't the President matched his revolutionary rhetoric with new strategic policies? Several reasons explain his reluctance:
Post-cold war defense cuts would eliminate jobs; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney spoke volumes last week when he inadvertently touted the B-2 as carrying a huge "payroll." The Pentagon is still geared to using nuclear weapons in war, despite the disappearance of the Soviet threat and the success of conventional power against Iraq. The cold war acclimated us to the perverse premise that superpower status depends on maintaining a capacity to eradicate civilization, even at the expense of American economic strength. Proponents of Star Wars have sold a beguiling technical fix to a new problem -- horrifying weapons wielded by irrational third-world despots -- that realistically can only be solved through collective economic and military containment.
These mind-sets must go if we are to spur deeper cuts in Soviet arms, revamp our budget and shape a new international security system.
How should we proceed with the Gorbachev-Yeltsin team?
First, the U.S. must make clear that all strategic arms, including submarine-launched missiles and missile defenses, are negotiable to the lowest level compatible with deterrence. To bypass military bureaucracies, we should appoint a joint commission of U.S. and Soviet experts to develop an answer to the question: how low can we safely go?
Second, we should involve the British, French and Chinese. A five-power conference should commit all to deep cuts, a ban on nuclear testing and producing new fissionable material and a U.N.-backed nonproliferation regime.
Third, we must build on the success of the nonproliferation treaty, which has worked but for a few rogue states like Iraq, North Korea and Libya. Global limits on ballistic missiles can supplement the treaty's constraints, and nuclear states such as India and Pakistan can be pressured to adhere. Rigorous U.N. enforcement would include severe economic sanctions and, where necessary, military action.
The key is China, which just pledged to join the nonproliferation treaty but has indiscriminately sold nuclear and missile technology. The test of President Bush's commitment will be his use of all available tools, including trade sanctions, to insure Beijing's cooperation.
When Mr. Gorbachev's launch-code briefcase was seized during the failed coup, one nuclear age ended and another began. In disassembling the Doomsday Machine, we can shape a containment policy directed against third-world nuclear dangers. It will take vision to lead the journey into this new nuclear age.

HEADLINE: Another Blow to Westinghouse

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
For the second time this year, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation has taken a major write-off as a result of real estate problems in its financial-services subsidiary. The company said yesterday that because of write-offs it had a net loss of $1.48 billion in the third quarter.
The company, based in Pittsburgh, also said it would eliminate 4,000 jobs from its work force of approximately 115,000. 
 Westinghouse's chairman, Paul E. Lego, termed the company's performance "disappointing." In an interview, Mr. Lego said the large amounts of real estate being sold at low prices by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency responsible for the savings and loan bailout, and tight credit conditions were forcing the company to sharply reduce the value of properties held by its credit subsidiary.
 
Writing Off $1.68 Billion
 The company said the write-off of $1.68 billion represented the reduction in value of its investments in real estate, leveraged buyouts and junk bonds. Earlier this year it cut the value of those investments by $975 million. The total value of the portfolio was listed at $22.03 billion at the end of 1990. In addition, Westinghouse took a write-off of $160 million to cover the cost of the job cutbacks.
Analysts said they had expected some kind of announcement, since the company had recently canceled a longstanding meeting with securities analysts. But some analysts said the size of the write-off had come as something of a shock.
"We have been surprised by the magnitude of the real estate depression," said Kemp Fuller Jr., who is with Baird, Patrick & Company. But he said the company had "put behind it as much as it is possible to put behind at this time."
In the interview, Mr Lego said: "We have not been able to do anything with real estate. There is no market and no third-party lending."
The write-off, he said, was a "decisive action" that would demonstrate to investors and rating agencies that "there is a reserve level sufficient to deal with the problems at the financial-services unit."
Mr. Lego said he hoped the real estate write-off would "put this behind us, and allow me to focus on the rest of the business."
The announcement was made before 9 A.M. yesterday, and trading in Westinghouse shares was delayed when the New York Stock Exchange opened at 9:30. When the stock opened at 10:17, it traded initially at $20.375, down $1.375 from Friday's close. It closed at $19.125, down $2.625.
After the announcement, Fitch Investors Service, a small rating agency, said it might downgrade its ratings for debt issued by Westinghouse and its credit subsidiary.
 
Trying to Raise Cash
 Mr. Lego said the company planned to bolster its cash position by selling $900 million in new equity, probably preferred or convertible shares, and by contributing $400 million in stock, rather than cash, to the corporate pension fund this year and next. Other employee programs, which he did not specify, will also be financed with stock rather than cash. Mr. Lego said the stock sale would result in dilution of less than 10 percent to earnings per share in 1992.
The quarterly loss came on revenues of $3.43 billion. It contrasts to earnings of $255 million, or 87 cents a share, on revenues of $3.18 billion in the third quarter of 1990.
Although real estate woes dominated the earnings report, other segments of the company's business reported problems as well. Operating profits at the broadcast division, which includes television stations in Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and San Francisco, were reported to be "down substantially" because of reduced advertising as a result of the recession and the Persian Gulf war.
 
Other Troubled Sectors
 The company's environmental group also reported reduced profits, citing cost overruns in the construction of trash-burning plants. Operating profits were "down substantially" at the industries segment, which produces refrigeration and power distribution equipment. Similarly, earnings were "slightly lower" in the electric power generating machinery division because of reduced income from licensing and plant completions.
One bright spot was the company's Knoll Group, which makes office furniture. It reported profits were "up slightly" in the quarter and "substantially higher" in the nine months.
The company said Leo W. Yochum, who retired in 1988 as senior executive vice president for finance, would return as the chairman of the Westinghouse Financial Services Inc. subsidiary. Mr. Yochum, who is 64 years old, replaces William A. Powe, who was named a special consultant to the corporation

HEADLINE: U.S. Garment Makers Come Home

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The clothing racks at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue are more and more often showing off an unfamiliar tag: "Made in the U.S.A."
Apparel industry economists say about 50 percent of the clothing sold in the United States is made abroad, and in some segments, like women's garments, manufacturing is almost exclusively done overseas. 
 But slowly, some manufacturers of dresses, suits and blouses who fled the United States in the 1960's and 1970's for Hong Kong, China, South Korea and Taiwan in search of cheap labor are moving operations to Manhattan, Maine and North Carolina.
So far, the shift is imperceptible in the statistics collected by the American Apparel Manufacturing Association. And experts doubt that the spurt in domestic production will radically rewrite the history of American apparel manufacturing.
But more apparel makers are producing goods here thanks to an uncertain political outlook, especially in Hong Kong, increased labor costs in East Asia, some signs of poor workmanship and the growing complexities of moving goods quickly from half a world away.
"The numbers certainly don't reflect this, but I know there's a lot of talk about it being done," said Carl H. Priestland, chief economist for the manufacturers' association. "The Limited, the Gap and Esprit have all been saying they want to source more domestically." The Gap, in fact, has found that it can buy American-made men's pants for about the same price as those from Hong Kong.
Developments in America, ranging from growing pools of immigrant Asian laborers in cities like New York to leaner inventory management by retailers have made it convenient and profitable to sew garments in the United States.
Also, an influx of Asian immigrants from Hong Kong has provided a pool of skilled labor that works for low wages. Many American retailers have adopted "just-in-time" inventory controls to improve efficiencies and reduce costly inventories. That has made ordering and shipping from Asia cumbersome, especially when consumer moods swing sharply or goods arrive with flaws and need to be returned for corrections.
"Right now, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan are very expensive -- for labor, for quotas, for import duties," said Wai Yuen-Shek, a transplanted Hong Kong native who says his five garment factories in New York are swamped with orders through the end of the year. "Manufacturers that used to take up three, four floors of a factory in Hong Kong are now shrinking, shrinking, shrinking to one floor or half a floor."
Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller, which makes women's ready-to-wear clothing sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's, started to move manufacturing back to the United States in 1986. Virtually all dresses and suits bearing the label are now made in factories in Philadelphia and New York.
 
'Doomed to Overbuying'
 Mr. Konheim said making garments here enabled him to price them competitively. "Everybody contracting in Hong Kong is projecting three and four months ahead of time, which means they're almost always doomed to overbuying," he said. "The cost of that kind of inefficient guesswork is what has led to this phony price structure with guaranteed markdowns that we have now."
Two years ago, almost all of the children's clothing sold by Albert and Tina Betesh, founders of the Choozie Wear Corporation in New York, was made in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. Today, 35 percent comes from places like Greensboro, N.C., and Sylvester, Ga. The quality still needs to be improved, Mr. Betesh said, "but we're willing to stick with it; there are just too many uncontrollable factors in overseas production."
Making clothes in the United States is problematic for other reasons. Labor costs are still high and the cost of some kinds of goods produced here still surpasses the cost of making and shipping goods from Asia or the Caribbean. Also, the doubts about American quality persist.
 
Aging Sewing Machine Operators
 "We're always looking for more production here, but I can't find labor in the United States for quality and for price," said Ely Barsel, president of the Arenzano Trading Company of New York, which makes suits under the Oleg Cassini and Richard Neal labels. "The average age of sewing machine operators is between 60 and 70, so I question whether it's within the realm of possibility to bring the sewing end of the garment business back into the United States in any full force."
Mr. Barsel and other apparel makers predict that eventually some of those manufacturers who have recently transferred their production to the United States will move it again, to places like the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
Mr. Barsel said the labor costs of making a jacket in Hialeah, Fla., where he has a cutting factory, are $18.50, while in Central America it costs about $6. Even with import duties and transportation, the jacket made there costs only $11.
At this stage the unions representing laborers in American apparel factories are not likely to see a sudden jump in their declining membership because technological advances in manufacturing, like computerized cutting and pattern-marking, will continue to displace workers, said Bruce G. Herman, president of the Garment Industry Development Corporation, a nonprofit company created by the industry's leading trade associations and unions.
 
A Caribbean Connection
 Mr. Barsel's company, like many others, manufactures women's clothes in the Caribbean under a Federal law that allows American contractors to ship cut pieces to offshore factories for assembly and pay duty only on the cost of assembly, which is cheaper there.
But Mr. Wai and his partner, Zee Wai-Chu, said that even though they were considering a joint venture with a factory in the Dominican Republic, the quality of the goods produced in Central America continued to be unpredictable and in many cases far below that in the United States.
As manufacturing flows back to the United States from the Far East, competition for America's remaining textile mills and sewing factories has heated up. Indeed, many manufacturers interviewed declined to give the location of their contractors because they fear others would bid up the price for those services.
Thomas F. Gayer, vice president of the Euro-American Textiles Corporation in New York, said that two small mills that do contract work for his company were investing millions of dollars to retooling factories and that Japanese and German companies were investing in American mills.
 
More American-Made Fabric
 In the last two years, Euro-American increased its volume of American-made fabric to $25 million, from $3 million, while European manufacturing dropped to 78 percent.
"By moving our production to the U.S., we have tighter quality control and shorter turnarounds," Mr. Gayer said. "It just made sense."
Beleaguered lenders, fearful of bankruptcies among garment industry customers, are indirectly causing some garment making to return from Asia by limiting the letters of credit used in international trade. David Gurwitz, president of the National Looms Corporation, a New York-based company that makes fabrics knitted and woven with Lycra, said the business he and his partners bought two years ago had doubled its sales in a year thanks to increased demand for American-made textiles.
"Clearly a lot of our clients have been affected by the shortage of credit available from a smaller credit-granting community," he said. "In addition to the worsened banking environment, the factoring community that finances apparel manufacturing is one-third the size of what it used to be."
 
A Decline in Quality
 Dealing with manufacturers in the Far East has long been complicated, and has grown more so as quality has fallen off. When apparel was delivered in shoddy condition, with crooked seams, poorly finished buttonholes or other problems, correcting the problems almost always meant returning the goods to the factory, a time-consuming process. Often, by the time the garments are returned from the factory, the season for selling them is nearly over and the clothes must be marked down.
The Limited, whose $5 billion in annual sales is generated largely by inexpensive clothing made in the Far East, is one of the largest buyers of apparel made in Asia, and it recently blamed poor-quality goods for its lackluster sales.
Workers in one of Mr. Wai's New York factories were repairing belts made by a Chinese contractor that were shipped twice as long as ordered and with the holes incorrectly punched in the middle instead of near the end of the belt. "You see the problems," he said.
 
Long-Range Commitments
 Several companies complain that they must place orders far in advance to overseas suppliers. A manufacturer whose garments are made in Hong Kong must commit to an order four to six months in advance, compared with a few weeks or even days for American-based companies.
"If you're producing domestically, you have the ability to knock out another 6 or 8 or 50 dresses within days," said Liz Goldsmith, vice president of sales and marketing for Dennis Goldsmith International Inc., a dress maker based in New York.
Retailers caught with bloated inventories during the recession are placing minimal orders to avoid markdowns. But they also want to be able to reorder garments if they sell well, and many have installed elaborate computer systems to tell them precisely what is in demand.
 
Need to Reorder Quickly
 "The retailer now knows precisely what's going out the front door, and he wants to be able to punch a button and tell the manufacturer, 'George, send 2,000 more T-shirts in tomato red right away,' " said Mr. Priestland of the manufacturers association.
The financial advantages of manufacturing in the United States have accomplished what the textile industry and labor unions sought for years with millions of dollars in advertising to American consumers to buy clothing, towels and other soft goods with the "Made in the U.S.A." label. But, manufacturers and industry analysts say, the recent return of some apparel making to onshore factories is purely a financial expedient.
"That campaign has not worked," said Alan G. Millstein, publisher of the Fashion Network Report. "What manufacturing is coming back is coming back because many people lack the financial resources to put out the letters of credit you need to order in Hong Kong and China."

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall Amid Concern Over Earnings

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Amid continued investor concern over corporate earnings, accentuated by Westinghouse Electric's news of a third-quarter net loss of $1.48 billion, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.01 points yesterday, to 2,942.75. Westinghouse is a Dow component.
"Without more interest rate cuts, the market must rely more on the outlook for profits," said Joseph Battipaglia, director of research at the Gruntal Company. "And seeing that outlook dim has given rise to the recent selloff in the market." 
 Mr. Battipaglia added: "The Fed has already given the market several months of lower interest rates, with expectations of an increase in housing and consumer spending. As a result businesses would begin to replenish inventories to meet new demand. But this has not happened because business activity has not picked up significantly. Consumers are paying down debt rather than using more of it. Hence, the recovery expectations for the second half of this year, have been dashed."
 
500-Stock Index Off
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was off 1.74, to 379.50, while the New York Stock Exchange composite slipped 1.06, to 209.16.
Volume on the Big Board was 148.5 million shares, down from 164.1 million shares traded on Friday, with losing issues outpacing gainers by a ratio of 2 to 1.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite fell 4.20, to 516.20, and the American Stock Exchange composite declined by 2.45, to 369.02.
By midday the market had settled at the low end of a tight trading range, with market participants saying that it may be approaching an oversold position, opening up some buying opportunities. Other traders, however, feared that if the Dow falls below 2,910, institutional selling will increase significantly.
National Medical Enterprises was the most heavily traded stock following newspaper articles about investigations into the company's aggressive efforts to recruit patients to collect health insurance payments. The company confirmed the reports in a statement, saying that its Psychiatric Institutes of America unit was under investigation in Florida, Texas and New Jersey and that it was cooperating fully with the authorities, as well as conducting its own internal investigation. The stock closed down 4 1/8, to 16 1/8.
Westinghouse Electric fell 2 5/8, to 19 1/8. The company in announcing its loss, which it attributed to a weak real estate market, said it planned to issue $900 million in equity. Trading was suspended for a half-hour following the dissemination of the news. General Electric, which has a huge finance arm like that of Westinghouse, was caught up in the market's sentiment and fell 1 1/8, to 67 1/4.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Installment Debt Shrank In August

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Recession-wary Americans shrank their installment debt at a 2.1 percent annual rate in August, according to a Government report today that showed consumer credit was lower for the eighth time in nine months.
"The contraction in net credit outstanding reflects the recession's impact on consumer spending as well as the consumers' concern about their personal finances," Michael P. Niemira, an economist, wrote in Mitsubishi Bank's Weekly Economic Indicator Report. 
 The Federal Reserve said consumer credit fell a seasonally adjusted $1.29 billion in August after declining 1.0 percent in July and 2.8 percent in June. The June drop was revised from a 1.4 percent decrease in the initial estimate last month.
Installment debt increased 1.9 percent in April, the only gain since last November.
Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home-equity debt. It helps finance much of overall consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
The Commerce Department had reported earlier that retail sales -- one-half of consumer spending -- had slumped seven-tenths of 1 percent in August. Many economists have expressed concern that without strong participation by consumers, the economic revival may falter.
"The latest drop in outstanding installment borrowing again was led by auto loans," the Fed report said. These loans plunged at an 8.6 percent rate, or a seasonally adjusted $1.97 billion, after falling 4.1 percent in July.
Automobile sales, which represent one-fifth of retail sales, had fallen 2.7 percent in August, the Commerce report said.
Auto loans have fallen every month this year and manufacturers of North American-made cars reported the model year ending in September was the worst since 1983.
Consumers continued to use their credit cards, however. Revolving credit rose at a 6.2 percent rate, or $1.18 billion, after a gain of 2.4 percent in July. This category has not declined since dipping 2.8 percent last January.
The changes left consumers holding $728.7 billion in installment debt at the end of August, seven-tenths of 1 percent less than they held a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Court to Review Mail-Order Sales Tax Curb

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
In a case with enormous financial implications for the mail-order industry, the Supreme Court agreed today to reconsider one of its own precedents, a 24-year-old decision that has barred states from taxing an estimated $45 billion a year in mail-order sales.
The 1967 precedent, which has come under sustained attack in recent years from states eager to capture as much as $3 billion a year in lost tax revenue, held that the Constitution bars states from taxing sales made by out-of-state companies that have no physical presence in the state. 
 Such taxation, the Court ruled in National Bellas Hess v. Department of Revenue, would violate the constitutional guarantee of due process and would place an undue burden on interstate commerce.
Several dozen states have passed laws recently making out-of-state catalogue sales subject to a use tax, the equivalent of an in-state sales tax. But state courts had uniformly, if reluctantly, adhered to the Supreme Court precedent and refused to permit enforcement.
But recently state courts have begun to break ranks. The case the Court agreed to hear today is an appeal of a ruling last May by the North Dakota Supreme Court, which declared that the 1967 decision was an "obsolescent" precedent that would no longer be considered binding in North Dakota.
The appeal today was brought by the Quill Corporation, an Illinois-based catalogue retailer of office supplies that sends out 60 different catalogues a year and has more than $200 million in annual sales. Quill's estimated $1 million in sales to 3,500 customers in North Dakota makes it the state's sixth-largest seller of office supplies in terms of annual volume.
In 1987, North Dakota amended its sales and use tax to cover out-of-state retailers that regularly solicit business from state residents. In 1989, Quill refused a request from North Dakota tax officials to begin collecting the use tax. The state then went to state court for a declaration that the 1987 law was constitutional and could be enforced.
In its opinion last May, the state's Supreme Court concluded that the economic premises of the 1967 decision were no longer valid, and that it was now illogical and unfair to make a physical presence within the state the sole basis for tax liability.
 
Big Growth in Sales
 In 1967, the state court noted, national mail order sales totaled $2.4 billion a year, compared with almost $200 billion today -- nearly 15 percent of all sales. Last year, 98 million Americans made purchases from the 13.6 billion catalogues that were mailed.
North Dakota, while defending the ruling by its Supreme Court, urged the Justices to hear Quill's appeal, Quill Corp. v. N.D., No. 91-194, because of the importance of the issue. Twenty-two other states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, joined a brief urging the Court to overturn the 1967 decision.
In its last term, the Supreme Court turned down Connecticut's request to review a decision of the Connecticut Supreme Court that had refused to permit the state to tax the mail-order sales of Saks Fifth Avenue's catalogue subsidiary. The Justices do not give reasons for denying, or granting, an appeal. But at the time the Connecticut case was filed, no state supreme court had yet refused to apply National Bellas Hess. The subsequent North Dakota ruling, raising the prospect of national disarray on the issue, quite likely convinced the Justices that the matter required their attention.
Other cases the Court acted on today as the Justices began their 1991-92 term included the following:
 
Proposition 13
 The Court agreed to hear a constitutional challenge to the California property tax limitations known as Proposition 13. The action was expected, because the Justices had agreed last June to hear a similar challenge, only to have R. H. Macy & Company, the taxpayer that brought the challenge, drop the case in the face of a threatened consumer boycott.
The new case was brought not by a company but by an individual homeowner, Stephanie Nordlinger, who in 1988 paid $170,000 for a house in the Baldwin Hills section of Los Angeles. Her property tax is $1,700 a year, in contrast to the $400 a year that is paid by neighbors who have owned their homes since Proposition 13 took effect in 1978.
Under the proposition, which amended the California Constitution, assessments were rolled back to 1975 levels, local property taxes were set at 1 percent of assessed value, and subsequent increases were limited to 2 percent a year as long as the property remained in the same hands.
Newly acquired property, however, is reassessed according to the purchase price. With the rapid increase in property values, widespread disparity has resulted. According to Ms. Nordlinger's petition, new property owners in Los Angeles "commonly" pay property taxes 10 times as high as those paid by some neighbors. Forty-six percent of all California houses built before 1975 are still in the same hands, and so are protected.
 
Basis for Challenge
 The constitutional challenge in Nordlinger v. Hahn, No. 90-1912, is based on the Federal Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and the right to travel. The California Court of Appeal rejected the challenge, and the California Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
Ms. Nordlinger's appeal is supported by the League of Women Voters of California and by the Building Industry Association of Southern California, which filed a brief asserting that Proposition 13 has made it increasingly difficult for people to afford new housing in the state.
Proposition 13 affects businesses as well. In the Macy case, the tax assessment on a Macy's store in a Contra Costa County mall was more than double that of two other retailers in the mall, because Macy's, which had undergone a corporate reorganization in 1986, was deemed to be a new property owner.
 
Biotechnology Patent
 Without comment, the Court let stand a ruling in an important patent dispute over rights to a top-selling anti-anemia drug that is manufactured by genetic engineering.
Last March, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit here, which has nationwide jurisdiction over appeals in patent cases, gave a complete domestic patent monopoly over the drug to Amgen Inc., based in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
The ruling was a serious setback for an Amgen competitor, Genetics Institute Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., which brought the appeal the Supreme Court rejected today. The appeals court found that Genetics Institute's competing patent claims were invalid because the company had not proved that it isolated a protein with the biological characteristics described in the patent.
At issue is the domestic market for EPO, or erythropoietin, a drug that stimulates the production of red blood cells and is useful for combating serious anemia. Domestic sales last year were more than $300 million.
While vitally important to the two companies, the case, Genetics Institute v. Amgen, No. 91-13, was of limited legal significance for other biotechnology cases because it concerned the specific facts of the disputed patent.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that life forms created through genetic engineering could be patented. That ruling gave a substantial lift to the biotechnology industry.
 
Bilzerian Appeal
 Without comment, the Justices turned down an appeal by Paul A. Bilzerian, the Florida investor and former corporate raider who in 1989 was convicted of violating Federal securities laws. He was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $1.5 million after the trial judge, Robert Ward of Federal District Court in New York, said he believed Mr. Bilzerian had perjured himself in testifying in his own defense at his trial. The Federal appeals court in Manhattan upheld the conviction.
The Government had charged Mr. Bilzerian, former chairman of the Singer Corporation, with secretly accumulating stock in takeover targets and then hiding the stock in secret accounts until after the stock price had risen. His appeal was Bilzerian v. U.S., No. 90-1803.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Figuring a Price On a Soviet Deal

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
AMONG the Soviet Union's collection of industrial operations, the Volga Automotive Plant Association is the first big target for Western investment. A 30 percent ownership stake in this Russian version of General Motors is to be sold soon, probably to Fiat S.p.A. But what should Fiat pay? What is Volga Autos worth? Bear, Stearns & Company, the Wall Street firm, is using Western techniques to answer this question. Its price tag, due this month, is likely to reflect Soviet politics and guesswork as much as financial analysis.
The Bear, Stearns effort, undertaken at the request of the Soviet Government, is important because it offers an analytic approach for valuing a company that operates in a society without normal guidelines, like stock prices, real estate values and the cost of labor, once the Government no longer sets Soviet wages. The goal is to come up with a cash-flow figure -- a rough measure of Volga Auto's potential earnings in hard currency that would indicate the return on Fiat's investment. 
 "I think this approach is quite a good, indirect way of valuing a company's assets," Leonid Abalkin, a senior economic adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said in an interview during a visit last week to the United States.
But then come the uncertainties. Will the Soviet Union, for example, limit future imports of Western-made cars, thus increasing Volga Auto's sales in the Soviet Union and, presumably, the return on Fiat's investment? The Soviets don't say.
Or, will Fiat, as the minority shareholder in a soon-to-be privatized company still controlled by Russians, have a sufficient say in Volga's managment to maintain quality? If not, the cars might not sell well abroad, and Volga's earnings from future exports might decline. Right now, 300,000 of the 700,000 cars manufactured annually are sold in Western Europe, Britain and Canada.
Then there is the social issue. Is Bear, Stearns including in its calculations the expense of continuing to provide housing, hospitals, schools and the like for many of Volga's 120,000 workers? Bear, Stearns does not say, but Mr. Abalkin insisted that these "social functions" must be maintained. "This is a permanent peculiarity of Soviet enterprises," he said.
Finally, neither Bear, Stearns nor the Soviets have produced a Western challenger to Fiat. Given the Italian auto maker's long involvement in Volga's operations, that is understandable. But the absence of competition gives Fiat extra leverage to bargain down the amount that it ends up investing to acquire 30 percent of Volga Autos.
Fiat built Volga's main plant 500 miles from Moscow in the 1960's. It provided the technology, now outdated, for Volga's principal car, called the Zhuguli at home and the Lada abroad. And last spring the Soviet Government -- seeking new technology and Western money to update Volga -- signed a letter of intent with Fiat that seemed to commit it to Fiat as the minority shareholder.
"In the end, this is going to be a negotiation," said Maryann Keller, an auto analyst at Furman, Selz Inc. "You hire an investment banker so that you know what sort of value Western business would put on the company. But what you say Volga is worth does not mean that you will get it."
Still, Volga Autos is easier to value in hard currency than other Russian companies. The Lada, similar in style to the Ford Taurus and in quality to the Yugo of Yugoslavia, already sells in the West for $6,000 to $8,000 -- a price that might make the car worth $2,500 to $3,000 in the Soviet Union, once price levels are left to free-market forces, said Planecon Inc., a consulting firm that specializes in Soviet and Eastern European economies. (Bear, Stearns will not discuss such details.)
But if the future revenue flow of Volga can be estimated more or less accurately, its costs cannot. The level of wages or the prices of such basic materials as glass and steel in a centrally controlled, closed-off economy do not serve as guides for what these inputs will cost in a free market, says Robert D. Hormats, vice president for international investment at Goldman, Sachs.
This uncertainty, in turn, becomes part of the calculation. Volga's annual cash flow -- the revenue minus the cost of inputs and of replacing machinery as it ages -- might turn out to be, say, $600 million, a figure that reflects recent Volga data. Fiat's 30 percent investment would then yield $180 million, or 18 percent if Fiat were to invest $1 billion, an amount mentioned in the Soviet press. Given the uncertainties, Fiat might consider 18 percent too low.
But Mr. Abalkin said he would consider $1 billion a giveaway. "A 30 percent stake is worth no less than $4 billion," he said, suggesting that the Bear, Stearns valuation will be a bargaining tool, at best.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. About to Sell New Hampshire Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is expected to reorganize and sell five troubled New Hampshire banks by the end of this week.
The five banks, which together account for about 25 percent of the $20 billion of assets held by all of New Hampshire's banks and savings institutions, have been badly hurt by losses on commercial real estate loans, and have been the subject of F.D.I.C. negotiations for months. 
 Four of the five -- Amoskeag Bank Shares of Manchester, Dartmouth Bancorp of Hooksett, New Hampshire Savings Bank of Concord, and Numerica Financial of Manchester -- are insolvent. The fifth -- Bankeast of Manchester -- has filed for bankruptcy.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C., told reporters Sunday evening that the rescues would be completed before his term ends on Oct. 16. The agency often announces the reorganization of failed banks on Friday, and makes arrangements for them to be open the following Saturday or Monday under new owners.
 
Divided Into 2 Groups
 Rather than sell each bank company individually, as is normally its practice, the F.D.I.C. is expected to divide the companies into two groups. One group will consist of the two commercial banks, Amoskeag and BankEast; the other group will comprise the three other savings institutions.
Gerrard Cassidy, a banking analyst at Tucker Anthony Inc., in Boston, said the bidders for the bank group would include the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, of Providence, R.I., which this year bought the Bank of New England and already owns the largest bank in New Hampshire, and Keycorp of Albany, which bought part of Goldome, a failed savings bank in Buffalo. Fleet/Norstar and Keycorp will also bid separately for the right to manage the pool of bad loans that the F.D.I.C. will keep while it sells the remainder for the banks, Mr. Cassidy said.
None of the potential bidders would comment on possible plans to bid for the New Hampshire banks.
Mr. Cassidy said that bidders for the three savings institutions included a group of investors led by William Craig, a former vice chairman of the Shawmut National Corporation, and First NH Banks, a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland.
 
'A Critical Mass'
 "The two franchises offered for sale could provide buyers with a critical mass in the state," said Frank Barkocy, a banking analyst at Advest Inc., a securities firm based in Hartford. Because of the weak regional economy and a glut of vacant real estate, Mr. Barkocy said the rescue had taken several months to arrange, and "has been a hard sell for Federal regulators."
Even assuming that the F.D.I.C. retains the banks' bad loans, Mr. Barkocy noted that the New Hampshire companies might not have much near-term profit potential, "except for buyers who have other profitable outlets for the low-cost deposits they can collect in the state."
Because the F.D.I.C. rescue includes the merger of some companies, analysts expect branch closings and job cuts to follow the sales. Analysts at the First Albany Corporation noted that the mergers and sales to large banking companies would be helpful to healthier banking companies in the area "as excess banking capacity would be reduced, with no competitors introduced."
One of the problems for the New Hampshire banking market, analysts said, was the conversion in the early 1980's of companies like Amoskeag and the New Hampshire Savings Bank to shareholder ownership. The influx of shareholder capital encouraged them to lend heavily on real estate projects in the "golden triangle" in southern New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: In the New Albania, New Varieties of Chaos

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, Oct. 4

 BODY:
When schools reopened the other day after an extended summer pause, Albanian education authorities were horrified to discover that 740 of their buildings had been vandalized -- windows, desks and other furnishings smashed.
It was another symptom of the chaos in this Balkan country, whose 3.5 million people are Europe's poorest. After a summer in which 20,000 Albanians, most of them young, tried to leave the country, only to be returned by Italy, a wave of robberies and burglaries has swept the land. 
 In August alone, 27 railway freight cars were plundered of their loads of fertilizer and salt, which is in short supply.
School textbooks and instructors from the Communist Government that ruled Albania unopposed until last spring remain largely unchanged. But now, teachers are being assaulted.
With the dissolution six months ago of the secret police and with the demoralized uniformed police and the army receiving frequently changed commands or none at all at times of unrest, there has been a breakdown of public order.
The economy continues to deteriorate. Average wages range from $40 to $60 a month. Two-thirds of the Albanian labor force is involved in agriculture, for the most part with hand implements. Now, the peasants are intent on acquiring land under a privatization law after four decades of collectivization. Fields lie fallow. Orchards go unpruned. Grapes rot unharvested.
Gramoz Pashko, Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic reform, said in an interview that Albania is burdened with foreign debts totaling $400 million. "If we had half a billion dollars in assistance, we could save Albania not only for this winter, but for the rest of life," he said. "We could have a real market economy and people would not die."
But with the exception of Italy, which is providing considerable food assistance, only a trickle of foreign aid has been delivered, including that promised by the United States.
Against this background, the political situation is also deteriorating. The Communist Party, which won about 70 percent of Parliament seats in March in Albania's first contested election since World War II, is moribund. It is split into as many as four factions under a new name, the Socialist Party.
After demonstrations last spring, the Communists agreed to share power with the opposition Democratic Party in a coalition Government of "national stability." Communists still hold most of the positions of power in Albania but are unsure of their grip.
The Democrats, led by Dr. Sali Berisha, a cardiologist, want to push the Communists the rest of the way out of authority with new elections.
But on the way to that goal, the Democratic Party leadership has split into two factions that are slinging bitter epithets at each other.
On one side is Dr. Berisha, a popular figure. On the other is a group of seven or more party leaders who include Mr. Pashko, the economist; Genc Rulli, the Finance Minister, and Azem Hajdari, a fiery young man who took command of a student uprising at Tirana University that started the process of Communist collapse last December.
The split began when Dr. Berisha dismissed Frrok Cupi, the editor of the party newspaper Democratic Revival, who had made a name for himself as a dissident during Communist rule. "I decided he was a spy," Dr. Berisha said, "and I fired him."
The other leaders were appalled, and they accused Dr. Berisha of acting in the manner of Enver Hoxha, the Albanian dictator who died in 1985.
The rift reached a low point over the weekend of Sept. 27 at a party national congress. On the agenda were the election of a chairman and a governing council, as well as a decision on when to push for national elections.
The seven opponents tried to persuade Dr. Berisha to step aside on the ground that he was overwhelming the party with his dominating personality. He refused. At the last minute, they put up two other candidates.
Dr. Berisha took his case to the floor of the 561-member convention, made a rousing speech, won standing ovations and received 449 votes.

HEADLINE: Haiti Legislature Declares the Presidency Vacant

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Under pressure from belligerent soldiers, Haiti's legislature tonight voted to apply a constitutional article that declares the presidency vacant and clear the way for the naming of a provisional leader who would be required to call new elections within 90 days. 
 The decision was announced during a visit by a delegation from the Organization of American States, which returned to Haiti this afternoon to demand the reinstatement of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, exiled in a military coup last Monday. The army accused Father Aristide of violating the constitution and seeking to create a separate armed unit as his own political tool.
Parliament's decision came shortly before 6 P.M., before the President of the National Assembly had returned from an airport meeting with the O.A.S. delegation.
Asked why the decision had been made in such haste, one senator said: "The declaration had already been decided upon. We had to do it this way because the army was angry. They wanted it done right away."
 
Violence at the Airport
 More than 100 armed soldiers milled about the Parliament building. While the legislators were voting, a group of soldiers became violent at Haiti's international airport, beating and arresting the Mayor of Port-au-Prince, Evans Paul, and forcing the cancellation of a trip by a group of politicians who were traveling to Venezuela to negotiate Father Aristide's return.
Father Aristide flew to Caracas, Venezuela, from Washington on Sunday night and met with the Venezuelan leader, Carlos Andres Perez. He flew to Kingston, Jamaica, today and met with the Jamaican Prime Minister, Michael Manley.
Soldiers at the Haitian airport beat on passing cars, saying, "We want a President today!" and "We want the country!" said one witness who had just arrived from Miami. He said at least one shot was fired at the airport.
Other soldiers surrounded a second-floor meeting room where members of the O.A.S. team, including Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, were discussing the country's crisis with Haitian officials. The delegation left the country shortly afterward.
 
Broadcasts Are Halted
 With the exception of Government programming, consisting of music punctuated by announcements of Parliament's action, all Haitian radio and television stations stopped broadcasting this evening. As night fell, automatic-weapons fire could be heard often around the city.
A Government radio announcement said there was no possibility of Father Aristide's return as President and attributed the gunfire around Parliament to the special military unit created by Father Aristide, even though Government soldiers in uniform were seen in the area.
The decision by Parliament, if applied, would call for the naming of Joseph Nerette, the senior justice on Haiti's Supreme Court, to serve temporarily as President.
The decision, made while soldiers nervously patrolled the streets after rumors circulated this afternoon of President Aristide's impending return, places Haiti on a collision course with Western Hemisphere nations that have vowed to enforce economic sanctions against the country until the ousted President is returned to office.
"We have come down with an extremely clear mandate that Aristide must be restored," said Carlos Iturralde, the Bolivian Foreign Minister who is chairman of the O.A.S. delegation, several hours before Parliament's decision was announced. "We want to make it clear that our position is very serious, that economic sanctions are there to stay and soon there will be a lack of oil."
 
Fears of Foreign Intervention
 Referring to the Haitian legislature's proposal to name a provisional President who would conduct elections within 90 days, Mr. Iturralde said, before the O.A.S. meeting began, "We cannot allow the presidency to be declared vacant."
After several days with little vocal support for Father Aristide among politicians not already tied to him, leaders of two political groupings said they were traveling to Venezuela tonight to meet with the President to help seek a way for his return.
Victor Benoit, a leader of Konakom, a left-of-center political organization that had backed Father Aristide's candidacy for President before distancing itself from him after he was elected, said he was seeking to avoid foreign military intervention in Haiti or the total isolation of the country.
With sentiment in the army strongly against Father Aristide's return and strong momentum in Parliament for an interim solution to the country's power vacuum, another O.A.S. official called the situation "very delicate and potentially very deadly."
Father Aristide, responding to strong concerns both in Haiti and abroad over his the reality of commitment to human rights, issued a statement denouncing violence and pledging respect for his country's institutions. His remarks included an explicit disavowal of "Pere Lebrun," the street-corner lynchings with burning tires that he has been widely seen as condoning in previous speeches.
"The three powers in our Constitution will have to mutually respect each other and respect the Constitution," the statement said. "As President of the republic, we condemn once again all forms of violence, all forms of violence from whatever source: Pere Lebrun or repressive violence."
Experts in Haitian military affairs expressed concern that any effort to bring about the return of Father Aristide quickly would provoke a violent reaction among ordinary soldiers, whom they described as being nearly unanimous in their opposition to the exiled President.
"The high command is in command insofar as there is no question of Aristide returning," one expert said. "They have no choice."
 
Soldiers' Banter
 Soldiers were talking extemporaneously on the Government-controlled radio during the night.
One soldier who said that he was "a little drunk" proclaimed: "There's no going back now." He asked the news media to "open their doors so that people can express their happiness" about the legislature's decision to vacate the presidency.
Several neighborhoods in the capital continued to report sporadic incidents of nighttime violence by heavily armed men, apparently undisciplined soldiers.

HEADLINE: Democrats Urge Study of Budget Before Cutting Money for Military

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The House Democratic leadership today moved to look at Federal budget issues for the next decade before trying to see whether last year's budget agreement should be altered to cut Pentagon spending.
The chairman of the House Budget Committee, with the backing of Speaker Thomas S. Foley, said his panel would start on that task tomorrow, and he hoped, would finish by the time Congress adjourns in November. 
 Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California, the budget panel's chairman, offered some long-term recommendations that are intended to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars over the decade. Those recommendations, which also call for major new spending in education and health, urge cuts in the military budget of as much as 33 to 40 percent below last year's levels.
He cited pressures to make those cuts quickly and to apply the money to domestic spending, and said his long-range approach was intended to forestall hasty action.
 
No Cuts in a Vacuum
 "But I do not believe we ought to simply proceed to revise the '93 budget" in a vacuum, Representative Panetta said.
"You can't simply, for example, go after the defense number unless you have developed a long-range path about where defense spending is going to wind up by the end of the decade," he added at a news conference.
Mr. Panetta acknowledged the need for cooperation with the Administration if a long-term plan is to be meaningful, saying, "There's no way that this is going to be done by the Congress alone, and there's no way it's going to be done by the President alone."
President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, while not commenting directly on the proposal for a 10-year look at budget needs, restated the Administration's opposition to reopening the budget agreement. "We do not want to open the budget, reopen the budget agreement," he said at his daily news briefing. "We don't expect it to be reopened and certainly have no plans to do that."
But Administration officials who spoke on condition that their names not be used acknowledged that discussions about using cuts in the military budget to help the Soviet Union were beginning within the Administration, although no strong advocate of such a move has emerged.
"There are some people in the Administration who would like to do it and there are some on Capitol Hill," a senior Administration official said. But two fears worry them, he added.
One is that aid might actually hurt the Soviets. For example, supplying free food might destroy domestic agriculture, he said.
The second concern, the official said, "is that once you open up the Pandora's box on defense, then cuts could be offsets for anyone's favorite programs."
For example, the official noted, domestic transportation programs might end up getting the money instead of the Soviet Union.
 
Urging a Shift
 A senior Treasury official said that while the Department had not adopted a position on such proposals, "we may get some benefit out of reductions in defense and part of that benefit may end up going to international things," particularly the Soviet Union.
Democrats in Congress, led by Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, have been urging such a shift of resources, but Administration officials, especially Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, have rejected such proposals in public comments.
"I've never seen any willingness to compromise on that point," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana. When told that the Administration was considering the idea, however, he replied, "It doesn't surprise me too much," and he asked, "Where does the money come from," if not from defense?
Mr. Aspin has proposed leaving $1 billion in the military budget to be used for Soviet relief this winter. But most proposals call for taking money from the military category and using it for discretionary domestic spending.
Last year's budget law prohibited moving money from one category to another until the budget year beginning Oct. 1, 1993.
While ordinarily one Congress cannot bind its successors, the budget act approved last year and signed by President Bush did impose conditions on future spending, and changing those limits would require repeal or amendment of last year's act, a step that would be almost impossible without President Bush's agreement.
The Senate Budget Committee is also expected to look at the budget again this fall with an eye toward breaking down the so-called "firewalls" between different spending categories. But it is unlikely to try to look as far as 10 years into the future; several senators are skeptical about how useful projections that far ahead can be.
Representative Panetta said he believed Republicans on his committee would share his general objectives of streamlining the Government, concentrating scarce resources on essential problems, economic growth and deficit reduction over the next several years. But he predicted, "There are going to be differences with regards to the pieces."
For example, he said raising taxes would have to be one element of the program, and he spoke of higher taxes for the wealthy, gasoline taxes and excise taxes. Republicans regularly oppose proposals for such taxes and counter with proposals for major cuts in domestic spending. Mr. Panetta did identify increases in health care spending as an area that had to be curbed.

HEADLINE: RISING PERIL SEEN AT EUROPE A-SITES

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCKVILLE, Md., Oct. 7

 BODY:
New safety problems are piling on top of old ones at the nuclear reactors in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union because of the economic and political upheavals there, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today.
The chairman, Ivan Selin, who recently returned from a trip to visit eight reactors in Eastern and Western Europe, said he was "uneasy" about the situation in the former East bloc. 
 Plants lack the resources to make needed improvements, he said, and because of overreliance on nuclear power, there is no chance to shut unsafe reactors. Regulators lack authority, he said, and the breakup of the Soviet Union is making the problem worse, as republics move to take control. Changes promised after the Chernobyl accident five years ago are still incomplete, he said.
His comments are part of a chorus of concern from Western experts, coming partly from increased openness in the East, and in part from a deteriorating situation there.
 
Pessimism on Soviet Plants
 "It is very hard to be optimistic in the short run about safe nuclear operation in the Soviet Union," Mr. Selin said in a session at the commission's headquarters this afternoon. "It isn't getting better."
Eastern European reactors have never been safe, Mr. Selin said, but now economic disclocations are creating new problems; for example, Bulgaria is short of operators for its Soviet-designed reactors. "There are plenty of people in Bulgaria who can run them, but no economic reason to do so," he said. "You can make more money as a cabdriver in Sofia."
And even steps that might seem to reduce risk are making things worse, Mr. Selin said. For example, public reaction to the Chernobyl accident has forced a moratorium on construction of many new reactors in the Soviet Union. But this requires the continued operation of older, primitive models, which lack containment buildings, the heavy steel and concrete structures routinely used in the West to hold in radiation in an accident, and emergency core cooling systems, which would provide water in case of a pipe break.
 
Dependency on Atom Power
 Four reactors in that category, at Greifswald, were shut by Germany after its reunification. The Soviets still operate two at Novovoronezhski and two at Kola, Bulgaria four at Kozloduy and Czechoslovakia two at Bohunice. The Bulgarian plant, he said, was an example of "extreme dependence" on nuclear power, providing 30 to 40 percent of the country's already-inadequate supply of electricity.
Mr. Selin called for an approach in which nuclear agencies like the International Monetary Fund would make reform a condition of aid; specifically, he recommended doubling or tripling the price of electricity to provide the plants with resources for things like control room simulators for training.
But the assessment by Mr. Selin and members of his staff was not uniformly grim. While control room instrumentation and procedures are deficient, Mr. Selin said, many operators are highly trained.
Moreover, Harold R. Denton, director of the commission's Office of Governmental and Regulatory Affairs, said while although the older Soviet-designed plants were not equipped to cope with pipe breaks, they have design elements that would allow them to survive many kinds of accidents.

HEADLINE: Europe Urges Rise in Soviet Aid

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LUXEMBOURG, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The European Community today challenged the United States, Canada and Japan to match $2.4 billion in aid that it plans to give the Soviet Union to help meet an expected winter food shortage.
The finance ministers of the community's 12 member countries called for a total Western aid package of more than $7 billion, saying their loans and credit guarantees were conditional on getting a similar commitment from other major trading powers. 
 "Burden sharing is important," said the community's top finance offical, Henning Christophersen.
The ministers from Britain, France, Italy and Germany will prod their American, Japanese and Canadian counterparts to commit themselves to the aid package at a meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations this week in Bangkok, Thailand.
 
$1.5 Billion More in Credit
 The European Community agreed last year to provide $900 million in emergency aid and credit guarantees, and today it promised an additional $1.5 billion in credit.
The United States has earmarked $2.5 billion in farm credits to the Soviet Union since last fall, officials said.
The European Community ministers have proposed sending a high-level mission to the Soviet Union within weeks to prepare contingency plans for food and medical aid. The Soviet authorities asked for Western aid to help them deal with expected shortages because of a poor food distribution system. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has requested $10.2 billion in food aid, a figure European officials consider inflated.
 
Soviet Cities Vulnerable
 Finance Minister Wim Kok of the Netherlands emphasized that the $1.5 billion credit was a contingency program and would "only be put in practice as soon as we know what the needs are."
But there is little doubt that the Soviet people are facing tough times, officals said. They said people in large industrial cities would be especially vulnerable to food shortages because there were no guarantees that farmers in the countryside would be willing to ship food to the urban centers.
Mr. Christophersen said the need for food aid was clear. "Everybody accepts that something has to be done," he said.
He added that Japan had been hesitant. "Japan has given a very small amount so far," he said, estimating Japanese aid at $36 million.
"They have the capacity" to do more, Mr. Christophersen said. "Why shouldn't they do it?"
The community nations are Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

HEADLINE: Shamir Again Criticizes U.S. on Loan Guarantees

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today delivered one of his more blistering attacks on the United States' postponement of loan guarantees for resettling Soviet immigrants here, saying the action struck at "the deepest foundations of Jewish and Zionist existence."
Mr. Shamir and his aides have vacillated repeatedly in their public remarks on the aid battle, swinging back and forth between anger and resignation, with an occasional pause to worry about the direction of Israel's relations with Washington. 
 But an underlying theme has been a consistent berating of the Bush Administration for having joined two issues: what this Government considers a humanitarian matter, help for Soviet Jewish emigres, and something that it considers purely political, President Bush's demand that the assistance take a back seat to Middle East peace talks he hopes to convene this month.
Opening a session of Parliament today, Mr. Shamir took an outraged stand.
He hardly went so far as one of his Cabinet ministers on the far right who accused Mr. Bush a few weeks ago of being an anti-Semite. Nonetheless, the Prime Minister raised Jewish consciousness as an integral component of the dispute, and he accused Mr. Bush of trampling it.
"The pain and disappointment are especially great because the American Administration chose to take a step that damages the deepest foundations of Jewish and Zionist existence," he said.
He praised Mr. Bush for having worked in the past, as Vice President, to win emigration rights for Soviet and Ethiopian Jews. But this time, he said, the Administration has neglected to recognize the decades of Arab opposition to Jewish immigration here.
"I want to believe that if the American leaders had known the extent of our sensitivity on this subject," he said, they "would have thought twice before taking the path they chose."
His Government's anti-Administration fire has been stoked anew in the last few days by reports from Washington challenging Israel's commitment to free-market changes needed to reshape a lumbering, centrally guided economy. The absence of such adjustments, according to credit analysts for the United States Export-Import Bank, raised doubts about this country's ability to repay the billions it intends to borrow to help Soviet immigrants.
Their analysis was handed to the Administration in July, and senior Government officials here assert that it was leaked to the press now to undermine Israel's fiscal credibility.
But Mr. Shamir's domestic critics accuse him of having brought problems upon himself by, in their view, neglecting economic and social needs, especially for new immigrants.
The research department of the Bank of Israel issued a report today asserting that the Government lacked a consistent overall policy for absorbing immigrants and for lowering the 11 percent unemployment rate.
Shimon Peres, head of the opposition Labor Party, signaled a likely campaign theme for the national elections expected next year when he criticized Mr. Shamir in Parliament for what he called his single-minded pursuit of new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"That's the only thing that shows some sign of policy," Mr. Peres said. "And where is it leading us to?"

HEADLINE: DARTMOUTH BEGINS $425 MILLION DRIVE

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Dartmouth College, the smallest member of the Ivy League, yesterday kicked off a five-year campaign to raise $425 million, joining a growing list of prestigious colleges and universities that are trying to attract record amounts of voluntary support despite a weak economy and bad publicity.
Dartmouth's goal is far lower than the $1.25 billion sought by Cornell University in the highest goal set by any university so far, or the $1.1 billion already raised by Stanford University. But Dartmouth's goal is ambitious, given its size, 4,500 students as against Stanford's 13,000, and its budget, roughly one-quarter the size of Stanford's. 
 "On a per capita basis it's about as big a campaign as there is," said George A. Brakeley 3d, president of Brakeley, John Price Jones, Inc., a fund-raising consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
 
Favorable Expectations
 Dartmouth's new drive is also notable for its timing, just a few semesters after an off-campus publication, The Dartmouth Review, drew unfavorable publicity for the college with its offensive treatment of blacks, homosexuals and American Indians.
But Dartmough officials said they believed the connection to the Review controversy would not dampen the response to their appeal to alumni and supporters, who are considered to be among the most loyal of any college.
E. John Rosenwald Jr., chairman of the campaign executive committee, said that in the last three fiscal years, while the controversy was playing itself out, Dartmouth's support has remained strong. Last year, giving from all sources exceeded $56 million, a record for the college.
Dartmouth's president, James O. Freedman, said yesterday that the money, raised over five years, would be used to strengthen faculty, academic programs and student financial aid and to improve the Hanover, N.H., campus.
In the Ivy League, Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania are in the midst of $1 billion capital campaigns, Princeton University has no campaign under way and Brown University is planning one. Yale University and Harvard University were expected to begin billion-dollar campaigns, but neither has yet done so. Harvard's new president, Neil L. Rudenstine, last month postponed the new campaign for two years.
Over the weekend, the University of Chicago began a $500 million campaign drive to coincide with its centennial.

HEADLINE: Brew Battle On Campus: Ban the Can Or the Keg?

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct. 4

 BODY:
The beer keg, as much a staple of college life as the all-nighter or the incompatible roommate, is at the center of debate this fall over how to control alcohol abuse at two of New Jersey's largest campuses.
With the semester in full swing and beer flowing as freely as ideas, Princeton University and Cook College of Rutgers University have moved simultaneously to establish new restrictions intended to curb drunken carousing and worse. 
 But they have moved in opposite directions.
At Princeton, kegs have been banned in favor of cans and bottles. At Cook College, cans and bottles have been banned in favor of kegs, bucking a national trend.
Neither school is predicting that its policies will bring about the dawn of a golden age of sobriety, and each campus has reacted differently to the rules -- dismay at Princeton, a wait-and-see attitude at Cook.
 
Unspeakable Social Decay
 What is clear at both, however, is the power of the keg as a symbol. For some, particularly undergraduates, it represents independence and youthful exuberance, a rite of passage to the adult world, or, at the very least, the reason weekends were invented. For others, particularly the president of Princeton, Harold T. Shapiro, it is a sign of unspeakable social decay that required urgent measures.
"The keg has become a symbol of the free and easy availability of alcohol," Dr. Shapiro said. "The keg ban is just a step and I hope it will be replaced by better steps."
David Burns, vice president of student life policy and services at Rutgers, said: "The keg is a powerful cue in a psychological sense. It is a very visible thing -- the center of the party."
Theoretically, of course, it is a violation of New Jersey law, as well as college regulations, for most undergraduates to drink. Since 1983, when New Jersey raised its drinking age from 18 to 21, legal consumption of alcohol was automatically restricted to about a quarter of college undergraduates, mostly seniors. But it remains a daunting goal to achieve temperance among thousands of adolescents thrust into the social crucible of dormitories and fraternities beyond the reach of administrators.
With fake I.D. cards and the tribal loyalties of a close-knit campus, under-age drinking persists at fraternity houses (Rutgers), eating clubs (Princeton), off-campus residences and dormitory parties. A vigilant student can stay within the letter of the law and still get a drink from a sympathetic upperclassman.
For Cook, one of four residential colleges at Rutgers' New Brunswick campus, the decision to allow kegs was intended to choke off a larger black-market flow. Under previous guidelines, issued six years ago, kegs were deemed the font of retrograde social behavior and replaced by a roughly equal amount in cases at college-sanctioned dormitory parties. But counting cans proved fruitless, because many more cases were often concealed.
 
The Ultimate Prerequisite
 Now when a keg runs dry, so the theory goes, a host at a Cook College party would be hard-pressed to roll out a fresh barrel without quickly arousing the suspicions of the proctors.
But permission for kegs at Cook College runs counter to an increasing inclination to ban them. In the last year alone, Dartmouth, Skidmore, Purdue, Syracuse and William and Mary have banned kegs. Other schools, including Bryn Mawr, have tightened curbs on alcohol and authorized parties by invitation only.
In some cases, local fraternity chapters have banned kegs or otherwise restricted their parties, in part because the national organizations have come under pressure from their insurers.
At Cook, with about 2,900 students, the latest guidelines are rooted in a yearlong discussion by a student-faculty committee presided over by the dean of students, Lee D. Schneider. The rules, he said, are intended to "encourage students to act responsibly and to take responsibility for others." He requires seniors who want to hold keg parties to attend seminars at which the guidelines are explained and notions about alcohol abuse and safe partying are explored.
 
'Save the Rain Forest'
 Cook College began a one-year experiment this weekend, allowing kegs in certain senior apartments. Keg No. 058203 became the first to be inspected by a proctor for the dean's office, to the cheers of about two dozen guests at a "save the rain forest" theme party in the Newell Apartments, a senior dormitory complex.
Surrounded by strands of ivy taped to the walls and ceiling, some students grumbled about the limits on quantity, but there was a sense that the experiment was worth trying. Support ran stronger at another gathering in a nearby apartment just outside the realm designated for kegs.
"It's a lot stricter this year," said Kevin Melvin, 22, a senior from Smithtown, L.I. "But the theme parties are fun, and it's not just drinking. The college cares about what we do, and if this works out we'll be setting things up for the next class."
A keg party at Newell is covered by six pages of rules.
 
Bluto, Meet John Locke
 The hosts, who are required to register with the dean during the week, also have to sign a "social contract" under which they pledge to help "eliminate socially intolerable forms of behavior, specifically harassment, sexual abuse, driving under the influence, racism, sexism, homophobia, vandalism, vomiting, littering and disorderly conduct." Violations of the party guidelines can result in fines up to $500 and as much as 100 hours of campus service.
Under New Jersey law, anyone who serves alcohol to a minor is in violation, but the drinker, if he or she is in a private place, is not sanctioned. For that reason, kegs have always been outlawed in Princeton dorms, because by definition a keg is a vehicle for serving alcohol. Princeton's penalties for those caught serving to minors range from warnings to probation and campus service.
At Princeton, the style of the keg ban has caused as much debate as its substance. Dr. Shapiro's announcement amounted to a decree. Issued without consulting students, faculty members or alumni, it has drawn a uniformly unfavorable response. It came even as his own special assistant, Carl Wartenburg, was trying to evaluate campus drinking and propose ways to deal with it.
Paul McDonald, chairman of the Undergraduate Life committee, said most students agreed that alcohol abuse was a problem. But he argued that Dr. Shapiro's "high-handed" ban had undermined campus dialogue.
 
Oh, Ecology! Oh, Reunions!
 "College students like to be treated as adults, and when they are treated as children, it's bound to create a backlash," said Mr. McDonald, a junior from Sugarland, Tex.
Underlying the debate over kegs versus cans is an unbending law of campus economics -- kegs cost about a third of the equivalent amount of canned or bottled beer -- that has vexed not only the 4,500 undergraduates at Princeton but also its alumni, whose reunions will be kegless and more expensive.
At Community Liquors in Princeton, the owner, Stanley Parnett, said the demand by students for the traditional half-keg -- $33 for the equivalent of 190 12-ounce cans -- had been "soft but steady."
But the loudest and most sustained outcry may come from the reunion classes, who are famous for transforming Princeton's lush Gothic campus into an orange and black Mardi Gras.
Writing on behalf of the class of 1982, two of its officers, William D. Kissinger and Richard G. Coffey, criticized Dr. Shapiro for acting unilaterally and asked him to reconsider.
They asserted that the ban would make the reunion too expensive, would create an ecological nightmare in the form of 24,000 cans or bottles for the class of 1982 alone, and would threaten security because "the bottles and cans that will have to be used in lieu of kegs are much more likely to be thrown and to cause injury."
"One cannot throw a cup full of beer and expect it to cause damage," they wrote.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Panel to Recommend Raises of Up to 19% for City Officials

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A mayoral commission examining the salaries of elected officials will recommend raises this week of up to 19 percent for Mayor David N. Dinkins and other high-ranking elected city officeholders, city officials said.
But by all accounts, the proposed raises have no chance of becoming reality any time soon. The Mayor has repeatedly said he would not accept a raise for at least a year and has vowed to oppose raises for other officeholders because of the city's bleak financial straits. 
 And the Speaker of the City Council, Peter F. Vallone, who in effect controls the ultimate fate of the raises in the Council, has said that although he supported raising Council members' salaries, he would staunchly oppose raises until the city's fiscal health improves.
Still, the three-member panel's recommendations, first reported yesterday in The New York Post, will give city officials a rationale for raising salaries in the future if the fiscal clouds clear. Doing it now, mayoral aides said, would be tantamount to political suicide.
 
Compared to Private Jobs
 Members of the commission did not return telephone calls yesterday seeking comment. First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the commission had arrived at the higher salaries by comparing the positions to similar jobs in other parts of the country and to jobs in private industry with comparable responsibilities. The commission also took into account the cost of living in New York and inflation.
The conclusion, Mr. Steisel said, was that top elected officials are underpaid for the level of responsibility they carry and could make much more in the private sector.
"Glory only carries you so far," Mr. Steisel said.
The biggest raise proposed by the panel would go to the Mayor, city officials said. The panel has decided to recommend that Mr. Dinkins's official salary be raised about 18 percent, to $153,000 a year from $130,000, which it is believed would make him the highest-paid mayor in the nation.
For the last year, Mayor Dinkins has voluntarily taken a 5 percent cut in pay -- to $123,500 -- along with his highest-paid commissioners and managers. In a speech on July 30, Mr. Dinkins promised he would freeze his salary for the next year at that level and urged other elected officials to join him.
Besides the Mayor's raise, the panel will recommend that Council member's salaries be raised to $65,000 from $55,000; that City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman's salary be increased to $122,500 from $105,000; that City Council President Andrew J. Stein be paid $115,000 instead of $105,000, and that district attorneys be given a raise to $115,000 from the $97,000 they now earn. The panel will propose that borough presidents be given a raise to $105,000 from $95,000, officials said.
 
Mayor's Recommendations
 The recommendations are expected to arrive on the Mayor's desk today or tomorrow, Mr. Steisel said. After reading them, the Mayor is to send his own recommendations to the Council, which has the power to approve the raises.
Peg Breen, the spokeswoman for the Council, said Mr. Vallone, the Speaker, has repeatedly said he would not urge passage of raises this year.
Created in 1986, the panel, known as the Advisory Commission to Review Compensation Levels of Elected Officials, scrutinizes every four years the salaries of the mayor, Council president, comptroller, borough presidents, Council members and the five district attorneys.
The commission is headed by Richard Shinn, a former chairman of Metropolitan Life Insurance. The other members are G. G. Michelson, a vice president at R. H. Macy & Company, and Donald C. Platten, a former chairman of Chemical Bank.

HEADLINE: Groups Urge Tax Freeze By Dinkins

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In an unusually stiff warning, two leading business groups yesterday urged the Dinkins administration to freeze all taxes on property, businesses and individuals in New York City for the next four years, to cut its work force by 30,000 employees and improve efficiency to maintain vital services.
By making those demands, the groups, the New York Chamber of Commerce and the New York City Partnership, joined a growing chorus, including the City Council and the Real Estate Board of New York, which has urged Mr. Dinkins to hold down taxes and cuts in services, or risk losing businesses and taxpayers and hurting the economy further. 
 But the groups' statement, on the eve of a meeting of the state Financial Control Board to review the city's finances today, was more sweeping, since it called for freezing all taxes, not just those on property.
It was a sign of their members' frustration with the city's fiscal affairs and labor relations, and was particularly unusual for the Partnership, whose membership includes nonprofit groups. It has supported tax increases in the past and generally adopted a conciliatory approach to City Hall.
 
'Enough Is Enough'
 "We're not only moderates, we've supported taxes," said the president of both groups, Ronald K. Shelp. "But there's a real sense, not only among the business community, but, I think, citizens at large, that enough is enough."
Mayor David N. Dinkins's latest official plans call for $500 million in higher property taxes in each of the next three years, to help close projected annual budget deficits of $1.5 billion. Lately, he and his top aides have hinted that the city may propose some kind of partial tax freeze, or reduce selected taxes in an effort to spur the economy as it prepares its long-term financial plan for the next four years, to be released early next month.
But they have not been specific, and plan to offer only the most general outline of their goals for curbing costs at the Control Board's meeting today. A number of business people and fiscal monitors said they saw the Partnership's proposal, in a memo to Mr. Dinkins, as a way of keeping up the pressure on the Mayor, and mayoral aides said they saw it as a bargaining position.
If the Mayor vowed not to raise taxes for four years, it would extend beyond the expiration of his term in 1993, committing him far into the future or complicating matters for any successor.
 
'More Anxiety'
 "In 10 years, I have heard a lot of business people rail about the local government or the problems of high taxes and declining services," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit watchdog group financed by business. "But I've never heard it so forcefully expressed. There's more anxiety about the state of the city right now than I ever remember."
Mr. Dinkins's chief spokesman, Leland T. Jones, said the Partnership's position appeared to be based "on fairly simple mathematics and a fairly simply understanding of the service consequences" of cutting 30,000 full-time workers from the payroll over the next four years. That figure is based on the 220,000 workers financed entirely by city funds.
Since last fall, through layoffs, attrition and early retirement incentives, the administration has cut more than 10,000 jobs from the 247,000 posts financed by all funds, not including part-time workers or those employed by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, but it has not yet said how many more it plans to cut over the next four years.
The Partnership said it realized the difficulty of cutting so many jobs, and said it could not be done by layoffs or retirements alone but would require streamlining and reorganizing government functions, abandoning some and preserving others, freezing wages and changing union work rules and labor practices, reducing vacations and fringe benefits. The city has vowed to pursue similar options, so far without success.
Even as the Partnership warned of the dangers in the coming years, the city and state comptrollers said yesterday that the city may face gaps in its $28.5 billion budget for the current fiscal year, just three months after cobbling it together. City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, echoing her earlier assessment, put the gap at $419 million, because of lower tax revenues than the administration projects, and higher expenditures.
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said the budget may be out of whack by $283 million, because of greater than projected costs for labor, overtime pay and debt service on the city's bonds. City officials said they believed the budget was in balance, but they have drafted a $200 million contingency plan of cuts in spending for supplies and other programs if necessary.

How to Beat System On Third and Long

BYLINE: By Thomas George

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
Derrick Thomas knows what it is like to be young and full of despair and feel as if you are "a product of the system." He particularly understands that there is a direct link between education and self-esteem and effecting change.
He is a product of that system. 
 He is effecting change.
Before the Kansas City Chiefs clashed with the Buffalo Bills last night, Thomas, the Chiefs' rock-solid linebacker, reflected on growing up in Miami, growing up as a pro in Kansas City and on his Third and Long program, which seeks to help this city's inner-city youth understand that learning to read unlocks doors.
"I based my program on past experience," said the 24-year-old Thomas, who is in his third season with the Chiefs and who last season led the league in sacks with 20.
"I majored in criminal justice at Alabama, but before that I was a product of the system in Miami. From a period of age 11 through 16, I went through living two lives. I was a good kid -- well, a semi-good kid -- from 7:30 in the morning till 6 in the afternoon after football practice. At night I would go stand on the corner with the guys and get involved in all kinds of deviant acts.
"One fatal day I wound up in court in trouble and they took me out of public school for a year and put me into what was like a boot camp, the Day Marine Institute. I thought it was the worst thing that ever happened to me. I was a sophomore in high school and I thought my life was over. No football. No nothing.
"It turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I gained a positive outlook and learned to set goals and see them through. I gained friendships, even with the judge in Miami who sentenced me, that have lasted. I gained a sense of pride and the value of reading. I guess what I learned most was this: If you educate a youth, you've won half the battle.
"Once you educate, they have the ability to make decisions and better choices. I guess I always remember what a professor once told me. He said, 'Once you habilitate an individual, he can be rehabilitated.' And a counselor once told me, 'Derrick, if you want to help the youth the most, teach them one thing: how to read.' "
Thomas, who wears No. 58, has 58 youths in the program. Each Saturday before Chiefs home games, Thomas gathers his group at a library where stories are read by a librarian, himself and other Chiefs' players. Reading skills are practiced. He also offers them an annual Christmas party and always a receptive ear.
The program has given Thomas inspiration on the field. At 6 feet 3 inches and 236 pounds, he is listed as a right outside linebacker but often lines up on the left side and in passing situations becomes a defensive end.
Opponents have paid more attention to Thomas and had limited him to 11/2 sacks this season. But he had four sacks last night in the Chiefs' 33-6 victory. His play is a reason the Chiefs' defense entered the game with the American Conference's No. 4-ranked defense (seventh against the run and third against the pass), allowing only 12.6 points per game.
Last season, Thomas had seven sacks in a Chiefs game at home against Seattle. Before the game, Air Force pilots offered a spectacular air show over Arrowhead Stadium and one gave Thomas a bandanna the pilots wear, which he wore under his helment in the game.
Thomas's father, Robert, was an Air Force captain lost in Vietnam during an operation called Linebacker Two. He was declared legally dead in 1980 and remains Thomas's chief hero.
The Chiefs think they are a Super Bowl caliber team, but their offense has barely reached that level yet. Kansas City relies on a crunching ground game and a sporadic passing attack, but the defense and Thomas shine. Thus, developing a consistent offense is the final ingredient for the Chiefs to reach their goals.
Thomas thinks the offense will improve. It is all a matter, he said, of making the right moves and, against complex defenses, the right reads.
"Our defense has played well, but our offense hasn't clicked yet," he said. "We will get it together. You look around the N.F.L. and scoring is down everywhere. I think it's injuries to key people on offense, like Joe Montana with San Francisco and Randall Cunningham with Philadelphia. We've missed key people on offense due to injury, too. Teams are more interested in ball control after what the Giants did last year, but I think things will pan out in scoring by the end of the season.
"One of the things I hope to do with my group is to bring them closer to the N.F.L. and to football and their dreams and maybe to come up with some type of uniform for them. Some have designer clothes, others barely nothing. I want them to know that no matter what your economic situation, you walk into my program and you are equal. And reading? It wipes out a lot of silly craziness that they go through."

HEADLINE: Cooperation Treaty Is Signed to Bolster Regional Economy

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Officials from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and New York City took the first tentative steps yesterday toward fashioning a regional approach to economic problems, signing what amounted to a nonaggression pact.
The agreement, endorsed by economic development officials amid the splendor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, commits them to work toward keeping companies in the region and attracting new ones, instead of concentrating on soliciting each other's business. It calls for them to forswear advertising that casts aspersions on another area in the region. And it pledges them to market the three states together to attract overseas companies and to increase tourism. 
 Many members of the audience, who were mostly other officials from cities and counties within the region, expressed concern that translating enlightened statements into reality would be very difficult, considering the role that politics plays in generating a culture of economic competitiveness. Nothing in the pact binds counties or cities other than New York, and even for the signers and their agencies, the agreement sets goals, not mandates.
Several noted that less than 24 hours after the pact is signed, New Jersey's largest utility, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, will begin a new advertising campaign called "New Jersey in the 90's," which will promote the advantages of doing business in that state. The campaign, which will begin with an address by Governor Jim Florio, is aimed primarily at businesses in the New York City area. "It's time for the state to go on the offensive, to identify where New Jersey should fit into companies' expansion or relocation plans," said Stephen J. Kukan, the utility's general manager in charge of area development.
Westchester County ran a similar radio advertising campaign aimed at New York City companies that earned the enmity of city officials. But since county officials did not sign yesterday's agreement, they would not be precluded from running such a campaign again.
Despite the inevitable difficulties of getting people to change a decades-old philosophy, many participants cheered the group's willingness to take the first step.
"What's important is that the meeting happened," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association.
Until preparation for the conference began several months ago, many of the region's economic development officials had not even met their counterparts face to face.
 
New Friends in Strange Places
 Stephen Morello, New York State's deputy commissioner of advertising and marketing, described how strange it was to discuss joint policies with people with whom he normally is "locked in mortal combat."
Usually, he said, his job is to convince people that the Adirondacks are better than the Berkshires, the Alleghenies or the Ozarks. Now he also finds himself trying to design tour packages that will allow tourists to take advantage of the best sights in the three states.
Robert B. Reich, the professor at the Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government who delivered the lunchtime address in the museum's Temple of Dendur, praised the group for forsaking traditional beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
But he warned them to expect three powerful forces attempting to undermine their efforts: politicians whose main concern is announcing the arrival of a new company and with it, more jobs; the news media, which he said are geared to keeping track of jobs won or lost, and the business community, which he described as very adept at talking about public-private partnerships one minute and then demanding tax abatements the next.
Still, he said, "This is a great step forward that you're all here talking to each other."
In addition to endorsing general peace principles, the officials accepted recommendations from four task forces they had created. The task force in charge of forging a regional economic development policy recommended that the three states work toward precluding active solicitation of individual companies within the region. It also called for a regional legislative agenda and for efforts toward reducing public subsidies in retaining and attracting companies.
Sally Hernandez-Pinero, New York City's deputy mayor for finance and economic development, cited an example where New Jersey spent $30 million trying to keep one company from leaving, while she had to offer a package of $50 million in incentives to keep the commodities exchanges in New York City. "It seems to me we could have spent that money in a much better way," she said.
Those in the trenches, the men and women who actually sit down and talk with companies about tax incentives to keep them in place, agreed to meet at least once a quarter to develop a longterm regional economic strategy and programs to promote the region. They also pledged to avoid economic development programs designed exclusively to attract businesses from one part of the region to another.
 
An Invitation to France
 Although none of this amounts to an explicit promise to stop bidding against one another, Carl Weisbrod, the president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation, said their recommendations represented a feat nonetheless.
The marketing group recommended that the three states jointly produce promotional materials aimed at specific countries overseas and industries within them considered most promising for bringing new jobs and visitors into the region. Besides obvious countries like Japan, Germany, Britian and Canada, the group also recommended going after less-developed but potentially more lucrative markets like France, Italy, the Netherlands, Korea and Hong Kong.
The group identified several industries where it believed the region had the advantage: banking and insurance, telecommunications and information processing, biotechnology and medicine, and electronics. While none of the three states, all on tight budgets, have been able to afford to participate in national trade shows, the group suggested that by pooling their resources, the states could market as one.
The fourth task force, on developing international businesses, had the fewest new ideas. It agreed to explore sharing office space abroad, and to give Connecticut access to the special export telephone number of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The conference, conceived by Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, was financed by James D. Wolfensohn Inc., an investment advisory firm.

HEADLINE: Lower Lead Limits Are Made Official

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The Federal Government today officially lowered the threshold at which children are considered to have lead poisoning, thus increasing the number of children considered poisoned to four million or more from several hundred thousand.
The Federal Centers for Disease Control said that scientific evidence was "so overwhelming and compelling" that children suffer mental problems when their blood contains even 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood that the threshold of poisoning, 25 micrograms per deciliter, must be lowered. 
 Even below 10 micrograms, the centers said, adverse effects in children have been reported, and if the evidence continues to accumulate, a still lower standard may be needed.
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said all children should be tested for lead in their blood over the next few years, as cheaper and more convenient tests are developed. For now, he suggests that any parent who has concerns about the lead paint at home and has a child under 6 "should see their physician or go into their clinic" to get the child tested.
Children are typically exposed to lead by eating chips of lead paint or breathing in dust from the paint.
As he announced the new "threshold of concern" in Washington today, Dr. Sullivan called for a broad national program to clean up lead, particularly in houses. But he said that most of the burden of that program should fall on state and local governments rather than the Federal Government.
He said he has asked Congress for $14.9 million for the 1992 fiscal year for a testing program, an increase from $8 million from 1991. Dr. Henry Falk of the Centers for Disease Control said that amount would test only "some tens of thousands" of the millions of children considered poisoned under the new guidelines.
Beyond that small program, Dr. Sullivan said, other testing of children and houses and certification of contractors who perform the tests or clean up housing should be left to state and local governments or to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Dr. Sullivan said lead poisoning affected virtually every system in the body and was usually irreversible. "It has been linked to kidney disease and hypertension in adults," he said. But he said high lead levels were "especially devastating to children and fetuses and can cause learning disabilities and deficits in I.Q."
He said that American children from all social and economic groups were at risk. He said about four million children, or 17 percent of all American children, are believed to have lead in their blood at a level that requires intervention.
The new threshold represents a major increase in concern. In 1978 the Government banned lead in gasoline, and since then the amount of lead in children's blood has dropped greatly. But because children between 15 months and 6 years old can ingest large amounts of lead from paint dust or chips, the problem remains large.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, an author of a bill to end lead poisoning in children, criticized the Adminstration's position. "The urgent question raised by the new standard is, What are we going to do to help the millions of lead-poisoned children?" he said. "Unfortunately, the answer from the Administration is, 'not much.' "
Dr. Herbert Needleman, chairman of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, whose research was central in alerting regulators to the hazards of lead in children, said he was pleased with the new standard but disagreed with the Administration about what action should be taken.
He suggested requiring those selling their homes to have their houses tested for lead hazards, just as they do now for termites. He also suggested that the Government set standards to insure that those who test for lead and clean it up work according to reliable standards.
The Administration opposes a Federal role in those activities. And when Dr. Sullivan was asked today if he supported the right of a home owner, at a minimum, to find out if a house has already been tested and what the results were, he replied: "I would suggest we have a Secretary of Housing for that. I'm the Secretary of H.H.S. -- I have 250 programs I'm responsible for and I don't need additional ones."
An official of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, John C. Weicher, said he had no comment.
The new threshold today suggested the following action levels: between 10 and 14 micrograms, children should be tested more frequently and preventive measures in homes should be begun; between 15 and 19 micrograms, a child should get special nutritional information on lead poisoning and how the right diet might prevent damage from doses of lead. If blood levels this high continue, testing and cleaning up the child's environment is necessary. A level from 20 to44 micrograms would require medical tests, perhaps drug treatment to remove lead from blood, and a cleanup of the child's environment. Medical emergencies begin at 70 micrograms.

HEADLINE: Vietnamese Refugees, Reconsidered

 BODY:
Vietnam has tentatively agreed to accept the forced return of tens of thousands of its citizens who left, often risking their lives in dangerous, leaky boats. The agreement, worked out with Britain and the United Nations, could fall apart under strong objection from the United States.
That would be unfortunate. The U.S. has adamantly opposed forced repatriation of the Vietnamese. But circumstances, including U.S.-Vietnam relations, are changing and this new policy may be more realistic. Rather than block it, the U.S. ought to help insure that it is carried out fairly. 
 More than 100,000 refugees from Vietnam are now living in camps in Southeast Asia, about half in Hong Kong. Sympathy for these escapees probably peaked at Christmastime 1989, when Britain deported 51 boat people, mostly women and children, from Hong Kong to Hanoi.
Britain's action may have been crude, but it vividly underscored the need to distinguish between genuine political refugees, who have a "well-founded fear of persecution" in their homeland, and economic refugees, seeking to escape poverty.
By international agreement, political refugees deserve the most generous treatment. But the same preferences do not apply to those fleeing economic deprivation. That points to the need for proper and relatively uniform screening procedures to distinguish. As long as the procedures themselves do not violate human rights, those screened out as economic migrants are candidates for return.
It's not a happy result. But no country can let in everyone who wants in; governments are constantly forced to make these decisions. Hong Kong sends illegal immigrants back to China. The U.S. forcibly turns back boat people from Haiti.
In any case, forcible return for the Vietnamese is not, arguably, any less humane than requiring them to stay in squalid resettlement camps where they are subject to robberies, murder and suicide.
Since 1989, about 6,000 boat people declared to be economic migrants have already returned to Vietnam voluntarily. An international fund for refugees provides them with living allowances and U.N. monitors check to see that they are not persecuted.
The United States now has some leverage to help insure that those who are returned to Vietnam are treated humanely. Last year, a plan was sketched out to normalize U.S.-Vietnam relations. The prospect of economic benefits that would result from normalization ought to be a powerful incentive to Vietnam to treat its returnees decently -- and could ultimately discourage more economic migrants from fleeing the country.

HEADLINE: Airport Rail Portion of Cuomo Plan Must Offer Travelers More

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's public-works plan to revive New York City's economy (news article, Sept. 24) includes a light-rail service to La Guardia and Kennedy airports that ignores the lessons of the defunct Train to the Plane. Most travelers with more than one piece of luggage find subway stairs and multiple transfers too difficult. The real market for an airport rail system would most likely be the unencumbered business traveler. They would not be attracted by lower cost, but only by speed. 
 Successful airport links, such as London's, Boston's and Washington's are the fastest way to the central business district. The defunct service offered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was no swifter than bus or taxi. There is no evidence the proposed route, terminating in Long Island City, would be different.
Rail service could be made attractive only if the nonstop trip from Kennedy to Grand Central or Pennsylvania Station could be made in 30 minutes or less. Otherwise, taxis will be far more convenient and the rail link will become yet another financial burden to the M.T.A.

The Old Butler Ploy

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
President Bush says the media did it. Not the butler. The butler never does it anymore. Everybody's been on to the butler for years. It must have been 1913 when I first heard a kid coming out of a movie tell a pal who was waiting to get in, "Don't waste your nickel, the butler did it." If not earlier.
Anyhow the butler hasn't done it in years. This is because hardly anybody has a butler anymore. The people who can afford butlers nowadays are mostly in prison, which makes you wonder why you never hear anybody say, "The butler's boss did it." 
 So knowing he couldn't pin the rap on the butler, President Bush called a news conference the other day and said the media did it. In politics these days and even in high-flown ideological disputation, it is almost always the media that do the dirty deed.
At any given moment half the population is pinning the crime of the given moment on the media. Monitoring organizations, each as relentless as Javert tracking a stolen loaf of bread, are constantly alerting us to media depredations.
Still, it's surprising to find President Bush doing the Charlie Chan, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple number. Few Presidents have been jollied so tirelessly by the media. The burbling of journalists in print and television about Mr. Bush's mastery of practically everything can make you grind your molars down to stubs if you hold that the journalist's first duty is to keep an eye open for clay feet on the mightiest of gods.
But back to our story: It was a Friday on television. CNN featured Robert Gates, Bush's nominee to run the C.I.A. Gates was insisting that, if given the job, he would never refuse to tell Presidents things those Presidents didn't want to hear.
This foolhardy announcement seemed to mark Gates as hopelessly unqualified for the job considering the history of what usually happens to people who tell Presidents what they don't want to hear, which is that they don't last long. Anybody remember George Ball?
In Lyndon Johnson's reign, Johnson officially authorized Ball to tell him things he didn't want to hear. The deal was Johnson wouldn't make Ball disappear, he just wouldn't pay any attention to what Ball told him. So Ball told him he couldn't win in Vietnam and Johnson, keeping his end of the deal, ignored Ball and saw his Presidency destroyed by losses in Vietnam.
While Gates on CNN was reminding us of the reckless foolishness of telling Presidents what they don't want to hear, Bush interrupted with a news conference to counter Democratic efforts to depict him as indifferent to the shabby state of the country's domestic affairs.
Somebody at the office had obviously made bold to tell him the Democrats were scoring with the line that while he was a crackerjack President of the Whole Darn World, as President of the United States he left a lot to be desired. What's more, the economy wasn't too good either.
Such counsel goes to the problem of what Presidents must do to win the next election, one field in which most of them will tolerate hearing what they'd rather not. So the President spoke a good deal about "domestic agenda," as though to say: "Here now! Who dares say I'm too dazzled about being President of the Whole Darn World to be deeply involved in our domestic problems?"
What gave the public the unfair impression that he had time only for international problems? You guessed it, folks: the media. All that coverage the media devoted to foreign affairs distorted the public's idea of the true nature of his toil.
Take this very news conference. He had summoned the media to talk about the economy and how to get it hopping again by cutting the tax on income from capital gains, for instance. Yet these media people had persistently changed the subject to foreign affairs.
He had obviously come prepared to nail down his case, for he picked up a sheet of paper and said he'd been keeping score: how many questions on domestic issues, how many on foreign? He didn't give his tally, but the Times reporter, Andrew Rosenthal, later counted a total of 26 questions, 10 of them on domestic affairs, which may be enough to convict if the jury is saturated with great sound bites.
Makes you wish they'd bring back the butler.

HEADLINE: Airport Rail Portion of Cuomo Plan Must Offer Travelers More;
Let's Get on With It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The seemingly lukewarm response of New York City officials to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's plan to revitalize New York's economy with a sweeping public-works program (news story, Sept. 25) is hard to fathom. To question how such a plan might benefit New York is to ignore established economic theory and more than a century's experience throughout Western society. Major construction programs send a powerful boost rippling through an ailing economy. 
 New York, where business development is reeling from the twin blows of recession and sharpened global competition, needs to move forward with the Governor's bold plan -- and quickly.

Toshiba Rewrites a Hollywood Script

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
From a distance, Time Warner's talks with two big Japanese companies about a billion- dollar investment in the debt-laden American company seem familiar: another Japanese effort to buy into Hollywood and the software that will be critical for the next generation of consumer electronics.
But to hear the executives of the Toshiba Corporation talk, an alliance with Time Warner Inc. is very different from the recent forays of the Sony Corporation and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. 
 When Sony bought Columbia Pictures Inc. in 1989 and Matsushita purchased MCA Inc., the parent of Universal Studios, last year, both companies seemed intent on becoming Hollywood moguls. Only by buying an entire studio, both companies reasoned, could they get the expertise and the ill-defined synergy between hardware and software they needed.
Now the accepted wisdom in Tokyo, echoed in Los Angeles, is that both Sony and Matsushita are being milked for cash by their Hollywood partners. That may say volumes about why Toshiba is proceeding cautiously to work out its investment in Time Warner, the second-largest cable operator in the United States and a producer of cable shows through its Home Box Office.
Time Warner's chairman, Steven J. Ross, is currently in Japan, but it is likely that it will be a while before he completes the final negotiations on the $1 billion investment -- half from Toshiba and half from C. Itoh & Company, the giant Japanese trading concern. Together, the two Japanese companies would get a 12 percent stake in a new venture that would comprise most of Time Warner's film, cable and pay-television business.
Unlike its crosstown rivals, though, Toshiba seems uninterested in anything more than a loose link to Warner's movie business, saying it does not want to depend on the fortunes of hit movies for its profits. But cable television is another story, particularly as Toshiba feels an increasing squeeze in its traditional computer chip and electronics businesses.
"The first thing you have to understand about this deal is that it is not about the movies, it is about cable television," a senior executive of Toshiba said the other day, asking to remain anonymous because the company is not officially discussing the Time Warner talks. "We expect we will learn a lot about the entertainment business," he said, "but that is secondary."
 
Emergence of Cable
 While the cable market is nearly saturated in the United States, it has spread slowly in Japan, where direct broadcasting from satellites to small rooftop antennas has been the favored method of giving viewers a wider choice of programming.
But gradually, cable is starting to take off. And Toshiba sees tremendous possibilities for interactive cable systems that can bring this video-addicted society in-home services ranging from banking to custom-made business-news programs.
"The problem," the Toshiba executive said, "is that we have none of the software expertise. And Time Warner has no ability to develop the hardware" for things like interactive television.
For Time Warner, Toshiba's view of the future of television hardware -- from high-definition television to interactive television -- is crucial. C. Itoh also has ventures in satellite broadcasting and owns a number of cable television properties in Japan.
It was C. Itoh, according to several people involved in the deal, that introduced Time Warner to Toshiba after shopping the investment around to Hitachi Ltd. and other Japanese electronics companies. It is an unusual alliance because Toshiba is loosely tied to the Mitsui group, which includes one of C. Itoh's biggest trading rivals. Such relationships across "keiretsu," or affiliated companies, are still relatively rare in Japan.
One Time Warner area Toshiba does not appear interested in now is the politically sensitive business of publishing magazines, which one senior Toshiba executive characterized earlier this year as a "political time bomb." Time Warner publishes Time, People, Sports Illustrated and other magazines.
Toshiba is still smarting from the 1987 Toshiba Machine scandal, in which one of its subsidiaries was caught illegally shipping machine tools to the Soviet Union. The scandal, and the company's handling of it, was a bitter lesson about American politics. Though the parent company appeared to have no knowledge of the transaction, its leadership resigned and Congress imposed trade sanctions against it.
Toshiba also does not seem to feel the need to integrate the Warner Brothers studio into its consumer electronics plans. "Whether Toshiba or C. Itoh can make this work is up to them," said Michael P. Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony U.S.A., who has chosen a different path. "With Columbia Pictures, we have an openness, a willingness to exchange ideas, that from the Sony side we never would have had with an outsider."
But the limited nature of the proposed Toshiba-Warner alliance -- at least at its initial stages -- also reflects the fact that Toshiba is a far different company than Sony and Matsushita, with very different strengths.
While consumer electronics is Sony's and Matsushita's core business, Toshiba's might is in semiconductors, computing and industrial electronics. And that is where Toshiba's somewhat conservative chief executive, Joichi Aoi, is still betting the future lies.
 
Year of Heavy Spending
 Toshiba has been spending heavily this year -- about $2.5 billion on research and development and another $3.8 billion on new plants and equipment. Much of that is directed toward manufacture of a new generation of powerful 16-megabit memory chips in volume.
"You need to go ahead and build, even in recessions, if you are to stay ahead in this business," Mr. Aoi said earlier this year, "especially in semiconductors and computers." He conceded that "consumer electronics has been going through a decline" that few at Toshiba think will be reversed anytime soon.
Still, Toshiba wants to transform its consumer business. "Japanese electronics companies cannot anticipate another boom product like the Walkman until high-definition television takes off," said Mike Jeremy, the technology analyst at Baring Securities in Tokyo. "They have calculated that the cost of continuing to do what they are doing at the moment in consumer electronics will soon result in a decline in profitability. And so when a debt-laden company like Warner appears, it is an opportunity to make some money in a new part of the business and transform their image rather cheaply."
Mr. Aoi may also be motivated by the fact that Toshiba's core businesses are facing more profitability troubles than at any time in several years. In the computer-chip business, Toshiba's early dominance has been challenged by rivals, and in a weak market prices are low.
"They are definitely having trouble" because of the weakness in demand for the four-megabit chip, said Peter G. Wolff, who follows the company for Kidder, Peabody & Company in Tokyo. "They are postponing the investment on the 16-megabit as long as possible, but these chips are not as profitable as they once were."
Nor are Toshiba's other big hits of the late 1980's: laptop and notebook computers.
Toshiba was the pioneer of the laptop and captured the lead before other computer makers realized that portable computing would be a gold mine. But over the last 18 months, it has lost is magic touch, particularly in the United States.
While the company produced the first notebooks sold in Japan, it did not adapt its machines for the American market fast enough. As its products began to look dated, several top officials left the company and a host of clone makers raced in.
The early evidence suggests that Toshiba's 1991 market share in notebooks will be well below last year's 21 percent. There have already been layoffs in Irvine, Calif., where Toshiba manufactures many of its American products. And the problems continue: the NEC Corporation has beaten the company to market with a color version of its lightweight notebooks in Japan, and the Compaq Computer Corporation just announced a similar machine in the United States.
Toshiba's recovery depends mostly on the success of a new generation of notebook computers with color screens, which it is developing in a joint venture with the International Business Machines Corporation. But the product is not likely to be available until next year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher as Skepticism Is Voiced on Lower Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced in world trading yesterday amid renewed skepticism that American interest rates were heading lower.
Gold prices subsided worldwide on profit taking. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $357.60 an ounce, off $1.70 from Monday. The Republic National Bank of New York said later that gold had fallen $1.95, to $356.80 an ounce. 
 Trading was active, with the dollar posting its strongest gains against the Japanese yen, which has rallied over the last week, and the German mark. The dollar returned above the critical 130 level against the yen and broke technical barriers against the mark.
Helping to drive trading were "diminished expectations that the Federal Reserve is going to ease interest rates," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with IDEA, an advisory firm.
He said the market interpreted proposals outlined by President Bush yesterday on the nation's tight credit situation as being "in lieu of a Fed easing." Lower interest rates affect the dollar negatively because they lessen the value of dollar-denominated securities.
Separately, some nervousness occurred before the meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers this weekend in Thailand. Some market participants are said to be having second thoughts that the ministers of the leading industrialized nations will take steps to support a stronger yen to ease Japan's trade surpluses.
Fund managers and corporations were active dollar buyers, and many traders speculated that the dollar was poised for an advance, at least against the European currencies.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 129.93 Japanese yen, from 129.53 yen on Monday. Later in London, it advanced further, to 130.10 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 130.17 yen, up from 129.40 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7140, from $1.7360 late on Monday. In New York, it cost $1.7070 to buy one pound, less than $1.7335 on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Monday, included: 1.6990 German marks, up from 1.6805; 1.4875 Swiss francs, up from 1.4735; 5.7865 French francs, up from 5.7230; 1,269.50 Italian lire, up from 1,255.50, and 1.1285 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1293.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Money Supply Doesn't Tell All

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
FROM the White House to Wall Street, everybody is watching the weekly money supply numbers as if the economy's life depended on them. And some people who have been leaning on the Federal Reserve to ease for years, including the Bush Administration, have seized on anemic money growth as a rationale for pressing the Fed to lower short-term rates -- already the lowest since 1973 -- some more.
But Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs, contends that the latest obsession with the money supply is a little crazy, if not downright dangerous. Money growth is not a reliable guide to the economy's direction in the short run, he said. So tying Fed policy too mechanically to the money supply risks supplying more stimulus than the economy can safely handle and a future inflation flare-up. 
 The mechanical notion popular now is that the pace of money growth dictates, with a delay of a quarter or two, the pace of the economy's growth. It is an appealing idea partly because the relationship does hold perfectly over long stretches of time and partly because the money supply did stall last summer. Had the Fed reacted more quickly, some recent converts to monetarism say, the recession might have been avoided.
The Fed's favorite measure of the money supply is M-2, a broad amalgam of most checking and saving deposits in households, including certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds.
What makes many people anxious is that M-2 has expanded by just 2.5 percent in the last year, less than the Fed's lowest target for it of 2.6 percent. Indeed, for the last few months, the money supply has actually been shrinking. The only other time that happened for any length of time was from 1928 to 1933 when, as one businessman put it, money was sleeping. Hence the worry.
But the relationship between money and the economy is not all that tight, Mr. Giordano argued, and the money supply has sent some spectacularly wrong signals in the past.
In the 1970's changes in M-2 preceded, more or less reliably, shifts in the G.N.P. by a couple of quarters. But more recently M-2 and the economy have occasionally gone separate ways. In 1986, while M-2 raced, the economy ground to a halt. In 1987, when M-2 started to crawl, the economy took off. "If money were all that mattered," Mr. Giordano wrote, "real G.N.P. would have been flat from 1987 to 1989, and the recession would have arrived much sooner."
One reason for the breakdown, he said, is that people seem to be getting by with less cash and smaller bank balances. With more choices, consumers are freer to shift their money. From mid-1984 through 1986, the difference between long- and short-term rates averaged around three percentage points, and nearly $200 billion of household assets flowed into bond mutual funds. Such funds, which offer more liquidity than C.D.'s, were not widely available before 1983. The net inflow into bond mutual funds so far this year has been around $80 billion to $90 billion. Time deposits and money market mutual funds account for almost the entire shortfall in M-2 growth, which would have approached an 8 percent rate without them.
But other forces are also holding down money. One is that banks are reducing deposit rates because they do not need the money. Instead, they are trying to bolster their capital. Banks with bigger capital cushions are likely to be rewarded by the stock market and find it easier to get permission to enter new businesses.
The activities of the Resolution Trust Corporation are also depressing money growth. Assets it takes over are financed with Government debt, which is not part of the money supply, and are no longer bank liabilities, which are. Government borrowing to cover thrift liquidations amounts to $32 billion this year and held M-2 down by a percentage point, Mr. Giordano estimates.
Other measures of liquidity are looking livelier. The stock and bond markets are awash with funds. Commodity prices have recently firmed. The dollar has weakened. The gap between long- and short-term interest rates is wide. And the premium between AAA and BBB credits is very narrow. When there is little liquidity, lenders charge less creditworthy borrowers large premiums.
No one can ever be sure that stagnant money growth is not a portent of an economic downturn. But simply assuming that it is -- and putting pressure on the Fed to crank up the printing presses -- carries its own risks. At the very least, devotees of M-2 could wait until the G.N.P. report for the third quarter, due Oct. 29, comes out to see whether the economy's actual performance confirms or contradicts the story told by the money supply.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Drop Sharply in Week

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts continued to decline briskly for the week that ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, the publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., that focuses on interest rates.
"New York's biggest commercial banks have cut short-term certificate of deposit yields by 29 basis points since the prime rate was lowered on Sept. 13," said Robert K. Heady, The Monitor's publisher. "Assuming the strong downward direction in yields continues at its present pace, the banks' cost of funds would be lowered by 50 basis points by mid-November." (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) 
 "Based on past history," Mr. Heady added, "that could set the stage for further easing by the Federal Reserve System at that time."
Mr. Heady says he thinks an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve will come by the middle of next month.
Bank of New York Acts
According to The Monitor, the largest change in C.D. yields at New York area banks in the last week was made by the Bank of New York, which lowered its yield on its six-month certificate of deposit by 37 basis points, to 4.86 percent. It also dropped the yield on its three-month certificate by the largest amount among the banks, 53 basis points, to 4.60 percent.
In the case of yields on money market accounts, the largest cut was made by Astoria Federal Savings in Queens. It reduced its yield by 21 basis points, to 5.12 percent.
Among the commercial banks in New York, the average yield was cut to 4.70 percent, or a decline of 2 basis points on money market accounts, while the yields on their three-month certificates were off by 9 basis points, to 4.92 percent.
 
Savings Institutions' Yields Fall
 For depositors at savings institutions in the New York area, yields were cut by an average of 4 basis points, to 5.29 percent, on money market accounts and by 3 basis points, to 5.36 percent, on three-month C.D.'s.
Nationwide, according to The Monitor, the average yields of 20 leading banks outside the New York region were cut by 3 basis points, to 4.95 percent on money market accounts, and by 4 basis points, to 5.20 percent, on six-month certificates.
At the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction on Monday, the three-month bill was auctioned at an average discount rate of 5.04 percent, compared with a rate of 5.11 the previous Monday, while the rate on the six-month bill averaged 5.08 percent, compared with 5.14 percent a week ago.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Mixed in Slow Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in slow trading yesterday, as credit market participants bid up prices of short-term issues and sold longer-dated notes and bonds.
Analysts attributed the strength among shorter-term issues to suspicions that the Federal Reserve Board might be gradually moving its target for the overnight Federal funds rate down another notch, to 5 percent. 
 For the third straight day, the Fed allowed the overnight rate for bank loans to trade at 5 1/8 percent, below the 5 1/4 percent level that is widely seen as the Fed's target. The Fed could have undertaken open-market operations to lift the rate back to the target level but did not do so.
 
Below Level Through Day
 "We have not seen the funds rate trade under its target for this long a period in many, many months," one Government securities trader said.
The funds rate remained below the current target level throughout the day, and traded as low as 5 1/16 percent.
"The consensus on the Street is that the Fed hasn't moved," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and analysis on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets. "But the funds rate trading consistently under 5.25 percent the past few days is a reason to scratch your head and wonder what is going on."
Ever since market participants misinterpreted the meaning of a Fed move just before Thanksgiving in 1989, the central bank has taken pains to send unambiguous signals about its policy intentions.
 
Action May Come Soon
 If the Fed is not lowering the funds rate at the moment, there remains a strong sense that it will soon.
Lincoln F. Anderson, an economic analyst at Fidelity Investments, the Boston mutual fund company, said the Fed would need to do more to spur the economy.
"At 5.25 percent, the funds rate is a lot lower than it was a year ago," Mr. Anderson said. "But inflation is a lot lower now than it was a year ago, and nominal growth in the gross national product has slowed more than rates have fallen."
Many economists note that in past recessions a sustained recovery did not commence until the funds rate fell below the economy's rate of growth.
Efforts announced yesterday by the Bush Administration to ease the tight credit situation and spur bank lending were seen as the main reason that traders sold long-term Treasury issues, even though analysts said the reforms were modest.
Before the changes were announced, rumors circulated that the Treasury would allow banks to use Treasury securities to satisfy reserve requirements, a move that would spur demand. That step, however, was not one of the measures announced yesterday.
 
Secondary Market Prices
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 103 3/8, down 3/8 point, to yield 7.81 percent, compared with 7.78 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 3/32, down 10/32, to yield 7.42 percent. But the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes rose by 1/32, to a late offered price of 100 14/32, to yield 5.88 percent.
In advance of today's auction of new seven-year Treasury notes, the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.17 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.99 percent late yesterday, down three basis points, or three one-hundredths of percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.03 percent.
 
High-Yield Pace Quickens
In other developments, the pace of new-issue activity in the high-yield junk bond market quickened yesterday, as two companies offered investors a total of $225 million worth of securities. On Monday, the Century Communications Corporation sold $204 million worth of high-yield debt.
Yesterday P&C Food priced an offering of $125 million worth of ten-year securities through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 11.50 percent notes were priced at $100, or par. They are rated Ba-3 by Moody's Investors Service and B by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
American Medical International priced a $100 million offering of senior secured notes.
The 11 percent notes, which mature Oct. 15, 2000, were priced at $100, or par.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated Ba-3 by Moody's and B-plus by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the high-yield market said both issues sold out quickly.
In large part, the sudden spurt in new high-yield issues is seen as a response to the announcement late last week that RJR Nabisco intended to retire significant amounts of high-yield securities with the proceeds from a stock sale.
Elsewhere, participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bond market said prices of most issues were little changed in slow trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point, traders said.

HEADLINE: BUSH EASES RULES IN EFFORT TO SPUR LENDING BY BANKS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
President Bush approved a series of regulatory measures today that he said would encourage banks to make new loans and stimulate the economy, but the announcement was viewed by bankers as a largely symbolic response to growing political pressures.
Taking steps to alleviate what he called a "credit crunch," the President said the measures were intended to "insure that we have sound banks making sound loans." He added that more steps would be taken, but he did not specify them. 
 Most of the measures in today's package were announced in less detail seven months ago, and today's statement from the Treasury Department used language that was virtually identical in many places to its March 1 news release on the subject.
 
Indication of Worry
 The presentation today as a package of new measures was a clear indication of the White House's concern about the sluggish condition of the economy 13 months before the 1992 Presidential election.
Worried that voters may perceive Mr. Bush as concentrating on foreign policy and not interested in pocketbook issues, the White House has gone to lengths recently to make it appear that Mr. Bush is on top of the situtation. [Page D1.]
Today's announcement also included the outlines of two new proposals, neither of which has yet been fully developed. One would permit bank officers who believe that their institutions have been unfairly treated by examiners to circumvent the usual process and appeal instead directly and secretly to supervisors in Washington.
 
In Line With International Rules
 The other would give the banks more flexibility in raising capital, presumably freeing them to make more loans. Many other countries now permit banking companies to treat a greater amount of their preferred stock as capital than the United States does. Several years ago, the United States signed the Basel Accord, an international agreement that standardized banking requirements. When it takes effect, the new measure will bring American regulatory practice into line with most other countries.
A third part of the package involves the important area of valuing real estate. The Administration said the guidelines were being drafted and might be completed by the end of the month. The guidelines would cover how banks classify loans and when they recognize losses.
The issue of the weak economy is so politically charged that the Cabinet has been deeply divided for some time over whether the regulatory package should have been announced much earlier and been more substantial, according to a senior Administration official close to the President.
The official, an economic policy maker who insisted on not being identified, said that four Cabinet members had urged the President to act sooner, but that they had been resisted by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. The official said the four were the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Jack E. Kemp; Labor Secretary Lynn M. Martin; Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner.
 
No Enthusiasm From Industry
 Industry reaction was largely unenthusiastic.
"There is a certain amount of silly season talk in response to an economy that is sputtering," said Herbert M. Sandler, chairman and chief executive of World Savings and Loan Association of Oakland, Calif., a $25 billion institution that is the nation's third-largest savings association and widely considered among the best managed.
"They're saying to examiners and bankers, 'be prudent,' " Mr. Sandler said. "But, of course, that is what they should have been doing in the first place. All this talk about a credit crunch is overblown. The people who aren't getting loans are those who got them in the 80's and shouldn't have. The good borrowers just aren't coming in to borrow."
Robert E. Litan, a banking specialist at the Brookings Institution who was on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration, called the proposal "thin gruel."
 
Reaction in Congress
 Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee, accused the President of "playing games with bank regulation as a cover for the Administration's economic failures."
Mr. Gonzalez singled out the idea to permit bankers to go over the heads of examiners when they disagree with regulatory decisions as particularly dangerous. He said it would have a "chilling effect on examiners."
The Administration has tried to blame regulators for the anemic recovery. In the March announcement, Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson referred to bank examiners as terrorists. His language today was more muted, perhaps in response to vigorous objections from the nation's top regulators, including L. William Seidman, the departing chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and William Taylor, head of the Fed's bank supervision division, whose confirmation as Mr. Seidman's successor is expected shortly..
"We believe that regulation has been a contributing factor to limited credit availability," Mr. Robson said at a news briefing this afternoon. "It is by no means the only factor. We're trying to bring that factor back into balance."
 
Clearly on the Defensive
 But, Mr. Robson and other Administration officials, clearly on the defensive, asserted that the new guidelines were not tantamount to the 1980's style of deregulation, in which the savings and loan crisis occurred.
The bankers "need to know the situation is not going to be one of all the regulators hitting them either with powder puffs or with chain saws," Mr. Robson said. "You want to be somehwere in the middle."
Some industry representatives, including the American Bankers Association, the largest bank trade group, said they were encouraged because the steps showed that tight credit had become an important item on the President's agenda.
"It's important, if only because these are now Presidential concerns," said Robert H. Dugger, chief economist at the American Bankers Association.
Mr. Bush acknowledged during a picture-taking ceremony that the package was "not going to cure the whole thing, but we're trying to do everything an Administration can to assist an economy that we think is moving out" of recession.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Vows To 'Contain' Tax Growth

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins pledged yesterday to hold down taxes, to build up reserve funds to weather future fiscal storms and to cut New York City's work force further to keep its budget balanced over the next four years.
Reporting to the State Financial Control Board, Mr. Dinkins said he would "contain the overall level of tax growth" to "make sure it is well below" the $500 million annual property tax increases that he had previously planned to help close projected deficits in each of the next three years. He did not offer to freeze taxes, as some business and civic groups and the City Council have urged, but he did not flatly rule it out. 
 His language, carefully couched as it was, represented his strongest statement yet of his intention to avoid more taxes, on top of the big tax increases of recent years.
Mr. Dinkins said he was also committed to "significant work force reduction" and indicated he was prepared to lay off more workers if municipal unions did not agree to productivity savings and to concessions on wages, benefits and work rules. But he did not specify how many more jobs he planned to trim from the payroll of a quarter-million workers.
 
A 'Rainy Day Fund'
 The Mayor also proposed to create a special "rainy day fund" of unspecified size as a cushion against future economic downturns "so that we can keep taxes stable even in the toughest times." He did not say where he would get the money for this fund, which would require changes in state law to allow the city to roll over surpluses from year to year. But he suggested that some of the $1 billion in aid he was seeking from the Municipal Assistance Corporation could be used.
Mr. Dinkins's monthly report to the Financial Control Board, a state body set up to oversee the city's finances in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, amounted to buying time until he submits his formal four-year plan to the board next month for bringing the city's spending into line with revenues.
City and state officials said top mayoral aides were still debating what the administration's tax proposals should be, with some arguing for a total freeze and others for annual increases of one-half to one-quarter of the $500 million annual increases Mr. Dinkins had been counting on to help close projected deficits of $1.5 billion in each of the next three years. Still others were said to be urging that the Mayor make no definite promises.
 
'The Basics Are There'
 Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up by the state to borrow money on the city's behalf, has repeatedly conditioned its aid on a plan by the city to hold down taxes and cut costs.
Yesterday, Mr. Rohatyn said, "I think the Mayor has the main elements -- the basics are there." But he added, "to be truly credible, his plan should include the agreement, the support of labor" in paring costs while preserving vital services.
Municipal labor leaders have repeatedly resisted concessions until they see a plan for avoiding further layoffs and spelling out what the unions would receive in return.
 
'A Leaky Bucket'
 "This is a non-event today," said Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. "We would have been surprised if anything different had happened. The city is attempting to carry this water itself, and it's got a leaky bucket and it's getting its head wet. Without us as partners, they're going to fail."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who heads the control board, praised the Mayor for outlining his goals, but he said that the city still had to come up with a very specific plan by next month and that he would wait until then before passing judgment. He, too, said he believed it would be best if the city won the unions' cooperation.
Yesterday afternoon, the Mayor and the Governor met again to discuss cooperation on a range of issues, including Mr. Cuomo's pledge to have the state begin assuming the city's Medicaid costs.
On the Mayor's tax plans, Richard Riley, a spokesman for the New York City Partnership and the New York Chamber of Commerce, which on Monday called for a four-year tax freeze, said the Mayor was "going in the right direction, but so far he hasn't gone far enough."

HEADLINE: Regional Group Agrees to Increase Penalties on Haiti

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Organization of American States today agreed on a plan to toughen economic sanctions against the new Government of Haiti and also offered to send a civilian O.A.S. observer force to Port-au-Prince to help restore democracy.
The O.A.S. officials met in emergency session at their Washington headquarters after an O.A.S. delegation visiting Haiti on Monday failed to negotiate a return to power of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected President. 
 O.A.S. officials insist that their team was close to negotiating a deal with Haiti's coup leaders for Father Aristide's return, under conditions that would have limited some of his powers, before military opponents of Father Aristide surrounded the Parliament and lawmakers named Justice Joseph Nerette of the Supreme Court as provisional President.
 
Rejects Interim Leader
 In an effort to pressure the coup leaders into resuming negotiations, the O.A.S. officials met throughout the day to hammer out a resolution that included the following key points, they said:
First, the O.A.S. officials categorically rejected recognizing the appointment of Justice Nerette, who was sworn in today, as provisional President, a move that the United States took the lead on earlier in the day.
"On the vote that was taken in the Parliament last night," the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said, "our view is that there is no constitutional vacancy and we will not recognize a provisional government.
"President Aristide was forced from office illegally by force of arms," she continued. "The Parliament acted yesterday at gunpoint. The legislators did not vote. They were forced to sign a petition. We do not accept the Parliament's forced action as a legitimate constitutional action."
Second, the O.A.S. resolution toughened earlier economic sanctions imposed on Haiti immediately after the coup on Sept. 30, by "urging" all member states to impose a total trade embargo against the impoverished island state, and particularly a cutoff of its oil supplies. Both Venezuela and Mexico, Haiti's primary oil sources, indicated that they would insure a total cutoff.
 
A Call to Freeze Assets
 The resolution also urged all governments in the Hemisphere to freeze Haitian assets, a move that only the United States has taken so far. The first O.A.S. resolution on Haiti passed on Oct. 2, two days after the coup, "recommended" that all 34 member states suspend their economic, financial and commercial ties with Haiti, as well as any aid and technical cooperation. Not all countries, however, have carried out those recommendations as tightly as has the United States, which cut off all $85 million of its economic aid.
Third, the O.A.S. officials said they were ready to accede to a request by Mr. Aristide that the O.A.S. dispatch a force made up of several hundred civilians that could mediate disputes between Haitian factions and monitor compliance of any agreements reached among them.
The proposed force would not be an invasion force, or a peace-keeping contingent, officials stressed, but rather something closer to the sort of mission that monitored the Haitian elections in December or worked to mediate disputes in Nicaragua between its rival factions. Officials said that as it was now being considered, the civilian force would only go to Haiti if invited in by all sides. All of the details, particularly questions of what sort of protection such a civilian team would be accorded, would have to be negotiated with the current leadership in Haiti, as well as with Father Aristide.
 
Limits on Aristide
 The logic underlying such a force is that the O.A.S. still wants Father Aristide returned to power, but given the intense opposition to him from certain elements in the Haitian military and parliament, O.A.S. officials are convinced that he could only come back in the context of an agreement that limited some of his powers, enjoined him to keep his popular mass supporters from intimidating opponents and insured that he did not take any retribution against the military that ousted him.
"The idea of the force would be to help create a sense of security throughout the country, as the O.A.S. did during the elections," one O.A.S. official said.
"The O.A.S. team that was just there came back impressed by the total distrust and fear that elements of the Parliament and the military have for Aristide and vice versa," the official said. "The idea is that Aristide might want someone around to assure him from threats by the army, and the army and the parliament might want someone around to make sure that Aristide does not abuse his powers again and use mob violence against them."
 
Exile in Venezuela
 Father Aristide, from his side, took the first step toward inviting in such a force by sending a letter from his exile home in Caracas, Venezuela, to the O.A.S. Secretary General, Joao Baena Soares, asking for such a mission. The tone and content of the letter also addressed some of the concerns expressed by the Bush Administration over Father Aristide's human rights record. Those concerns have led the Bush Administration in recent days to distance itself slightly from the Father Aristide, although American officials insist that they still prefer to see him restored to power over any other alternative.
In his letter sent Monday to the O.A.S. and released today, Father Aristide said that "I, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, solemly declare that the only solution to the deep crisis now affecting my country lies in peacefully restoring democracy with full respect for the Constitution, national institutions and the human rights of all Haitians."
O.A.S. officials said one of the problems they have now in trying to mediate in the Haiti crisis is that no one seems to be in charge in Haiti. The newly appointed President seems to take his orders from the coup leaders, and the coup leaders seem to be taking their orders from their enlisted men.

HEADLINE: Soviet Republics Back Gorbachev on Nuclear Cuts

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The four major Soviet republics with nuclear missile bases have been consulted on the latest disarmament initiatives and support President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Soviet officials said today. The officials insisted that Mr. Gorbachev's powers in the arms area were not eroding with the integrity of the union.
With the dissolution of the monolithic Soviet Union, there has been uncertainty and concern about the future control of the long-range nuclear missile bases in the Russian federation, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Byelorussia, even as President Bush and President Gorbachev make further pledges and proposals for disarmament. 
 But Kremlin officials insisted at a news conference that the initiatives were not being resisted and were being supported in the four republics. The indulgence of separate sovereignties and caution about union relations are now the hallmark of post-Communist politics in the republics, where views differ on how to deal with de facto membership in the nuclear club.
Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksei Obukhov, one of the principal Soviet arms negotiators, said the four republics had been kept up to date and consulted on the latest disarmament plans, in which President Gorbachev has matched or exceeded a range of unilateral reductions announced last month by President Bush. These include Mr. Gorbachev's pledge to reduce strategic warheads by an additional 1,000 beyond planned treaty limits to a total of 5,000 warheads.
In particular, President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federation, whose vast republic contains most of the strategic missiles, was "fully informed" on the current disarmament consultations and "accepted and approved them," Mr. Obukhov said.
Mr. Yeltsin, whose power has grown with the waning of the union, has been on a vacation retreat and has not commented on any involvement in the disarmament consultations.
Since the collapse of the union after the failed hard-line coup in August, Mr. Yeltsin has maintained that, to better guard against nuclear war ever occurring, the nuclear arms issue was no longer a matter solely for the Kremlin but must be one of joint jurisdiction with the republics where the missiles are based.
Tonight, the Interfax news agency reported that the Foreign Minister of the Russian republic, Andrei Kozyrev, met with an American disarmament consultant now visiting Moscow, First Deputy Secretary of State Reginald Bartholomew, to discuss republic proposals to cut strategic warheads even deeper than President Gorbachev's most recent proposal. There was no comment reported by Mr. Bartholomew but the incident was evidence of how unpredicatble the disarmament subject has grown in the dissolved union.
Leaders of the Ukraine, where separatist fervor is strongest, have proposed making the republic free of nuclear weapons. But the precise details of how the this might occur have been left unsettled while the republic points towards a full declaration of independence and presidential elections in December. Some politicians have noted that the fate of the missiles could prove a valuable bargaining lever in future relations among the old union's sovereign republics.
Mr. Yeltsin has offered to store the other republics' missiles on Russian soil. But this idea has not been immediately endorsed and has in some cases fed the traditional fear that Russia, the largest and wealthiest of the republics, will come to dominate whatever survives of the post-Communist Soviet Union.
The nation's republics have been in political disarray since the collapse of the union, trying to create a decentralized economic community and talking vaguely of reviving some sort of looser political union rooted in republic sovereignty. Today, with Mr. Yeltsin still on vacation, his Vice President, Aleksandr Rutskoi, complained that "anarchy is descending on the republic" in the face of "mountains" of new laws that do little to solve the basic economic and political crisis.
Mr. Rutskoi, facing increasing intramural squabbling among the many factions of Russian politics, unexpectedly urged caution about the proposed free-market economic compact supposedly endorsed in theory last week by most republics, including Russia. He complained that Russia was standing as "a cow being milked" by other republics, which were turning the economic proposal into a "graphic instance of banditry." To the contrary, other republics worry that they might be exploited by Russia.
 
Politics Before Economics
 Reversing what had been an approach proposed by Mr. Yeltsin himself, Mr. Rutskoi said that in his view a new political union should first be created by the republics before an economic community is attempted. Such a political union would seem extremely difficult if not impossible to create under the current mood of rapidly escalating separatism in Russia and other republics.
The Vice President heightened the daily talk of "anarchy" as former Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned that the threat of a right-wing coup did not die with the Communist junta's failed attempt in August.
As quoted by the Interfax news agency, Mr. Shevardnadze, who first warned of the coup danger last winter when he resigned from the Gorbachev Government, told a business meeting here that the coup threat "is still a reality to be reckoned with" because it is "rooted in the deteriorating economic situation and declining production."
Mr. Shevardnadze estimated the disjointed nation was in the critical period within which it needed to create an economic community and a new political union. "It is important to live through these six to eight months without political shocks or cataclysms," he said.

HEADLINE: Saudi Arabia Pledges $1 Billion to Soviet Union

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia has agreed to send $1 billion in emergency humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union this fall and is working with Egypt to send Islamic "preachers" into Soviet Muslim republics to head off Islamic fundamentalism and "revolutionary themes" coming out of Iran.
The direct aid of food, clothing and medicine is in addition to $1.5 billion in credits pledged earlier to the Soviet Union by Saudi Arabia. The aid has been the subject of high-level discussions in Moscow, Cairo and Jidda over the last two weeks, Saudi and Egyptian officials say. 
 The Saudis have made a heavy financial commitment to the Soviet Union at a time when the Bush Administration is waiting to pledge direct aid until the economic reforms promised by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are carried out. The Bush Administration has accelerated food credits it has made available to the Soviet Union and officials have said they are considering further assistance.
Japan announced today that it would give the Soviets $2.5 billion in emergency credits and guarantees. The announcement was widely seen as a new initiative by Japan to win back possession of islands in the Kurile chain that the Soviet Union captured in the closing days of World War II.
The European Community tentatively approved a $2.4 billion aid package on Monday that includes loans, food and medicine for the Soviet Union.
In confirming the Saudi aid package, which has not been publicly announced by either government, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, said in an interview that King Fahd believed strongly that industrialized countries should try to meet Moscow's immediate needs.
"The Soviet people would like to have freedom of speech, but that is not enough, they must have freedom to eat," Prince Bandar said. "The Americans, the Europeans and the Japanese should come through with more humanitarian aid from October to December if we are to avoid another shock to the system." He said he brought back a list of urgently needed food, clothing and medicine after meeting with Ivan S. Silayev, who is the chairman of Mr. Gorbachev's economic management committee.
Upon his return to Washington, Prince Bandar said he conveyed King Fahd's sense of urgency on the Soviet aid issue to the White House in a round of meetings here last week.
The Saudi royal family has expressed internal concerns over the stability of the Soviet Union and its Muslim republics in the wake of the unsuccessful August coup in Moscow and the wave of independence movements that have rolled across the country.
Riyadh feels that the role of Iran, as a traditional Western buffer against Soviet expansion into the Persian Gulf, has been diminished by the collapse of Communist control, Arab diplomats here say. But this has not diminished the need to contain the still fervent zeal of Iran's most radical revolutionary elements, which for now command a majority in the Iranian Parliament and have not come to terms with their Arab neighbors, the diplomats say.
Saudi Arabia has distributed about $250 million in aid already pledged to Moscow and the purpose of Prince Bandar's trip to the Soviet Union earlier this month was to clarify how Mr. Gorbachev's government was dealing with incoming aid since many of the central government's functions have been undermined by independence movements in the Soviet republics.
Officials familiar with the missionary plan said Saudi money and Egyptian religious scholars will be deployed to the Muslim republics in the Soviet Union, where they will finance the rebuilding of mosques and perhaps set up special Saudi-Egyptian banks for financing other projects.
"For 70 years, those people were cut off from religion," said one Saudi official. "We will send preachers en masse and they are Sunnis and they will calm the people down," he said, pointing out that the mission will counter the "revolutionary themes" from Iran.
Iran, in which Shiite Islam is predominant, has sought to extend its influence in the Muslim republics of the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Lavish Homes Seen Losing Luster in New Jersey

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct. 8

 BODY:
In New Jersey, where housing costs reached record heights in the 1980's, the next decade will be a time of maturing baby boomers whose consumption will be less conspicuous and whose home buying may be more modest, forecasters said today in presenting a census portrait of the state in the 1990's.
"The decade of yuppie spending is over," said Dr. James W. Hughes, a demographer who is a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University. "The three-car garage in the front of the house will be a thing of the past. The numbers of those waiting to board the housing train will be smaller and there will be more stability in shelter costs." 
 When the spending and building surge of the 1980's departed, it left behind millions of square feet of vacant office space and new housing production that got ahead of demographics. These population and housing trends are reflected throughout the Northeast.
The 1980's housing market, Dr. Hughes said, exceeded household growth by 25 percent, even as homes continued to bring high prices. The median cost of a home in New Jersey was the highest in the nation in 1990, at $162,000. In 1980, the New Jersey median price was $61,000, about average.
In the decade ahead, he said, the $300,000 house of the 1980's will surrender its popularity to the more modest $200,000 home, and the customary trading up by those in the 45-to-54 age group will be slowed. Some will stay put, while others will settle for building an addition onto their home.
Dr. Hughes's forecast came at a daylong conference at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel, the 12th annual meeting organized by the New Jersey State Data Center. The center is a cooperative of state and local agencies and the Census Bureau and is coordinated by the State Labor Department. Its mission is to provide information and analytical support to planners, academics and business-group representatives, dozens of whom attended the session.
The collapse of New Jersey's housing market has its roots in a steep and continuing slide in the number of households being formed in the state, as well as their size. "This is the lowest level of household growth since the Great Depression," Dr. Hughes said.
Combined with growth in the ranks of those middle-aged and older, and a sharp drop in the number of younger people, both the housing and labor markets could be adversely affected.
A big reason for the decline, he said, was the 3 D's: delayed marriage, deferred childbirth and divorced couples. In the last decade, census figures show, baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- increased by 556,045 people. In 1990, this category included 35 percent of all New Jersey residents.
Other "bulges" in the census place almost 15 percent of the population in the seniors category, those 65 and older. Right behind the seniors and the baby boomers come those of the so-called baby bust generation, those now 10 to 19 years old. That group dropped over the decade by 290,135 people, and it is the decline in this group that is expected to make houses and jobs harder to fill in the next 10 years.
But it is the maturing baby boomers, whose sensitivity to the aging label Dr. Hughes jokingly sought to ease by calling them the "chronologically gifted," who will dominate the economy and whose income and consumption potential are expected to define the 90's.
The last decade, a time of tax cuts and free-wheeling investment, is over, he added, and the 90's have already become a time of tax increases that will consume income, even as the high cost of college tuition takes a greater toll on the middle-aged pocketbook.
"The upscale outer-suburb life style will fade," he said, adding: "The 80's consumer would pay anything to save time. Now people will drive to outlet stores to save money."
 
'Little Land to Waste'
 Echoing Dr. Hughes's assessment was Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association, who urged regional cooperation to ward off the effects of what he said were overbuilding and a propensity to use up precious vacant land.
"We're consuming land faster than almost anything else," he said, "in a state with little land to waste."
Mr. Anderson said he was alarmed at a region becoming more segregated by race and income when the global job market was increasing competition for jobs that could just as easily be located in Ireland as in suburban New Jersey.
Twenty-five percent of all immigrants to the United States settled in the metropolitan area over the last 10 years, 8 percent of them in New Jersey, he said. But once the Federal Government opened the gates, it did little or nothing to help states and communities deal with attendant problems of literacy, job training or social services for them. He called on the Congressional delegations from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to act jointly to resolve some of these shortcomings.
He also expressed alarm at the unsupervised expansion of office space throughout the state in the 1980's that not only glutted the market but also used up valuable land in the New Jersey countryside, far from public transportation, far from a labor market and far from affordable housing for workers. As much as 40 million square feet of space, he said, is still vacant in northern New Jersey alone.
He said land consumption had doubled in the region in the last 20 years.
"Stopping the land consumption madness is imperative," he said.

HEADLINE: Equality Plan on School Financing Is Upsetting Rich and Poor in Texas

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 7 -

 BODY:
For years "the Robin Hood plan" loomed as a dreaded last resort for Texas public schools, and now that it is operating, no one is very happy about it.
The rich say they are being robbed by the new system for financing public education. The poor say that despite sweeping revisions designed to eliminate financial inequities among school districts the state is still not giving them what they need. 
 Texas's success or failure will be closely watched in more than 20 states where education financing systems are under challenge in the courts. Among them are New Jersey, where the State Supreme Court last month ordered a new trial to determine whether the state's 1990 Quality Education Act adequately addresses equal financing between poor districts and rich districts, and New York, where arguments are scheduled this month in a lawsuit brought by a group of poor districts asking a state court to declare the school financing system unconstitutional.
 
Equity and Excellence
 In a groundswell of legal activity, the number of states with such lawsuits has grown to 22 from 8 two years ago. Poor school districts with a relatively small amounts of taxable property are contending in the suits that their students are unconstitutionally disadvantaged compared with those in rich districts, where large amounts of taxable property can raise more money for the schools.
The disadvantages may come in many forms, from the microscopes and computers available to students in richer districts to the crowded classes held in cafeterias or hallways in poorer districts. At a time of limited government resources, the increasingly urgent new question is whether equity and excellence can be achieved simultaneously.
"We were an exemplary district in Texas, and it is going to be much more difficult for us to maintain our standards now," said Charles Slater, superintendent of the Alamo Heights School District in an affluent predominantly white suburb of San Antonio. "The real solution to equity should be to raise everyone to the level of Alamo Heights, not to bring us all down to some level of mediocrity."
But John Augenblick, a Denver-based consultant who has worked for several state governments helping to design school financing plans, said, "For some districts to insist that they want to remain at high levels of spending is all well and good, except that there are other districts that have never had the chance to even come close to the national average."
 
Access to Equal Amount
 More and more often, he said, "the courts are ruling that state governments have a responsibility to insure that all school districts have access to about the same level of funding, and whether that level is adequate or not depends on what the state is willing to spend."
In October 1989, almost as soon as the Texas Supreme Court struck down the old school financing system that was based primarily on property taxes, some prominent politicians began predicting that Texas could pay for school equity only by imposing corporate or personal income taxes.
When that solution proved politically unpalatable, the Robin Hood approach of taking property tax money from rich districts and redistributing it among poor ones was adopted. The Texas plan sets in motion a spending proposal that would increase state spending on public schools by as much as $5 billion over the next four years. But the Legislature imposed no new state taxes to cover the additional spending. Texas is one of three states without corporate or personal income taxes.
"We got this started without any specific funding changes relative to public education," said State Senator John Montford, a Democrat from Lubbock, who is a crucial legislator on tax issues. "But I think we are inevitably headed towards a major fiscal crisis and some tough decisions, because the spending is going to increase and the money won't be there."
The plan sets up new regional taxing authorities and obliges all school districts within those regions to tax at the same rate to pay for a basic educational program, and to then share the money. The system earned its nickname because, in the sharing process, about $300 million in local property tax revenue will be taken from rich school districts to be given to poor ones this year, according to preliminary estimates.
 
Minimum Money Assured
 In addition, the state has committed itself to providing enough money to insure that poor districts have a minimum amount to spend if Robin Hood money falls short.
Rich districts are expected to take advantage of provisions allowing them to raise extra money through property taxes to enhance their programs, but they can do so only within certain limits.
Although the Robin Hood approach has been tried in different forms elsewhere, in Texas it has generated the most direct confrontation between rich and poor districts, which fought in court all summer and are promising further battles. Several rich districts have already challenged the new law, contending that the state is unconstitutionally appropriating local revenue.
In Utah, Wyoming and Montana, the state governments receive a portion of the revenue raised by local school districts and redistributes the money in districts around the state to equalize spending, Mr. Augenblick said. But, he said, Texas is the first state to redistribute money within regional districts.
 
Flowing Between Neighbors
 With money flowing among neighboring school neighbors, the potential for resentment is heightened, especially when many of the rich districts are predominantly white while most of the poor districts have large minority populations.
Some of the rich districts most determined to fight the Robin Hood plan are Dallas suburbs like Plano, Richardson, Carrollton and Farmers Branch, which have been able to attract residents from the city with the lure of better public schools. To the extent that the Robin Hood plan reduces the ability of such suburbs to spend more on their schools, it threatens to disrupt one of America's fundamental population dynamics.
In its unanimous 1989 decision -- which said the disparities in spending between rich and poor school districts were unconstitutional -- the Texas Supreme Court stated that "property-poor districts are trapped in a cycle of poverty from which there is no opportunity to free themselves." The 100 richest school districts spent an average of $7,233 a student annually, the court noted, while the 100 poorest -- even by levying much higher taxes on their residents -- could only average $2,978 a student.
As a matter of principle, the poor school districts see the new law as a victory.
"There is more equality of opportunity among school districts than ever before and the state has put in more money than ever before," said Al Kauffman, a lawyer with the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund, who filed the original suit in 1984.
"For basically the same tax rates, almost every district will have similar revenues," he said, "and the tremendous disparities between the richest and the poorest school districts will be eliminated."
But many poor school districts feel they have so much catching up to do that the amount of new money they will receive is disappointing -- especially because they have had to raise taxes in order to take full advantage of the law. That was the way the law was written.
For example, the Edgewood School District in a poor, predominantly Hispanic area of San Antonio, raised its property taxes by 23 percent, and will get some Robin Hood aid from nearby districts, but even with both those sources of income, its school budget will increase by less than 10 percent.
Some of the new money will acquire things that used to be luxuries, like music teachers, said Earle Bolton, the deputy superintendent, but "for the main part, a lot of the money is going into maintenance and repair of physical facilities." Roofs that have been leaking for years will finally get fixed, and in two major buildings air conditioning units that date to the 1940's may be replaced.
Meanwhile, the rich districts are just as unhappy.
 
Giving and Raising Taxes
 For, example the Alamo Heights district will give up $4 million in Robin Hood money. It has raised taxes this year by 36 percent, but is still cutting its budget by about $1 million. Various economy measures taken included a salary freeze, cuts in clerical positions, elimination of some instructional programs like accounting and the closing of the district's swimming pool.
The state's two big-city school districts, Dallas and Houston, feel doubly cursed. Both cities are losing residents to suburbs that offer better schooling, and both are required to provide costly services to students with special needs, like bilingual education for recent immigrants. Even so, because of their large tax bases, both city school systems were categorized as rich districts under the Robin Hood plan.
School boards around the state are now coming up with their property tax rates and will be sending out their bills next month. With some school administrators predicting a tax revolt, the true impact of the law -- and its ramifications for other states -- may not become apparent until property owners learn its full price tag.

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS NOMINATION;
VOTE ON THOMAS IS PUT OFF AS SENATE BACKING ERODES OVER HARASSMENT CHARGE

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
After a day of divisive, emotional debate over one of the most politically charged issues before it in recent years, the Senate tonight agreed to postpone until next Tuesday the vote on the confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
The White House reluctantly agreed to the delay to allow time for the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings into accusations of sexual harassment that have set off a storm of outrage against the Senate and caused many to demand closer scrutiny of Judge Thomas. 
 The highly unusual delay in the confirmation process resulted from the dramatic and carefully presented public accusation on Monday by Anita F. Hill, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma who is a former Thomas aide.
 
Integrity at Issue
 The decision to delay came more than two hours after the original 6 P.M. deadline for the vote had passed. Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, stepped onto the Senate floor and said that there were too many lingering questions about allegations against Judge Thomas to call a vote tonight.
"The delay approved," Mr. Mitchell declared, "is important to the integrity of the Senate, the integrity of the confirmation process, the integrity of the Supreme Court and the integrity of the individuals involved."
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, also called for a delay, but only until Friday. He conceded, though, that Republicans were outnumbered. He said Republicans did not hold the Senate to a vote tonight on the nomination because the tide was running so strongly against Judge Thomas that he might have been rejected altogether.
 
New Scrutiny for Accusations
 Under the agreement, the accusations of sexual harassment against Judge Thomas will be examined in hearings scheduled to begin on Friday. Judge Thomas, in a signed statement distributed today by his chief defender, Senator John C. Danforth, said, "I totally and unequivocally deny Anita Hill's allegations of misconduct of any kind toward her, sexual or otherwise."
Professor Hill appeared briefly before reporters today in Norman, Okla., to say only that she would cooperate with the Senate, saying: "I will fully cooperate with the efforts of the Senate. I intend to cooperate and to go to Washington if it is requested." In explaining the delay, Senator Dole said that some of his Republican colleagues "would have rolled the dice at 6 P.M." But he added in a mellow, candid tone, "I couldn't put together 60 votes at 6 o'clock.
"It seemed to be that it was a gamble that should not be taken," he said, adding that "some questions remain" that probably should be answered.
Senator Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, adopting a tone intended to heal divisions, said the agreement was a result of events that were "unpredictable, unplanned and unfortunate."
Among the supporters of Judge Thomas who pushed for postponing the vote was Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, who declared, "The Senate is on trial at this point."
The decision to delay came after White House lobbyists and Senate Republicans realized that they might lose if they forced a vote on a group of Democrats who were leaning toward Judge Thomas but were being battered by criticism that the overwhelmingly male Senate paid too little attention to the allegations of sexual harassment.
The turning point came in an emotional speech less than two hours before the scheduled 6 P.M. floor vote. Senator Danforth stepped onto the Senate floor and said the nominee wanted time to clear his name from the "sharks" who, he said, were trying to use the accusations of Professor Hill to keep Judge Thomas off the Court.
The Missouri Republican said he had spoken to Judge Thomas by telephone and quoted him as saying: "They have taken from me what I have worked 43 years to create. They have taken from me what I have worked 43 years to build: My reputation."
 
Thomas's Denial of Charges
 Senator Danforth also distributed a statement signed today by Judge Thomas, asserting:
"1. As I told the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Sept. 28, 1991, I totally and unequivocally deny Anita Hill's allegations of misconduct of any kind toward her, sexual or otherwise. These allegations are untrue.
"2. At all times during the period she worked with me, our relationship was strictly professional. During that time and subsequently, the relationship has been wholly cordial.
"3. I am terribly saddened and deeply offended by these allegations."
The bitter emotional tone today on the Senate floor was in keeping with the tempest into which the lawmakers were plunged on Monday, when Professor Hill accused the Senate Judiciary Committee of declining to investigate her complaint.
Mr. Danforth portrayed Judge Thomas as seeking the delay, but most Senate officials agreed that it was forced on Republicans and White House strategists because they feared they could not hold their bare majority if the vote took place today.
 
Bleak Republican Tally
 By the estimate of Senator Dole, there were 41 votes for Judge Thomas, 41 against, and 16 to 18 undecided, "depending who you count." There are 57 Senate Democrats and 43 Republicans, and at least 7 of 13 pro-Thomas Democrats had come out openly for a delay by the time the Republicans decided not to risk a vote.
The postponement came after an extraordinary 24 hours of politicking on and off the Senate floor. The Senate was under great pressure for a delay so lawmakers could learn more of the allegations by Professor Hill, who said Judge Thomas had harassed her with remarks about sexual positions and practices, anatomy and pornographic movies when she was his assistant, from 1981 to 1983, first at the Education Department and later at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
It was a day of intense drama in the Capitol, a moment when issues of principle and political survival came together. It tested not only the fate of Judge Thomas, but also the standing of leading Senators, and the image of the institution itself.
From early this morning, it seemed clear that the 6 P.M. vote was in doubt, especially when Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, pulled the first surprise of the day, infuriating Mr. Mitchell. Senator Moynihan called for a six-day adjournment so senators could examine the allegations. Although Mr. Moynihan withdrew his request, senators were uncertain all day if the vote would proceed that evening.
For the first time since Professor Hill's allegations were made public, the nominee sought to defend himself by releasing the sworn affidavit in which he categorically denied the allegations.
As evidence that Professor Hill maintained a friendship with Judge Thomas, Mr. Danforth also released what he described as the nominee's secretary's telephone logs, showing that Professor Hill had called him 10 times from 1984 to 1990, with an 11th call made by a third party on her behalf. On Aug. 29, 1984, for example, an entry said Professor Hill "needs your advice on getting research grants," while on Aug. 4, 1987, she "wanted to congratulate you on marriage."
Professor Hill was quoted in Wednesday's issue of The Washington Post as saying the report about the telephone calls was "garbage." However, in a brief interview tonight with The New York Times, she refused to confirm that comment, simply reiterating that she would cooperate with the Senate investigation.
Even Mr. Danforth, who had expressed only optimism about his prospects since Judge Thomas was nominated by President Bush on July 1, for the first time raised the notion that the nomination was in doubt.
"If he loses the nomination because of this," Mr. Danforth said at a news conference, "if he is telling the truth and he loses the nomination because of this, that to me is an earth-shaking development -- to have the nomination of Clarence Thomas for Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court lost because of the illegal distribution or leaking of the content of an F.B.I. report, plus charges which are totally refuted by the nominee."
The unanswered questions about Judge Thomas were the center of the debate, and a critical issue in the talks between Republicans and Democrats was over how much further the Senate should go in seeking answers.
A crucial question is if the harassment took place, why did Professor Hill have continued contacts with Judge Thomas, even following him from one civil rights agency to another. The professor said Monday that she went to the second agency because she wanted to continue in the civil rights field and did not want to be unemployed, but Republicans hammered insistently at this question today.
There is also dispute over details. News reports have said that Judge Thomas acknowleged in the F.B.I. document that he had asked Professor Hill out but denied her other assertions. But Senator Specter, who spoke to Judge Thomas about the allegations before the committee vote, insisted again today that the nominee had denied that he even asked her out.
"I looked him straight in the eye and he looked at me straight in the eye," Mr. Specter said. "And he forcefully denied having dated or asked her out."
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee had been informed of Professor Hill's allegations before they voted on his confirmation Sept. 27. The committee was split 7 to 7, with only one Democrat voting for confirmation, and the nomination was sent to the Senate floor for action anyway.
 
Biden on Defensive
 But a mounting number of Democrats, including some who had pledged support for Judge Thomas, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, said today that questions about the Judiciary Committee's handling of Professor Hill's complaint made it impossible to proceed.
Implicit in many speeches was the idea that Senators were reluctant to repeat what many saw as the mistake of the Judiciary panel and its chairman, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware. Leading women inside and outside Congress said the committee has projected an image of indifference to women by appearing to brush aside the complaints of a woman of substance and rushing to judgment for reasons of political expedience.
"Judge Thomas has a cloud hanging over his head," said Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat who announced his support for confirmation late last month. "In my view, the only responsible course for us, as members of this body, to discharge the Constitutional obligation which is incumbent upon is, is to the best of our ability conduct a thorough examination of these allegations."
The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, notably the chairman, were dogged with questions over why they did not delay the committee's vote and investigate the matter more fully.

HEADLINE: Haitian Legislators Name a Judge To Be President Until a New Vote

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Haitian National Assembly swore in a Supreme Court Justice as provisional president today to replace the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's first democratically elected leader, who fled the country after being overthrown in a military coup eight days ago.
The appointment of Joseph Nerette, a Justice described as political centrist in his late 60's, came after the parliament overwhelmingly ratified a motion declaring the office of the president vacant. 
 The action officially vacating the office was first taken by parliament on Monday and repeated today. The initial vote Monday came as soldiers surrounded the National Assembly building and fired their automatic weapons into the air. The soldiers also briefly took over the airport Monday while a delegation of diplomats from the Organization of American States was meeting there.
 
Motion Declared Illegal
 Because of the actions by the soldiers and the absence of many members of Parliament, including its president, the motion to vacate the President's office was declared illegal on Monday by O.A.S. representatives and Western diplomats.
[In Washington, the Organization of American States drew up plans to toughen economic sanctions against the new Government of Haiti, and also considered an offer to send a civilian O.A.S. observer force to Port-au-Prince. Page A3.]
Asked if the soldiers had coerced the legislature to declare Father Aristide's office vacant, Haitian politicians said the soldiers may have forced the issue, but the outcome was inevitable. "We are repeating our vote today because there appear to be doubts about what occurred yesterday," said Senator Thomas Dupiton, referring to the ratification vote today.
While opposition by enlisted men in the Haitian military to Father Aristide's return is genuine, several politicians described Monday's action by the soliders outside the Parliament as intended to send a strong signal to the O.A.S. that Father Aristide's departure was irreversible.
"The thing was cooked up to present a fait-accompli before the international community," said the leader of one political party who acknowledged that in recent days there had been repeated contacts between soldiers and civilians opposed to Father Aristide's return to Haiti.
After being sworn in by Senator Dejean Belizaire, the president of the National Assembly, Mr. Nerette, a gaunt and diminuitive legal scholar, delivered an inaugural speech in which he made several references to complaints made frequently against Father Aristide during his presidency, including officially-sanctioned violence, class tensions and disregard for constitutional checks and balances.
 
Duvalier Aide May Be Named
 "The realization of this country's potential requires the reconciliation of all its sons," Mr. Nerette said. Haiti, he added, "does not belong to one man, or a small group of men. This country belongs to all its sons, whether rich or poor."
Uncertainty over how the provisional government would be received internationally was underscored by the absence of any diplomatic presence at the swearing-in ceremony.
The new President was expected to name Jean-Jacques Honorat as his Prime Minister. Mr. Honorat is a former director of tourism under the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier.
The naming of Mr. Nerette, who is charged with leading Haiti to new elections within 90 days, came after several days of of a power vacuum in which soldiers prowled the streets intimidating and sporadically attacking citizens.
Since Father Aristide was forced out of the country by a military rebellion on Sept. 30, diplomats estimate that as many as 300 people may have died.
In stark contrast to the swearing-in of Father Aristide in January, after the populist priest-turned-politician was elected in a landslide, the streets of the capital were nearly deserted this afternoon, and except for those invited to the inaugural ceremony, there appeared to be little celebration.
 
Aristide's Rights Record Cited
 In recent days, a high-level mission of the O.A.S. had repeatedly warned that Haiti would remain isolated and subject to an economic blockade unless Father Aristide were promptly returned to office.
Haitian politicians today reproached the O.A.S. team for coming to Haiti with what they called a predetermined and inflexible mission -- the return of Father Aristide -- without bothering to gather information on both the deposed president's record of alleged human rights violations and the exceptionally strong sentiment against him.
"I think they were uncouth to come here and tell us what to do," said Louis Dejoie, the leader of the Parti Agricole Industriel National, who applauded the naming of an interim government. "To blockade our ports and leave us without anything to eat would be genocide. It's an insult."
Asked how the international community would regard the provisional government, the Canadian ambassador to Haiti, Bernard Dussault, said: "The O.A.S. does not intend to break dialogue."

The Asia Test for Mr. Bush

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
President Bush will soon face his biggest and most challenging test in shaping a new world order since the Persian Gulf war. Beginning in mid-November, Secretary of State Baker and later Mr. Bush himself will spend the better part of a month traveling in Asia, ending symbolically on Dec. 7 in Pearl Harbor.
They will be trying to pull together a policy for the Asian-Pacific rim, an area of the world that will probably have a greater impact on America than all the latest Soviet-American arms control announcements and the Middle East negotiations. 
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker will be dealing with the core issue of any new world order -- foreign economic policy -- in the largest, most dynamic economic region of the globe.
The Bush-Baker challenge will be to replace the historic anti-Soviet focus of U.S. Asian policy with a new emphasis on geoeconomics, to forge new economic bonds and use them to resolve political problems and prevent economic disputes from exploding into political confrontations.
The stakes are investment, jobs, growth, trade and trade wars, and -- most delicate and dangerous of all -- relations with China and Japan. Washington's troubles with these two Asian giants edge ever closer to a blowup.
No country is more important to the U.S. than Japan, and with no other country are its economic ties so strained. Mr. Bush has managed to keep things together through his personal relationship with the departing Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, but personal friendships will not substitute for the tough political decisions needed in both capitals to sidetrack economic warfare. The two sides are talking about the right issues (American budget deficits and education and Japanese restrictive trade and investment practices), but they just are not getting anywhere.
Japan will be Mr. Baker's principal stop in a trip that will begin with a Nov. 12 meeting with Asia's leading free-market countries. Later in November Mr. Bush will journey to Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Australia. Neither now plans to stop in China.
Chinese leaders are approaching a full boil over Congressional pressures on human rights, Mr. Bush's visit with Tibet's Dalai Lama and a host of other such matters. U.S. leaders are steaming over China's $15 billion trade surplus with the U.S., some of it the fruits of slave labor.
Some China experts would like Mr. Baker to stop in Beijing and defuse the tension. But the Secretary and the President worry that such a high-level contact would send American human rights watchers into orbit. The solution, and Administration diplomats are working on it secretly, is to see if Beijing will agree in advance to certain concessions to be announced during a Baker visit.
America's hold on China turns on trade, technology and investment, all of which Beijing requires to modernize. That hold, tragically, has done little to alleviate Beijing's human and political rights abuses. But Washington has used its leverage well to gain China's critical neutrality at the U.N. during the war against Iraq, pressure on Communist rebels to end the fighting in Cambodia and agreement to restrict missile sales to the volatile Mideast and elsewhere.
The power of the purse is everywhere evident in Asia. Japan is using it to pry its northern islands away from the Soviet Union. Tokyo is employing the same bait to persuade North Korea to halt its none-too-secret nuclear arms program. North Korea is coming out of its nasty and dangerous shell because it is an economic basket case. Vietnam will also sink into economic oblivion without aid, which explains its recent help in concluding Cambodia's civil war.
Overarching all this are the worldwide GATT free-trade negotiations, a vast multilateral gabfest now in an ominous stalemate. A breakdown in these talks could lead to Western European and North American trade blocs. To guard against such possibilities, some Asians are flirting with establishing their own trade bloc.
Fortunately, Asian nations still depend on free trade, oppose protectionism and fear Japanese domination if America is excluded. Every Pacific rim nation wants full American involvement in the region, which gives the U.S. an inherent long-term advantage that Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker can start using next month to mold the emerging geoeconomic order.

HEADLINE: Why Peru Accepts Wrong Kind of Aid;
Two Colossal Menaces

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Misadventures in Cocaland" (Op-Ed, Sept. 8), Gustavo Gorriti depicts the United States aid package for Peru as unbalanced and shortsighted, and worries that it will cause the campesinos, or peasants, to rise up and group behind the terrorist group Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path. Furthermore, he describes the drug trade as indispensable for the survival of the Peruvian economy. I disagree with both statements. 
 I do not believe that the substitution of less productive crops for coca will push the campesinos into the ranks of the Shining Path. Peruvians are having harsh and difficult times. They are paying the price with a high unemployment rate, violence, corruption and other social maladies for the wrong national policies of the past. But their belief in democracy, a free press and individual rights is intact.
I agree that a rational and perfect policy should put more emphasis on the root of the problem, poverty, and less on the branches. But such purism will block any possible aid.
Peru faces two colossal menaces: the drug trade and Shining Path. They are intertwined in all aspects, and their defeat rests in consolidation of democracy and improvement of the economy.

HEADLINE: Why Peru Accepts Wrong Kind of Aid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Peru's President -- A Good Bet" (editorial, Sept. 28), you cynically misrepresent the Bush Administration's latest bribe to Peru as "aid." In the last few months, your news columns have documented the negotiations between the United States and Peru that led to President Alberto Fujimori's eventual surrender to White House "diplomacy." 
 Mr. Fujimori at first rejected the Bush "aid" proposal as dangerously militaristic and blind to the economic realities underlying coca production in eastern Peru. The proposed package contains no serious alternative development strategies, nor does it offer sustained support for development of alternative cash crops.
Peruvians are concerned that brutal military suppression of the only viable peasant economy in the region will merely sharpen their nation's crisis, sweeping it into a vicious cycle of violence and guaranteeing the need for more such United States "aid" as Peru sinks into civil war.
The Bush Administration responded to Mr. Fujimori's rejection by threatening to curtail aid from the international lending institutions Washington controls. Mr. Fujimori reluctantly agreed to accept the United States package, rather than face economic isolation.
You attempt to gloss over the sad facts of this "aid" package. Of the $60 million in economic aid you refer to, almost all will go toward interest on outstanding loans, not crop substitution or road building in rural Peru. The meager amount for economic development is all Mr. Fujimori can show to save face and not be laughed out of his country as another incompetent weakling pandering to the interests of Washington and the banks.
Finally, to portray the Peruvians as the deserving recipients of "poison" disguised as "medicine" is a callous ruse.

HEADLINE: Recession and Re-election Don't Mix

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
From George Bush down, top officials in the Administration and other Republican strategists are convinced that the only obstacle in the way of the President's re-election would be a recession next year.
The White House does not believe such a recession is likely, and neither do most private economists. But the President's advisers cannot ignore the possibility. And what frustrates them, many said in interviews, is that unlike previous Presidents who found ways to boost the economy for their political advantage in an election year, this Administration feels its hands are tied. 
 An Administration official said he felt like someone becalmed at sea. No matter how confident he might be that the wind would soon spring up and blow him safely ashore, he said, he would feel better if he could do something about it.
One of Mr. Bush's chief political advisers put it this way: "If you look at the things that historically have given incumbent Presidents a difficult problem in an election, there's a lingering war. That's not likely to happen. There's a major scandal. I don't see that happening. The most common one is a very sour economy, and we can't completely rule that out."
Worried that voters may perceive the President as concentrating on foreign policy and uninterested in pocketbook issues, the White House has gone to lengths recently to make it appear that Mr. Bush is on top of the situtation.
The President held a news conference on Friday to emphasize his domestic and economic policies. "The economy's on the right track," he asserted, although he conceded that "all is not well." He offered no new proposals for turning the situation around.
On Monday, Mr. Bush met with a group of corporate chief executives and then held a Cabinet meeting to discuss the economy. Today, he met with his top economic advisers as a follow-up to two highly publicized meetings with the advisers week before last. After today's meeting, the President announced that he had approved a series of regulatory measures that he said would encourage banks to make new loans. [Page A1].
Asked about the flurry of activity, a top assistant to the President said, "There's a feeling that he hasn't been visible enough on this issue."
But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, suggested publicly Monday what other Presidential assistants have been saying privately -- that bold new proposals in the economic area are not in the offing.
"We just want to stay on top of the situation and nurture this process in any way we can," Mr. Fitzwater said.
 
Deficit Limits the Options
 With the Office of Management and Budget predicting a monumental budget deficit of nearly $350 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, the Bush Administration cannot afford to cut taxes or increase Government spending, the normal ways of stimulating the economy.
The collapse of the Soviet Union as a military threat may mean that the President and Congress will agree next year to reduce military spending and use the money to cut taxes, lower the deficit or expand social programs. But that would not have any effect on the strength of the nation's economy before the 1992 election. 
And monetary policy, which the Administration has depended on to regulate the economy up to now, seems lately to have had little effect generating economic growth. The Federal Reserve has already cut the interest rates it controls to their lowest levels since the 1970's, but that has not proved sufficient to generate enough new bank lending to increase the nation's money supply and thus give the economy a lift.
A recession occurs when the nation's total production of goods and services actually shrinks. The current view among economists is that the country pulled out of recession during the summer and that the recovery will be slow but steady. But Charles Black, a leading Republican strategist, has made a point of trying to drum up concern about the economy in party circles.
"In talking to our people who are in some danger of complacency about the President's chances," Mr. Black said, "I have been saying that I don't think any one Democrat is a threat to the President's re-election, but a bad economy is. If the economy is growing, he's going to be extremely tough to beat.
"But," Mr. Black added, "if the economy is sliding the way it seems to be doing now, a strong Democrat could take advantage of that and make it a competitive race."
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, who is expected to become Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, said he believed the President's re-election chances would not be hurt if the economy merely grows very slowly next year. But he said an all-out recession would be politically damaging.
 
Sticking With the Forecasts
 Should 1992 find the nation in a recession, the President would of course have the power to initiate domestic-spending programs or propose jobs-creation legislation or take other steps to stimulate the economy. But to do so would probably increase the budget deficit, a situation that many economists believe would only worsen the recession.
Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said that for the time being he was sticking by the forecast the Administration published in July: that the economy will grow at the rather slow rate of 3.6 percent next year. But, Mr. Boskin cautioned, "there are lots of reasons the economy could follow a different path, and it would be wise to recognize that the economy could do significantly better or significantly worse."
A lower-level Administration economist said he believed that if another official forecast were done today, the projection would be for a growth rate a bit lower than the July projection of 3.6 percent and more in line with Congressional and private forecasts.
 
History Casts a Shadow
 Any of the current projections are well below the 4.6 percent that is the average rate of economic growth in the six election years since World War II in which the incumbent party retained control of the White House. The current forecasts, in fact, lean slightly closer to the 2.98 percent average for the five election years since the war in which the incumbent party has lost.
Scholars who have studied the effects of the economy on Presidential elections have found that incumbents have serious trouble weathering election-year recessions but that voters are forgiving of recessions that occurred earlier in a President's term.
Allan J. Lichtman, a history professor at American University here, wrote in his book, "The 13 Keys to the Presidency," that all seven times since the Civil War when the economy was in recession in the fall of a Presidential election year, someone from the opposition party was elected President. The years he listed were 1876, 1884, 1896, 1920, 1932, 1960 and 1980.
Mr. Lichtman's calculation is subject to quibbles. Some lists show a recession in the fall of 1900, when William McKinley was re-elected, and the latest view is that the recession of 1980 ended that July. But no one disputes the main point Mr. Lichtman is making: recessions during election campaigns are generally disastrous for incumbent Presidents.
 
The Unemployment Factor
 Another way of looking at the situation is to examine the unemployment rate. Michael S. Lewis-Beck, a political scientist at the University of Iowa who is writing a book on election forecasting, found that all five times since World War II when the unemployment rate was falling in the second quarter of the election year, the incumbent won: 1948, 1964, 1972, 1984 and 1988.
On the other hand, the unemployment rate was rising or flat during the April through June quarter in six election years, and the incumbent party lost five of those elections, in 1952, 1960, 1968, 1976 and 1980. The only exception was in 1956, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was re-elected.
The Bush Administration is forecasting that the civilian unemployment rate, 6.7 percent last month, will be an average of 6.4 percent during 1992, a figure comparable with current predictions by most private economists. But some economists say that even if the economy is improving, the unemployment rate may not have begun to drop by next year's second quarter.
When recessions have occurred in the first three years of an incumbent's term or even early in an election year, voters have not usually held them against the President. So scholars do not expect the recession that began in the summer of 1990 to hurt Mr. Bush.
 
Incumbents Who Took Action
 Many recent Presidents going into the year of their re-election campaign have taken strong steps to show the country they were trying to turn the economy around. In 1963, President Kennedy pushed for the biggest tax cut in American history up to that time. In 1971, President Nixon imposed wage and price controls. In 1979, Jimmy Carter began to focus on controlling runaway inflation and named Paul A. Volcker to head the Federal Reserve Board. In 1983, Ronald Reagan retreated substantially from the economic philosophy of his first years in office and supported legislation to create new jobs.
Commerce Secretary Mosbacher is advocating an all-out push next year for a reduction in the capital gains tax. But others, including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, say such action would be unwise given the strong opposition in Congress, the political beating the President took on the issue last year and the likelihood that Democrats would insist on an increase in other tax rates if the capital gains rate were lowered.
The best guess is that the President will sit tight next year, make no bold new proposals in the economic area and keep his fingers crossed that another recession can be averted.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 11, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article and a picture caption in Business Day on Wednesday about the effects of recession on Presidential elections referred incorrectly to the voting of 1876, during a recession. The incumbent party was re-elected: Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, received the most electoral votes and succeeded Ulysses S. Grant. But Samuel J. Tilden, a Democrat, received more popular votes, fitting the pattern in which challengers receive more votes during recessions.

Chart: "Candidates Helped by Recessions"
 The opposition candidate has won the Presidency each of the seven times since the Civil War that the economy has been in a recession in the fall of the election year, according to Allan J. Lichtman, a history professor and author. Mr. Lichtman includes the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, even though the recession that year officially ended in July. His list does not include the re-election of William McKinley in 1900; whether the economy was shrinking that fall is debatable.

HEADLINE: A Pole Asks Urgent Help In Privatizing

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
The Polish official who heads his country's sweeping privatization program says it has been sharply scaled back and American expertise is urgently needed.
"Our basic problem is that we have no domestic savings, and foreign interest is currently very guarded," Dr. Jerzy Thieme, the chairman of the Poland's so-called mass privatization program, said during what he described as a private visit to New York. 
 He said the number of state enterprises involved in the program, which was announced three months ago, had been cut to 230 from 400. He also said that a plan to give all Polish adults a stake in these businesses would be delayed.
 
Sees Delay Until 1993
 In June, Poland announced plans to transfer ownership in 400 state enterprises, or about 25 percent of all Government-owned industry, to a group of stock funds to be created and run by Western investment managers. The nation's 27 million adults were to receive vouchers giving them a stake in these funds.
Dr. Thieme said he did not foresee the public distribution of shares in the planned stock funds until 1993 because it would take until then to restructure the companies and assess their value.
"Real life has modified the plan quite radically," he said. On closer review, he said, 170 of the larger companies initially included in the program were found to be unsuitable because their problems were so severe.
As a result, the companies to be privatized now represent only about 6 percent of state industry, he said. Dr. Thieme declined to say which enterprises had been eliminated but did say they included some cement and sugar businesses. The 230 companies still to be privatized are currently being evaluated by officials from the accounting firms Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen, he said.
 
'Mass' Goal Now 'Moderate'
 Stanislaw Wellisz, a professor of economics at Columbia University and until recently a member of the supervisory board of the privatization program, said he had been informed of the cutback.
"From a mass privatization program, it has been scaled back to a more moderate one," Professor Wellisz said. "They did not want to distribute enterprises on the verge of bankruptcy."
Commenting on the changes, Tomaz Telma, an economist at Planecon Inc., a consulting firm in Washington, said the plan now seemed "more gradual and more realistic." A major problem, he added, is that "there is a very big mentality barrier to these market changes in Poland."
 
'We Need Everything'
 Dr. Thieme, a former vice president for Citibank in New York, said he would like to have a team of five American experts to help him design the capital markets essential to support the privatization plans.
"We need registration systems, modern banking technology to support trading -- in fact we need everything," he said. "And I would like to have experts from the U.S., the most sophisticated model of capital markets anywhere in the world."
But his ministry lacks funds to hire such experts, Dr. Thieme lamented, and he is having to rely on West European expertise that is paid for, in part, by the British and French Governments.
 
May Consult Nonprofit Group
 One possibility, he suggested, was that Poland would turn to an American organization, the Financial Services Volunteer Corps, a nonprofit group established last year and run by Herbert S. Okun, a former United States Ambassador to East Germany. The organization, partly financed by the State Department's Agency for International Development, provides financial experts on a volunteer basis for East European countries switching to market economies.
Mr. Okun said that he had met with Dr. Thieme last week and that if the organization received a formal request from Poland, "we would be happy to send our experts."
Parliamentary elections are scheduled in Poland this month, and Professor Wellisz of Columbia suggested that the privatization plans could face further adaptation or curtailment as a result of political pressures.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold and Platinum Higher After Soviet Supply Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold and platinum futures prices advanced yesterday on further news of dwindling Soviet gold reserves.
A report by Tass, the Soviet press agency, said that Soviet reserves were approaching 240 metric tons, lending credence to similar statements made earlier. 
 Tass reported that the economist Grigory Yavlinsky told the Russian Parliament yesterday that by 1992, gold reserves would drop to 240 tons.
"This is the third Soviet statement indicating that the reserves are at this level," said William O'Neill, an analyst in New York with Merrill Lynch Futures. He said the figure appeared to be the one the Soviets would report to the International Monetary Fund at its meeting this weekend in Bangkok, Thailand.
Gold also benefited from a weaker dollar and surging crude oil prices.
Traders of platinum futures perked up on the gold report in Tass.
 
Wondering About Soviet Platinum
 "They began wondering how much of the platinum reserves were left in the Soviet Union," said Peter Cardillo, research director of Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York. "If the gold reserves are that low, maybe platinum reserves are even lower."
The Soviet Union is known to have sold a relatively large amount of platinum in recent years.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum for delivery in January settled $7.10 an ounce higher at $367.
Gold on New York's Commodity Exchange was $1.90 an ounce higher for December at $362.10. December silver was 2.8 cents higher at $4.113 an ounce.
The advance in crude oil futures at the New York Mercantile Exchange was tied to concerns that the political turmoil in the Soviet Union would reduce oil exports even more than already feared.
Crude oil for delivery in November was up 17 cents a barrel, at $23.16; November heating oil was 0.99 cent higher at 68.05 cents a gallon; November unleaded gasoline was 0.29 cent lower at 63.20 cents a gallon, and natural gas for delivery in December was 2.9 cents higher at $2.152 for 1,000 cubic feet.
 
Harvest Assessment Due Today
 Most grain and soybean futures prices edged lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as the market awaited the Government's latest harvest assessment, due today.
Wheat futures turned higher at one point on a report that the Soviet Union had increased the amount of United States wheat it was seeking, but the market failed to hold the gains.
Corn and soybean prices were under pressure all week from bearish expectations surrounding the crop report. There is almost universal agreement that the Agriculture Department's estimates of crop yields for corn and beans will be significantly higher than they were a month ago.
Wheat for delivery in December settled 2 3/4 cents lower at $3.43 a bushel; December corn was3/4 cent lower at $2.48 3/4 a bushel; December oats were 1/2 cent higher at $1.28 3/4 a bushel, and November soybeans were 2 1/4 cents lower at $5.69 3/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off Amid Uncertainty Over Trend of Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against leading foreign currencies yesterday in trading dominated by largely technical influences and uncertainty over the direction of interest rates in the United States.
Foreign exchange analysts said part of the dollar's drop was a technical correction after the currency's strong advance on Tuesday. 
 At the same time, they said, the market continued its debate on the direction of interest rates in the United States.
Some participants expect the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy and allow rates to decline further to stimulate the still-sluggish economy. Others predict that the central bank will leave rates unchanged.
The dollar is supported by higher rates, so the prospect of lower rates helped bring the American currency lower.
Earl I. Johnson, a vice president with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said traders believe "there's still the possibility of a rate cut as early as Friday."
Traders were hoping the release of money supply figures today would give them some clues about interest rates. The sluggish growth of money supply in the United States economy has played a role in Fed decisions in recent months.
Mr. Johnson said the dollar was fluctuating in a narrow range, but was unlikely to trade significantly higher because the direction of the economy remained uncertain.
The dollar fell to 129.80 Japanese yen in New York, from 130.35 late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to a closing 130.40 yen from 129.93 yen, and in London it fell to 130.15 yen.
The British pound rose in New York to $1.7195 from late Tuesday's $1.7070. In earlier London trading, sterling rose to $1.7175 from $1.7140.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Bonds Plunge

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices plunged yesterday as credit market participants sold securities after the Federal Reserve Board gave a strong sign it had not yet eased monetary policy. Results of an auction of new seven-year notes also showed that demand was not nearly as strong as anticipated.
The decline in bond prices was the third in succession, but some market participants did not attach much significance to the drop. 
 "In bull markets, there tend to be violent corrections," one Government bond trader said. "This has been the first one in nearly three months. The fundamental story of weak economic growth and low inflation is still very much alive, but it will take a few days for the market to recover from this."
But other traders said that despite a very wide spread, or difference, between yields on two-year notes and 30-year bonds, demand for long-term securities was moribund.
 
'Absolutely No Sponsorship'
 "The long end has absolutely no sponsorship, and people are getting out and taking profits," another trader said. "I don't think the constant effort on the part of the Bush Administration to talk down interest rates and to push the Fed to ease continually is helping bond yields much."
Talk that the Fed was in the process of moving short-term interest rates down another notch ended yesterday, when the central bank entered the open market to drain reserves from the banking system at a time when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading at 5 1/16 percent.
Over the last few days the closely watched funds rate has been trading below the 5 1/4 percent level that is widely seen as the Fed's target.
Until yesterday, the Fed had not indicated to market participants that it had endorsed the recent softness.
Analysts said that yesterday's draining operation was a clear signal that monetary policy remained unchanged for the moment.
 
Results of Auction
 The Fed's action helped to push down prices early in the day, but the bulk of the downward move came after results of the seven-year note auction were announced.
At auction, the $9.25 billion worth of securities were sold at an average yield of 7.20 percent, down from the 8.26 percent average yield at the last seven-year note sale on July 10.
Unlike other Treasury issues, traders said there was no readily identifiable source of demand for seven-year notes. As a result, seven-year auctions have often been disappointing. Still, demand at yesterday's sale was a good bit weaker than expected, the traders said.
Prices of the new seven-year securities began to erode shortly after the auction took place and continued for much of the afternoon.
By late in the day, the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.25 percent.
While prices of longer-term notes and bonds took a beating, the prospect of another easing move by the Fed helped to limit the damage to short-term bills and notes.
 
Secondary Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 102 14/32, down more than a full point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 7.91 percent. Late Tuesday the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 7.81 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 19/32 late yesterday, down 1/2 point, to yield 7.49 percent. But the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes dipped by just 2/32, to a late offered price of 100 3/8, to yield 5.92 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.99 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday. Six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 5.04 percent.
Municipal bond participants said that an offering of $600 million worth of serial and term bonds sold by the Denver International Airport went well. The sale is part of the $2.66 billion project to construct a new airport for Denver.
Securities offered yesterday carried a maximum yield of 7.95 percent on term bonds that mature in 2025.
Lehman Brothers acted as lead manager for the negotiated sale. The securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and BBB-minus by Standard & Poor's.
 
Offering by Ontario
 New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a $750 million offering of 10-year securities for the Province of Ontario.
The 8 percent securities were priced at $99.925 to yield 8.011 percent, 50 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The noncallable securities are rated AA-2 by Moody's and AA-plus by Standard & Poor's.
The First Boston Corporation served as sole underwriter of slightly more than $109 million worth of floating-rate securities backed by auto loans from the Rochester Community Savings Bank.
The securities, which have an average life of 1.34 years, float monthly and will reset at 90 basis points above the six-month Treasury bill index.
The initial rate on the securities was set at 6.86 percent.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of seven-year Treasury notes:

Yields Fall and Assets Rise For Money Market Funds

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields of both tax-free and taxable money market funds declined for the week ended yesterday.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, which monitors funds and issues the Money Fund Report, noted that "a huge inflow of funds this past week reflects relative attractiveness of money funds compared with market yields of securities like the 90-day Treasuries." 
 He pointed out that yields on money funds reflect the two months' average maturity of portfolio holdings, which translates into a higher current yield that reflects the higher interest rates of two months ago.
Money funds, he explained, will always be more attractive during a period of sharp decline in interest rates than other comparable short-term investments that mostly reflect current rates.
He reported that total assets of tax-exempt funds reversed a downtrend and rose by $2.9 billion, to $89.2 billion. "A lot of this increase is seasonal flows of money at the end of a quarter," he said. The maturity of portfolio holdings rose to an average of 62 days, up from 59 days.
The seven-day compounded average yield for the tax-exempts dropped to 4.23 percent from 4.49 percent -- a sharp decline of 26 basis points -- while the seven-day simple yield declined to 4.14 percent from 4.39 percent -- a matter of 25 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
As to the 30-day period, the compounded yields rose to 4.35 percent from 4.34 percent, and the 30-day simple yield rose to 4.26 percent from 4.25 percent -- by a basis point in each case. Mr. Frank explained that the 30-day yields still reflected rising yields in the municipal market that occurred in recent weeks up until the current week.
 
Highest-Yielding Fund
 The highest-yielding fund among those with assets over $100 million continued to be the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compounded yield of 5.22 percent, down from 5.37 percent.
Among funds investing in individual state securities in New York State, Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market continued to head the list, with the highest seven-day compounded yield of 4.95 percent, down from 5.05 percent a week ago.
In Connecticut, Prudential Connecticut Municipal Money Market Series again led with a 4.67 percent yield, down from 5.32 percent.
In New Jersey, the leader again was Calvert, N.J., Tax-Free Reserves, which reported a seven-day compounded yield of 4.89 percent, down from 5.16 percent,
Among the taxable funds, Mr. Frank said, the average seven-day compounded yield dropped to 5.21 percent, down 8 basis points from 5.29 percent. The simple yield also dropped b 8 basis points, to 5.08 percent from 5.16 percent,
The 30-day compounded yield dropped by 6 basis points, to 5.29 percent, down from 5.35 percent, and the 30-day simple yield fell to 5.16 percent from 5.21 percent.
Assets of the taxable funds rose by $9.2 billion, a larger increase than the $4.1 billion rise the previous week. Of the $9.2 billion increase, Mr. Frank said that $6.7 billion came from institutional investors, which means the public participation was up by $2.5 billion. Assets now total $461.2 billion, versus $452.0 billion last week.
Average maturities of portfolio holdings of the taxable funds moved up by a day, from 61 to 62 days.
The taxable fund with the best return was Riverside Capital Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compounded yield of 6.32 percent.
In comparison, bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, dropped to a yield of 5.00 percent, from 5.02 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

Ford Expecting More Losses

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that it expeceted to report losses for the rest of the year.
In a prospectus for a $750 million issue of preferred stock, Ford said it anticipated a third-quarter loss bigger than the second-quarter loss of $323.5 million. Ford lost $1.2 billion in the first half of this year. 
 "Because the pace of the economic recovery in the United States has been slower than had been anticipated, Ford also would expect to report a loss for the fourth quarter," said the prospectus.
The prospectus gave no indication of what the anticipated loss would be. Wall Street analysts had forecast that the General Motors Corporation, Ford and the Chrysler Corporation would break even or show a modest profit in the fourth quarter after five straight quarters of losses.
Collectively, the Big Three lost $3.2 billion in the first half of this year and they appear heading to their worst financial year in history, victims of a profound slump in car and truck purchases. In 1980, during the depths of a deep recession, the three companies lost a combined $4.5 billion.
Ford's disclosure of a probable fourth-quarter 1991 loss suggested that the other auto makers would probably report similar results.
"I don't anticipate that Ford will be alone in reporting a loss," Steven Girsky, an auto analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said today. "I think G.M. will be close by."
Ford's stock lost 75 cents a share today, closing at $29.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Tempus Fugit, but You Can Buy It

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
After a decade when Americans struggled to find more time for work to increase their earnings, what people now seem to want even more than money is time off -- time away from jobs and chores, to do whatever strikes their fancy.
As a result, many people who can afford it are trading their hard-earned dollars for services that offer hassle-free leisure time. Sensing that shift, travel and service companies are coming up with new ways to package time, wrap it as neatly as a Big Mac and sell it to the public. 
 The American Express Company, for example, is selling a packaged Thanksgiving Day in New York, with brunch, a window on Broadway overlooking the Macy's parade and dinner at the Rainbow Room. The tab is $175 for each adult and $100 for each child.
The McDonald's Corporation has just opened the first in what may become a chain of large indoor play centers that are not attached to McDonald's restaurants. The center, near Chicago, is designed to give parents burdened with chores at home a place to spend time with their children. McDonald's is wagering that parents will pay $4.95 for a place where their children can play safely while they can watch from a quiet room.
"People are now saying they are willing to give up current income for leisure time, and that is a big change," said Dr. Juliet Schor, an associate professor of economics at Harvard University. "A shift in materialist values is taking place even as economic pressure on people to work longer hours is increasing."
In the last 10 years, as incomes stagnated, many Americans worked longer hours to maintain their life styles, researchers say, and women entered the work force in unprecedented numbers.
Now, the growing demand for unharried leisure time is particularly acute among families with two working parents. Close behind are white-collar employees who no longer believe that working long and hard for money and success necessarily means they are going to live better.
A survey of 1,010 adults in January by the Hilton Hotels Corporation found that 67 percent of those responding said they would be willing to forgo one or two days' pay, or 20 to 40 percent of the their income, for a day or two of free time each week.
Asked what seemed the most important use of their time in the 1990's, by contrast to the way they spent time in the 1980's, 77 percent said they would spend more time with family and friends; 72 percent said they would use the time for self-improvement, and 66 percent would just do whatever they pleased. Only 61 percent said they would use the time to make more money. The Hilton study was done in conjunction with Prof. John P. Robinson of the University of Maryland.
People have always dreamed about having more free time. And there have been periods like the 60's when sizable numbers wanted to drop out of society altogether.
What distinguishes the current demand for leisure time, researchers say, is that it comes as most workers' incomes have stagnated. And even among white-collar workers whose incomes rose in the 1980's, the desire appears to grow not out of abundance but out of exhaustion and frustration as husband and wife both work at top speed.
 
'A Decline in the Belief in Work'
 "For white-collar workers the restructuring and downsizing of industry did something fundamental to people's thinking about where they get satisfaction in their lives," said Bickley Townsend, a vice president of the Roper Organization, a New York survey research company. "There is a decline in the belief in work as a source of satisfaction."
Professor Schor of Harvard said the average amount of time worked each year grew by 149 hours between 1969 and 1989. About half that increase took place in the last decade.
Some researchers, like Professor Robinson, have challendged Professor Schor's estimates, but most agree that the frustration about lack of time has hit working mothers hardest. Another Roper study, conducted in 1990, found that a majority of working women with children under 13 years old said they would prefer to stay home rather than to hold a paying job, by 51 percent to 42 percent. That finding represented a major reversal from 1985, when more women chose employment over homemaking by 51 percent to 45 percent.
With an ear to such sentiments, American Express announced last month that it would start selling "experiences" in sports, politics, food, literature, music and other fields -- like the Thanksgiving Day parade -- to people holding its expensive Platinum Card. The idea, the company said, is to plan all the details of a perfect evening or day off and, at a cost of $75 to several hundred dollars, spare people the trouble of making plans themselves.
"To Platinum Card members, leisure time has become a precious commodity," said John Williams, an American Express vice president for marketing. "As card members tell us about their individual interests, we will shape once-in-a-lifetime experiences to match."
 
Offering 'Quality' Leisure Time
 On a more modest level, McDonald's last month opened its first Leaps and Bounds children's center, where the product is not fast food but "quality" leisure time for parents with children.
Situated in the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Ill., the center gives adults a choice of romping with their children in an 11,000-square-foot play area or sitting in a glass-enclosed "plenty quiet" room. There they can watch their children on television monitors, read or do nothing at all.
"If it were physically possible to not require sleep, that would help out immensely," said Susan Oberling, 32, a manager at a health care company who sat peacefully, as her 7-year-old son, Michael, played outside.
"To have time together as a family is always a challenge," Ms. Oberling said, adding that she and her husband worked a total of 100 hours a week. "In the evening," she continued, "by the time my husband and I are finished working, it's time to eat dinner, do homework with my son, and then it's bedtime."
 
Successful Hilton Campaign
 Hilton Hotels discovered a successful marketing campaign over the last two years with its discount "Bounceback Weekend" at $65 to $150 a night. The chain advertised the weekend as an escape from the mounting pressures of weekends at home and awarded its weekend customers planning kits to help them schedule their weeks more efficiently.
Weekend reservations at its 260 hotels have more than doubled, Hilton says, turning Saturday night from the least popular to the most heavily booked night of the week. Other large hotel chains have mounted similar marketing efforts.
Companies that provide services that eliminate hassle or planning to free up leisure time also say they have discovered a fast-growing market. They include "drop off" day-care centers, which allow parents to leave children at almost any hour without making reservations in advance, and services that shop on behalf of busy adults. And around the nation, milk delivery is making a comeback.
 
Supermarket Shopping by Phone
 Shoppers Express, based in Bethesda, Md., allows a customer to order groceries from the supermarket by phone or facsimile machine, then delivers the order. In the last 10 weeks, it has added service in 11 metropolitan areas, for a total of 32, and now serves some of the largest supermarket chains in the nation.
"Our customers don't want to give up two hours of free time to shop," said Kevin Sheehan, a vice president at Shoppers Express. "They are the two-income families with kids. We have done two years of research and development, and we think that as we enter the 1990's these people are going to place more emphasis on time."
Other food delivery services also report steady growth in demand. Room Service, a Chicago company, permits customers to select different courses from the menus of more than 15 restaurants. Brian Keil, one of the company's founders, said deliveries in Chicago had doubled in the last year, to more than 700 a week.
 
Child-Care Centers' Tactic
 In Minneapolis, four chains of child-care centers are competing for the patronage of parents who decide to take a spontaneous day off or night out and need child care, right away. One company, Clubkid, even lends beepers to parents so they can be contacted immediately if problems develop.
Lynn Taylor, a vice president at Robert Half International, a large recruiter of accountants, financial employees and data processing personnel, said that since 1989 a growing number of companies have lured employees not with higher salaries, but with promises of shorter hours or more flexible time off.
"Many people have been through the 70-hour workweek and they are asking themselves, 'Why do I want that?' " Ms. Taylor said. "People are stepping back a bit to smell the roses."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Chrysler Is Set to Open New Center

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 9

 BODY:
While other auto makers are busy promoting their 1992 car and truck models, the Chrysler Corporation is also showing off a building that will consolidate engineers, designers and scientists under one huge roof in hopes of speeding the development of new models.
Four teams assigned to develop four future vehicle "platforms," or wheelbases, each the basis for a family of similar-size models, will occupy one entire floor at a new four-story technology center that officially opens next week in Auburn Hills, Mich., about 30 miles north of Detroit. Two years ago, Chrysler reorganized its engineering departments into platforms, in line with the structure of most Japanese auto makers. 
 Historically, American auto makers developed cars by having separate departments for each part of the same car. In recent years, more and more auto makers have developed a team approach for each family of models.
"It's extremely difficult to communicate in technical depth when people are spread out as they are," in about 40 locations in the Detroit area, said Richard Torigian, a Chrysler executive engineer. In addition to the traditional testing equipment, the center will include five laboratories that Chrysler currently does not operate, like a laboratory to test the electromagnetic interference between a vehicle's electronic components and airplanes and microwave towers.
Chrysler also hopes the technology center will promote confidence in the No. 3 auto maker's future. In a prepared statement, Lee A. Iacocca , Chrysler's chairman, called the Chrysler Technology Center the place where "the world's best vehicles will be born" and "a commitment to long-term thinking."
The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler all are trying to organize engineers into platform teams. All three continue to keep some engineers assigned to departments as specialists, as do the Japanese auto makers.
G.M.'s Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group adopted the team approach earlier so a bigger proportion of its engineers work on platform teams. Ford executives have said they are about halfway toward complete platform-team organization. And a Chrysler spokesman said virtually all engineering was organized in that manner.
 
Aging Operations
 To stay competitive, Chrysler had very little choice but to modernize its operations that are used for developing new products. Those operations are centered in Highland Park, Mich, a poor community on Detroit's north side, which has a high crime rate. Chrysler believes it will be better able to recruit young scientists and engineers to work in suburban Auburn Hills.
The expenditure, however, comes at a time when the No. 3 auto maker is having financial difficulties and vehicle sales are weak.
To pay for the building, Chrysler sold $1.1 billion worth of bonds last year, with an interest rate pegged to the auto maker's credit rating. The interest payments to holders of the Auburn Hills Trust bonds will be covered by Chrysler's lease payments on the building. Interest payments on the bonds started at about $136.1 million annually and have risen to $174.6 million at the current interest rate.
Since the sale of the bonds, however, Chrysler's credit rating has fallen to below investment grade, causing interest on the notes to rise to 15 7/8 percent from 12 1/8 percent.
The auto maker's precarious financial position began two years ago as the economy began to weaken. Chrysler lost market share and has been losing money this year.
Chrysler broke ground for the technology center in 1986. It does not expect to finish construction until 1994. At that time, the auto maker expects 7,000 people to be working there. So far, 1,200 workers have moved there. The auto maker has said it will keep its headquarters and nontechnical white-collar workers in Highland Park.

 BODY:
Allied-Signal Inc., whose spending has far outstripped the cash it has been taking in, took strong action yesterday to do something about it, including plans to reduce managerial ranks by 14 percent. In response, its stock price jumped 12 percent.
The measures reflected the determination of Lawrence A. Bossidy, the chief executive since Aug. 1, to move quickly to make Allied more competitive and cut costs. 
 The company said it also planned to cut capital spending and the stock dividend, sell 8 small businesses, and close 10 small manufacturing plants. The reorganization will lead to an $880 million charge against earnings in the current quarter.
The earnings write-off includes $200 million for potential environmental liabilities, bringing Allied's total environmental reserves to $500 million.
 
Stock No. 4 on Active List
 Many of the measures, including the dividend cut, were expected on Wall Street. Still, the extent of the reorganization pleased investors nearly as much as July's announcement that the highly regarded Mr. Bossidy had been recruited from the General Electric Company to take over from Edward L. Hennessy Jr. Allied's shares, which jumped $3.75, to $33.125, when Mr. Bossidy's appointment was announced, rose $4.25 yesterday, to $40.375. With 2.8 million shares changing owners, it was No. 4 on the New York Stock Exchange active list.
The dividend will be cut almost in half, to $1 from $1.80.
Allied, based in Morris Township, N.J., said the $880 million writeoff would result in a substantial loss for the year. The company had net income of $142 million from regular operations on sales of $5.95 billion in the first half of 1991.
 
Cut in Operating Costs
 Mr. Bossidy told analysts gathered at a midtown Manhattan hotel and listening by telephone from around the country that the various changes would reduce operating costs by $225 million, or $1 a share, next year and $350 million, or $1.55 a share, by 1994. Analysts were especially impressed by projections that the company would start taking in more cash than it was spending next year.
"It eliminates the uncertainty they have had for a long time of never having enough money to operate the business without borrowing," said Anthony Ludovici, who follows the company for Tucker Anthony.
Mr. Bossidy said the 5,000 managerial layoffs would be spread fairly evenly throughout Allied's aerospace, automotive and engineering materials businesses. The automotive sector, where 1,580 jobs, or 17 percent of the salaried work force, will be eliminated, will be the hardest hit. Allied will also close heavy vehicle component manufacturing operations in Reno and in Salisbury, N.C., and eight other auto component plants that were not named yesterday.
The plant closings and other consolidations will also eliminate 3,300 hourly jobs. Allied's total worldwide work force is about 100,000.
 
Salaried Worker Reductions
 About 700 of the job reductions in salaried workers will stem from centralizing financial, purchasing and human resource jobs. In some cases, just one of the company's three business sectors will perform work for the whole company. The aerospace group, for example, will take over all payroll operations.
"We will do work in the most economical place," Mr. Bossidy said. "There will be no stand-alone sectors." Allied also said that 10 data centers would be consolidated into one large center in Arizona and the 4 separate telecommunications systems would be consolidated into one system.
The reorganization plan also sharply reduced capital spending for 1992 from a requested $927 million to about $700 million. A substantial part of the reduction reflected the company's decision to reduce its investment in anti-lock braking systems and fluorine products. Although Allied is the leading manufacturer in the world of vehicle braking systems, it is a distant third to Bosch of Germany and the Teves subsidiary of ITT. in the sophisticated anti-lock systems segment. Mr. Bossidy said the company hopes that its newest anti-lock system, which will be tested this winter, turns out to be "a breakthrough product" but that the company will reconsider its involvement in the business if it is not.
One key element in Mr. Bossidy's plan to halt the outflow of cash is a drive to raise productivity and reduce the time it takes to make products.
One area that Allied did not cut, to the surprise of some analysts, was research and development spending. Mr. Bossidy said that when the sums devoted to engineering or provided by customers were removed from Allied's reported totals, the $430 million projected for this year represented an average commitment for the industries Allied is in.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Rich Icing For Turner Broadcasting

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
AS the Atlanta Braves stormed from well back of the Los Angeles Dodgers this summer, the stock market took notice. The team's owner, the Turner Broadcasting Company, perhaps better known for such operations as Cable News Network and Turner Network Television, followed right along.
Shares in Turner Broadcasting, which were languishing below $14 in late July, when the Braves were in third place and seemingly headed nowhere, have moved up to nearly $18 as the Braves captured the Western division title in the National League. Last night they lost the opening game of the playoffs to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Wall Street analysts say it has been the fate of the Braves that seems to have drawn investors. 
 It is a bit absurd that the fortunes of the Braves would have a big effect on the shares of Turner Broadcasting. Last year, the revenues from Turner's sports operations -- including the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association as well as the Braves -- were $34.7 million, or less than 3 percent of the company's $1.4 billion.
That figure is, to be sure, understated, since it does not include advertising revenues from broadcasting Braves games, but the fact remains that Turner's fortunes are much more dependent on trends in cable television advertising than they are on any sports activities.
But the investor enthusiasm does reflect that when given a chance, sports fans have often been willing to show their loyalty by investing in stocks representing their favorite teams. The only publicly traded team now, the Boston Celtics of the N.B.A., went public in 1986 at $18.50 a share, a price that seemed high at the time based on such things as earnings, but that reflected fan enthusiasm. The price of the shares is now $17.
The last two public offerings of shares in big league baseball teams were in 1917, when the St. Louis Cardinals went public, and in 1936, when the hapless St. Louis Browns did so. In both cases, according to an article in the Summer issue of the Friends of Financial History, the shares eventually were bought cheaply from public holders. Jason Zweig, the editor of the journal, said it appeared that public investors in the Cardinals lost money, but that investors in the Browns may have fared better than the team did.
Now the only other major league teams in which public holders have a stake are the Cardinals, owned by Anheuser-Busch, and the Chicago Cubs, owned by the Tribune Company. In each case, the baseball operations provide a minor share of revenues.
For Turner Broadcasting, the revival in the stock certainly cannot be justified by the increased profits that will come from the Braves' successes on the field. Jeff Russell and John Reidy, who follow the stock at Smith Barney, said the success may help Turner get more for ads for next year's Braves games, and probably was a modest positive for third-quarter results.
But they noted that the field success will not help the company in the current quarter. A lot of money will be spent advertising on the Braves' playoff and, if all goes well, World Series, games. But that money will go to CBS, which has the television rights.
Still, it is arguable that Turner's rise in the stock market is a belated recognition of the company's revival, which followed a 1989 reorganization that resulted in cable operators, principally Time Warner and Tele-Communications, owning a large stake in the company. Together, they now own 44 percent of the company's stock, adjusted for conversions of preferred stock. Ted Turner, the company's founder and chairman, controls 32 percent, but has voting control because the company has two classes of common, one -- class A -- with extra voting rights but inferior dividend rights, if dividends are ever paid.
Yesterday, Turner class A shares fell 12.5 cents, to $17.625, while the more widely held class B shares rose 25 cents, to $17.75, in American Stock Exchange trading.
The company has reported losses for years, but reported a profit of $4.6 million for 1990. That was not nearly enough to cover preferred dividends, but this year the company has reduced its preferred stock substantially, by exchanging it for common, and for the first six months of 1991 it reported profits of $19.1 million, or 8 cents a common share.
For all of 1991, the Smith Barney analysts think the company will earn 20 cents a share, rising to 65 cents next year.
Still, the most important fact for the company is likely to be trends in advertising, which have done surprisingly well during the recession, reflecting the success of CNN, and what happens to the current talks about Turner's acquisition of the rights to the Hanna-Barbera cartoons from Great American Communications.
But just as those factors seem to have been relatively unimportant in the rise of the Turner stock, perhaps they will also be unimportant in its trading over the next few weeks. That could depend on whether Atlanta manages to pull off still more upsets and go on to win the World Series.

HEADLINE: Dow Declines by 17.44 in Heavy Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday in heavy trading, dragged down by concern over corporate earnings, a weak bond market and fading expectations of any imminent interest-rate cut by the Fed.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.44 points, to 2,946.33, as Big Board volume reached 186.7 million shares, up from 170.1 million on Tuesday. Decliners outpaced gaining issues by a ratio of slightly less than 2 to 1. 
 Ricky Harrington, director of investment policy for Marion Bass Securities in Charlotte, N.C., called yesterday's market and the previous session a technical rally that ended about noon as bonds came under pressure. "While the broad market was considerably weaker," he said, the Dow did not fall lower because of a strong gain in one Dow stock, Allied-Signal.
For most of yesterday's session trading was mostly in the lower end of a tight range, with blue chips little changed. There is some individual buying, but on the most part investors find there is not much to motivate them ahead of a watershed of corporate earnings expected.
"A couple of significnt Dow support levels in this market have already been broken, 3,000 and 2,970," Mr. Harrington said. "How far will this market fall? Well, you now have some support at the 2,900 to 2,920 levels and a low end at 2,850 from which the market can mount a rally."
 
Vulnerability of the Market
 The market will continue to be vulnerable over the near-term for a number of reasons, one of them the bond market, he said. When the bond market rallied for several weeks, the stock market failed to match it, but now that bonds have come under pressure, stocks are following suit. Another, is the back drop of institutional investors who have some what less cash than they did a year ago.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 3.87, to 376.80, while New York Stock Exchange composite was off 1.84, to 207.95. The American Stock Exchange composite slipped 0.68, to 368.51.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite fell 3.44, to 513.81.
Millipore, a diversified manufacturer, fell 2 points, to 33 5/8, after the company, citing soft economic condition domestically and Europe, said its sales were weaker than expected for the third-quarter and nine-month period. Analysts wasted no time in lowering their own estimates.
Nordstrom fell 8 1/2, to 33 3/4, after the specialty retailer projected sharply lower-than-expected third-quarter sales and earnings results. In hectic trading more than 2.5 million shares were traded in the first hour, with 6.2 million shares changing hands for the day. Nordstrom rang the bell for other retailers, Dayton Hudson fell 2 7/8, to 66 3/4; Dillard Department Stores dropped 2 points to close at 122 1/4; May Department Stores was down 1 1/4, to 50 1/2; Sears, Roebuck, off 7/8, to 36 3/4, and J. C. Penney was down 1 1/2, to 48 1/4.
Digital Microwave, a manufacturer of telecommunications equipment rose 3/4, to 9. The company expects a second-quarter loss, but sees new order activity beginning to materialize.
Allied-Signal rang up a 4 1/4-point gain, to 40 3/8, after the announced restructuring, which was taken as a bullish move by the company.
Bristol-Myers Squibb was up 5/8, to 82 3/8, as the Food and Drug Administration approved the company's Dideoxyinosine, a drug for treating patients at advanced stages of infection with the AIDS virus.
Biogen, which reported third-quarter profits on Tuesday, rose 1 1/8 yesterday, to 34 3/8.

HEADLINE: With No Chicken in the Pot, Cubans' Faith in Castro's Revolution Is Waning

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
In this city of crumbling beauty and pressing hardship, many Cubans say that only the still-intimidating police apparatus prevents them from openly expressing the hope that their three-decade-long experience with a Communist system is drawing to an end.
Even as the international network of cold war alliances that supported him has dissolved, President Fidel Castro, the country's leader for 32 years, has warned his people that come what may, Cuba will not veer from the Communist path. 
 But in a weeklong visit on tourist's visa, which allowed more open exchanges with strangers and frank discussions with Cuban acquaintances, almost all expressed the hope or belief that with the island's economy stumbling badly and faith in the leadership thinning, Cuba was now heading toward change.
 
Bold Conversations
 "We have got to change," said one ticket agent, boldly striking up a conversation with a rare American customer. "You can't imagine what it feels like when you are on the margins while the whole world is moving forward."
"We all feel this way now," the agent said. "Change is coming. It has to. Let's hope it comes soon."
A tourist guide, among the most carefully chosen and privileged workers in the country because of their frequent contacts with foreigners and dollars, expressed similar sentiments.
Asked which of the national tourist outfits she worked for, the young woman said with a sneer: "Don't you know everything here is for the state? It's all the same. This is a really terrible system. We are a little luckier than others, but even for us, life has become rotten here."
 
Closed Communist Congress
 In the midst of what the leadership acknowledges is its worst crisis since Mr. Castro deposed the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista on Jan. 1, 1959, the ruling Cuban Communist Party has scheduled a closed congress for Oct. 10 to try to formulate a message of hope while preserving the foundations of its one-party system. Many Cubans, however, say they view the meeting as simply a bid to hold onto power rather than to move the country forward.
"How do you expect me to have faith when they lock themselves up behind closed doors?" asked one university student in a typical remark. Another man said, "If they knew how to make the economy function do you think they would wait for a congress to announce it?"
Nothing has so eroded support for the government as the recent, rampant spread of shortages of foods and consumer goods, caused in large part by the collapse of Cuba's trade with its former allies in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The shortages have come well before the full impact of the Soviet Union's recently announced disengagement from the island could be felt. And while there has never been abundance under the revolution, the new scarcities alarm many Cubans who had lived comfortable lives compared to many in Latin America.
In the living room of the cramped apartment where he lives with his wife and two children, a Cuban writer described the dispiriting dietary regimen that is now more or less standard.
 
Few Chickens
 "We get one chicken for four people every nine days, theoretically," said the writer, who like most Cubans expressed fear over having his name appear in a foreign newspaper. Referring to the small ration book that tightly governs the monthly consumption of every household, he added: "Often it doesn't work out the way the libretta suggests, though. Sometimes we only get a chicken every 15 days.
"We get five eggs a week per person," the writer continued over a glass of white wine brewed at home from green beans in a flash of the sort of creative improvisation that has flourished here in the absence of many ordinary goods. "We are given fish maybe once a month, and the condensed milk we just bought was our allotment for July."
At the mention of pork, a Cuban favorite, one woman mocked: "Is that Spanish you are speaking? Here we have forgotten what that word means."
Others tell of using Chinese toothpaste, which can still be readily found, to wash their clothes in the long and frequent absences of laundry detergent. Soap and shampoo have become just as rare, forcing most people to revert to cold water baths. The recipes that Cuban women swap these days as often as not are for homemade products for the care of their hair.
 
No Shortage of Police
 The growing candor of ordinary Cubans is more remarkable since Cuba still maintains a vast force of police officers and soldiers, both uniformed and plainclothesmen, who pervade the country's society. These police officers peer stone faced from kiosks outside foreign embassies, noting passport numbers of all who enter, unsubtly mingle in hotel lobbies monitoring foreigners' movements and keeping out Cubans, and trail visitors and eavesdrop on telephone conversations.
Human rights advocates have long faced attacks by security agents posing as offended citizens whenever they have tried to mount demonstrations or hold public meetings. Recently, the government announced the formation of "rapid response teams" to be based in neighborhoods and workplaces so they can quickly put down any discontent before it spreads.
During an earlier visit this summer, a brief and non-political conversation between an American and a group of young Cubans in Havana's Central Park, police officers quickly surrounded the young Cubans and herded them off to a side street, where they were frisked and questioned aggressively.
One question that is on everyone's minds concerns the intentions of the United States.
From thin Cuban newspapers, which for lack of paper have become increasingly hard to find, Cubans are still fed negative images of the United States.
Granma, the Communist Party daily, still devotes about a half a page to reporting every rise in American unemployment, bankruptcy or drug abuse. Murders and other crime stories from New York City are an especially favored staple.
"Are the Americans going to invade us again?" several people asked an American visitor, as if they feared some new imminent military action had already been prepared.
If Cuban news on the United States has long been skewed and sketchy, recent information about the Soviet Union, the country's closest ally for over 30 years, has become equally selective after the failed attempt by Communist Party hardliners to overthrow President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
For over a year, Mr. Castro has given ominous warnings about the consequences for Cuba should the Soviet Union somehow disintegrate. For a time, he spoke of a "zero option," or a painful if temporary shift to austere horse- and oxen-powered autarky in order to save socialism.
Hundreds of Cubans, frightened by the apocalyptic-sounding scenario spelled out by their leader and given flesh by the growing shortages, have fled the island -- by boats and rafts in most cases, or by defecting abroad, as many of the more privileged children of the revolution have recently done.
The number of Cuban boat and raft refugees rescued by the United States Coast Guard has increased more than fourfold already this year. The most recent figures show that 1,907 refugees have been taken in so far this year compared with 467 for all of 1990.
Since Mr. Castro's warnings on the Soviet Union have mostly come true, discussion in the media of the consequences for Cuba have been minimal.
"I heard they were pulling out their soldiers but that all of the commercial agreements would be maintained," said one Cuban intellectual, who like most of his countrymen seemed unaware of the extent to which Soviet subsidies have already been cut.
A street-level appraisal of Cuba's circumstances came from a taxi driver who saw the replacement of the fleet of Soviet-made Lada cabs with shiny new Nissans as a more blunt expression of the new economic realities.
"The days of great friendship are over and the Russians are asking for dollars like everyone else now," the taxi driver said. "I'll be glad when I get a Japanese car, because the Ladas were never really any good anyway."

HEADLINE: 7 Arab Houses Are Seized in Raid By Jewish Settlers in Jerusalem

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 9

 BODY:
A group of Jewish nationalistic settlers evaded the police and took over seven Arab houses today in an effort to re-establish a Jewish neighborhood at the former site of the ancient city of King David. Most were soon evicted by the police.
The incident occurred a few days before Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, is to arrive here for what many hope will be the decisive round of negotiations before the convening of a Middle East peace regional conference at the end of the month. 
 Opposition-party politicians called the action a deliberate provocation, given that Mr. Baker was confronted with new settlements in the occupied territories on several previous visits. Government officials also saw possible diplomatic effects.
Science Minister Yuval Neeman, who is a member of the far-right-wing Tehiya party, joined the settlers early this morning.
"If one result of this will be that it will be harder to convene the peace conference, I certainly wouldn't be sorry about that," he said.
The seizing of the houses before dawn set off stone throwing in an already tense city. The police here are braced for possible Palestinian demonstrations or attacks to commemorate the killing a year ago of at least 17 Palestinians near Al Aksa Mosque at Haram al-Sharif, or the noble sanctuary. Jews call the area the Temple Mount.
The Israeli police used force to oust the 50 armed settlers from all the houses except one, where four rightist members of Parliament and one family were allowed to remain, a police spokesman said.
"We knew of the moves in advance and in large measure prevented it," said Anat Granit, a police spokeswoman. "We were prepared for them."
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, an opponent of the planned Mideast conference, was asked if he supported the predawn takeover. "Jews have a right to settle anywhere in the city," he replied.
 
'Only the Street Is Left'
 Similar moves by Jewish settlers have occurred in the last year inside the Old City and in various parts of Arab East Jerusalem. A municipal spokeswoman said that such "brazen actions" only cause tension and friction among the city's 150,000 Arabs and 350,000 Jews.
One of the Arabs evicted, Jamil Ahmed Abasi, 45 years old, returned home this morning from visiting relatives and found the settlers rearranging his home and refusing him entry.
"Of course I was shocked," he said. "Where else am I supposed to go? Only the street is left."
Mr. Abasi, who has five children, is currently unemployed.
Mohammed al-Abasi, the mukhtar, or leader, of the 30,000 Arab residents of the area, Silwan, said 17 families received eviction notices from a Government body in charge of absentee properties six months ago and had appealed. A hearing is scheduled on Oct. 20, he said.
The new Jewish group, called El Ad, which means To There, supports Mr. Sharon's ideas. It said it had bought half the approximately 12 acres of land that make up the former City of David, including the houses. A spokesman, Yigal Canaan, said that an appeal against their ouster by the police would be filed with the High Court.

HEADLINE: Between Worlds: New York's Bangladeshis

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
When Maksouda Bhuiyan, an announcer on a Bangladeshi cable television program in New York City, answered a knock at her front door recently, a Bangladeshi man, his wife and their 5-month-old child were standing outside. The family, who had arrived in the United States only hours earlier on a flight from Bangladesh, carried a picture of Mrs. Bhuiyan that they had clipped from a magazine.
The couple, who knew no one in the city when they arrived about three weeks ago, needed a place to stay. Mrs. Bhuiyan allowed the family to move in with her. She did not have the heart to refuse them. She continues to feed them, and they live with the Bangladeshi family next door. 
 For many Bangladeshi immigrants, that scene has been played out often in New York City. Newly arrived immigrants who know no one in the United States search out any Bangladeshi they can find to ask for help, which is often given in the tradition of their country.
But when one of those newly arrived immigrants was arrested in April in the slaying of a woman whose family had hired him as a houseboy, Bangladeshis who had been in New York City for years began to realize the need for better services and programs to support those immigrants.
"They think they come here and everything is ready for them," said Rehana Hasan, who owns a pharmacy in Queens, and is a friend of Mrs. Bhuiyan. "The reality smashes them. It breaks them completely."
Many of the new immigrants have come to New York after winning visas in a lottery that the State Department began two years ago and that will be closed this year in an effort to increase the ethnic diversity of those entering the United States. Most Bangladeshis have settled in Jackson Heights, Astoria and Corona in Queens and work in restaurants, delicatessens and as taxicab drivers. Some move to Brooklyn, where many work on construction jobs.
Because the more than 6,500 lottery winners may bring their immediate family with them, about 20,000 Bangladeshis have come to New York in the last couple of years, said Sayed Ullah, editor of Probashi, one of the three Bengali-language newspapers in the city.
But when they arrive after leaving a land cursed by recurrent and massive natural disasters and beset by extreme poverty and unemployment, they find a community that is without many job skills or access to job training and second-language programs and that is plagued by a high unemployment rate, Mr. Ullah said. Their dreams of economic prosperity quickly dissolve into a nightmare of economic, social and cultural deprivation, he said.
The result has been a strain on New York's insular Bangladeshi community, whose 50,000 members have been struggling to find links between their native culture and their new country. The community has eight mosques in addition to the Bengali-language newspapers.
 
Frequent Arguments
 Bangladeshis point to the life of Abu Ahmed, whose wife was killed by an immigrant whom the family hired as a house boy and who has hired about 10 of the immigrants to work in the family's three Manhattan restaurants.
The Ahmeds hired Mohammad Lokman Uddin as the housekeeper at their home in Little Neck, Queens. Mr. Uddin, a 21-year-old welder from Bangladesh who spoke no English and could barely read and write in his own language when he arrived in America less than a year ago, lived with the Ahmeds and was paid $200 for a six-day week.
But he argued constantly with Noor Ahmed, who was 31 years old, adding to the strain in a household where the marriage was already troubled, friends and relatives of Mrs. Ahmed said. The police said that in a fit of rage after hearing that he would be dismissed by the Ahmeds, Mr. Uddin strangled Mrs. Ahmed and then dumped her body in her car. The police said he confessed through an interpreter to the murder.
The slaying has has led many women in the community to question their role as Bangladeshi women in the United States.
 
Contrasting Roles
 Many of the women work as doctors, dentists, social workers and in other professions, but signs of independence and assertiveness welcomed at work are frowned upon in their homes.
The community faced with the realization that a woman's place in the Bangladeshi community in New York City, while often better than that of women back home, is ruled by centuries of Muslim and Hindu tradition. Because of that tradition, Mrs. Ahmed's family and friends say, Mrs. Ahmed felt trapped in a marriage that she wanted to leave. But to leave meant being ostracized by her family and the entire community.
 
Family Influence
 "In our society, it is very difficult for a man to see a woman independent," said Syeda Khalique, a third-year law student and mother of four who runs three small businesses, an unusual accomplishment for anyone and especially for a Bangladeshi woman. "Marriage is a contract, a social duty. In our society if a woman divorces, the blame is always with the woman. The whole society feels pity for the man."
Shama Mubdi is a case manager for the New York City Human Resources Administration who has lived in America for 16 years. "We are here in America," he said, but the men "still have the old-country mentality."
And Mrs. Khalique said: "You may work and earn a living, but if you come in front of men to talk, you are shameless. Aggressiveness means you have no moral character. It is like a master-servant relationship."
Friends and relatives of Mrs. Ahmed say that Mr. Uddin, who often watched pornographic movies against her wishes, never respected her and rarely followed her instructions. Mr. Uddin, for his part, says that Mrs. Ahmed treated him "like a slave."
"I did not want to come," Mr. Uddin, who was born in Sylhet in northern Bangladesh, said in an interview at Rikers Island. "Bush gave me the lottery, and I said, 'Why not make some money.' So I came."
Members of Mrs. Ahmed's family say they are angry with themselves and with Mr. Ahmed, saying that they could have made her life happier. Mrs. Ahmed's mother, Suretunessa Laskar, said that her daughter had been deeply unhappy and had wanted a divorce, but that her family and Mr. Ahmed had forbidden it out of tradition.
"I told my sister -- you are a woman; he is a man," Sabir Laskar said. "You have to tolerate him. You can't get divorced because who will marry your daughter?"
Bangladeshi women say such an attitude is prominent in all their lives. Some women in the community, troubled by their friend's death, have begun to re-evaluate that view. They have begun to meet and discuss the complexities of their lives, their role in the Bangladeshi community and their relationships with their husbands.
But amid their discussions, they think about Mrs. Ahmed.
"I feel so much that her soul is not at rest," Mrs. Khalique said. "She used to ask me how can you be so free and I would tell her it must come from inside. I hope she is free now."

HEADLINE: Bush Said to Order China Import-Barrier Inquiry

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
President Bush has ordered a wide-ranging investigation into Chinese import barriers that could lead to punitive duties on imports from China, Administration officials said today.
Scheduled for announcement on Thursday, the President's decision reflected a broad consensus among Federal agencies that China is discriminating against American products and shows no willingness to change its policies, they said. 
 But the decision reflects not only international trade strategy but also domestic political maneuvering.
The Administration waged a fierce political battle this summer to win the renewal of China's most-favored-nation trade status. Part of the price it paid for the support of seven Democratic senators from farm states was a commitment to start an investigation if China did not change its policies soon.
The investigation ordered today would look at four ways in which Administration officials believe that China unfairly restricts imports. They are import quotas and outright bans on some products; complex import licensing requirements; highly specific technical standards that only match domestically produced goods; and a refusal to publish rules so that American businessmen can avoid legal pitfalls.
Administration officials contend that these import barriers are a major reason why China will accumulate an estimated $12 billion trade surplus with the United States this year, exporting more than $3 worth of goods to the United States for every dollar worth of imports. Chinese exports to the United States have soared while American exports to China fell slightly last year.
The Chinese Ambassador, Zhu Qizhen, said at a news conference this summer that weak Chinese imports of American goods reflected a slowdown in the Chinese economy, and not discrimination against American exports.
China is one of the largest foreign markets for American grain and agricultural pesticides, and senators from states producing these products were under pressure from constituents to vote against legislation this summer that either would have canceled the preferential trade status immediately or made any renewal next year subject to a wide range of conditions, such as an improved human rights record.
China threatened to retaliate against American exports if either measure passed, and Administration officials said President Bush would veto any legislation that did not call for an unconditional renewal.
The Senate voted 55 to 45 to impose conditions, failing to reach the two-thirds majority required to override a veto. The House passed similar legislation by slightly more than a two-thirds margin. Neither house has moved to iron out differences between the bills.
A resolution to cancel the trade status entirely passed the House by a narrow margin and was never put to a vote in the Senate.
In a letter on July 19 to Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, one of the seven farm state Senators who supported the Administration on this issue, President Bush wrote that if talks with Chinese officials in mid-August "fail to produce Chinese commitments to take substantial measures to improve market access," the Administration would take action.
The talks in August made no progress, but American trade officials gave China until the end of September to outline a new negotiating stance.
The delay infuriated Mr. Baucus, and he threatened last month to withdraw his support of Mr. Bush's position.
China gave the American Embassy in Beijing a response on Sept. 30, but Administration officials concluded that it represented no change.
Senators who voted in favor of the Administration's position in July have been put in an awkward position by a Customs Service order last Friday impounding shipments of wrenches and steel pipes from China, pending an investigation into whether they were made by prison labor.
The order followed testimony to a Congressional panel on Sept. 23 by Harry Wu, a former Chinese prisoner who said he returned to China this summer with false credentials and signed deals with prisons to ship these and other products to the United States.

HEADLINE: States' Public Workers Face New Round of Layoffs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Just as state and local governments complete an agonizing round of large-scale layoffs of public employees, many budget directors are predicting that with the economy still faltering and revenue declining, a whole new wave of layoffs may be necessary.
"I think it's going to be a really tough year," said Marcia A. Howard, research director of the National Association of State Budget Directors. "Most state budgets were based on the premise that a recovery would be well under way by now, and if it is, it certainly hasn't helped state revenues yet." 
 State and local employment has declined by 84,000 workers since July, the start of the fiscal year for nearly all states, the United State Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in early October. It was the first time in 10 years that state and local employment decreased for three months in a row.
The drumroll of layoffs is constant:
Connecticut laid off 2,500 workers last month and Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. is threatening to lay off another 7,500 unless unions provide more concessions. Massachusetts is laying off 4,000; Ohio is laying off 1,000 and Maine 200. New York State, completing a 12-month work-force reduction of 18,000 through layoffs and attrition, is laying off 1,300 this year. New Jersey has laid off 5,000 and is considering laying off another 5,000 while California plans to lay off 3,000 in January.
 
Nation's Capital Cuts Back
 Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon of Washington has sent termination notices to 126 middle-management employees, as part of her campaign promise to sharply reduce the district's 48,000 employees.
Gina Douglas, a communications specialist in Washington's Office of Personnel, said she could not answer questions about the layoffs because she herself was being laid off from her $48,500-a-year job.
"I'm just a little bit depressed today, I'm fighting back the tears," said Mrs. Douglas, 33 years old, who is married and has two children. "We have a whole host of bills associated with a car, house and two kids. It's frightening."
The continuing layoffs not only erode the traditional sense of job security associated with government work, but put a drag on the economic recovery, forcing thousands of families to tighten their belts.
Layoffs of public employees have profound social impact, too, bringing in their wake larger class sizes in schools, shorter library hours, fewer hospital beds and less protection from fire and crime.
 
Maryland Revenue Problems
 No one is certain where the cuts will end, as Maryland's experience has made painfully clear. Last year, the state laid off 3,000 employees when, for the first time in state history, tax revenue did not exceed the previous year's.
But this fiscal year, which began July 1, is looking even worse. Since then, Maryland has dropped its revenue estimates for this fiscal year by $260 million, to $5.8 billion.
So, Gov. William Donald Schaefer recently announced the layoff of 1,766 more state workers and the elimination of 420 positions that are currently vacant. The layoffs effectively eliminate rehabilitation programs for all 20,000 state prisoners and several mental health programs, close 1,000 beds in substance abuse programs, shut four state parks, two state police barracks and two medical evacuation helicopter stations.
The state also eliminated subsistence grants and health benefits for 24,000 indigent and disabled people who are ineligible for Federal welfare programs.
Things are expected to worsen in Maryland before they improve.
"Fiscal 1993, which starts next July, looks like another $600 million to $800 million deficit," said Frederick W. Puddester, deputy secretary of the State Departent of Budget and Fiscal Planning. "We're looking at more cuts and layoffs."
 
Medicaid a Big Factor
 The most serious problem in Maryland, as in other states, is the skyrocketing cost of health care in the Medicaid program for the poor.
"In the last two years, we've seen a double-digit increases in health costs and a 25 percent increase in enrollment, from 340,000 to 420,000 people." Mr. Puddester said.
The striking three-month decline in state and local government employment -- an 84,000-worker drop to 15,401,000 -- was still smaller than the 153,000 decline in state and local employment in the single month of July 1982, the start of the fiscal year after the last recession. Some experts expect the current decline to be just as steep, but take place over a longer period.
At the state level, the decline in employment was steepest in July, when the work force shrank by 21,000 workers. It declined another 6,000 in both August and September.
According to the new Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, local governments are laying off workers even faster that state governments, with the decline in local employment doubling in each of the last three months. The number of local government workers dropped by 7,000 in July, 15,000 in August, and 29,000 in September.
New York City, which has about 240,000 workers, has laid off 3,000 employees since July and may lay off up to 3,000 more, depending on union negotiations. Nassau County officials are also preparing to lay off up to 2,000 employees after labor negotiations collapsed two weeks ago.
 
Public Safety Hurt
 Cities in Massachusetts, for the third year in a row, laid off thousands of workers, including 2,500 teachers and 365 firefighters.
"We can't comfortably provide public safety at the levels of firefighters we have now," said Robert B. McCarthy, president of the Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts, a union.
Many small municipalities, he said, are making do by relying on mutual aid agreements with their neighbors.
Stephen K. Wollmer, a spokesman for the Massachusets Teachers Association, the union for the state's 68,000 teachers, said that as a result of the cuts "class size in virutally every district is mushrooming, and in some cities and towns, it is not unusual to have class sizes over 40."
Part-time government workers are especially vulnerable. The National League of Cities reports that full-time employment in large cities was stable over all last year, but that these cities reduced part-time employment by 15.2 percent. Federal employment, amounting to nearly 3 million workers, actually increased by 10,000 in the last three months, recovering some of its losses earlier in the year.
 
Decline in Tax Income
 Budget officials in 19 states, surveyed by the budget officers' association in August, said they were planning or considering layoffs this year. Since the survey, sales and income tax revenue has declined below projections in as many as half the states, the association estimated. The association expects the number of layoffs nationwide to increase sharply later this year and next as states come to grips with revenue estimates that are turning out to be overly optimistic.
Midyear tax increases are also likely in some states, according to the association. But tax increases are less of an option for most states, since they already raised taxes this year by at least $15 billion.
"States are likely to have a succession of difficult budget years," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at RockefellerInstitute. "There will be more layoffs, and I think public employment will have slower growth in the 1990's than at any time in the whole post-war period."

HEADLINE: Singapore Journal;
Back to Somerset Maugham and Life's Seamy Side

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
Discovering too late that much of its colonial history was being smothered beneath antiseptic towers of steel and tinted glass, Singapore is trying to restore what remains of its past, both the dignity and the debauchery.
The dignity is embodied in Raffles, the big wedding cake of a hotel once described as having stood "for all the fables of the Exotic East." Raffles reopened in September after a $90 million, two-year renovation intended to return the hotel to the tropical glory that attracted the likes of Somerset Maugham and Rudyard Kipling. 
 The debauchery is Bugis Street, which was once the Singaporean equivalent of Bourbon Street in New Orleans or Place Pigalle in Paris and which was largely bulldozed over in the early 1980's to make way for a new subway station.
The transvestites of Bugis Street have been quietly told that they can soon return to what had for decades been their dusk-to-dawn home. Bugis Street (pronounced BOO-gees) is being recreated.
"Darling, it's going to be show time again in Singapore," said a 34-year-old transvestite and former denizen of Bugis Street who goes by the "stage name" of Tammy Tan.
 
Losing Touch With the Past
 The restoration of Raffles and Bugis Street is the result of a larger realization among Singaporeans that, in turning a fetid, malarial port into one of the most modern, ruthlessly well-scrubbed nations on earth, Singapore was losing touch with its past.
A place that still conjures up images of opium dens, bawdyhouses and brawling, peg-legged pirates, Singapore is now better known among its Southeast Asian neighbors for Japanese-style efficiency and for hygienic standards second to none. In Singapore, you can drink the water.
In recent years, historic neighborhoods of ramshackle row houses and small shops have fallen to the wrecker's ball to make way for the futuristic office towers that now dominate the city-state's skyline.
The economic miracle of modern Singapore is the vision of the nation's first and, until last year, only Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, whose leadership involved a strong element of puritanism. It took his successor, Goh Chok Tong, to lift a national ban on jukeboxes and R-rated movies.
But this nation's 2.7 million residents are nothing if not astute business men and women, and it has occurred to many here that Singapore's sterile, oblivious-to-its-history reputation, deserved or not, could be scaring the tourists away.
Among visitors to Singapore, Japanese are the biggest spenders, and a 1989 survey found that while 47 percent of Japanese tourists were attracted to Singapore for its lush greenery and its cleanliness, only one percent said they were brought here principally by the opportunity for sightseeing.
"Singapore has a lot to offer, but I think it's true that we don't have much of what would collectively be known as historic sightseeing areas," said Jennie Chua, the general manager of Raffles. The resurrected Raffles, she said, will serve two purposes: luxury hotel and premiere tourist attraction.
Opened in 1887 and named for the colony's founder, Sir Stamford Raffles, the hotel early on developed a reputation as the home away from home for men of letters. Its guest list has included Kipling, who advised travelers to "feed at Raffles when visiting Singapore," and Maugham, who paid his first visit to Raffles in 1921 and who was said to sit beneath a fragrant frangipani tree in the hotel's Palm Court and craft short stories from tidbits of gossip overheard while supping among Singapore's gentry.
The hotel is woven into Singapore's history. In 1942, on the eve of the Japanese invasion, British colonialists made their "last stand" at Raffles, gathering to sing "There'll Always be an England."
Yet unlike the other Grand Dame hostelries of Southeast Asia, Raffles was allowed to deteriorate, a victim of Singapore's worship of the new, and by the late 1980's there were reports that the hotel, faded and a bit dowdy and therefore very un-Singaporean, was preparing to close for good.
The rescue began in 1987, when Raffles was designated a national landmark. It closed two years later for a complete rehabilitation.
The conversion has turned Raffles into a palatial all-suites hotel; each of the 104 suites is now complete with teakwood floors, 14-foot ceilings, overhead fan and handmade carpets. It will be the most expensive hotel in Singapore, with prices beginning at $350 a night.
The famed Long Bar -- where in 1903 the bartender Ngian Tong Boon created the Singapore Sling, a slow-acting concoction of gin, cherry brandy, lemon juice and soda -- has been moved to what will be a shopping-and-dining complex adjoining the hotel.
 
'A Partying Place'
 Only a few blocks north of Raffles, the rehabilitation of Bugis Street is intended to appeal to those searching for something very different -- a taste of the island's raucous, disreputable past.
Bugis Street may have had its heyday during the Vietnam War, when sailors descended by the boatful on the its open-air restaurants and hawker stalls to drink and carouse. Bugis Street accommodated them, remaining open 24 hours a day.
In a second-floor office on the recreated Bugis Street, Ronnie Chia, the developer who is overseeing the restoration, displays photographs of the street carnival that was the old Bugis Street.
"It's going to be a fun place, a partying place," Mr. Chia said of the new Bugis Street, which, like the old, will feature buildings with old terra cotta-tiled roofs and Venetian windows. "We want to create the original flavor of Bugis Street," he said. "Good food, 24 hours of fun."
"I have no objections about these ladies coming back, so long as they don't get in trouble with the law," Mr. Chia said of the Bugis Street transvestites. "This is Singapore. They will have to behave themselves."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Restores Africa Trip But With Revised Financing

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Stung by the collapse of his ambitious plans for taking a chartered airplane to South Africa with a large delegation of city officials and business executives, Mayor David N. Dinkins now plans a scaled-down trip on commercial flights, with many members of his entourage paying their own way.
The Mayor postponed the trip last month because, he said, a top aide was too busy working to calm the racial violence in Crown Heights to raise the necessary $500,000 in private funds for the flight for him and several dozen officials, aides and friends. The fund-raising effort had drawn questions from some civic groups. 
 It is not yet clear how many people will go, but the overall cost appears likely to be less than half that for the earlier plan.
 
Tentatively Rescheduled
 The trip has been tentatively rescheduled for Nov. 10 to 17, the aide, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, said yesterday. Privately raised money will still pay the way for Mr. Dinkins, his wife Joyce, Mr. Lynch and their support staff of press aides and advance team. But others, including the half-dozen city commissioners who had been invited, will be asked to pay their own $4,500 transportation and hotel costs -- about $1,500 less per person than the charter air fare and ground transport alone were to have cost, officials said.
Mr. Dinkins had focused much attention on the trip, planning to take about three dozen people, not including his immediate aides, and the effort grew unwieldy amid the city's other problems. Its sudden collapse embarrassed him and it echoed other organizational failures that have plagued his administration.
But his aides said the Mayor believed his goals for the trip -- to lend support to the African National Congress and forge cultural and economic ties between New York and any post-apartheid regime -- were badly misunderstood and unfairly criticized. Tomorrow, he is to address the City Club of New York in an effort to explain his rationale and build support for the trip.
Asked why the trip had been switched to commercial flights and the itinerary scaled down, Mr. Lynch said, "Cost, lower cost." He and Mr. Dinkins had said all along that they planned a charter flight to save time and that the large delegation was intended to make the trip more than a ceremonial visit. The Mayor had repeatedly said that he and a handful of aides could have simply made the trip but that he had higher aspirations for it than that.
Yesterday, several city officials, including Douglas H. White, the city's Personnel Director; H. Carl McCall, the president of the Board of Education, and Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the acting Health Commissioner, said they still planned to go.
"He still intends to go," said a spokesman for Mr. White, Denise Collins. "He very much wants to. He understands that he has to pay his own way."
Spokesmen for some others, including the Human Resources Administrator, Barbara J. Sabol, and the head of the Housing Authority, Laura Blackburne, said they did not yet know their bosses' plans.
The city, as it always does on mayoral trips, will pay the way for the Mayor's police bodyguards, though it will not say how many are going, citing security.
 
Money Still Being Raised
 Mr. Lynch said money for the trip was still being raised by the New York City Business Assistance Corporation, a city-controlled nonprofit group that has raised money for other events, including the ticker-tape parade for veterans of the Persian Gulf war. He said the names of the contributors would be made public eventually, but so far the administration has not released them.
After the last trip was postponed, Mr. Lynch said he would establish a citizens committee to raise funds for the trip to avoid any conflicts of interest in having him, the Mayor's chief political aide, solicit contributions from corporations and individuals. He said yesterday that the committee did not have a formal head but that some people, including Lee Dunham, head of the Harlem McDonald's Group, had been working informally to raise money.
Mr. Lynch said Mr. Dunham and other business people going on the trip had always been scheduled to pay their own way, and would now.
Under the earlier plan, the charter plane would have cost a fixed price, no matter how many people went, though the per-person cost would have been lower if more people went. Now the cost will be directly tied to the size of the party.
 
No Stop in Lagos
 The current plan would abandon a stop in Lagos, Nigeria, but still calls for a stopover in Rome in hopes of gaining a papal audience on the way to Africa.
In South Africa, the group would meet with government and opposition political figures and labor and church leaders in Johannesburg and Cape Town, and the black township of Soweto. But a planned visit to the city of Durban will probably be scrapped, Mr. Lynch said.
Mr. Lynch said City Hall was surprised that the prior plans and the postponement had caused such a stir.
"We were confused by why it caused that reaction," he said. "I thought we had laid out clearly why we were going and why it was important from an economic development standpoint. It was not just taking an entourage."

HEADLINE: The Search for Romance In the Shadow of AIDS

 BODY:
Last spring, George K., a 43-year-old family therapist from Brooklyn, placed a personal ad, describing himself as heterosexual, white, professional, spiritual, healthy and infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
"If you love warm sandy beaches, pure white snow and fireplaces, let's connect," the ad read. 
 A 34-year-old woman from Connecticut, also infected with the virus, was one of six to respond. "I view HIV as a challenge, and not as the end of my life," she wrote.
They met in April, and plan to be married next year.
 
The Need for Love
 George and his fiancee have found romance in the age of AIDS. They are among the one million Americans, gay and heterosexual, estimated to carry the deadly virus usually transmitted by sex. They live surrounded by fear and stigma, but life, with the need for love, goes on -- goes on longer than ever, as early testing becomes more widespread and treatment improves.
And as they learn to live with the virus, many of the infected are striving for companionship, sexual intimacy and even marriage.
Still, many people suffer rejection, struggle in vain to keep marriages together or withdraw into the loneliness more commonly experienced in old age or widowhood, say psychotherapists and organizers of support groups for people infected with HIV. Yet there are relationships that survive, couples that become closer and people who fall in love, sometimes with uninfected partners.
"Many people are very concerned about not ever wanting to transmit this to anyone else," said Alison M. Deming, a psychotherapist in Syracuse who works with an HIV-positive support group. "Yet the need for a relationship and someone to care about is so important. It's basic."
 
Telling, or Not
 A key question for HIV-positive people -- most of whom are between the ages of 25 and 44 -- is when and how to disclose their infection to someone in whom they are romantically interested. For some the decision is even harder, because they are also forced to disclose intravenous drug use or bisexuality.
Some say they tell straightaway. But others say that as long as they keep the risk of transmission to a minimum -- by using condoms and avoiding any exchange of blood or semen, as health experts advise -- they think that they pose little threat and feel they can withhold the information.
There are HIV-positive people who engage in sex without revealing their infection or taking precautions. Four states have passed laws that make failure to inform a sexual partner of HIV-infection before sex a crime, and 15 others have made it a crime to knowingly expose a partner to the virus.
But experts say that most people with the virus feel compelled to tell, or at least to practice preventive measures. George K.'s fiancee said she previously had a simple rule -- she would keep quiet unless there was the possibility of a long-term relationship. (Most HIV-positive people interviewed for this article either declined to be identified or allowed only a partial identification, out of concerns for their privacy, their insurance or their jobs.)
"I felt no HIV-negative man would want to sleep with me if he knew," said the woman, a physical therapist who tested positive in 1989. "My feeling was that if I was going to practice safe sex, why should I put myself on the line while there are people who do not know they are infected and are not practicing safe sex?"
Don A., a 43-year-old New York City school teacher who is gay and who tested positive five years ago, said he does not tell the men he has sex with about his infection until after their third date, although he always takes precautions.
By then, he said, he trusts the person and feels he should tell; before then, his infection is nobody's business.
"In this day and age you have to assume that everybody is positive," he said. "If you feel a condom could break, then you shouldn't be putting yourself at risk."
 
'I Wonder If It Will Make You Scared'
 But waiting until a bond has been established does not make telling any easier. Steven G., a 25-year-old gay man from Brooklyn, said it took him eight months to inform his uninfected companion of his HIV infection because he feared losing him and because "I just didn't know how to tell him." He told him in a letter.
"I keep wondering how you will take this," he wrote. "I wonder if you will be angry, disappointed or what. I wonder if it will make you scared of me."
But it did not. The two remain together, and the boyfriend still tests HIV-negative, nearly four years later.
The boyfriend, Mark A., a 29-year-old communications coordinator for an AIDS service organization, said it never occurred to him to leave. He was in love, he said, and "I don't feel I'd be any safer without Steven.
"For a gay man, there's no escaping," he said. "You either protect yourself or you're going to get it."
For Steven, an account executive for a marketing consulting firm, telling Mark was as difficult as coming out of the closet had been -- and as cathartic. Afterwards, he said, he was willing to consult a doctor and start on antiviral drugs for the first time.
But not all couples cope as well. Gail B., a 28-year-old Camden, N.J., resident, and her husband took the HIV blood test after applying for life insurance. Last year, only weeks after their first wedding anniversary, they learned that he was negative and she was positive.
"My husband has really backed away," said Gail B., who traces her infection to a previous relationship with a drug user. "Every time I don't feel well, he withdraws from me. Once he said he thinks he might be afraid to get close to me because he doesn't know how long I'll be around."
But even couples that have adjusted well and enjoy satisfying relationships are troubled by other issues. Many fear becoming a financial and emotional burden. Those who are parents ponder their children's future in their absence. Sometimes the child is also infected. Often, a couple keeps the infection a secret from family and friends, which can leave them feeling isolated.
Many people with the virus find it easier to be with someone who is also HIV-infected. Many AIDS organizations arrange social gatherings for HIV-positive people to meet, and workshops on dating and sex.
 
'We Live Now. We Don't Wait.'
 George K., who found his fiancee in the personal ads of The Body Positive, a magazine for people with the virus published by a group of the same name, said the couple share both fears and a desire to enjoy each day. A former intravenous drug user, he learned of his infection in 1988.
"We live now. We don't wait," he said. "The new car next year is not as important as what we can do now."
The only disadvantage in their relationship, they said, is a temptation not to practice protected sex since both are HIV-positive, despite the possibility that they could reinfect each other with different strains of the virus and further weaken their immune systems.
"For us," his fiancee said, "part of it is denial and that we can pretend for a short time that we're like regular people."
But sharing the virus is no guarantee of a better relationship. Debra Chabrier, 35, of the South Bronx, said she and her husband, both former intravenous drug users, went in different directions after both tested positive six years ago. She overcame her heroin addiction, had a son three years ago despite the urgings of doctors and relatives and now goes to school. The boy, Isaac, is free from HIV.
Her husband, who used to work as a security guard, now is unemployed, stays home and recently began using crack.
But she stays with him, she said, because she feels sorry for him, out of gratitude for the care he gives when she is sick and out of fear of being alone. They are no longer lovers. "He sleeps. He doesn't go anywhere. He has no friends," she said. "He watches cartoons all day and night. He says that's his therapy."
Many HIV-infected people choose celibacy. Victoria Gonzalez, a 42-year-old grandmother who tested positive for the virus last December, a month after her husband died of AIDS, said she will not go out with men, mostly because she feels "marked."
"When you say, 'I'm HIV-positive,' you're saying 'I'm a walking infection,' " she said. "I don't want to share this with anybody."
Marcie L., a 22-year-old business student in Manhattan, broke off her engagement and ruled out any future love relationship when she learned three years ago from a routine blood donation that she was infected.
She said she does not want to deal with the risk of passing on the virus, even with safeguards like condoms.
"It's frustrating sometimes," she said of her decision to give up the idea of marriage or a family. "I didn't care much about life until I realized life is so limited. It hurts."
Still, she dates, just for fun, she said. But when a man gets too interested, she lies and tells him she is seeing someone else.
Lee G., a 41-year-old health professional in Manhattan, said she made one attempt at dating after she found out she had the virus in 1989. But she said that after several outings, her date kept pressing her to go to bed.
When he hinted that there could be something wrong with her, she told him she was HIV-positive. "He cried," she said. "He said, 'I'm sorry I asked you.' "
The two stayed friends.
Although the need for companionship is central, some HIV-positive people say that a love relationship also gives them a sense of security.
Steven G. said he feels under extreme pressure to make his relationship work. "I feel it's my last long-term relationship," he said, but also because he cannot afford to lose his boyfriend.
"If I get sick, he'd take care of me," he said. "It's a very selfish thing to feel but knowing that he's negative is a big safety net for me."
George K. does not count on his HIV-positive fiancee to see him through his illness. Her own health might falter first, he said, or she might not be able to handle the stress.
All he wants, he said, is to enjoy a rewarding relationship, even in the shadow of AIDS. "It's all attitude," he said. "You have to be thankful for what you have.
"I have a career. I have health. I have a wonderful woman in my life.
"I'm alive."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Details His Medicaid Plan, And Reviews Are Less Than Raves

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today filled in the framework of his plan to overhaul the state's Medicaid system with cold numbers that were ridiculed by Republican legislators, rejected by hospital officials and viewed warily at City Hall in New York.
Two weeks ago Mr. Cuomo proposed that the state assume by the end of the century the full share of Medicaid costs paid by local governments, now totaling $2.8 billion. In exchange, localities would give up a share of their taxing authority to the state. 
 Today, detailing his plan publicly for the first time, Mr. Cuomo revealed that New York City would be asked to give the state all of its personal income tax revenue by the year 2000 if the state is to assume Medicaid costs now paid by the city.
 
For Suburbs, Sales Taxes
 Under the plan, counties outside the city would sacrifice the revenues generated by up to 1 percentage point of their sales taxes. State law allows counties to levy local sales taxes of up to 4 1/4 percent.
Although Mr. Cuomo has proposed that the city sacrifice all of its personal income tax revenues, he said today that the city would still reap a windfall from the takeover, an amount that would grow to $1.2 billion by the city's 1999-2000 fiscal year, he said.
But city officials were wary, saying they would have to study the economic underpinnings of the Governor's proposal to be sure that the city would not lose more than it gains.
"One of the things that needs to be reviewed carefully is what happens if the personal income tax grows more quickly than Medicaid," said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, who called the plan "a point of departure."
But state officials said guarantees would be written into the plan to insure that the city and other local governments could not lose money.
Mr. Cuomo also revealed that his plan is based on assumptions that local tax collections would grow by an average of 5 percent a year and that Medicaid costs would grow by 12 to 13 percent a year through the end of the century. That led the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., to call the plan "a house of cards built on overly optimistic forecasts."
The Senate Republicans, who have their political base upstate and on Long Island, have expressed reservations about the plan because of a perception that their counties would benefit far less than New York City, which has most of the state's Medicaid recipients.
State officials say the plan released today would produce net savings of $1.6 billion for all local governments, including $1 billion for New York City, in the state's 1999-2000 fiscal year. But the city would receive only a fraction of that amount in the immediate next three years. That has prompted city officials to complain that the plan does not do enough to help them avoid large deficits in the next three years.
"If you're going to say this is a 20th century idea, why wait until the 21st century to see it fully implemented?" an aide to Mayor David N. Dinkins said today.
 
Immediate Gains Projected
 City officials have projected budget shortfalls of at least $1.5 billion in each of the next three years. The city budget this year is $28.5 billion. Mr. Cuomo's plan projects that the city would see a net gain of $78 million in the city's 1992-93 fiscal year, $169 million in 1993-94 and $273 million in 1994-95.
By the city's 1999-2000 fiscal year, which differs from the state's, the city would save $1.2 billion, the plan projects. The savings would result from the city's giving up $5.3 billion in Medicaid costs while giving up only $4.1 billion in income tax revenues.
What remained unclear today was how Mr. Cuomo would bring the cost of the $12 billion Medicaid program down to a more manageable level. He and his aides have said that cost containment would be the fiscal and political key to enacting the Medicaid proposal. The Republicans, who control the State Senate, have said that they would not consider the plan unless serious efforts were made to reduce costs.
"It's the price of admission," said Patrick J. Bulgaro, the state budget director.
 
Sharing Burdens
 Under Mr. Cuomo's plan, local governments would save $150 million from cost containment in the state's 1993-94 fiscal year. But the plan did not specify how the savings would be produced. His aides said only that the Governor would take "a balanced approach" by trying to place equivalent burdens on both Medicaid recipients and health care providers when proposing next year's budget.
But the fact that the proposal relies so heavily in its early years on cost containment has already generated opposition from hospital officials.
Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said yesterday, "We're not on board on the takeover at this point because the takeover looks like nothing more than a cost-shifting to the already financially strapped hospital community and its patients."

HEADLINE: ON PRO BASKETBALL;
The King Has No Time for Bush

BYLINE: By Harvey Araton

 BODY:
President Bush, or anyone else, ought not be upset with Michael Jordan for failing to attend a White House reception last week with the Chicago Bulls. Why should Jordan have traveled all the way to Washington so the President could enjoy such a rare and important photo opportunity?
It seems only fair that Bush visit Michael, a busy man with domestic and global responsibilities, at Michael's house. 
 As a habit, Jordan does not favor political alignments, but it is unlikely that he would refuse to open his home to the President, especially if Bush contacted Jordan's agent, David Falk of ProServ, to make an appointment. (White House staff should be aware that Jordan is currently engaged in rigorous two-a-day practices with the Bulls and prefers a relaxing round of golf during the middle of the day.)
It's not as if the President is dying in the polls, but an election year is coming, the economy remains weak, the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court can't be helping, and who in this country currently has a higher approval rating than Michael Jordan?
Following his and the Bulls' ascension to the National Basketball Association championship last spring, Jordan has made the final leap from adroitly marketed basketball phenomenon to indisputable American icon. He's everywhere -- cereal boxes, fast-food joints, soft-drink bottles, basketball shoes, in the hearts and minds of millions -- except the White House. Maybe some day he'll run.
NBC, realizing the consumer-friendly benefits of Jordan on the air, has recently become the Michael Jordan Channel. First there was a prime-time tribute to Jordan, with the comedian Billy Crystal as host. Then there was the hourlong show to announce the 1992 U.S. of N.B.A. Olympic team, climaxing with a live studio presentation of Jordan as the primary defender of that American birthright, the basketball gold medal. Next came a week's work as the host of "Saturday Night Live."
Between television gigs, Jordan slipped down to his home state, North Carolina, to have a stretch of highway named after him. Which will be the first American city to take the next obvious step and rename the airport?
One day last summer, sitting in his Roslyn, Va., office, Falk revealed that organizers of the Emmy Awards were after Jordan to appear on their show. "I'd love for him to do it," Falk said. "But I know what he's going to say when I bring it up to him. That's another day gone, when he'd rather be with his family or out on the golf course. I don't even know if I'm going to mention it to him.
"You wouldn't believe all the requests that Michael gets. He gets asked to do so many charitable and community activities, more than one a day. If he did them it would be a full-time job. Beyond basketball and the community, he has his business obligations, and like all normal human beings, he wants to have enough time for himself."
When Jordan opted not to appear at the White House with the Bulls, his decision created a controversy in Chicago as the Bulls opened their training camp. It was suggested in print and even by some of the Bulls, most notably Horace Grant, that Jordan should not be allowed to place himself above the team.
The Bulls' coach, Phil Jackson, was asked to comment, and looked amused. He was likely thinking: Where does everyone think Jordan has been all these years?
Larry Bird and Magic Johnson carried the N.B.A. out of its sickbed in the early 1980's and taught it to walk, tall and proud. Jordan is helping it fly. Doing roughly $15 million annually in endorsements, he is Star Trek, the Next Generation, where no athlete has commercially gone before.
It apparently took stiffing the President for Chicago to notice that there are different rules for Michael Jordan, and have been since he took that city by storm in 1984. Jordan is no saint. He probably kept Isiah Thomas off the Olympic team. He has been manipulative within the Bulls' organization relating to personnel, just as the much-maligned Thomas has been in Detroit. He has hardly used his power to address prevalent black issues. But here, finally, is a black American athlete so successful in the art of overcoming racial stereotypes and marketing to mythical proportions that he can get away with telling the White House, sorry, he's busy.
Maybe next year.

HEADLINE: Hilton Net Drops 14.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Oct. 10

 BODY:
The Hilton Hotels Corporation said today that its third-quarter net income fell 14.2 percent from the third quarter of 1990, when the company reported a large gain from a property sale.
Despite problems in the hotel division, Hilton's operating income rose 18 percent during the July-September quarter, reflecting better results from Nevada gambling operations. 
 The hotel and casino operator earned $18.8 million, or 39 cents a share, in the latest quarter. That compared with $21.9 million, or 45 cents a share, a year ago. The earlier figure included $6.5 million, or 13 cents a share, from the sale of a half-interest in the Hotel Conrad Hong Kong.
Revenue rose 5.5 percent in the quarter, from $260.1 million to $275.1 million.
"All of our Nevada gaming properties recorded improvements in operating income from a difficult third quarter last year," Barron Hilton, the company's chairman and president, said in a statement.
"However, the soft U.S. economy, and generally overbuilt conditions in many markets, continue to adversely affect our hotel division."

Bowater Buys Great Northern

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The Georgia-Pacific Corporation said today that it was selling 80 percent of its Great Northern Paper Inc. operation to Bowater Inc. for $300 million in cash.
The Great Northern acquisition will increase the mill capacity of Bowater, based in Darien, Conn., by about 40 percent and more than double its timberland holdings. 
 The major bond ratings agencies expressed concern that the deal might increase Bowater's financial risk. The company's senior debt and preferred stock, currently rated A, were placed on creditwatch yesterday by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, with negative implications. Moody's Investors Service Inc. also mentioned a possible downgrade.
The sale reduces Georgia- Pacific's holdings in Maine just 18 months after its merger with Great Northern Nekoosa Inc., the largest merger ever in the forest products industry.
Bowater will manage Great Northern Paper and will have the option to purchase the rest of the company from Georgia- Pacific after June 30 for another $22 million.
Bowater will acquire Georgia-Pacific's mills in Millinocket and East Millinocket, Me.; hydroelectric assets that power the mills; an Ashland, Me., lumber company and about 2.1 million acres of timberland.
Georgia-Pacific, a $13 billion forest products company, has been hurt by the recession and the subsequent housing downturn.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Higher on Concern Over Yeltsin's Whereabouts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher in volatile trading yesterday as a result of rumors that the Russian President was missing.
Gold prices declined after rising overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery slipped 70 cents to settle at $358.80. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid price of $358.30, off 70 cents an ounce from Wednesday. 
 The dollar opened lower in domestic trading but soon reversed course when rumors hit the market that the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, was missing. He was vacationing on the Black Sea.
The rumor "created a flight-to-quality buying of dollars," said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer at Barclays Bank P.L.C. The dollar is considered a safe haven in times of world turmoil.
A second bout of dollar-buying was prompted when President Yeltsin's deputy was reportedly unable to reach him. Reports of Mr. Yeltsin's disappearance were denied, but not before the dollar had broken through key technical levels.
"There was no hard economic data to trade off of," Mr. Hatcher was, explaining why the rumors had such a strong impact on trading.
Today, the Government is scheduled to release producer prices and retail sales reports for September. While many expect the data to reflect controlled inflation and a sluggish economy. Mr. Hatcher said the market had probably already taken that into account and the reports may have little influence on trading if they come in as expected.
Japanese markets were closed for the Sports Day holiday. In European trading, the dollar slipped to 130.30 yen, from 130.40 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday. In New York the dollar settled at 130.35 yen, up from 129.80 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7150, compared with $1.7175 on Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.7145 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.7195.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6960 German marks, up from 1.6890; 1.4845 Swiss francs, up from 1.4785; 5.7780 French francs, up from 5.7515; 1,268.25 Italian lire, up from 1,262.25, and 1.1293 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1308.

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs 30.19; Program Trading Cited

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Stock prices rose strongly yesterday, despite growing investor concern about the prospect of lower corporate earnings. After a lackluster morning and early afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average surged to close at 2,976.52, up 30.19 points.
Analysts said the increase was largely a result of program trading. Indeed, Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said computer-driven trading accounted for about 87 percent of the Dow's ascent. 
 The Dow slipped below its opening level twice yesterday before turning upward. Birinyi Associates said that there were three buy programs in the afternoon, with the most significant occuring at 3:43 P.M., and continuing until the end of trading. Program trading accounted for about an hour of trading, nearly twice the average of recent months, Birinyi said.
The Nasdaq composite index was up 2.13 points, to 515.94. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose less than one-tenth of 1 percent, to 368.59. The Standard & Poor's 500 stocks were up 3.75 points, to 380.55. And the New York Stock Exchange index was up 1.60 points, to 209.55.
"Even though the Dow rose, there are still some concerns about corporate earnings," said Edward J. Shopkorn, managing director of institutional equities with the Mabon Securities Corporation. "And people are waiting to see what the Federal Reserve will do about interest rates. So it seems that today's action doesn't mean anything." He added that the market could well fall further.

 Two big movers on the Dow yesterday were I.B.M. and J.P. Morgan, which were each up 2 3/8. I.B.M. rose to 99 3/4. J. P. Morgan rose to 63 3/8 after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Also, General Electric was up 1 7/8, to 67 1/4. Minnesota Mining rose 1 3/4, to 90 5/8. Procter & Gamble rose 1 3/8, to 83 1/4. Those five stocks accounted for 57 percent of the Dow's movement.
The Dow Transport stocks showed particular strength, rising 23.54 points, to 1,206.46, a gain of nearly 2 percent. Setting the pace for thatgain was American President, an operator of container ships. The company's stock was up 4, to 39 1/2. American President earnings were up sharply and the company's chairman said that the upward trend will continue into next year because of improving conditions in the shipping industry.
On the New York Stock Exchange, the most active issue yesterday was the Limited, which was down 1 3/8, to 21 3/4. Analysts said that the stock fell because of retailers posting weak sales in September.
On a percentage basis, the biggest gainer on the big board yesterday was General Datacomm, a maker of data communications networking equipment. The company's stock rose 3/8, to 3, a gain of 14.3 percent.
In over-the-counter trading, the most active issue was Scitex, an imaging and computer graphics company. The company's shares were down 2, to 34 1/2, with 5.3 million shares changing hands. The Israel-based company's shares slipped because of new shares being on the market stemming from a secondary offering, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Seven Troubled Banks Shut in New Hampshire

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation yesterday closed a group of seven New Hamphire banks owned by five diffferent banking companies, and said the banks would open today under new ownership.
The failed banks, which account for about a quarter of the New Hampshire market, were closed and sold as a group rather than individually, to limit disruption of the local economy, L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C. said. Officials at the agency have said they may consider similar treatment of other clusters of weak banks. 
 Deposits of all the banks continue to be insured by the F.D.I.C. for up to $100,000 for each account, and all customer accounts will be transferred to the new owners. While the five banking companies had total assets of about $5.2 billion, the F.D.I.C. estimated the cost to the Government of the failures at $966 million. The unusually large loss, compared with the size of the banks, is an indication of the severity of the banks' problems with bad real estate loans.
 
4 Go to First NH Bank
 A group of four commercial banks with total deposits of $1.8 billion -- BankEast of Manchester, Amoskeag Bank of Manchester, Bank Meridian of Hampton and the Nashua Trust Company -- will reopen as branches of the First NH Banks Inc. of Manchester, a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland, with $1.3 billion in deposits. Nashua Trust, Bank Meridian and Amoskeag were all part of Amoskeag Bank Shares Inc., once the largest banking company in the state.
First NH, which the Irish bank acquired in late 1988 for $370 million, is the state's largest banking company, with $3 billion in assets and 57 branches in all 10 counties of the state. Since the purchase, losses at First NH have caused the Irish bank to inject an additional $145 million in capital to keep the bank strong enough to make acquisitions.
 
3 to New Dartmouth Bank
 A group of three savings banks with total deposits of $2.2 billion -- the New Hamphsire Savings Bank of Concord, Dartmouth Bank of Hooksett and Numerica Savings Bank of Manchester -- will open as branches of the New Dartmouth Bank of Manchester, a newly created bank owned by a group of private investors.
The investor group, which was assembled by Kidder, Peabody & Company, is led by William F. Craig, a former vice chairman of the Shawmut Bank, Boston, and Robert P. Keller, the chief operating officer of Dartmouth Bank.

HEADLINE: Corporate Economists Urge Further Easing by the Fed

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., Oct. 10

 BODY:
A panel of economists from a score of the nation's biggest corporations recommended today that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates further to keep the recovery from stalling.
"Some further reduction in interest rates would be a prudent policy step to help assure that adequate growth does in fact occur," the economists said. "Preventive action now is preferable to waiting until new weakness becomes apparent." 
 The Business Council's prediction of a 2.4 percent rate of growth in the gross national product for the quarter ended Sept. 30 and of a 2.5 to 3 percent growth rate through the end of 1992 differed little from the forecast it made in May at the earlier of its semiannual meetings at the Homestead Resort in southwest Virginia.
But the undertone of the report and the forceful recommendation for an additional easing of monetary policy reflected less confidence that the recovery can be sustained.
The group, which met on Oct. 1 to assemble the latest forecast, said the prediction was subject to "considerable downside risk" from sources like interest rates, job losses, stress in the financial system and an actual decline in the aggregate net worth of consumers, which fell in 1990 for the first time since 1962.
A separate panel of top corporate executives who constitute the membership of the Business Council was generally even less optimistic than the economists, with at least two of them urging a big easing by the Fed.
"We're in a very, very slow growth situation," said James D. Robinson 3d, chairman, chief executive and president of American Express. "We think a bold step should be taken." When asked how much the Fed should ease rates, Mr. Robinson suggested a full percentage point from levels that are already among the lowest in at least a decade.
John F. Welch Jr., chairman and chief executive of General Electric, said the risks of bold action would be minimal because of the greatly diminished upper pressure on prices.
When asked about the possibility of a so-called double-dip recession, Mr. Welch said the question implied that the economy was already recovering. "We are not seeing any 'out' yet," he said, disagreeing with the consensus among economists -- as opposed to company executives -- that a recovery started in the spring.
John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, said he saw the economy exhibiting "limited signs of life," with consumers and lenders remaining cautious. He said 50 percent of credit card customers were now paying off balances monthly, well above the usual 30 percent.
With inflation "gone as an immediate issue," Mr. Reed added, there is "tons of room" for the Fed to further ease monetary policy.
And while John G. Smale, chairman of the executive committee of Procter & Gamble, said his company began to see some rebound in its business in May, the chairman and chief executive of another consumer products company, H. Brewster Atwater Jr. of General Mills, was far less optimistic.
"It is a slow and dragging recovery," with consumer spending down twice as much as disposable income, Mr. Atwater observed. "There is an opportunity for the Fed to loosen up a little further."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Selloff Continues

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The selloff in the Treasury bond market continued yesterday, as inflation worries prompted speculators and retail accounts alike to sell long-term securities. Traders feared that the economic recovery sought by the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve Board may push up inflation.
The rise in bond yields, which continued to move toward 8 percent, came on a day when the nation's leading retail chains reported that sales were weak in September. 
 "The fundamentals for the economy are not any different, but expectations about the future are different," one government bond trader said.
"People are somewhat concerned that the Administration and the Fed will do almost anything to get us out of recession. That concern has created uncertainty about whether or not the Fed is abandoning efforts to contain inflation."
Concern about reports scheduled to be released today, including producer price numbers and retail sales for September, may have also touched off some selling, analysts said.
And comments by Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, may have heightened the notion that the recovery is gathering steam.
Mr. Parry told a conference at California State University yesterday that the economy emerged from recession in the third quarter. He added that a number of current factors, including recent declines in interest rates and growth in industrial output, should help sustain the momentum in months ahead. Mr. Parry spoke before the Fed issued its weekly report on money growth.
Sluggish growth in the monetary aggregates, especially M-2, the money measure the Fed tracks most closely, has been a source of mounting concern at the central bank. The figures released yesterday did little to allay those worries.
The Fed reported that the two largest monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, posted big declines in the week ended Sept. 30. The narrowest measure, M-1, rose by $4.6 billion.
The $3.2 billion decline in M-2 pushed growth in that aggregate down to 2.2 percent, from the fourth quarter of 1990. That level is below the 2.5 percent rate that is the lower end of the Fed's target range for the year.
Moreover, the Fed announced that in the third quarter M-2 growth fell by three-tenths of 1 percent. It is the first quarterly decline in the aggregate since 1959, when the Fed began tracking M-2.
 
Treasury Prices Recovered
 Treasury prices recovered somewhat after the money numbers were released. Analysts said the weakness increases the chances that the Fed will ease monetary policy soon, especially if today's reports reflect a moribund economy accompanied by modest inflation.
The retail sales report "will either confirm or refute the pervasive anecdotal evidence that retailing is still in the tank," said David H. Restler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "If the numbers are weak, then I think the Fed will probably have to act."
The Fed prefers to have its easing moves follow a decline in market interest rates. As a consequence, the rise in bond yields this week cannot be viewed as a favorable development.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 29/32, down 17/32, to yield 7.95 percent, compared with 7.91 percent late Wednesday. So far this week, yields on the benchmark issue have risen by nearly 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year securities were offered at 102 5/32, down 14/32, to yield 7.55 percent. And the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes dipped by 2/32, to 100 10/32, to yield 5.95 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.00 percent, up one basis point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged on the day, at a late offered rate of 5.04 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.08 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the NCNB Corporation offered $300 million of 10-year subordinated notes through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 9 1/8 percent notes, which mature Oct. 15, 2001, were priced at $99.56, to yield 9.193 percent, 1.65 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The noncallable securities are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues fell by about 1/8 point. Trading activity, which has been sluggish lately, picked up yesterday, market participants said.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues dipped by about 1/8 point, according to traders.

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Posts Record Earnings

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company yesterday announced a record quarterly profit, largely as the result of increased earnings in a wide range of trading activities.
Among other banking companies to report earnings, the Bank of New York Company announced lower profits as it charged off a loss on more bad loans. But the company said its holdings of troubled loans fell for the second consecutive quarter. 
 The Wachovia Corporation of Winston-Salem, N.C., reported slightly improved earnings.
At a time when profits at many banks have been weighed down by record-high loan losses and weak demand for new loans, Morgan has prospered by shunning the riskiest borrowers and building its trading businesses. Its low loan losses have helped Morgan maintain top-notch credit ratings, which in turn have helped its trading business by attracting corporate treasurers who prefer to arrange their currency and interest-rate swaps with the strongest banks.
 
Morgan
 In the three months ended Sept. 30, Morgan earned $373 million, or $1.89 a share, up 79.3 percent from $208 million, or $1.08 a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter profits were raised $32 million, or 17 cents a share, by a one-time gain from the early retirement of a bond issue.
Morgan's profits were better than some analysts expected, and helped the company's stock climb $2.50, to $63.375, in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Moves by the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term interest rates also helped Morgan, as well as many other banks, analysts said. As rates have fallen, the difference between the interest rates banks pay for deposits and the rates they charge on loans has grown. At the same time, banks that trade securities have benefited from the lower cost of borrowing needed to finance their inventories, and in many cases from price gains in their securities holdings.
Norman Jaffe, a banking analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc., a securities firm, said that Morgan's low loan losses were not typical among other large banks, which he expects will report higher-than-normal loan losses and continued increases in delinquent loans.
Analysts at Merrill Lynch & Company noted in a recent report that the increases in troubled loans this quarter will generally be smaller than previous quarters, except for some banks in the West. They said that bank profits would also be hurt by weak loan demand. Earnings for regional banks, they concluded, "are recovering, but ever so gradually."
 
Bank of New York
 At the Bank of New York, a sharp rise in losses from bad loans pushed its third-quarter profit down 16.9 percent, to $59 million, or 72 cents a share, from $71 million, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier.
The bank said it charged off $252 million in loan losses, up from $148 million a year earlier. At the same time, however, the bank said its holdings of nonperforming loans had fallen by $280 million since midyear to $1.57 billion. Much of the increase in charge-offs was the result of the sale of loans for commercial real estate projects and loans to highly indebted companies that had previously been listed as nonperfoming.
Analysts said the decline in nonperforming loans -- those that are badly delinquent or so troubled that the bank does not expect full payment -- helped raise Bank of New York stock $2.50, to $30.75, in Big Board trading yesterday.
Bank of New York also announced that it had decided not to sell its subsidiary BNY Financial because of the unit's strong performance and because the parent company's capital strength had improved without the sale.
BNY Financial, which specializes in making business loans secured by receivables, is the third-largest lender of its type, with about $800 million in assets and annual volume of over $6 billion.
 
Wachovia
 Among other regional banking companies, the Wachovia Corporation announced third-quarter profits of $80.6 million or $1.12 a share, up 6.9 percent from 75.4 million, or $1.07 a share, a year earlier.
Wachovia has long been one of the country's most profitable banking companies with a good record for avoiding bad loans. Its chairman, John Medlin, attributed the meager increase in profit to weak loan demand and increased loan losses caused by the weak economy.
Wachovia's shares fell 12.5 cents each yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $55.125.

HEADLINE: Potamkin, Cadillac Maven, Is Back

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Cadillac executives never questioned Victor Potamkin's ability to sell cars during his 15 years as a Cadillac dealer. But his flashy, low-price pitches to New Yorkers did not always square with the auto maker's high-style marketing approach.
Now, after Mr Potamkin sat it out for four years while Cadillac floundered with a more refined approach, Cadillac officials have decided that the 80-year-old Mr. Potamkin knows New Yorkers. Potamkin Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet is scheduled to open Tuesday at the same stand where Mr. Potamkin sold Cadillacs from 1972 to 1987. 
 In each of those years, Mr. Potamkin said he was the national sales leader by far for Cadillac, averaging 6,000 cars a year. By comparison, today's top-selling Cadillac retailer averages about 1,600 cars a year.
"We missed him," said Peter R. Gerosa, Cadillac's general sales and service manager, who is confident that Mr. Potamkin will regain the title of national Cadillac sales champ. "I'm sure he's going to do it with Cadillac style, but maybe with a little Potamkin style thrown in. We want him to sell cars."
Mr. Potamkin's return comes not a moment too soon for beleaguered Cadillac, whose sales nationwide are off 20 percent from last year's level as of September, and have been in a slump for the last two years thanks to insurgent brands like Lexus and Infiniti. In Manhattan, Cadillac is eager to fill a troubling void because it has been without a dealer for its new cars since Roger Penske closed his dealership in May.
Mr. Penske, who runs a transportation conglomerate with interests that range from truck rentals to diesel engine-making to Indianapolis 500 racing, closed Penske Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet after struggling for four years with dismal sales.
When Mr. Potamkin bowed out of the business, General Motors took the occasion to dress up the dealership and tried to sell cars with a more refined approach. The lighting was more subdued, Italian ceramic floors were installed and stainless steel cabinets were moved into the repair area. The idea was to offer New Yorkers white-glove treatment more in keeping with Cadillac's self-styled image.
 
Not As Many Ads
 Mr. Penske did not advertise as much as Mr. Potamkin, and he did not discount his cars as deeply. As a result, Mr. Potamkin, who watched the proceeding closely, doubts that Mr. Penske sold in a year what Mr. Potamkin moved every two months.
After Mr. Penske closed the dealership, Mr. Potamkin said he called General Motors this summer to suggest that he could get the dealership humming again. A sometimes critic of Cadillac's previous products like the ill-fated engine that ran alternatively on four, six and eight cylinders, Mr. Potamkin says he loves Cadillac's new offerings, especially the sporty Seville STS and Eldorado models which were dramatically redesigned for 1992.
"New York City is a General Motors town," he said, and the luxury car maker should have representation there.
Mr. Potamkin gave up the dealership in 1987 because he wanted to devote more time to raise money to fight Alzheimer's disease, which afflicts his wife, Luba. He said he would continue with his work to help fight the disease. He and his sons, Robert and Alan, will be the principal investors in the dealership, along with James Goldfein, a longtime Potamkin lieutenant, who will be the dealership's general manager. The Potamkins own about 50 dealerships in five states on the East Coast, including a Cadillac dealership in Atlanta. Sales in 1990 totaled nearly $800 million.
 
A Gloomier Market
 Mr. Potamkin will be operating in a gloomier market for selling Cadillacs than he left four years ago. He signed over his busy dealership to Mr. Penske just three days before the stock market crashed on Oct. 19, 1987, and the New York economy has been crippled ever since.
Even in a strong economy, selling cars in Manhattan is difficult and expensive. Overhead costs are about 35 to 40 percent higher than a comparable dealership in an outlying suburb, Mr. Gerosa said. Just arranging test drives on crowded Manhattan streets is a challenge.
But Mr. Potamkin, who first went into business in 1946, is undaunted. "We've seen this market before," he said, adding that New York drivers consider their luxury cars a necessity.
Mr. Potamkin declined to predict sales for the dealership, but said the key to succeeding in the expensive New York market was sales volume. As a dealer, he sold an average of 500 Cadillacs a month. His best month was May 1982, when he sold 968 Cadillacs. The current Cadillac retail sales leader, which does not include sales to corporate fleets, is Don Massey Cadillac in Plymouth, Mich., which sells about 135 cars a month.
Mr. Potamkin said he would use promises of low prices and customer satisfaction in his advertisements, and also key the ads to leasing. Leasing is important to Cadillac because lease customers are typically 10 years younger than Cadillac buyers, who average 65 years of age. Cadillac needs to woo younger drivers to insure its future; with its new Seville and Eldorados it hopes to attract buyers as young as age 35.
The opening of the Potamkin dealership was delayed partly by contract negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union, which represents many of the service workers. A clause in Mr. Penske's contract with the U.A.W. required his successor to honor the contract. But Potamkin officials balked at some of its terms, including high wages negotiated with Mr. Penske. Severance packages also had to be negotiated for some workers who would not be needed at the new Potamkin dealership.
Cadillac officials contributed an undisclosed amount of financial support to bridge differences, according to a person involved in the labor negotiations who insisted on anonymity.
Cadillac is also paying for minor renovations to the two showrooms. The larger showroom is at 11th Avenue and West 56th Street. A smaller showroom, expected to open in January, will be at 1133 York Avenue at 61st Street, Mr. Goldfein said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Army of Veterans Will Need Jobs

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WITH the end of the cold war, hundreds of thousands of men and women attached to the United States armed forces will be looking for jobs in the private economy.
Before President Bush took the initiative for sharp reductions in tactical nuclear forces, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney had laid out a plan for reducing the armed forces by more than half a million from its present level of about two million. Of that total, the Army would cut military personnel by 245,000, the Navy by 77,000, the Marine Corps by 28,000 and the Air Force by 170,000. 
 In addition, the plan called for reducing the reserves by 245,000 and eliminating the jobs of 193,000 civilians employed directly or indirectly by the Defense Department. In all, the Cheney plan proposed to cut total jobs over the next five years by nearly one million from the present level of about four million.
It now seems likely, however, that the military cuts will be even deeper. During a conference this week of business leaders and military officers at Fort Myer, Va., sponsored by the Army and the Committee for Economic Development, Secretary Cheney called the failed coup against the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a "watershed event" -- and one that cleared the way for a new United States strategy.
But he warned against letting "our euphoria blind us to the tasks that lie ahead." The central authority of the Soviet union, or what remains of it, has not yet been clearly defined. New threats could arise within or between individual republics. "Independence," Mr. Cheney said, "is not the same as democracy." And new "regional threats" could arise, as in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, he said a new strategy could assume that in the future there would be "more warning time" to respond to threats. That would mean fewer weapons on ready alert and fewer troops in Germany. The task now, he said, is "to reduce forces without reducing security."
That will involve decisions on what weapons to keep and what to take away. Superior technology is required to make future crises manageable. That is the military's first principle for a new strategy, reinforced by the Persian Gulf war, where, Mr. Cheney said, "technology produced tremendous results."
The second principle, he said, is the importance of rigorous training. He reported talking with soldiers who told him that their experiences at the Army's National Training Center in California "were tougher than anything we encountered in Iraq."
The third principle is maintaining the quality of the people -- "a professional force of men and women." The Army at latest report was 88.8 percent male and 11.2 percent female. Its racial compositon was 62.6 percent white (not including Hispanic), 28.6 percent black and 8.8 percent other minorities. Secretary Cheney asserted that with an all-volunteer force and high standards for recruitment, the quality of the military "is higher than it has ever been."
A former Secretary of Defense, who requested anonymity, said he thought the result of the strategic changes prompted by the success in the Persian Gulf and by the collapse of the Soviet Union would be deeper cuts in military personnel -- possibly by as much as 40 percent rather than the 25 percent envisioned in the earlier plan.
Facing the job of "massive deployment" from military to civilian jobs, Secretary of the Army Michael P. W. Stone said the Army was undertaking a broad-based program to insure that the people it will be releasing find jobs in the private sector.
Prof. Paul Andrisoni of Temple University's School of Business and Management told the Fort Myer conference about evidence he has found of discrimination against blacks and other minorities when they are discharged from the military. The Army prides itself on the job it has done in the integration, training and promotion of blacks, other minorities and women. Indeed, some of the businessmen at the conference said business could learn from the Army about equal treatment of people from different backgrounds.
But in so sluggish an economy, will the jobs be there? When asked what he thought about the capacity of the private sector to absorb so many into new jobs, Secretary Cheney restated his view that "we have a plan, we will follow it and we think this presents a great opportunity for the private sector." However, the task of absorbing veterans and the already unemployed into civilan jobs is not only managerial and educational but macroeconomic.
The cardinal issue facing the Bush Administration is whether it yet has an overall budget and fiscal plan, as well as an educational policy, that will strengthen the nation's economic growth, with lasting benefits to the nation's social structure, financial stability and global competitiveness.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Are Up Again

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
New applications for unemployment insurance benefits rose again in late September, the Labor Department said today, as the economy's recovery from recession remained too weak to encourage hopes of employment.
Claims for jobless pay rose to a seasonally adjusted 435,000 in the week ended Sept. 28, an increase of 5,000 from the previous week. 
 Economists had actually expected a drop in claims to 427,000. The increase underlined the concern that has become apparent even at the White House over the thinness of the recovery.
The department said the seasonally adjusted number of claims over the four-week period was 427,000, compared with 423,000 in the previous four-week period.
The number of people receiving benefits under state programs rose to 3,343,000 in the week ended Sept. 21, the latest period for which the figure was available. That was a rise of 17,000 in a week.

HEADLINE: Embargo Starts to Worry Haitian Business People

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 10

 BODY:
On Rue Pavee, the sweltering commercial street whose traffic has long been a barometer of Haiti's economic life, the chaotic return today of newspaper hawkers, whiskey vendors and Crazy Glue salesmen nearly two weeks after a violent coup belies the deep worries of business people working in air-conditioned offices.
After their euphoria at seeing Haiti's first elected president, the leftist priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide, forced out of office by soldiers, many in this poor country's small commercial community are awakening to the realization that the outside world is likely to exact a high price for bucking the hemispheric trend toward democracy. 
 Defying efforts by other nations in the hemisphere to win the reinstatement of Father Aristide to office, the Haitian legislature on Tuesday named a provisional president, Joseph Nerette, to replace him. Almost immediately, the Organization of American States announced stringent economic sanctions that many merchants now fear will quickly ruin them.
[Ambassador Alvin Adams said the United States may freeze the foreign assets of Haitian business people involved in blocking the return of deposed President, the Associated Press reported.]
Many in the business elite said they felt caught between a brutal and undisciplined army that refuses to consider allowing Father Aristide's return and a violence-prone population that could make the country ungovernable if he remains in exile.
Moreover, with much of the country's economy based on exports of simple assembled goods, many business people say that a strict embargo of Haiti would almost immediately spell doom for them and even greater hardship for their employees.
"Right now I feel like I would be very happy in Beirut," said one Rue Pavee entrepreneur who was busily canvassing the city for dollars so that he could make a new start in Miami if the worst should arrive.
"For most of us up until now this has been a political thing, but suddenly it is economic," the businessman said. "There is no clean way out of this situation."
"I know I don't want him to come back," he said, referring to Father Aristide, "but what we have now scares me too."
In Haiti's industrial zone there was similar anguish and confusion.
"Two days of an embargo and 40,000 jobs will go out the window just like that," said one Haitian industrialist. "In the meantime, we have a lot of very determined army people out there who are not looking at the economics. They are going to ride this thing regardless of the consequences."
With only enough oil and cash on hand to keep the country running for about six weeks, the businessman said he had little doubt that "the most stubborn forces" would be brought to their knees, but wondered "if the rest of the world is willing to pick up what is left of Haiti afterwards."
When business people contemplate the return of Father Aristide, many say they fear that after international attention dies down, the populist leader who has described Haiti as a mother who gives "sweet milk to the rich and sour milk to the poor" will unleash the masses on a spree of vengeance.
The affluent often cite statements like one in which the President urged the teaching of the words Pere Lebrun, the local term for lynchings with burning tires, in the national literacy program as proof that his return would endanger them.
With words like these still ringing in their ears, many of the relatively affluent here say that they are looking for ways out of the country.
Others, however, say that rather than fearing Father Aristide, who they found provocative, but not lethal, they worry more about an nervous army that is thought to be responsible for 300 or more killings since the coup began.
After five years of coups, plots and purges of senior officers, said one Haitian military analyst, the command structure has broken down to the point where "if you are sitting up in the palace, the only thing you command basically is your orderly and maybe your driver."

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 10

 BODY:
A second Mexican state governor has resigned after allegations of election fraud, underlining the growing power of opposition protests as President Carlos Salinas de Gortari seeks to improve the image of his country's political system.
 Fausto Zapata, governor of the central state of San Luis Potosi, announced Wednesday night that he was resigning only two weeks after being sworn in "to pave the way to a political solution to the problems our state is facing." 
 Mr. Zapata, a member of Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has faced opposition protests since official figures showed that he won the Aug. 18 election.
 Groups of protesters prevented him from entering his offices, and his opponent, Salvador Nava, has been leading a protest march to the Mexican capital.
 
 
Interim Governor Named
 The San Luis Potosi Congress appointed Gonzalo Martinez Corbala of the Institutional Revolutionary Party as interim governor until new elections are held in 14 to 18 months.
 Opposition forces have also accused the governing party of fraud in elections in the neighboring state of Guanajuato, prompting the PRI candidate, Ramon Aguirre, to step down in August only hours after being declared the winner of the gubernatorial elections.
 The mid-term election was the first held under a reformed electoral code ordered by Mr. Salinas to counter persistent allegations of vote-rigging by the governing party. The Institutional Revolutionary Party has ruled Mexico for more than 60 years.
 The party's landslide victory across Mexico was viewed as a vote of confidence in Mr. Salinas's attempts to remold his party and seek closer economic relations with the United States.
 
 
Embarrassment to Salinas
 But Mr. Salinas evidently saw the protests in Guanajuato and San Luis Potosi as an embarrassment that could hinder his major foreign policy objective of signing a free trade agreement with the United States and Canada.
 Mr. Salinas's hand was evident in both resignations. Mexican newspapers reported that Mr. Zapata was called to the President's office here on Wednesday to be told of his fate.
 As was the case in Guanajuato state, Mr. Zapata's resignation angered backers of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in San Luis Potosi.

HEADLINE: Majority in Poll Fault Focus by Bush On Global Policy but Back New Order

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
A sizable majority of Americans say President Bush has been spending too much time on foreign policy and should pay more attention to domestic matters, especially the economy, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
A major reason for those beliefs may well be a widespread conviction that many key foreign-policy problems have been solved. Among respondents in the poll, which was conducted by telephone from Saturday to Monday, 70 percent said nuclear war is unlikely in the next decade, 50 percent said the cold war has ended and 44 percent said no country posed a serious military threat to the the United States. 
 But the 1,280 people questioned in the poll, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, sharply rejected a turn to isolationism in this country like the one that followed World War I.
The poll was taken not long after President Bush's ground-breaking speech announcing the withdrawal of all American land-based and sea-based tactical nuclear weapons from Europe and Asia, and just as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union was promising to make similar arms reductions.
 
Pattern of Political Strength
 Americans responded very favorably to Mr. Bush's initiative, with 59 percent praising the President's withdrawal of the short-range weapons and two-thirds of the 35 percent who did not approve saying they would approve if the Soviets in fact followed suit.
Mr. Bush's success on the arms-reduction front was part of a continuing pattern of electoral strength as the 1992 campaign approaches. Over all, a strong 64 percent of those interviewed said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job, even though that is down six percentage points from September, and essentially the same proportion (63 percent) said they approved of his performance on foreign policy. His rating on his handling of the economy was weak, at 30 percent, but the other figures suggest that for the moment at least the public judges him primarily in foreign-policy terms.
Still, the pervasive dissatisfaction with the President's performance as manager of the economy could prove damaging, as Democratic Presidential hopefuls have already begun suggesting. Mr. Bush's current economic rating, down from August, when it stood at 38 percent, ties his lowest point (one year ago) since he took office, and it comes as economic forecasters within the Government and in private industry are suggesting anew that the current recovery may prove to be weak or transitory.
The new poll indicates the depth of public concern about the economy in several ways. Asked to name the most important problems facing the country, 20 percent named unemployment and 17 percent mentioned the economy in general -- far more than chose any other issue and more than have mentioned economic problems in previous New York Times/CBS News polls during the Bush Administration.
 
Peace Dividend
 About three of five respondents, 59 percent, said President Bush had been neglecting the home front and about four of five, 78 percent, said he should concentrate more on the economy. Asked what should be done with any peace dividend, three of five said it should be spent on education, the environment, health care or other domestic needs rather than on reducing the deficit or cutting taxes.
Obviously, the voters give the President credit for successfully negotiating the turmoil in Europe and the Middle East during the last three years.
Respondents to the poll agreed, for example, with most of President Bush's contentions in his dealings with Israel, which form a key element in his attempt to convene a Middle East peace conference.
A majority back the Administration in its opposition to new Israeli settlements in the West Bank and favor withholding loan gurantees until Jerusalem yields ground on the issue. And a plurality says Israel has too much influence in Washington -- just like the President, who complained about Israeli lobbyists on Capitol Hill.
Some of the afterglow of the Persian Gulf war continues, with 74 percent still arguing, as in other recent polls, that getting involved was not a mistake, whatever the critics think, and 61 percent saying the cost was "worth it."
Nor is the public in any mood to challenge Mr. Bush on China. It is split down the middle, the poll indicates, with 40 percent saying criticism should be avoided to maintain relations and 44 percent insisting that it is important to call attention to the way that China suppresses human rights. With such a wide division on an issue of secondary importance to most voters, the President has a relatively free hand.
One area of potential peril for the President and for American policy is Japan. In the next century, Japan will be the No. 1 economic power in the world, according to 58 percent of those who talked with survey interviewers; only 25 percent thought the United States would be. American voters are not likely, if the past is a guide, to accept such a development without protest.
Japan's economic might and Americans' fears about their own economy is reflected in two other findings of the new Times/CBS News Poll. After the gulf war, there was a surge of optimism in the polls, but now the prewar tenor of opinion has reasserted itself; 52 percent of respondents said life for the next generation of Americans will be worse than for the present one, and a strong minority, 44 percent, saw the United States as a power in decline.
 
End of the Cold War
 The survey left no doubt that Americans see a vastly changed world, if not yet a new world order of the kind that Mr. Bush has so often discussed, and they strongly favor a strong continued United States role in that world.
Fully two-thirds of the respondents rejected the following statement: "Since the United States is the most powerful nation in the world, we should go our own way in international matters, not worrying too much about whether other countries agree with us or not." Likewise, two-thirds rejected the idea that the United States should behave less assertively on the world stage.
For the first time in a Times/CBS News Poll, a majority says the cold war is over, a surprising finding, perhaps, given the answer to another question. Asked whether the changes in relations between East and West were permanent, a majority, 52 percent, said no, that they would probably revert to their old pattern before long.
In addition, the bulk of the respondents said it was still important for the United States to keep strong military defenses, to maintain the North Atlantic Treaty Organization partnership with Europe and to keep American troop strength in Western Europe at about the same levels.
When asked whether any country in the world poses a serious threat to the United States, 44 percent said no, 43 percent said yes. Among that fearful minority, predictably, the potential foes were seen as Russia and Iraq.
But some Americans, at least, see an opportunity for the United States to let its guard down a little.
For example, 46 percent said spending on intelligence agencies like the C.I.A. should be decreased, with 46 percent saying financing should stay the same and only 5 percent calling for an increase. About a third (36 percent) said that overall Federal spending on the military should come down.
And if there is a residual distrust of the nation that has formed the focus of American apprehensions for four decades, feelings in this country toward the Soviet Union have warmed substantially as it has struggled to redefine its relations with the world, and, indeed, to redefine its own character.
Reflecting a steady improvement over the last five or six years, as arms-control agreements have gone into effect, 50 percent of the electorate says that the Soviets can be trusted to keep their word on nuclear weapons.
 
How the Poll Was Taken
The New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Saturday to Monday with 1,280 adults across the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for the group who say they follow news about world affairs and foreign policy issues "very closely" it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion might introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Medicaid Plan: No Free Lunch

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The beauty of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's ambitious plan to restructure the state's insatiable Medicaid system, at least according to the Governor and his aides, is that every county in the state would come out a winner.
"This is a plan that's very good for local governments," Mr. Cuomo said today. "You've got to come out at least even and probably make money." 
 But what is already dampening the plan's political prospects is the fundamental truth that there still is no free lunch in state government. If the state, which cannot print $100 bills, ends up assuming a Medicaid burden estimated at $1.6 billion a year, the money has to come from somewhere.
In the two weeks since Mr. Cuomo unveiled his plan, which calls for the state to take a share of local taxing authority in exchange for picking up local Medicaid costs, the legislative debate has increasingly focused on who the losers might be.
 
Savings and Cost
 "It will save localities $1.6 billion, but who's going to pay for that?" asked one state official, who requested anonymity. "Is it the taxpayers, is it the hospitals, is it the recipients? There is a savings for all counties, but for every savings there is a cost."
Predictably, representatives of upstate and suburban counties complain that the plan asks the rest of the state to subsidize a New York City bailout.
In New York City, officials at City Hall suspect that the Governor, by calling for the city to sacrifice all of its personal income tax revenues by the turn of the century, is asking them to give up more than they will get back.
Republican state senators question the economic assumptions that form the foundation of the Governor's plan, particularly his assertion that Medicaid costs will grow at 12 percent or less in coming years. Citing statistics released by the State Comptroller's office but questioned by the Governor's staff, they predict that Medicaid spending is far above that level and far above budget in the current fiscal year.
That has heightened fears that by taking over local Medicaid costs the state would assume an uncontrollable burden. That burden, the Republicans maintain, eventually may drive the state to raise taxes or to cut cherished programs, like aid to schools.
And virtually everyone in the Legislature is cynical about the potential for significantly cutting the Medicaid program's cost, which Mr. Cuomo has made a prerequisite for a takeover.
There are few mechanisms left for reducing Medicaid costs these days without either cutting the services provided by the program and the eligibility levels of its recipients, or reducing reimbursement rates for the state's financially strapped hospitals.
The state has already imposed $600 million in cost-containment measures in the last year, and the Governor's call for an additional $375 million in the next two years -- $225 million in savings for the state and $150 million in savings for localities -- has generated nervousness among both health-care providers and Medicaid recipients.
Mr. Cuomo has not yet said where the savings should come from, hoping instead that a private consensus emerges from administration experts and the Legislature. But it is clear that the traditional politics that have blocked past cost-containment efforts may be difficult to overcome.
 
A Power Base
 The Democrats who control the Assembly can be expected to resist cuts in the level of Medicaid services and eligibility that would harm the poor. The Assembly Democrats' power base is New York City, where two-thirds of the state's Medicaid recipients live.
The Republicans who control the State Senate have already criticized Mr. Cuomo for not proposing enough Medicaid cost containment. But they can be expected to resist cuts in reimbursement rates to hospitals and nursing homes, which they traditionally have protected.
Many Medicaid analysts believe that hospitals, nursing homes and long-term care centers are the only places where significant savings can be found. They account for about 65 percent of all Medicaid payments. Some legislators are also concerned that many cost-containment measures will simply shift the burden of indigent health care to other government agencies.
If the state eliminates Medicaid coverage for services like podiatry and dentistry, untended ailments may worsen until treatment is demanded in public hospital emergency rooms.
Mr. Cuomo argues that in the next legislative session, when Medicaid is certain to be the hottest of topics, the Legislature will have little choice but to consider cost-containment measures it has rejected before.
With the state slow in emerging from the recession, with little help coming from the Federal Government and with legislators unlikely to raise taxes in an election year, "they have no options," Mr. Cuomo said.
"If you're the Legislature and you know you're not going to have the money and that you will have the needs, what are you going to do?" he asked.

HEADLINE: Governor Offers Plan to Preserve Wilderness Site

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAKE PLACID, N.Y., Oct. 10

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today formally unveiled his decidedly moderated plan for preserving the Adirondack Park Wilderness. The proposal has drawn less enthusiasm from environmentalists but also less rancor from local officials than the far more aggressive preservation blueprint advanced last year by the Governor's Commission on the Adirondacks.
Mr. Cuomo's plan focuses on state-financed tax breaks and other incentives to keep back-country forest tracts out of development. It amounts to the most significant gubernatorial package of legislation affecting the Adirondacks since the early 1970's.
 
A Better Chance of Passage
 The Governor, speaking to a meeting here of the Adirondack North Country Association, a local citizens group, staunchly defended his recommendation as having a much better chance of passing the Republican-controlled State Senate than his commission's package. 
 His plan was laced with programs to revive the struggling economies of many of the park's hamlets, including tax credits to attract businesses and the creation of an Adirondack North Country Authority to help improve housing and water treatment systems.
The Governor's proposals came nearly three years after a series of land sales to developers were attacked by environmentalists as threatening the wilderness character of the 6-million-acre park.
Mr. Cuomo estimated today that the cost of his plan, primarily the tax incentives, would be about $5 million a year. The incentives, he said, would have to come from an environmental trust fund that has yet to be approved by the State Legislature. Estimates of the cost of the commission's proposals ranged upward of several hundred million dollars.
The Governor's plan is generally given a better chance in the Legislature than the commission's package. "This is a horse that can cross the finish line," said Neil Woodworth, conservation director of the Adirondack Mountain Club.
The tax incentives proposed by the Governor would be largely intended for forest products companies and other large landholders that might consider selling their land to developers. Such landowners would get breaks on their tax bills ranging from 35 percent for making a 10-year commitment to preserve the land as open space to 80 percent for giving the state rights to buy the property in the future or allowing public recreation on it. The commission called for zoning that would have forbidden almost any new construction of homes or condominiums in the back country.
 
Zoning Laws Proposed
 The Governor did embrace some new zoning laws for many now-undeveloped lakefronts in the park. But as contrasted with his commission's proposals, the laws would reduce, but not eliminate, multi-home developments in these lakefronts by designating shorelines as "critical environmental areas" and demanding expanded lot sizes.
In general, individuals who currently hold land with plans for building a single dwelling on it would be unaffected by the new laws, although there would be new requirements for upgraded septic systems any time a new house is built or an old house changes hands.
"I think there's an interesting philosophy here, not just a land grab," said Jim Frenette, a member of the Franklin County Legislature.
Environmental groups generally had positive if somewhat lukewarm reactions to the Governor's package. The National Audubon Society, whose president, Peter A. A. Berle, served as chairman of the Governor's Adirondack Commission, praised many aspects of Mr. Cuomo's proposals but said they "fall short in several significant ways" of an overall preservation plan.

A Dream of One Central Asia Under Islam's Banner

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TASHKENT, U.S.S.R.

 BODY:
The young mullah bowed one more time on his knees, finished praying, sat on the edge of the mosque's expansive prayer mats and began talking in a hushed voice, his eyes often scanning the faces of those who passed through the hand-carved gates to the place of worship.
"We want an Islamic state," he said, his rarely tried English carrying him slowly through his ideas. "Every person in their heart wants this. They want Islam in their homes. We want to live in a Muslim way." 
 The mullah, who insisted on anonymity, came to worship in the mosque, not to preach there. He said he felt safe preaching only in the homes of believers, where the risk of secret police surveillance is reduced.
Here in Soviet Central Asia, the mullah's sentiments are increasingly heard, in the mosques, in homes, on the streets and, for a time, on the airwaves of the region's republics.
 
Dream of Grand Turkestan
 Left in the foam of glasnost's and perestroika's wave here are a rush of passions, a longing for a return to the region's religious roots, a deep-seated hatred of the Communist Party and, for the first time, talk of returning to a vast Central Asian state, a revival of the old idea of a grand Turkestan.
These ideas, these dreams even, are not necessarily compatible, are not shared with equal fervor in each Central Asian republic. But the collapse of the monolithic Soviet Union and the rush toward independence by individual republics, real or not, has created fertile ground for aspirations that once seemed the stuff of fairy tales or history.
"Maybe this is the history of a new country," said Goga A. Khidoyatov, a professor of modern history at Tashkent University. "The country we call the Soviet Union is gone. I dream to live in a time that we will form a United States of Asia."
He went on to say that the new mufti of Bishkek -- the capital of Soviet Kirghizia, formerly called Frunze after a Soviet revolutionary, regained its historical name in February -- had spoken of this. "I think we will create this new Turkestan," he said. "It is the wish of all the people."
 
Balkanization by Stalin
 Uniting Central Asia's republics -- Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tadzhikistan and Turkmenia -- may be easier said than done. Already, the leaders of the republics are plotting their own courses toward a post-Soviet future, some intent on a rapid restructuring of their economies and political order, others, like President Islam A. Karimov of Uzbekistan, determined to preserve the Stalinist political system.
Professor Khidoyatov said the current fragmentation of the republics stems from Stalin's deliberate Balkanization of the area. "The Turkestan republic was very strong, and very dangerous for Stalin," he said. "That is why he split it into many parts. In language, for example, they liquidated our alphabet. Now we are restoring it, because we want to restore this republic."
By law, the local languages are the official languages of the republic. But here in Uzbekistan, where the two-thirds of the population who are Uzbek speak the local language, their newspapers still use the Cyrillic alphabet imposed on them instead of the original Arabic script. And Russian remains the lingua franca of government and economic life.
At the core of pan-Turkestan sentiment remains the enduring cultural and slowly reviving religious tug of Islam. But the young mullah in the mosque said it was important that the region's religious leaders not deceive themselves into believing that the token allegiance to Islam expressed by the majority of the people would bring down Communism and replace it with a religious state.
"Here there is a Stalinist regime stronger than in Russia," he said, tugging on his beard. "So you see, there are Muslims in word and Muslims in deed. Our people's minds were oppressed by the Stalinist system."
"But there is a difference between a Russian way of life and an Asian way of life. We cannot live without religion. Because every ceremony, every birth of a child, every circumcision, every wedding, all these ceremonies are made by mullahs."
 
'Every Day a New Mosque'
 "Every day a new mosque is born," said Abdulla Ismail, the head of the international department of the Central Muslim Board. "We have many Muslim schools. As to whether we will become like Saudi Arabia, or Iran, it will depend on the people's desires."
In the last year, a political movement has begun in the region grouped under the banner of the Party of Islamic Renaissance. It is rapidly attracting adherents, though it is illegal since the constitutions of every Central Asian republic bans religious-based political parties.
The young mullah at the mosque here said: "There are two kinds of mullahs. There are the official, the approved mullahs. And there are the underground mullahs like myself. We don't preach in the mosques. We preach in people's homes. Now, there are many more fundamentalists than official mullahs."
How long, he was asked, did he think it would be before his dream of an Islamic state would be realized? He looked down at his hands. "I am 30 now," he said. "It will take 30 or 50 years. When I am an old man."

HEADLINE: 4 Slain in 2 New Jersey Attacks And Former Postal Clerk Is Held

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIDGEWOOD, N.J., Oct. 10

 BODY:
A former postal clerk, apparently seeking revenge for his dismissal, killed his former supervisor and her boyfriend and then invaded the post office here early today with a small arsenal and killed two mail handlers, the authorities said.
Before setting out from his Paterson apartment dressed in black military fatigues, black combat boots and a black silk Ninja-style hood, the man left a handwritten two-page letter there complaining about postal authorities and vowing revenge, officials said. 
 "It generally expresses his dissatisfaction with the Postal Service," the Passaic County Prosecutor, Ronald Fava, said of the note found in the home of 35-year-old Joseph M. Harris. "He felt he was treated unfairly. It basically indicated that these people are going to pay. He was doing this as an act of revenge."
 The Ridgewood Police Chief, Frank C. Milliken, said, "The firing just brewed and churned and churned for 18 months."
 
Note Refers to Slaughter
 Without offering specifics, Mr. Fava said the note referred to the massacre at an Oklahoma post office in August 1986. In that case, an employee who was facing dismissal pulled guns from his mailbag, killing 14 people and injuring 6 others before killing himself.
Mr. Harris emerged from a basement locker at the post office building and surrendered to members of the Bergen County SWAT team shortly before 7 A.M. He was wearing a gas mask and bulletproof vest and armed with a 9-millimeter Uzi handgun, a .22-caliber machine gun with silencer, a samurai sword, three hand grenades and some homemade bombs.
"I think Mr. Harris came prepared to die," said Joel Trella, chief of the Bergen County Police Department. "He was armed quite heavily -- more heavily than I"ve ever seen in my career."
But he surrendered quietly after about a half hour of negotiations.
Among his victims was Carol Ott, a 30-year-old supervisor of mail clerks who work the overnight shift, sorting mail for carriers. She was stabbed to death in the home she shared with her boyfriend in Wayne, about 10 miles west of here.
Mr. Fava said the wounds were large and gaping, including a deep slash on her left shoulder consistent with a slash by a sword. Ms. Ott was clad only in a T-shirt when she was killed. Mr. Fava said there was no sign she had been sexually assaulted.
Besides Ms. Ott, the victims were her boyfriend, identified as Cornelius Kasten Jr., who was shot behind the right ear as he sat watching television in a basement recreation room, Mr. Fava said. The two mail handlers were Joseph M. VanderPaauw, 59, of Prospect Park, N.J., and Donald McNaught, 63, of Pompton Lakes, N.J.
Ms. Ott was Mr. Harris's immediate boss in his final months of his employment with the post office here and was instrumental in getting him discharged 18 months ago, officials said.
Two months before Mr. Harris's dismissal, Ms. Ott filed a report with the Ridgewood police department, accusing Mr. Harris of harassing her on the job. Chief Frank C. Milliken said today that Ms. Ott never specified the type of harassment although he said it was not of a sexual nature. She declined an invitation by the police department to file a formal criminal complaint against Mr. Harris.
Chief Milliken said Ms. Ott told officials she wanted to consult a lawyer before filing a formal charge. "She said, 'I don't want to do that,' and she never came back," he said.
Former co-workers today described Mr. Harris as a quiet, tense and often sullen, ill-tempered man who said little while working and did not respond well to authority and directions. None, however, could recall any particular incident that prompted Ms. Ott to go to the Ridgewood police.
But some remembered friction between the two.
"They were like oil and water -- they just didn't mix," said one ex-clerk who sorted mail on the overnight shift and asked to remain anonymous. "He just had something against her."
Several postal workers remembered that Mr. Harris had told Ms. Ott sometime in early 1990 that he was going to "get" her. But apparently the two had no further contact until Ms. Ott was slain last night.
"I asked her a couple of months ago if she was having any problems with him and she smiled and said no," said Philip Torchio, a letter carrier.
Shortly after Ms. Ott went to the Ridgewood police in February 1990, she started the procedure that led to Mr. Harris's dismissal, according to postal authorities. She asked that he submit to a "fitness for duty exam," a Postal Service procedure under which an employee is sent to a doctor to determine if he is able to work. The exam can involve both physical and psychological evaluations.
 
'No Further Contact'
 Mr. Harris refused to take the test and was dismissed outright, said Thomas F. Johnson, chief inspector for the Postal Service in New Jersey.
"When he declined to go for the 'fitness for duty,' he was removed and there was no further contact with him," Mr. Johnson said at a news conference here.
Mr. Johnson said he was unaware of the particulars of the problems between Mr. Harris and Ms. Ott.
The Ridgewood Postmaster, Earl Alston, also signed the forms seeking the exam, officials said. He was unavailable for comment today. Postal workers who attended a private mid-morning briefing with the police said they were told that Mr. Alston was also a target of Mr. Harris today.
 
'Very, Very Quiet'
 It was not immediately clear late today whether Mr. Harris had ever filed any grievances over his dismissal with the union representing postal clerks, the American Postal Workers Union, A.F.L.-C.I.O.
The police said today that they knew little of Mr. Harris's background. He has apparently been unemployed since his dismissal and living alone in a small second-floor apartment in a six-bedroom house on Derrom Avenue on the east side of Paterson.
The owner of the home, Carmen Johnson, who said she was Mr. Harris's half-sister, said he had lived in her house for about 14 years and was "very, very quiet."
He was born in Trenton in March 1956, and served in the Navy from 1974 to 1977, specializing in repair of mechanical and electrical equipment, officials said. Mr. Harris, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds, began working for the Postal Service in 1981 and spent most of his nine-year career as a clerk sorting mail on the overnight shift here, officials said.
 
Little Contact With Family
 In 1984, he was reprimanded by postal officials for harassing co-workers, law-enforcement officials said. They said they had no details of this incident. Mr. Johnson, the chief postal inspector, said he did not have the information about it.
Kim Ward, Mr. Harris's sister, said in an interview last night outside his house in Paterson , that he was the second oldest of 10 children.
After he was discharged from the Navy, Mrs. Ward said Mr. Harris had only sporadic contact with his family, including his mother, who also lives in Paterson. Mrs. Ward said that she has not spoken to him in several years.
Otto Harris, a 36-year-old cousin in Paterson, said: "He was always fascinated with martial arts. He was always fascinated with explosives. He always liked guns, but he never hurt anyone before."
He recalled seeing Mr. Harris late Wednesday night near his home, and said, "He seemed calm."
Before leaving his apartment, however, Mr. Harris rigged a homemade bomb of explosives and an ether-based can of auto-starting fluid to his front door, officials said.
He apparently first drove to Ms. Ott's beige split-level house.
At 2:15 A.M., Marcello Collado, a truck driver from Paterson, pulled up to the rear loading dock of the post office with a truck load of mail. Unlike on most nights, the bay doors were closed and the building was dark. He went to the basement of the building and encoutered a gunman wearing agas mask. A shot was fired, and Mr. Collado fled to the police station about half a mile away.
Sgt. Robert Kay and Officer Peter Tuchol were sent to the post office building about 2:20 A.M. They, too, came upon the masked gunman in the basement. He hurled an explosive device at them and they retreated and called for assistance.
Within minutes, the building was surrounded and officers began stopping mail handlers and sorting clerks as they arrived for work.
From about 3:15 until shortly after 6 A.M., police officials attempted to call Mr. Harris by telephone inside the building, officials said. But the calls were unanswered. The negotiators with the Bergen County SWAT team entered the building through a side door at 6:26 and emerged with Mr. Harris at about 6:50.
Until mid-afternoon, the police feared that both the post office and Ms. Ott's home in Wayne were booby-trapped. Both were cordoned off. But no explosives were found at either place.
At about 7 A.M., the police found the device Mr. Harris had rigged to his apartment door. They had gone to the home earlier, at about 3 A.M., but Mrs. Johnson, the owner, refused to give them the key to Mr. Harris's apartment without a search warrant.
"If I did what the police asked me to do and I gave them the key, we would all be dead now," Mrs. Johnson said this afternoon.

HEADLINE: White House Defends Delay on Health-Care Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Top officials of the Bush Administration defended themselves today against criticism that the White House was ignoring the nation's health care problems by failing to propose a comprehensive overhaul of the system.
"We will have our comprehensive plan in due course," the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, told members of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 He said that he hoped the Administration would propose a plan before the 1992 election, but that in any event, "I suspect we'll all be at a signing ceremony in the second Bush Administration term."
Mr. Darman said the incremental changes the Administration has proposed would not be enough to adequately put the brakes on soaring health care costs. But he said these measures, including malpractice changes, were a start.
 
Several Plans Dismissed
 Administration officials have already dismissed several plans to deal with the health-care crisis, including national health insurance that would cover everyone under a Federal system, and have also dismissed "pay or play" plans that would make employers either offer health insurance to workers or pay into state funds to insure workers. Officials are leaning toward programs that involve changes in the tax system, either incentives for business or changes in personal income tax to help make health insurance affordable.
Health care costs have been rising at more than twice the rate of general inflation, a pace Mr. Darman calls "unsustainable," and will exceed $650 billion this year. Health-care spending currently accounts for about 12 percent of the gross national product, yet an estimated 34 million Americans have no health insurance and lack access to routine health care.
The Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, said he, too, would like to propose a comprehensive plan before the election, "but that is going to be the President's decision."
Dr. Sullivan and Mr. Darman pointed out that about 30 different health-care reform plans were circulating on Capitol Hill, and that Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a speech on Wednesday that "attempting to legislate now would be a terrible mistake."
But committee members said Mr. Rostenkowski had at least entered the debate actively by proposing his own plan, which would require employers to provide health-insurance coverage to employees or pay a tax to support a public benefit plan for those who do not have workplace coverage.
Dr. Sullivan has criticized this "play or pay" proposal and others like it. He said the plan would not contain health-care inflation, would smother competition and would lead to rationing and waiting lists for health-care services.

HEADLINE: Silver-Lining Deal Has Publisher Staying

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
After considering a move out of New York City, a major publishing concern, the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Division, has decided to relocate from Third Avenue to Union Square, long ago the hub of the nation's publishing industry.
The publisher, which has some 400 employees, is close to signing a lease for about one-third of the commercial base of Zeckendorf Towers, at 10 Union Square East, between 14th and 15th Streets. The agreement may be the salvation of the office portion of the condominium building, whose sole tenant, Integrated Resources, filed for bankruptcy last year. 
 In deciding to stay in New York, the publisher dramatized the silver lining for tenants -- and the city -- when developers are forced to strike generous deals.
Should the division take the full 120,000 square feet in which it is interested, the value of the lease over its 10-year life would be $34 million, said Tom A. Javits, vice president of the Zeckendorf Company.
 
'Made Them Feel Really Welcomed'
 City officials believed Macmillan/McGraw-Hill was seriously considering a move to Connecticut or New Jersey. They arranged a meeting last month with local executives, community leaders, police and transit officials and others to discuss the publisher's worries, including security.
"We made them feel really welcomed in their new neighborhood without committing city dollars," said Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the deputy mayor for finance and economic development. Mayor David N. Dinkins said it proved that "there are more than financial incentives to our economic development approach."
The president and chief executive of the division, James P. Levy, confirmed that the publisher had considered other sites. Now, he said, "We look forward to being part of the redevelopment of this important artery in the lifeline of New York City."
The division is part of the Macmillan/ McGraw-Hill School Publishing Company, a joint venture. It operates out of the Maxwell Macmillan Building, 866 Third Avenue at 52d Street. Mr. Levy said it was the largest publisher of educational material for children through the eighth grade.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said, "It is clearly a great day for New York as the center for the printed word."
And Jonathan F. Fanton, the president of the New School for Social Research and co-chairman of the 14th Street-Union Square Local Development Corporation, said, "The Macmillan decision is a real vote of confidence in the vitality of Union Square."
It would also seem to be a vote of confidence in the commercial portion of the Zeckendorf development, above which four residential towers rise.
"I think, with the emergence of such a strong user as Macmillan/McGraw, that it will really become a publishing building -- books, magazines, things of that type," said the developer, William Zeckendorf Jr. His partners in the project include Elie Hirschfeld and KG Land, a subsidiary of the Kumagai Gumi Company of Tokyo.
Financing came from the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the holder of $67 million in Industrial Development Agency bonds.

The Mayor's Trip: Who's Paying?

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins of New York City has scaled down his proposed trip to South Africa. Instead of traveling by chartered plane Mr. Dinkins will travel commercially, and many in the entourage will pay their own way. These moves make good sense. But disquieting questions still remain about who's footing the rest of the bill.
Mr. Dinkins isn't the first mayor to venture abroad, and it's hard to quarrel with his effort to forge cultural and economic ties between New York and any post-apartheid regime. But the administration still delays in disclosing the list of donors. 
 The money is being raised by the New York City Business Assistance Corporation, the same city-controlled nonprofit group that raised funds for the parade for veterans of the Persian Gulf war. Responding to criticism that it was inappropriate for the Mayor's chief political adviser, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, to solicit corporations and individuals doing business with the city, Mr. Lynch formed a citizens' committee to do the job.
The committee still doesn't have a head, suggesting that Mr. Lynch is still involved. He promises that the list of contributors will be made public when the fund-raising is completed. But further delay merely heightens concern about conflicts of interest.

Sandro's
 In his leaner days, Sandro Fioriti might have been a soccer goalie, thrashing his towering frame in front of the net while deflecting leather cannonballs. Today his goal is less perilous but equally challenging: endearing New Yorkers to the multifaceted cuisine of his native region around Rome. Sandro's cadre of regular patrons offers proof that to some extent he is succeeding.
Six-year-old Sandro's is not the kind of place you stumble upon. It is well concealed in the lobby of a high-rise apartment building on far East 59th Street, hard under the rumbling 59th Street Bridge. The big, casual dining room has a terra-cotta floor, palm trees and walls covered with framed posters of Italian food products. In such a neighborhood setting, captains in black tie seem incongruous.
Upon being seated, you are presented a basket of terrific rosemary bread and "dare you to eat just one" sage-and-rosemary breadsticks. You will find that the wine list is strongest among Italian reds and whites, with a smattering of American labels, all on the moderate to high side. As we were discussing the wine and other matters, a captain barged in -- a common and annoying occurrence -- and recited his daily specials. When we wanted him, though, he was nowhere to be found. Another captain took the wine order and, a mere 20 minutes later, returned with it. Service in general was maladroit. The amiable Mr. Fioriti, though, was a most cordial host, stopping by every table to ask how the food turned out.
We had no complaints about the ravioli filled with spinach and ricotta afloat in a beautifully balanced tomato-cream sauce, nor with the crisply fried artichokes, their dark golden leaves as brittle as puff pastry. The most compelling pasta dish was ravioli filled with sea urchin roe in a subtle tomato sauce studded with minced baby scallops. The oceanic sea urchin flavor burst through with every bite, and the light tomato sauce allowed it to shine.
Quality pancetta and pecorino cheese were the foundation of a dish recommended by our captain, but the sauce was not integrated and the pasta was unevenly sauced. Spaghetti with clams on the half shell, a touch of tomato and herbs had a lusty shellfish flavor. Penne tossed with mild Italian sausage and cream was too timorous and lacking pepper for my taste.
Among nonpasta starters, tender sauteed baby calamari with radicchio and tomato had everything going for it but flavor. Garlic or hot pepper would have helped. Ice cold carpaccio with olive oil and slices of Parmesan was hard to judge until it warmed on the plate. Then it was pleasing.
Main courses here could sustain a pair of soccer players for the day. The roast suckling pig, a special, has a wonderful burnished skin concealing a thin layer of fat that adds moisture to the succulent meat. Equally good, if not better, was roasted baby lamb with a blackened crust and aroma of rosemary. One of the house favorites seems to be straccetti, grilled slices of beef that had been coated in olive oil, garlic and lemon. The vibrantly flavored meat is exceptionally tender. Fennel sausages with bitter broccoli were a fine combination, too. Butterflied Cornish hen, though, which can be savory when grilled, is fried here, which leaves it a bit heavy and bland.
Among the seafood, salt cod cooked with potatoes, onions and tomatoes is firm and flavorful, reminiscent of traditional Portuguese recipes. Grilled swordfish, a special, was lustrous in a pool of white wine sauce scented with lemon and basil. It came with grilled endive. Only grouper braised with artichokes in a lemony wine sauce came out flat and one-dimensional.
Another one of Mr. Fioriti's regional dishes is the polenta pudding with raspberry sauce. Surprisingly, the pudding was ultra-smooth with no grain detected. We later learned that a fine grade of polenta, almost flourlike, is used. Chocolate mousse cake is relatively light and intense with good bittersweet chocolate. And chocolate-dusted tartuffo is a special treat, as is granita of expresso (although granita of lemon is watered down).
The first time we visited the restaurant, we were victims of Mr. Fioriti's puckish sense of humor. Toward the end of our main courses, he came by and insisted we try a platter of his favorite pasta. We groaned. As we finished our desserts, he came over holding a platter over his head. "Pasta, Pasta!" he announced as we all cringed. He then placed in front of us a platter of warm sugar cookies. Then came a selection of his homemade fruit grappas. Peach was our favorite.
Sandro Fioriti is the type of host who makes sure you never leave hungry. And if you order wisely, you'll leave happy, too.
 
Pamir
 Afghan food, which not long ago was as obscure as it was exotic, has moved into the dining mainstream in major cities. In New York City, for example, diners can choose from more than a half-dozen serious Afghan restaurants and many more living-room-size family cafes. Pamir, a congenial spot on Second Avenue in Manhattan, has always been one of my favorites.
Afghan food is a melange of Middle Eastern cuisine with some spicy Indian accents tossed in. Lamb, chicken, rice and vegetables are the primary ingredients. Exotic herbs and spices give the food its allure.
Pamir's dining room is a long, shadowy expanse with a bar at one end. Oriental rugs, assorted wall hangings and soft Eastern music contribute to its mysterious feeling. Candlelit tables are tightly arranged to accommodate the enthusiastic nightly crowds. Over the course of three visits, I found that service is not as sharp as it used to be. Orders are occasionally confused and servers are not always as diligent about getting drinks, bread, water and the like.
The menu rarely changes, so it takes only one visit to become familiar with the specialties. Starters include sambosa goushti, triangles of greaseless fried pastry stuffed with a mixture of ground beef and chickpeas redolent of cinnamon and cumin; bulanee gandana, thin, blistered turnovers filled with scallions and herbs that are eaten with a tart yogurt sauce; bulanee kachalou, another turnover, stuffed with mashed potatoes, onions and spices, and aushak, crisp flat scallion-filled raviolis under a lovely yogurt sauce with ground meat and mint. All of the turnovers go well with some fiery cumin and coriander sauce.
Beer is probably the most suitable beverage with this tangy food, although certain full-bodied red wines from the perfunctory list might stand up to the spices. Oddly enough, Pamir has a menu of tropical cocktails. The barman makes a mean margarita, although I wouldn't try it with a spicy yogurt sauce.
Two popular main-course dishes are badenjan chalaw, a spicy mixture of cubed lamb, eggplant, tomatoes and onions, and sabsi-chalaw, lamb in a mellow spinach sauce flavored with onions and garlic. A daily special was a winner, too: zardak chalaw, stewed lamb with carrots, onions, garlic and ginger.
One of my favorites has always been a colorful creation called norange palaw, a circular mound of saffron rice laced with almonds, pistachios and thin strips of orange zest. Beneath the rice is an aromatic lamb stew that, when mixed with the rice, can yield a complex and subtle melange of flavors and textures. A recent sampling, however, was woefully unbalanced. The rice was overloaded with sweet orange zest and cloying with rosewater. Quabilli palaw, a similar lamb dish made with brown rice, almonds, pistachios, raisins and carrot strips instead of orange, was better balanced, but some of the lamb was mushy from overmarination.
Among meat entrees, there is only one escape from lamb. Kabab-e-murgh features skewered marinated chicken cubes with vegetables. On two samplings, the chicken was dryish, ameliorated somewhat by the coriander dipping sauce.
Side dishes to consider are sabsi, a puree of spinach with onions and assorted spices (ours arrived at room temperature); buranee kadu, sauteed chunks of pumpkin topped with yogurt and ground beef, and buranee badenjan, delicious sauteed eggplant with a garnish of the same yogurt meat sauce.
Desserts take some getting used to. Firnee is a firm, semisweet pudding studded with almonds and pistachios. Baghlawa is a form of baklava, made with brittle layers of pastry and sweetened walnuts. Gosh-e-feel is the most exotic, a pizza-size piece of fried dough dusted with cardamon, pistachios and confectioners' sugar.
While Pamir still has exotic (and economic) appeal, the lapses in service and food merit a reduction from two stars, which it received in 1987, to one star.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Should Accept Israeli Settlers;
Private-Sector Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The disagreement over the loan guarantees to Israel can be resolved by extending the guarantees to private-sector investments in Israel, rather than to the Israeli Government. The loan guarantees to the private sector will facilitate raising capital to build the infrastructure and plants, and to buy the equipment needed to provide employment to the incoming immigrants. 
 Many Israelis would prefer it if less resources were extended to the Government, which is not known for its frugality or efficiency in investments. The Israeli Government controls too much of the economy and giving it more resources will further increase its economic and political power relative to the private sector.
The extension of United States-sponsored loans to the private sector, rather than to governments, has been suggested by the United States as the policy of the European Bank towards Eastern European countries. Also, the United States Export-Import Bank routinely lends money to private foreign companies that import from the United States.
If this proposal is implemented, the Israeli Government would have to raise the additional funds it needs to build new settlements by raising taxes. This will make explicit to the Israeli public the economic burden that the settlement activity entails. If this burden seems too high for the Israelis to bear, they could pressure the Government to freeze the settlements. Such internal political pressure would be more potent than an outside pressure.

Pulling Together

 BODY:
At a recent meeting, the state governments of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut agreed with New York City to find ways to press economic development as a regional unit. Although separate efforts to attract business will continue, competition will henceforth be downplayed while joint efforts to attract jobs and tourism will be stressed. It's an excellent strategy, especially in these difficult economic times.
No one expects that all competition will stop. But the rival governments seem finally to have acknowledged that bringing new employment to the New York metropolitan region is far better for the region as a whole than having the same development take place a thousand miles away. 
 The cooperating jurisdictions will no longer publicly criticize each other. And there was general agreement that unbridled rivalry sometimes encourages cities to make such huge concessions, in taxes and other benefits, that the winner often ends up losing more money than it can possibly recoup.
The various governments have now built a constructive foundation for further cooperation. The introductory meeting should now be followed by some specific steps to raise the region's banner.

HEADLINE: SYRIA TO BOYCOTT REGIONAL SEGMENT OF MIDEAST TALKS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Syria has informed the United States that it does not intend to participate in one of the three phases of the American-crafted Middle East peace talks, a move that American officials fear may induce other Arab countries to remain on the sidelines and make the negotiations less appealing for Israel.
According to Middle Eastern diplomats and American officials, the Syrians told Washington that they do not plan to take part in the negotiations involving Israel and other countries about regional problems -- like water rights, economic development and arms control. The United States had envisioned these discussons as an important accompaniment to the direct, one-to-one negotiations between Jerusalem and Damascus. 
 The Syrian move, which was conveyed to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d by Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa during a heated meeting in New York on Sept. 26, could have a dampening effect on the proposed peace conference, if other Arab countries follow suit. This is because the United States has promised Israel that the wider-based talks would include Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, with whom Israel has never had diplomatic contact, and would signal that Israel might one day win recognition and acceptance in the whole Arab world.
 
Carrot and Concession
 The Syrians have decided, though, that such talks, which Washington viewed as a carrot to induce Israel to join in the process, constituted a concession, one they were not willing to make until and unless Israel commits itself to returning the Golan Heights, the diplomats said. Israel captured the region in the 1967 war and virtually annexed it.
Administration officials have gone out of their way not to disclose the Syrian move, as Mr. Baker continues to try, through private channels, to persuade Damascus to change its mind.
The negotiations the Syrians are balking at attending are one of three integrated stages in the peace talks that Mr. Baker has been trying to organize. The first stage is a purely ceremonial opening session to be held somewhere in Europe later this month. The Arabs, and particularly the Syrians, insisted on this opening to give the talks an international cover.
The second stage is to be separate, direct talks between Israel and Syria, Israel and Lebanon, and Israel and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. The Syrians are still agreeing to engage in these two-way talks with Israel, but there is no agreement as to where or how they will be conducted.
Two weeks after these talks begin, Mr. Baker promised that the broad negotiations would take place over regional problems. The purpose is to draw into the negotiations the Arab states that do not have territorial disputes with Israel -- particularly Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the other Persian Gulf nations -- in order to signal Israel that there really has been a radical change in Arab attitudes that opens a path to various new relationships.
The American logic underlying these broad-based talks was that the way to persuade Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians was by creating a regional environment that signaled that reconciliation of Israel and its Arab neighbors was possible.
The Syrians told Mr. Baker, the diplomats said, that all they have to discuss with Israel now is exchanging land for secure and recognized boundaries, under their interpretation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242.
Until Israel commits itself to giving up territory, Syria is not ready to participate in a broad-based conference about other issues. The Syrians told Mr. Baker this is because they fear that the Israelis will pocket whatever concessions come at the regionaltalks, particularly the tacit recognition Israel would derive from sitting down with the Saudis and other Arabs -- and not give Syria what it wants on the Golan Heights.
 
Baker Armed With Compromise
 This also explains why Syria refused to attend a conference in Ankara scheduled for Nov. 3 to discuss regional water problems. The Syrians said they would not come if the Israelis did. When other countries heard that Syria was not coming, they pulled out and the conference was postponed.
American officials say they have compromise proposals they plan to present to President Hafez al-Assad when Mr. Baker meets with him in Damascus next Tuesday. He will try then to persuade him to send a delegation to the regional session.
When asked about Syria's move, an Administration official said: "There is good news and bad news. The bad news is that they say they don't want to come. We're still working on that. The good news, though, is that it is a sign that they know this thing is real and is going to happen, and that is what is making them so nervous. The important thing is that they are not raising any questions about the bilateral talks."
Nevertheless, a senior Israeli official said, if Syria is not going to attend the regional talks, "it would certainly send a very negative signal to the Israeli public about this whole process."
 
Cementing a Delegation
 On another front, Mr. Baker met today with four Palestinian leaders to try to prod them into forming their joint delegation with Jordan.
Mr. Baker told the Palestinian representatives -- Hanan Ashrawi, Faisal al-Husseini, Sari Nusseibeh and Zakaria al-Agha -- that their delay in assembling a joint delegation could hold up the whole conference -- which is to start by Oct. 31.
Mr. Baker, an American official said, told the Palestinians that it was important that they, or their colleagues from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, go immediately to Amman and set up the joint delegation "in the right way." That means that the delegation include only Palestinians that the Israelis approve of -- that is Palestinians from the occupied territories, without any direct links with the Palestine Liberation Organization or without any clear-cut connection with East Jerusalem.
It also means that the delegation must be visibly assembled by people from the West Bank and Gaza, with Jordan's King Hussein, and not by the P.L.O. and Jordan, since that could drive Israel away from the talks.
 
Assurances Still Sought
 The Palestinians, for their part, emphasized to Mr. Baker that while they want to come, they still want to be assured that the question of a freeze on Israeli settlements will be addressed as soon as the conference opens. They want to know that the future status of Jerusalem will be on the agenda, and they still insist that a Palestinian with some links to East Jerusalem be allowed to be participate. They have also been seeking a clearer American commitment about their political rights.
Mr. Baker, speaking to reporters before his talks with the Palestinians, said: "President Bush and President Gorbachev made it clear at the Moscow summit that they would like to convene a conference in October, and I simply would point to the fact that this is the 10th of October. So we've got to see some decisions taken here and we've got to see some decisions taken across the board, across the region."
Without being specific, he warned that hard-line elements in the region were intent on disrupting the talks.
"As we get closer and closer to the end of October," he said, "I think you will see a tendency on the part of rejectionists and extremists across the region to take actions designed to disrupt the possibilities for peace."

HEADLINE: Major Aid to Soviets Tops Agenda At Economic Meeting in Bangkok

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The seven major industrial nations, impressed by the worsening financial condition of the Soviet Union and in particular its growing foreign debt, are expected to discuss the granting of substantial foreign aid at a meeting of their finance ministers and central bank chiefs that will begin here Friday.
American officials, traveling to Thailand after an overnight stop in Tokyo, said the agenda at the meeting would be almost completely devoted to the prospect of a Soviet debt crisis and how to solve it before it undermines the country's ability to trade with the West, a critical need. 
 "There is a rough consensus that some alleviation of the short-term debt problem is going to have to take place," said a senior United States official, who spoke on condition of anonymity .
 The major industrial nations, commonly called the Group of Seven, are the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada. Senior American officials said today that they have decided they will have to formulate an urgent program to ease the Soviet debt burden, which is now estimated at $70 billion.
A Soviet delegation is expected at the meeting on Saturday.
 
Debts May Be Postponed
 The senior American official declined to discuss specifics, but there have been suggestions that some debt payments to foreign banks and governments might be postponed or that short-term loans might be offered.
A $70 billion debt is not considered onerous, given the Soviet Union's vast resources and its potential for earning hard currency from exports.
But the nation's economy has deteriorated so rapidly in recent months that there have been disruptions in exports and in the flow of hard currency into the country.
Although figures are sketchy, the Soviets have suggested that they may be unable to make about $5 billion -- and perhaps as much as $8 billion -- in debt payments due in the next three months.
Such a default, in addition to drastically reducing Moscow's ability to trade with the West, would presumably halt any further foreign loans to the Soviet Union.
 
Minimizing the Problem
 Nonetheless, some officials sought to minimize the acuteness of the problem and the importance of the meetings here. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board, told reporters today, "I wouldn't look at this particular meeting as a watershed, but as an ongoing, continuous, intensive exploration of the economic evolution of the Soviet Union and the types of problems that are emerging."
Another senior American official preferred calling the pending problem a temporary "liquidity crisis" rather than a longer-term "financial crisis."
"There is a hump they need to get over, and then it will be easier for them to service their debt," the official said.
Those who consider the Soviet situation acute say that if Moscow loses its credit-worthiness with the West, the ability of governments to help save the country from great economic disorder may be severely limited.
Long-term aid is not now being considered because of concerns whether the Government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would be able to use it effectively.
The Soviet Union has received special associate status in the International Monetary Fund, which is also meeting here. The Soviets are already getting technical advice on how to transform their deteriorating central system into a market economy.
And, according to the senior American Government official, the matter of humanitarian aid has been resolved in recent days "in terms of philosophy."
The United States has offered $2.5 billion worth of credits to provide food and other goods to the Soviet Union. The European Community offered a similar-sized package, and Japan, which for years resisted providing help because of a longstanding territorial squabble with Moscow over disputed northern islands, offered a package of credits and loan guarantees as diplomatic progress was made on the islands issue.
There has been some criticism of the aid offered by Japan and the Europeans, on the basis that their assistance was in a form not always immediately available.
In comments to reporters today, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said that economic help to Moscow should be substantial and forthright. "It's hard money, and it's going right this minute," Mr. Brady said of the American commitment. "I don't want to criticize anyone else. What I do know is the United States is there with $2.5 billion in food credits."
 
First, Two Hurdles
 Officials emphasized that two major hurdles must be cleared before the Soviet Union's debt problems can be eased: the lack of clear information on the extent of the problem, and uncertainty over the relationship between the central Government and the Soviet republics.
So the Soviet delegation is being awaited here with keen anticipation.
"The most important thing that they could bring would be clarity in the responsibilities of the center and the republics, starting with debt obligations," the senior American official said.
Mr. Greenspan said that, despite the difficulties caused by the lack of solid information, the Soviets had made substantial progress in collecting and providing the industrial nations with previously secret economic data.
"They're telling us things I never expected them to tell us," he said. "We're learning increasingly how the system works with the type of detail that basically enables us to diagnose what's happening."

HEADLINE: Bad Times at the A-Bomb Factory

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
When the Savannah River Plant, the nation's main installation for the manufacture of nuclear bombs, was built in the 1950's near Aiken, S. C., it was like "gold rush days," recalls a local resident in Mark Mori and Susan Robinson's frightening documentary, "Building Bombs." 
 Almost overnight, the population of the area grew from 13,000 to 55,000. Aiken became a thriving company town run by the Du Pont Company, which built and operated the plant until the 1980's, when it was taken over by Westinghouse. 
 Those rosy days are long gone. None of the plant's five reactors are operating today. It is a nuclear waste site and storage facility whose cleanup costs have been estimated at more than $30 billion. 
 The 54-minute film, which opened yesterday at the Angelika Film Center on a bill with three shorter films dealing with nuclear issues, offers an understated history of the plant, which is shown to be aging badly, contaminating the local ground water and threatening one of the country's largest aquifers. One of the most disturbing disclosures is that between 1955 and 1983 low-level nuclear waste from the plant was disposed of in cardboard boxes, dumped in shallow trenches and shoveled over. 
 Among those who tell their stories are Art Dexter, a retired Du Pont physicist who suffered a crisis of conscience after being shown a vault containing enough tritium to power 30,000 of the bombs dropped on Nagasaki, and William Lawless, a former engineer for nuclear waste management for the plant. While employed by the plant, Mr. Lawless filed a report on the dangers of ground water contamination from the cardboard boxes that Du Pont rejected and eventually had killed. George Couch, a maintenance mechanic at the plant for 22 years, who is now suffering from a rare blood disease, recalls the plant's lax safety procedures. 
 The plant's biggest defender, who cites its economic benefits to the region (14,000 jobs), is James Edwards, a former United States Secretary of Energy and a former Governor of South Carolina.
 "Building Bombs" is an effective muckraking film because it doesn't scream hysterically. Its scenes covering the 1950's have a deceptively cozy, upbeat atmosphere. The recollections of former plant employees are clear and reasonable, and the narration by Jane Alexander is almost dispassionate in its coolness.
 "Deadly Deception: General Electric, Nuclear Weapons and Our Environment," a half-hour video that is also on the bill, interweaves saccharine television advertisements for General Electric consumer products with inflammatory material about the company's operation of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State and the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in upstate New York. 
 The company ran the Hanford reservation for two decades into the mid-1960's, a period in which the film alleges that those living downwind from the reservation suffered from serious radiation-induced ills. The video was produced by Infact, an organization that is pressing General Electric to get out of the nuclear weapons business, and does not present General Electric's views. 
 Rounding out the program are two clever, strongly polemical antinuclear cartoons. In Jonathan Amitay's "Nukie Takes a Valium," a mocking male mushroom cloud puts on drag to offer a seductive modest proposal for nuclear annihilation. Hal Rucker's "Manic Denial" is a vignette about a psychiatrist awakened to nuclear peril by the discovery of a missile weapon silo near her uncle's farm.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Time to Review Benefits Is Now

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
With employers increasingly adopting flexible, or cafeteria-style, benefit plans, many of which require re-enrollment in the fourth quarter, millions of Americans face important choices about their financial security. Even for people in traditional benefit plans, it is useful to review whether there are gaps in coverage they ought to supplement.
Some flexible plans offer more choices than others. But the basic idea is that employees are given a menu to select how much health, life and disability insurance they want and an opportunity to put away money on a nontaxable basis for dependent care and unreimbursed medical expenses. 
 Generally, the employee is given a certain amount of benefit credits to use for the benefits chosen, and the option of supplementing the credits with salary, if desired. The plans allow employers to shift part of the cost to employees, but at the same time allow employees to tailor their coverage to their personal or family needs. Working couples, for example, may be able to coordinate their coverage. Making the best use of a flexible plan can be equivalent to getting a raise.
"Employer-provided benefits are becoming more significant but precious, so an employee has to evaluate carefully how he is going to spend his employer's money and how much he wants to contribute of his own," said Avery E. Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company in New York, who specializes in pensions and benefits. He and several other experts discussed criteria for employees to use in making choices.
"Health and medical is the most important because it's an ongoing major expense for both an individual and a family," Mr. Neumark said. "Everybody should be covered." Whether to choose regular health insurance or a health maintenance organization is a partly a life-style choice and partly an economic one, he said.
Regular insurance reimburses patients for care provided by their own physicians, typically at 80 percent or 100 percent of the usual and customary charges for a procedure, which may be less than a particular doctor charges. Generally, patients must pay several hundred dollars before insurance kicks in. H.M.O. coverage is far more complete, but doctor choice may be limited.
"If you have a family with young kids, you may have to go with the bread-and-butter plans with low deductibles," Mr. Neumark said. Optical and dental coverage are extra. With several children in a family, the benefits collected could well exceed the premium cost. A healthy young single worker might well find that paying for optical and dental care as needed costs less than the insurance premiums.
Disability insurance, which partly replaces salary in case of illness or accidents that prevent working, is the next consideration. William J. Goldberg of Houston, national director of personal financial services for KPMG Peat Marwick, said, "If you need your earnings to support yourself, you need disability insurance." Joel S. Isaacson, a partner in Clarfeld & Company, New York, and director of personal financial planning, advised people to build a six months' cash reserve to take care of short-term needs because short-term disability insurance is relatively expensive. But he advised supplements with the purchase of good long-term coverage, which is less expensive. "The main thing you want to protect against is catastrophe," he said.
Mr. Goldberg noted that the coverage provided by many corporations had not kept pace with inflation, so he often advises executives to buy supplemental disability coverage. Also, many traditional plans do not provide long-term disability insurance, so employees need to buy it on their own.
Life insurance needs vary greatly, with the number of dependents, age and other family financial resources. Mr. Isaacson said someone who is the sole support of a family might want to buy private insurance to supplement what is available at work, which is often limited to two or three times annual salary. But a single person with no dependents probably needs very little.
Tim Kochis, partner in Kochis & Fitz, San Francisco, said a healthy, young worker who does need life insurance might well find that private coverage costs less than group insurance, "where he is subsidizing older workers."
Flexible spending accounts that allow the use of pretax dollars for payment of unreimbursed medical expenses like well-baby care or psychotherapy or for dependent care offer big opportunities for tax savings. Mr. Isaacson noted that one client-couple who put $5,000 into such an account for child care would have had to earn an additional $2,375 had they paid for child care with earned income after Federal, state and city income taxes and Social Security.
But, Mr. Ray cautioned, flexible spending accounts are "use it or lose it." Anyone who has put money into such accounts this year should be sure to spend it before the end of the year or the money will be lost, he said. "There is a lot of paperwork, but it's worth the paperwork," he added.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Broad Decline On Low U.S. Inflation Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled broadly lower on world currency markets yesterday after a better-than-expected report on United States inflation raised the possibility that interest rates might decline.
Gold prices advanced after falling overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $359.90 an ounce, up $1.10 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $359.50, up $1.20. 
 The dollar was driven down in choppy trading largely by a Labor Department report showing prices at the producer level rose a slight one-tenth of 1 percent in September. The rise in the Producer Price Index was smaller than expected and was the latest in a series of data showing mild inflation at that level.
With inflation moderating, the climate is more conducive for the Federal Reserve to trim interest rates to stimulate the economy. Lower interest rates generally are bearish for the dollar because they lessen the value of dollar-denominated investments.
A separate report showed that excluding the volatile auto category, retail sales inched up only one-tenth of 1 percent in September.
"The dollar was driven down considerably in an immediate knee-jerk reaction," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "There is no reason for the Fed not to ease at this phase."
Later in the day, the dollar seesawed amid heavy corporate buying, rallying higher and then declining again to settle lower.
Mr. Donney suggested that political turmoil in the Soviet Union had helped underpin the dollar, with investors making safe-haven purchases.
"But the fundamentals -- weaker interest rates, a weak economy in the U.S. -- is still the dominant factor," he said.
In Tokyo, where markets reopened after a holiday on Thursday, the dollar fell to close at 129.85 Japanese yen from 130.30 yen at Thursday's close in London. Later in London, it fell to 130.00 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 129.58 yen, down from 130.35 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7195, from $1.7150 late Thursday. In New York a pound cost $1.7235, up from $1.7145 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6895 German marks, down from 1.6960; 1.4793 Swiss francs, down from 1.4845; 5.7575 French francs, down from 5.7780; 1,264.00 Italian lire, down from 1,268.25, and 1.1285 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1293.

United Technologies to Cut Corporate Staff

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 11

 BODY:
The United Technologies Corporation said today that it would cut about 25 percent of its 1,000-member corporate staff, becoming the third major industrial company in a week to announce job cuts because of the poor economy.
United Technologies said the cuts, part of a $1 billion company wide belt-tightening announced this summer, would be followed by other, unspecified reductions. 
 "Increasing pressures from the continued poor economy, a decreasing defense budget and more aggressive competition worldwide will undoubtedly require further reductions that will result in a substantially smaller, restructured corporate office," Robert Daniell, the company's chairman, said in a statement.
The sluggish economy has forced more companies to tighten operations as sales have slumped and profits have been squeezed by the lingering effects of the recession.
On Wednesday, Allied-Signal Inc., the aerospace, automotive products and materials company, announced it was cutting 5,000 jobs, and on Monday the Westinghouse Electric Corporation said it would lay off 4,000 employees.
United Technologies said its cuts would take place over the next few months. About 670 people on the corporate staff work at headquarters in Hartford, while the rest are at other locations in the United States and overseas.
In addition to producing electronic defense systems for the military, United Technologies' businesses include Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Carrier air-conditioners, Otis elevators and Sikorsky helicopters. It had sales last year of $21.8 billion.
In the latest quarterly report, released in July, the company said profits fell 79 percent in the second quarter to $43.4 million from $207.5 million the previous year. The stock of United Technologies rose 37.5 cents today, to $43 a share, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Edged Up 0.1% Last Month

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Prices at the producer level rose a slim one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the Labor Department said today, suggesting that inflation remained under control.
A drop in food prices, the fourth straight monthly fall, helped keep a lid on prices. Energy prices rose, however. 
 The September gain in the Producer Price Index followed a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in August and a decline of two-tenths in July.
 
Hopes for Rate Cuts
 Economists said the report gave the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut interest rates to stimulate the sluggish economic recovery, if it wanted to do so.
The White House, which has been putting pressure on the central bank to lower interest rates, called the report "extraordinarily good news," saying it provided "plenty of room for interest rates to be low and stay low and get low.
"It's an ideal foundation for stimulating growth in the economy when you've got inflation low and under control," Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, told reporters.
So far this year the Producer Price Index, which measures prices charged by producers of finished goods, has fallen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nine-tenths of 1 percent. That is the best performance since 1986.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the so-called core rate of inflation was unchanged, after edging up two-tenths of 1 percent in August.
 
Lack of Demand Cited

"There just aren't inflation pressures out there," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc. "There's just not the demand to create them.".
"If demand were good and producers could raise prices, you bet your bottom dollar they would," she added.
Responding to tame inflation, economic weakness and sluggish growth in the money supply, the Fed pushed down interest rates on Sept. 13 to their lowest levels since the 1970's.
Banks soon followed by cutting their prime lending rate a half-point, to 8 percent, a move that reduced borrowing costs for small businesses and people with home-equity loans.
Facing Presidential elections next year, the White House wants the Fed to cut interest rates more to insure that the recovery remains on track. But the Fed is standing pat for now, apparently awaiting more data.
Today's report on producer prices showed that food prices continued to slide, dropping five-tenths of 1 percent last month, after falling four-tenths the previous month.
 
Drop in Food Costs

The department's food index tumbled at an annual rate of 6.6 percent from June to September, the quickest decline for any quarter since the third quarter of 1976.
The September decline was led by meats, fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as potato and corn chips, fats and oils, and eggs.
Energy prices, by contrast, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent last month, but this was less than the 1.8 percent climb the previous month. The relative slowdown was primarily attributed to gasoline prices, which rose just one-tenth of 1 percent. Home heating oil prices jumped 3.7 percent.
Prices of new passenger cars rose six-tenths of 1 percent, after a 1.1 percent climb in August.
In September, the overall index stood at 121.3, meaning that a basket of finished goods that cost $100 in 1982 cost $121.30 last month.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Surge on Inflation Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
An exceptionally favorable report on inflation prompted a sharp rally in the credit markets yesterday, pushing interest rates down as prices of Treasury notes and bonds rose.
The rise in prices wiped out much of the steep declines registered earlier in the week, but long-term bond yields were still higher at the close of trading yesterday than they were a week ago. 
 The inflation report showed that prices at the producer level rose by just one-tenth of a percent last month and were unchanged when food and energy prices were excluded. That was much better than most Wall Street economists had anticipated.
 
Exceeding Expectations
 "The inflation numbers were as good as you could hope for, and were considerably better than people had thought," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation.
For market participants, the good inflation news was bolstered by a report on retail sales, which rose by an anemic one-tenth of 1 percent during September, once automobile purchases were excluded.
The data renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve Board would move quickly to lower short-term interest rates another notch. But the Fed chose not to initiate that move yesterday.
"Greenspan is out of the country," one government securities trader said. "And I don't ever remember the Fed easing when the chairman is out of the country."
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is in Bangkok, Thailand, for a meeting this weekend of monetary officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations.
Prices of Treasury securities began moving higher during overnight trading in Asia and later in Europe, but spurted after the reports on producer prices and retail sales were released.
 
A Shortened Session
 Much of the United States activity was telescoped into the morning hours, since the government securities market closed at 2 P.M., Eastern daylight time, providing an early start to a three-day Columbus Day weekend. Futures markets will be open on Monday, but the cash market in government securities will be closed.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 25/32 late yesterday, up 30/32, to yield 7.88 percent, compared with 7.95 percent late Thursday.
Despite the decline, by the end of the week yields on the benchmark issue were well above the 7.77 percent at the close of trading the previous Friday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year securities were offered at 102 27/32, up 22/32, to yield 7.45 percent. The 7 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 25/32, up 3/8, to yield 6.81 percent. And the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes rose by 1/8 point, to a late offered price of 100 14/ 32, to yield 5.88 percent.
 
Bill Rates Decline
 Short-term Treasury bill rates fell in anticipation of an easing move by the Fed.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 4.94 percent, down 6 basis points, or six one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell 5 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.99 percent.
Because of the truncated session in the government securities market, activity in the markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was slow.
Corporate traders said that prices of most issues rose by about 1/8 point to 1/4 point.

HEADLINE: Balancing Act in Quest for Quiet Skies

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
In the battle for quieter skies, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey finds itself caught between the airlines that pay the bills at its three airports and the politicians who represent the airports' angry neighbors.
In starting to draft "aggressive" local rules that would reduce such noise faster than new Federal rules, the Port Authority is throwing in its lot with its neighbors, at least for now. 
But in addition to the airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration may well also oppose the move.
Top officials at the Port Authority promised yesterday to seek a compromise that everyone can accept, even if reluctantly. But it is hard to see how the Port Authority can satisfy these conflicting interests.
Richard C. Leone, the head of the Port Authority, said that while he expects an eventual compromise, he will respond first to instructions from local political leaders. He added that he simply does not agree that the Federal Government is the ultimate arbiter of noise policy from coast to coast.
 
Too Passive? Too Aggressive?
 And David Z. Plavin, the authority's director of aviation, said: "I am assuming there is no way to do this that will satisfy most of the people. Some will say we have been too aggressive and others not aggressive enough. But I think there is a way of reaching agreement. We have no choice but to do that."
The authority's objective, Mr. Plavin said, is to cut down on the actual number of noisy flights to and from the local airports. The Port Authority is not persuaded that new Federal rules announced last month, which set deadlines for airlines to phase out noisy planes from their nationwide fleets over about 10 years, will make much difference to New York and New Jersey, which have a disproportionately high number of noisy flights.
"We see no relief in terms of the specific fleet that serves our airports," Mr. Plavin said of the Federal rules.
There are at least two ways the authority might go about devising local rules, although the agency doesn't plan to make its decisions for at least a month, after a round of consultations with airlines, politicians and citizens groups.
One approach would be to adopt the Federal compliance schedules on a local basis. A few years from now, when an airline is required by the Federal rule to have eliminated half the noisy jets from its fleet nationwide, it would also promise to schedule quieter jets for half its flights in the New York area.
 
New Rules in Los Angeles
 An alternate approach would be to count the number of local flights by an airline using the noiser jets in 1991, and to reduce them steadily -- for example, to cut them by 10 percent each year until they all ceased in 10 years.
But the airlines are sure to object to either approach, and neither would be welcomed by the F.A.A. The airlines want, in effect, to be let alone by the Port Authority, since in any event virtually all the noisy jets will be gone nationwide in 10 years' time under the Federal rule.
New York is not the only locality eager to impose strict local noise rules. A recent attempt to do so in Los Angeles led to intense negotiations between the city and the Federal Aviation Administration in the months before the final Federal rules were published.
Although an agreement has not yet been completed, the negotiations have led to an understanding that Los Angeles may set tight limits on individual airlines operating noisy planes at its airports.
But Federal officials have said that the Los Angeles plan cannot be construed as a pattern to be followed elsewhere. They reached agreement with the city in large measure to head off its strategy of setting strict local rules before the Federal rules took effect.
 
Reluctant to Wait
 The pressure for stricter local rules originates with the people who live near airports or within earshot of arriving and departing planes. They are reluctant to wait for years as the planes are replaced with quieter models. Although they have the support of powerful lawmakers at the local, state and Federal levels, there is little hope that the residents can dictate the outcome of the battle, say lawyers familiar with noise regulations. The best they can do is argue that the new law specifically allows local airports to set local noise rules, a disputed point that can only be settled in court.
The Federal Aviation Administration, for its part, has two options to thwart local rules it does not like. One is to go to court claiming that Federal law pre-empts the local airport authorities. A second is to withhold grants and revenues from the Port Authority unless its noise regulations comply with the new Federal rules.
Finally, although they cannot tell the authority what to do, the airlines have profound economic power as the authority's customers and tenants and Kennedy, Newark and La Guardia airports. By bringing business there they fuel the authority's economic engine, and they claim that local noise regulations could cost them so much money that they would have to cut flights into the area.
Mr. Plavin said the agency will be careful to meet the technical requirements of the new Federal noise law, which dictates the process by which local airport authorities set their local noise rules.
The local rules have to be based on economic and environmental analyses showing what alternatives were considered and whether the costs imposed on the airlines are worth the benefits to be gained by the localities. When the rules are proposed, there must follow a comment period of at least 180 days before final adoption.

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS NOMINATION;
Americans Riveted By Lesson in Civics

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
In cities and towns far and wide, Americans took time out from their workaday lives yesterday to tune into an extraordinary civics lesson: the riveting collision before the Senate Judiciary Committee between Judge Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court nominee, and Anita F. Hill, the Oklahoma law professor who said she was sexually harassed by him.
For a nearly a week now, since the charges became public, they have been topic No. 1 in offices and universities, in restaurants and on street corners, with many women celebrating the sudden public discussion of a heretofore private subject and many men wondering about their own conduct, present, past and future. 
 "The old rules are going out," said Steve Traub, a student at the StanfordMedical School in Palo Alto, Calif., who gathered with a group of friends to watch the proceedings. "We don't really have new rules in place yet. But at least now we're talking about it."
There's plenty of disagreement among people watching and listening to the hearings about who was telling the truth and who was not, plenty of debate about whether the confusing set of facts and allegations ought to disqualify Judge Thomas from service on the High Court, plenty of speculating and ruminating about why Professor Hill was there telling her story and whether the Senate had handled her situation properly.
 
Anguish and Fury
 The vivid details of Professor Hill's account and the raw anguish of Judge Thomas's defense at times left spectators gasping.
Who could have imagined just a few days ago that a quiet Baptist woman would be in the Senate chamber and on national television describing conversations about pubic hair or penis size? Who could have imagined a Supreme Court nominee alternately on the edge of tears and trembling with fury as he described the anguish he and his family have suffered?
Was it possible, television viewers asked each other, that Judge Thomas could have done or said even half the things that Professor Hill accused him of without understanding that he crossed some boundary between repartee and abuse? Or alternatively, was it possible that she could have some political agenda or emotional disturbance that would lead to such carefully crafted lies?
"It's still his word against hers," said Floyd Stevenson, a barber at the Hyde Park Hair Salon in Chicago. "But I'd say Judge Thomas has a problem because of the graphic detail she is providing."

 
 
Which One to Believe?
 Many people watching the hearings were struck by the impossible task of knowing for sure whom to believe when two unshakable witnesses tell diametrically opposed stories, which is often the case with sexual harassment claims.
"That's what's so problematic about this stuff," said Karen Seal, a medical student at Stanford, where the campus was rocked a few months back by the resignation and subsequent return of a prominent female neurosurgeon who charged she had endured 25 years of subtle and not-so-subtle sexism. "Each person sounds so believable. How do human beings judge?"
Many viewers were saddened by the belief that Professor Hill and Judge Thomas, both individuals of good reputation and credentials, would emerge scarred from these hearings, whatever the resolution.
"It's incredibly sad," said Jill Kasle, a professor of public administration at George Washington University in the nation's capital, where people were so preoccupied by the hearings that lunch dates were forgotten and the streets were almost deserted at midday. "Everybody is in an impossible position."
 
'It's Unfortunate for Both'
 The same sentiment was heard at a YMCA in Greenwich, Conn., where a television just off the lobby acted like a magnet for employees and patrons alike. "I think it's unfortunate for both sides," said Beth Finger, a YMCA trustee. "They're both very sympathetic and tragic figures."
Many people said that the ragged and ruthless process of confirming Supreme Court nominees, or electing presidents, for that matter, was to blame for incalculable suffering.
"None of us could pass the scrutiny they go through," said Bill Jenkins, an engineer on the Stanford campus, who completed his tasks yesterday with radio headphones firmly on his head. "This dirty linen stuff -- that's one of the reasons I would not want to go into politics."
The process could get even dicier now, some people said. In recent years, candidates for appointed or elective posts have been pilloried for sexual liaisons and drug use and now, conceivably, another moral litmus test has been added to a growing list.
"Sexual harassment is so pervasive, but nobody asked about that before," said Whitney Carrico, another Stanford medical student. "Many people could be held accountable for this. Who's going to be the next appointment? He could be accused of the same thing."
 
Captivating Audiences
 From Clarence Thomas's hometown of Pin Point, Ga., to Morris, Okla., where Anita Hill's family still lives on the farm where she grew up, and even to the Supreme Court itself, televisions tuned to the hearings captivated audiences. The Justices of the Supreme Court, who attended their regular closed-door Friday morning conference, missed the opening hours of the Senate hearing, but the sounds of the hearing were audible in the corridors behind their conference room, emanating from the television sets and radios of their law clerks and secretaries.
Certain viewers had special agendas as they watched the hearings. Women, who seemed to feel they had the most at stake, said that listening to Professor Hill's account of unwanted advances and offensive conversation stirred memories of their own unpleasant experiences in the workplace. And, by and large, they had no trouble understanding her decision not to confront Judge Thomas when he was her supervisor a decade ago.
"It was simple economic viability," said Rae Amey, the director of development for a nonprofit organization in Santa Monica, Calif. "You can't make men understand. They just don't grasp the issue."
Men, for their part, talked of their confusion and concern trying to figure out how to behave in a shifting social climate. "I'm scared to say anything," said Luke Fichthorn, a college student who was interviewed by The Associated Press in a New York City bar.
"You make lewd comments now and then; everybody does," Mr. Fichthorn continued, noting that a lot of male-female repartee could be misconstrued if taken out of context. "I feel sorry for Judge Thomas. I know, in his position, he should be very careful. But nobody's perfect."
Many viewers asked themselves and their friends if workplace relationships between men and women will ever be the same.
 
Smelling a Conspiracy
 For some black Americans, the charges against Judge Thomas, even though leveled by a black women, smelled like a conspiracy, perhaps by Democrats and perhaps by Republicans, to keep a black man off the Supreme Court.
"Anita Hill shouldn't make a mistake and the women's groups shouldn't make a mistake," said Tracey Boykin, a Chicago social worker who was getting her hair done and watching television at the Hyde Park Hair Salon. "This is about politics. The big boys in power don't give a damn. They're just using her."
The owner of the salon, John T. Tolbert, had another theory: President Bush had somehow set up his own nominee for disgrace. "I think Bush could be having a change of heart about having a black man in such an important position," Mr. Tolbert said. "This was a great opportunity to back out of the deal and still look good."
In addition to specific concerns, confusions and questions about Judge Thomas, Professor Hill and a messy political process, many people yesterday looked forward to the rewards that might come from a frank, public discussion of sexism in the workplace.
At the Stanford Medical School, that discussion was joined last June when Dr. Frances K. Conley resigned her post after condemning the way men treated women in the hierarchical world of academic medicine.
Dr. Conley has since rejoined the faculty, citing progress by the school's administration in addessing issues of sexism. And students said yesterday said that their professors, jolted by the reaction on campus and across the nation, have changed their behavior in ways great and small.
Typical is one faculty member notorious for using offensive slides in his lectures, without understanding the distress among female students. The slides are gone now, and his door is open to female students.
"Now we can talk on a humane level," said Whitney Carrico, the medical student. "And that has happened with somebody we thought was recalcitrant."

HEADLINE: Angry Dinkins Defends Travel To South Africa

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
In an impassioned and often angry speech yesterday, Mayor David N. Dinkins painstakingly detailed his reasons for going to South Africa, saying he hoped to forge an economic partnership with leaders he believes will lead the country after apartheid falls.
"I'm going in November," the Mayor declared at a meeting of the City Club, a civic group. "I'm going in a rowboat if I have to. I'm going to South Africa. No doubt about it." 
 In often prickly tones, the Mayor chided critics who have questioned the need for the trip and the size of the delegation. He asserted that his detractors were ignorant of both the potential economic benefits New York City could reap and the influence the city could have in helping end the racist system.
"Under a democratic South African Government, an enormous amount of business will flow through New York," the Mayor said. "And, as Nelson Mandela said during his visit here to New York City last year, the A.N.C. will remember those who stood by them." The A.N.C. is the African National Congress, the leading opposition group led by Mr. Mandela.
 
Like a Schoolteacher's Scolding
 Mayoral aides said Mr. Dinkins has been extremely annoyed by the attention reporters focused on the scuttled trip and the criticism of his administration's way of doing business. Yesterday's speech was a clear attempt to counter that criticism and outline what Mr. Dinkins said he believes are the important reasons for going.
The Mayor was embarrassed last month by the collapse of his initial ambitious plan to charter a jet to South Africa and take more than three dozen city officials, business leaders and friends. That trip was postponed and eventually scaled back because his top aide, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, was too busy working to calm racial violence in Crown Heights to raise $500,000 in private money for the trip.
Since then, the fund raising -- done by the same city-controlled nonprofit organization that has raised money for events like the parade in June honoring Persian Gulf war veterans -- has drawn fire from some civic groups that questioned whether the contributors might have done business with the city.
At times using the scolding tones of a schoolteacher, the Mayor spoke angrily of the deprivation in black townships and the laws that continue to discriminate against blacks.
 
'Isn't It Sad?'
 He said New Yorkers were uninformed about conditions in the country, and pointed to an article in The New York Times Travel section that, he said, "actually suggested that the biggest obstacle confronting an American tourist visiting South Africa today is not the terrible truths that have resulted from apartheid, but the high cost of a ticket to get there."
The Mayor then broke from his prepared text, saying: "I know that if the whales were endangered tomorrow, that the world would be organized in righteous protest, and perhaps properly so. Isn't it sad that these kinds of conditions can go on and on for so long -- and yet here we are perhaps on the eve of the ability to recognize a breakthrough -- and too few people seem to understand?"
Underlying the speech, mayoral aides said, was Mr. Dinkins's frustration at his seeming inability to communicate to the public that the trip would be more than ceremonial and that he was deeply committed to doing what he could to end apartheid.
"He feels this trip has not been understood," Mr. Lynch. "People got the impression this was a kind of junket. And it's not."
 
'A Double Standard?'
 The Mayor's aides said he has felt unfairly singled out by critics. Some prominent blacks have gone so far as to say publicly that Mr. Dinkins's trip is being scrutinized more harshly because he is black.
"There is room to point to a double standard," said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, minister of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. "In my memory they have not been as critical of others who have gone to other places."
Yesterday Mr. Dinkins took pains to point out that his trip was no different from those made by other politicians that drew less criticism. He mentioned Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's trip to Italy in 1984, trips by Mayors Edward I. Koch and Abraham D. Beame to Israel and even a trip Mayor John V. Lindsay took to Britain.
"It is also a personal voyage for me," he said. "I will be returning to the continent of my ancestors for the first time. And to travel back to one's homeland and offer support to people who suffer personal misery is, I believe, a profound singular experience and one that is uniquely American."

HEADLINE: Organizing for Visas: Irish, Lottery and Luck

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
In the shadow world of the more than 30,000 Irish living illegally in New York City, this weekend has become a symbol of their hopes and dreams.
It is the culmination of a maddening but strangely coordinated frenzy of millions of mailings, their one chance to leap overnight from a barely visible realm into an established world, part of the largest legal migration of the Irish since 1965. 
 Only 16,000 citizens of the Republic of Ireland can win a coveted residence visa this year. But over the last couple of weeks, Irish people living illegally in New York -- nearly a third of the 100,000 Irish thought to be living illegally in the United States -- have come out of their gray world, gathering in pubs and organized seminars to study every possible angle to reduce the random nature of the Government lottery. In fact, the Irish have organized so extensively that they have also become the leading experts for many of the citizens of the 34 other countries that are participating in the lottery.
For most, the permanent residence visa, which allows immigrants to work and live in this country legally, will lift them out of a world ruled by fear of deportation, paranoia and insecurity.
"This is the opportunity of a lifetime," said Moira Philbin, 26, who has been working illegally under an assumed name, jumping from job to job, for the last three years. She has worked without health insurance and any other benefits. "I want to get on with my life, go to school, get a good job. I'm so, so hopeful. If I don't get it, I'll be a basket case." If she does not win, she said, she is not sure if she will have the courage to apply again in next year's lottery.
For the Irish, one of the largest groups of illegal immigrants in the city, this fight for legitimacy has taken on added significance. "There has been terrific networking, and it has given them a new sense of security," said Adrian Flannelly, who is the host of an Irish radio program and has helped organize the preparation campaign.
On Monday beginning at 12:01 A.M. the people who mailed the first 40,000 letters deposited by postal workers in a cage in a post office in Merrifield, Va., will qualify to become permanent resident aliens. Any letters deposited before 12:01 A.M. Monday will be discarded. As many as 5 million pieces of mail are expected to arrive at the post office in suburban Washington between 12:01 A.M. and the Oct. 19 deadline for receiving such letters.
Among the factors expected to determine which of the 5 million pieces will be among the prized first 40,000 is pure luck. For example, a postal truck delivering these letters may run a few minutes late or a mail sorter may pause in his work. To increase their chances of winning, applicants are mailing hundreds of applications each.
An additional 10,000 envelopes will be picked and held as a reserve in case some of the first 40,000 are disqualified because of things like having a criminal record, carrying the AIDS virus, having syphilis or active tuberculosis.
This unusual lottery system for obtaining permanent resident visas is being conducted by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service and is a result of a 1990 law that gives preference to European countries to compensate for the preference given Latin Americans and Asians in the last 26 years. It guarantees the Irish at least 40 percent of the places. Most of the Irish who will win the lottery are already in the United States, Irish-Americans say.
 
Fear of Deportation
 In this new visa program, the Irish are guaranteed 48,000 resident alien permits over the next three years and the lottery will become a permanent annual feature.
Although critics describe the lottery as a disguised amnesty for the illegal immigrants from the Republic of Ireland, its supporters say that it is merely addressing years of discrimination against Irish immigrants and that its main goal is to legalize the Irish already in the United States.
"The impact is unbelievable," said Sean Benson, director of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center in Woodside, Queens. "Many have been invisible for four or five years. It's a real coming-out session."
And it has also pulled the community together. While in the past the new Irish rarely even admitted to their friends that they were illegally working, the new social pastime at the hundreds of Irish pubs throughout the city has been licking scores of envelopes and stamps for the applications. Lottery announcements have been plastered on the doors of Irish pubs and delicatessens.
Since their first wave of immigration more than 200 years ago, the Irish have consistently flowed into America. The large Irish communities in the city are in Woodside and Sunnyside in Queens and around Bainbridge Avenue in the north Bronx. Most of the illegal community here in the city came after 1965, when immigration laws became much stricter, and they reflect a very different Ireland. The two communities -- the one with the brogue and the one without -- while supportive of each other, are also separated by a cultural and generational gap.
"The younger Irish think the older ones have an antiquated view of Ireland," Ms. Philbin said. "They idealize Ireland in a way we don't."
While the older generation is much more nationalistic, the younger arrivals view themselves as part of an integrated European community. The majority of the new Irish are young and single, escaping a collapsing economy in Ireland with 20 percent unemployment.
 
Careers and Visits
 A survey taken by the Irish Immigration Reform Movement shows that the new arrivals come from all parts of Ireland, many from rural backgrounds and that most have completed a high school education. They enter the country on tourist or student visas and then never leave, taking tough jobs for which they are frequently overqualified and over-educated, often as nannies, maids, bar and restaurant employees and construction workers. For most of the women, legality has come to symbolize career advancement. For the men, it meant finally being able to go back home for visits.
Despite their differences, there has always been a tremendous wave of sympathy and support among the established Irish here for their younger counterparts. Under the premise that the key to winning is sending in an application letter that will be part of the first batch to be selected, local Irish newspapers, radio stations, immigration centers as well as the Catholic Archdiocese have set up more than 18 seminars in the city to discuss how, when and where to mail application letters as well as how to prepare for the I.N.S. interview that will follow the winning of the lottery.
To increase their chances, most people are mailing 500 to 1,000 application letters each, staggering the mailing over several days and mailing in different areas of New York as well as taking letters directly to Virginia. A three-day mail strike in Ireland has increased the chances for those already in the United States. The Irish Voice, Adrian Flannelly and scores of other organizations are trucking down hundreds of thousands of letters to Virginia.
On a recent evening in Manhattan, more than 400 people gathered at a seminar sponsored by The Irish Voice. The majority were Irish, but there were English and Dutch and Poles and Italians as well. For all, a resident alien permit was the unattainable dream finally at their fingertips. Even if legalization meant a stricter payment of taxes -- that was fine, too, they said.
It was a room full of hope.
One woman who has been working here on a student visa for more than a year, would identify herself only Susan McK., 24 years old, from Dublin. Winning, she said, for her meant an end to exploitation. As a waitress, she has survived without a salary, merely on tips for more than eight months. "My other choices are nannying and I'm not really into child care," she said. "I want to continue my postgraduate work in art here."
Ms. Philbin is counting the hours for the letter that will tell her she won. "I feel like my 300 letters will be lost among the 5 million. I want it so badly. I'll be the first person greeting the postman every morning."

HEADLINE: Bush Vetoes Extended Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
President Bush today vetoed a $6.5 billion bill that would have provided as many as 20 additional weeks of unemployment benefits for 3 million people who have been out of work more than half a year. The President said the measure would damage the economic recovery by abandoning budget discipline.
 Mr. Bush's 23d veto was accompanied by a message intended to blunt the political issue the Democrats have made out of his opposition to this bill and a similar measure that he killed in August. He said his Administration was "deeply concerned about the needs of the unemployed and their families." Mr. Bush added that if a "responsible" bill were passed that did not violate last year's budget agreement, he would sign it immediately. 
 But he did not seek to draw attention to his action today. The veto, which was threatened before Congress passed the bill last week, was announced while much of the nation's attention was concentrated on televised hearings concerning Judge Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. The President had until Oct. 19 to act.
 
Little Hope for Override
 None of Mr. Bush's vetoes haves been overridden. The Democrats who pushed this bill are not optimistic about overriding this one, for they would have to persuade two of the 35 Senate Republicans who opposed it last week to change their votes to do so. The 65-to-35 vote there was short of the two-thirds majority required under the Constitution to override, although the 300-to-118 margin in the House exceeded it comfortably.
 The Senate will take an override vote next week, said Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, who complained that with the veto, "President Bush has once again demonstrated that he is more willing to assist those abroad than Americans here at home." As evidence of that attitude, he cited Mr. Bush's willingness to issue emergency declarations under last year's budget act in order to help Kurds, Turks and Israelis.
 This measure would be financed by declaring an emergency and increasing the deficit by its cost. Mr. Bush was able to kill a similar measure in August without a veto because it was drafted in a way that allowed him to sign it first and then refuse to declare the emergency. The bill he vetoed today already included a declaration of emergency, so he had to veto it to kill it.
 The Democrats' interest in making a political issue out of unemployment was reflected not only in Mr. Mitchell's language, but also in the announcement by Representative Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, that his organization was running radio and television advertisements in the districts of House Republicans who opposed the bill. Mr. Fazio said it was cynical for the veto to be issued during the Thomas hearing.
 But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader, said the veto would force the Democrats to choose between real extended benefits for the jobless "or just political benefits at the expense of unemployed Americans."
 He said the Democrats could choose between two cheaper measures, with shorter periods of extended benefits, which Mr. Bush would sign. One is his own and the other is offered by Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota. Both would be paid for by extending a tax law procedure for using the Internal Revenue Service to collect defaulted student loans and by auctioning off unused radio frequencies.
 
Costs of 2 Alternatives
 The Durenberger bill would cost $3.9 billion and provide as many as 15 weeks of extended benefits for workers whose regular 26 weeks have run out. The Dole bill would cost $3.3 billion and provide as many as 10 weeks of benefits in the states with the highest levels of unemployment plus special provisions to be made by the Secretary of Labor in pockets of very high unemployment.
 Democrats in both houses have been reluctant to move ahead with the plan of auctioning the radio frequencies, and some broadcasters have opposed the idea.
 In complaining about the veto today, Mr. Mitchell and other Democrats said there was about $8 billion in a Federal trust fund set up to pay extended benefits of as many as 13 weeks. But, although national unemployment was 6.7 percent in September and about 300,000 workers exhaust their benefits each month, the rules for paying benefits out of this fund are drawn so tightly that workers in no state are now eligible.
 The bill vetoed today by Mr. Bush would provide 20 weeks of additional benefits in states where the total unemployment rate over the previous six months averaged 8 percent or more, 13 weeks in states where the rate is 7 percent or more, and 7 weeks in all other states.
 The President complained about several elements of the Democratic bill today. He complained that its three tiers of extended benefit levels amounted to "a complex, cumbersome system." He said it "could slow reemployment and would result in benefit delays, payment inaccuracies and escalating administrative costs."
 He also complained that the Democratic bill, unlike existing law or the Dole or Durenberger measures, used a state's total unemployment as a standard. Current law and the Republican bills use the rate of unemployment among insured workers, who are about half of those employed.
 The Administration contends that the rate based on the insured is more accurately calculated and thus a more precise tool. The Democrats maintain that it does not reflect real conditions in a recession labor market, when a large number is unemployed, insured or not, makes it hard to find a job.
 But Mr. Bush's heaviest emphasis was on the budget argument. He said that enacting the bill "would signal the failure of budget discipline, which would have a negative effect on financial markets that could threaten economic recovery and lead to increased unemployment."

HEADLINE: March of the Mayors

BYLINE: By Osborn Elliott; Osborn Elliott, chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, is organizing a march on Washington in April.

 BODY:
Suddenly last summer, while no one was looking -- not even the press -- the mayors of America got mad.
Meeting at Hyannis, Mass., in August, leaders of the U.S. Conference of Mayors -- representing 1,000 cities -- voted to mount what they hope will be history's greatest march on Washington. It will be part protest against a Government the mayors think has betrayed them, and part celebration of the immeasurable contributions the cities make to our society. 
 Today there will be a trial run, as Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore leads his city in its own march on Washington. Mayor Schmoke hopes to rally more than 10,000 people, including a number who will actually walk the 40 miles from Baltimore to Washington.
The date chosen for the main march, April 11, 1992, is a Saturday in the middle of the Presidential primary season. The mayors plan to gather hundreds of thousands of people, in Washington and in cities around the country. Citing multiple crises in housing, health care, jobs and schools, they will be marching under the slogan, "Save Our Cities! Save Our Children!"
They are targeting those people and institutions they hold responsible for more than a decade of brutal cutbacks in Federal financing: a Democratic Congress, a Republican White House, an uncaring bureaucracy. The mayors want the march to be nonpartisan: in their view, both political parties have been responsible for the cuts in Federal aid.
It is not hard to understand why American mayors have become so angry.
Since the late 1970's, the portion of state and local budgets picked up by Washington has plummeted by one- third. For New York City, that has meant the loss of almost $25 billion in Federal money and $3 billion in the current fiscal year alone. That is about the size of the budget gap the city has painfully had to close.
Everywhere the cutbacks have had devastating effects. They extend to surrounding areas, to the suburbs, even to rural America -- all those places that suffer from crime, drugs, poverty and unemployment.
That's why the mayors expect their march to draw people from all segments of society. They are calling for civic groups to join the protest. They look for teachers and students and mothers and fathers to join hands, demanding delivery on all those promises of a better education. They expect church and labor leaders, bankers and businessmen, doctors and lawyers, artists and merchants, farmers and pharmacists -- in short, everyone who has a stake in the well-being of our cities -- to join the march.
For years, our leaders have shown their disregard for the cities. They seem to be saying that's not where the votes are. But the mayors argue against this. They point to polls suggesting that Americans think of the cities as the engines of our society. Indeed, a survey by Louis Harris last summer showed that 77 percent of Americans believe this country cannot survive unless the problems of its cities are solved.
That gives the mayors reason to hope that their protests, today's and the march scheduled for April, will be instrumental in focusing the nation's attention on its pressing domestic problems once again.

HEADLINE: Miyazawa Gets Party Approval to Lead Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Kiichi Miyazawa, a stalwart of Japan's governing party and one of the architects of the country's postwar economic ascent, was virtually assured election as the next Japanese prime minister tonight, ending a bruising weeklong scramble for the leadership.
Mr. Miyazawa, an urbane 72-year-old politician who has held virtually every key political post in Japan except prime minister, was endorsed this evening by the largest and wealthiest faction in the Liberal Democratic Party, controlled by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. 
 At a news conference earlier in the day, Mr. Miyazawa said he expected no significant changes in Japan's relations with Washington, where he has been a well-known and influential player in Japanese-American relations for more than two decades.
 
'The Same Values'
 "We have the same values," he said of Japan and the United States. "If we have something to complain about to each other, we should do so frankly."
It was the Takeshita faction that withdrew its support from Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu a week ago, forcing him to abandon his hopes of seeking a second term. Political analysts said they expected Mr. Miyazawa, a far more senior member of the party and a leader of a major faction, to hold somewhat more independent sway over the conduct of the Government than did Mr. Kaifu, who was widely viewed as a weak leader entirely dependent on the good graces of Mr. Takeshita and his aging ally in the governing party, Shin Kanemaru.
For Mr. Miyazawa, known as one of the party's keenest minds and one of its most fluent English speakers, the endorsement today completes a stunning political turnaround. Less than three years ago, he was forced to step down as Finance Minister when he was implicated in the Recruit scandal, a stock-and-influence peddling scheme that later also led to the resignation of Mr. Takeshita.
It was the Recruit scandal that brought Mr. Kaifu to office, with his promise of political reforms that would rid Japan of "money politics" and the perpetual struggle among party factions that emphasize power relationships over ideas or ideology.
But the political reform bill on which Mr. Kaifu staked his premiership failed, precipitating the swift end of his tenure. The events of the last week, in which a small cadre of behind-the-scenes players have chosen a new prime minister, suggest that the scandal ultimately brought about little lasting change.
Technically, the position for which Mr. Miyazawa was endorsed is president of the Ruling Liberal Democratic party. But ever since the party took control of the nation more than three decades ago, its president has automatically become the prime minister.
 
Rival Assails Process
 One of Mr. Miyazawa's two main rivals for the party presidency, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, criticized the secretive selection process.
"Some people may think that the presidential election is now over, but others wonder how the party's 1.75 million rank and file members feel," Mr. Mitsuzuka said. "A public election should be held so that we can seek the support of the people in competitive balloting. I am ready for the election. I will not budge."
Mr. Miyazawa's other key rival for the job, Michio Watanabe, also said he would stay in the race, though neither man has much chance of winning.
Overall, there has been little public criticism of the fact that Japan's new leader is once again being chosen behind closed doors, amid the promises of the jobs and patronage that have always cemented temporary alliances among the five main factions.
In fact, the Japanese public seemed in a curious way to enjoy the drama of the last week, with plots and maneuvering that rivaled anything performed in kabuki theater. With almost no differences in philosophy or national policy at stake, many Japanese say, a Western-style nationwide vote or greater public participation in the process would accomplish little.
If all goes as the party expects, Mr. Miyazawa will take office when Mr. Kaifu's term ends on Oct. 30. Mr. Miyazawa comes to power at a moment of considerable challenge for Japan, which is struggling to resolve a territorial dispute with the Soviet Union that has blocked full relations, contain a ballooning trade deficit with the United States and define its role in Asia, where it is often courted as an investor but mistrusted as a neighbor.
Mr. Miyazawa will also have to navigate two of the most delicate international decisions facing Japan in the next few months: how to contribute to United Nations peacekeeping forces and whether to open up its highly protected rice market to imports.
"I am very humbled," he told his supporters tonight, using the modest words expected of winners in Japanese society. "I do not believe I am worthy of the honor."
The endorsement of Mr. Miyazawa seems to reflect the party's sense that, with the passage of time, the principals in the Recruit scandal have been rehabilitated and can once again openly share in the Government's top posts. But Mr. Miyazawa was careful to say that his top priority would be passage of a political reform bill, exactly what Mr. Kaifu failed to accomplish.
The endorsement capped several days of frantic politicking within the governing party as Mr. Miyazawa, Mr. Watanabe and Mr. Mitsuzuka, scrambled to seek support.
Mr. Watanabe, a tough political infighter, is believed to have been passed over in part because of derogatory comments he made several years ago about American blacks. Mr. Mitsuzuka has only narrow support in the party, where he has taken over the leadership of the faction formerly headed by Shintaro Abe, who died this year.
American and European diplomats seemed pleased by the choice of Mr. Miyazawa. "He's been in touch with American leadership for 20 years, and he is well-known and respected," a senior American diplomat here said. "And he is a very engaging man."
Mr. Miyazawa joined Japan's Ministry of Finance during the war. After Japan's defeat, he used his English skills to negotiate with the occupation forces. In 1949 he became the political secretary to Hayato Ikeda, later a Prime Minister.
He ran later for Parliament and began serving in the 1960's in a succession of top jobs. As Minister of International Trade and Industry, one of Japan's most sensitive posts, he tacked the textile trade disputes with the United States, the forerunner to a series of economic clashes that would grow more heated every year. From 1974 to 1976 he served as Foreign Minister.

HEADLINE: What's Wrong With Tolls on East River Bridges? Plenty

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Tolls on New York City's East River bridges, a bad idea when first proposed decades ago, hasn't improved with age ("What's Fair Is a Fare," Op-Ed, Sept. 28). 
 When the idea was last floated, studies showed it would only cut discretionary traffic to Manhattan, basically shopping and entertainment trips, while the other side of the bridges would have an increase in air pollution of as much as 400 percent. This could doom development of downtown Brooklyn's new backoffice complex.
New technology might reduce the backups, but there will always be a need for several tollbooths for each bridge for drivers who do not regularly travel to Manhattan and lack the high-tech panacea on which toll proponents now rely.
Tolling the East River bridges is also bad public policy.
Tolls would shift the maintenance cost of the city's 877 bridges to the users of only a dozen routes and at the same time divide the city, sending a message that Manhattan is accessible only to the affluent.
The tolls proposal is an admission that the city has lacked the political will to maintain its infrastructure, even in years of budget surpluses.
New York can devote sufficient resources to its transportation infrastructure without tolls. Instead of supporting this ill-conceived notion, I urge a commitment by the city's leaders to our long-term maintenance needs.

 Judge Thomas put the Senate on trial with a powerful invocation of racial imagery that he had not used before yesterday's testimony, saying that black men who did not "kowtow to an old order" would "be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree." 1

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Cuomo Utters a 'Maybe' But Hastens to Add 'Not'

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo told a group of supporters at a private meeting yesterday that he was thinking about running for President, and then spent the rest of the day insisting that he had not said anything that anyone should be interested in.
 Thus Mr. Cuomo set off another round of the now familiar guessing game, "Will he or won't he?" Mr. Cuomo, who has steadfastly insisted that he has no plans to run for President and no plans to make plans, was now raising the possibility that he was planning to make some. 
The confusion began at breakfast.
 Cuomo supporters who attended a morning meeting with him in Manhattan say he told them that he was considering running for President.
 But at a news conference later in the day, after word of his ruminations had leaked out to The Associated Press, Mr. Cuomo insisted that he had made the remarks only to placate contributors who were pressing him on the subject.
 "They said, 'Will you think about it?' " he said. "I said, 'Sure, I'll think about it. I'm always thinking about it.' I said I'd have to be mindless not to think about it. I don't talk about it, but I think about it. Of course I do."
 The events of the day were reminiscent of the Governor's long flirtation with a presidential candidacy four years ago, when he often seemed to be encouraging speculation only to express irritation later with those who did speculate.
 But it was unclear yesterday whether the Governor was simply trying to reinvigorate his national image or whether he had truly shifted his public position and was seriously considering the 1992 campaign.
 
Starting to Believe Him
 With five candidates already vying for the Democratic nomination, and with the first primary just four months away, even many of the Governor's supporters had finally started to believe his protestations that he had no plans to run.
 Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a friend of the Governor's, told reporters at a breakfast meeting on Thursday that he did not know whether Mr. Cuomo would run.
 But he added, "I take him at his word ---- that he has no plans to run and no plans to plan."
 In the last few weeks, as interest has shifted to the declared candidates, Mr. Cuomo has complained that news organizations have ignored his message about the economy and the state of the country because they are interested in him only as a potential presidential contender.
 Apparently to regain press attention, the Governor's aides have sent out mixed signals about Mr. Cuomo's intentions, much to the dismay of candidates already in the race. At a meeting in Los Angeles last month, John Marino, the chairman of New York's Democratic Party and a close associate of the Governor, told members of the Democratic National Committee that Mr. Cuomo had until November to get into the race. That remark set off a spate of rumors that Mr. Cuomo would run.
 Any hint that Mr. Cuomo may run is likely to make it more difficult for the declared candidates to muster money and supporters. Yesterday, some Democrats expressed irritation at Mr. Cuomo's shifting signals.
George Bruno, a Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire who supports the Presidential candidacy of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, said this afternoon: "You can't be the reluctant maiden for year after year and then expect to jump into the process in midstream. The time is really past when candidates should be thinking about whether to get in. The time is at hand to either do it or not do it."
 
'Wholly Different Attitude'
 Mr. Cuomo has been toying for so long with the idea of running for President that many of his supporters are inured to his circumlocutions on the subject. But several people who attended the breakfast at the Regency hotel, at Park Avenue and 61st Street, said they had been struck by the forcefulness with which Mr. Cuomo discussed his plans to explore a Presidential race.
 They said that the Governor had brought up the topic himself, and had said that it was time for him to make a decision about the 1992 race.
 "It was a wholly different attitude about running for the presidency," said Peter Tufo, chairman of the State Thruway Authority and a guest at the breakfast. "What really struck you, it sounded as though he was giving it serious consideration."
 Howard Rubenstein, a public relations executive who has been a major contributor to Mr. Cuomo's campaigns, said: "He said he would think over the next few weeks about what he would do concerning running for President. He also said he was leaning in the direction of not running, although listening to him you could get the sense that he was running."
 Word of the Governor's remarks at the breakfast, which was closed to the press, reached reporters almost immediately, and a flock of television cameras greeted Mr. Cuomo when he arrived at a midtown Manhattan event to promote volunteerism.
 The Governor maintained that he was shocked to learn that his remarks had created such a stir. He insisted that he had discussed the Presidential race only in response to questions at the breakfast -- an account contradicted by several people who were there -- and that he had said he would think about a race only to avoid disappointing his supporters.
 The question that remained was, just what was the point to all this? Some politicians speculated that Mr. Cuomo, irked by a perception that his profile had diminished, was trying to attract national attention and deflect attention from the problems at home in New York.
 But others suggested that the Governor remarks meant he was genuinely considering a race. The reason he did not want to say this publicly, they speculated, was that if he eventually chose not to run, he would then have to explain why publicly.
 "This is not just dithering," one adviser to the Governor said. "He's really torn."

HEADLINE: Consumer Sales Post Rise of 0.7%

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
After holding back in August, consumers spent a bit more freely in September but not enough to change the sluggish economic outlook.
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales -- which include everything from groceries and gas to autos and appliances -- rose last month by a total of seven-tenths of 1 percent. 
That was more than most economists had expected. Still, the report did not portray a strong or sustained pickup in spending, and, as such, did little to calm fears that the economic recovery could fade this fall.
 
Lack of Enthusiasm
 "These are status quo consumption numbers," said Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board.
 The September gain, which was largely accomplished by a jump in auto sales, merely made up for a drop of six-tenths of 1 percent in August. And, outside of cars, spending was practically flat, up only one-tenth of 1 percent. That reflected a mix of more spending on household furnishings, food and gas, and less on clothes and drugstore items.
 Coming in tandem with a report that showed weak prices at the wholesale level, the retail sales report did lift hopes that the Federal Reserve would soon push short-term interest rates lower. "This leaves the door wide open," said Ed McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. [Page 42.]
 The bond market welcomed yesterday's economic news, driving long-term rates down. [Page 44.]
 
Hints in Advance
 Yesterday's report had already been foreshadowed by earlier reports of disappointing sales at department stores and some improvement in car sales, in part because of stepped-up auto purchases by businesses.
 All in all, economists interpreted the latest sales reports as evidence that consumer spending had risen fairly solidly in the summer, but, at best, would rise much more modestly this fall.
 "The report doesn't end the drama: Will they spend or won't they?" said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence
 The first official look at the economy's overall performance in the third quarter will be reported on Oct. 29. Based on the last three months of retail sales data, most economists estimate that consumer spending rose at an annual rate of 3 percent to 4 percent in the summer quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent rate in the second quarter.
 In light of that, and given that consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy, these economists also estimate that the gross national product grew at a 2 to 3 percent rate in the third quarter. To be sure, inventories, which appeared to decline at a slower pace than in the spring, are a wild card in the G.N.P. estimate.
 Taking the July, August and September data together, retail sales were about 2 percent higher than the average for the second quarter. And spending on services, like rent and medical care, has been climbing at around a 3 percent annual rate, said Kurt Karl, an economist at the WEFA Group. Services account for about half of household budgets.
 
An Early Rebound Fades
 The trouble is that all of the third quarter's strength came at the beginning of the period and subsequently faded. Car and light-truck sales, for instance, which had dropped to a 10.7 million annual rate in the depths of the recession, had climbed back to around a 12.9 million rate by July, but improved only slightly in September. That left sales no higher than in July.
 "The consumer did come out of the closet in the spring," said Nicholas Perna, chief economist at the Connecticut National Bank. "The problem is that they ran straight into a jobless recovery."
 The economy has generated just 224,000 jobs since April. Many large companies as well as state and local governments continue to announce cost-cutting measures that include layoffs, and few executives expect the kind of rip-roaring job growth that followed the deep 1981-82 recession.
 "The growth in the economy has come mostly from rising productivity, not new jobs," Mr. Perna said.
 That has kept consumers who have held on to their jobs feeling anxious. Confidence surged in March after the Persian Gulf war ended but "has been moving sideways ever since," said Richard Curtin, director of the Consumer Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan.
 
Lacking the Cash
 And incomes, which have been inching up, have not recovered from the recession yet. On average, each American consumer lost about $450 in after-tax income in the recession and has recouped just $100 of that loss, according to David Kelly, an economist at Data Resources Inc. "The glass is just one-quarter full," he said.
 So far, consumers have been squeezing their savings, freeing up ready money by paying off debt, and benefiting from lower inflation. But spending cannot continue to climb much faster than income for long. So with job growth likely to stay anemic, Mr. Kelly said he expected consumer spending to rise at just a 2 percent rate in the fall.
 Yesterday's report from the Commerce Department is based on a survey of 3,000 retailers, compared with the 12,000 retailers who will be included in a final September sales report to be released a month from now. Revisions in monthly retail sales data, a senior official said, have averaged four-tenths of a percentage point during the last 12 months.

HEADLINE: ART;
From Quirky Little Gallery to Behemoth

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
To the art world, the name Getty usually means the acquisitive J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., whose high-profile purchases -- from ancient Greek sculptures to Van Gogh's "Irises" -- have made front-page headlines.
 But the museum is only one component -- albeit the most important one -- of the mighty J. Paul Getty Trust. Last year this $3.5 billion private foundation spent $149 million -- almost the entire budget of the National Endowment for the Arts -- on the museum and seven other programs, some of them hotly debated in their fields. 
 For all its ambitious reach, the nine-year-old trust has kept out of the public eye, its offices discreetly tucked away in anonymous-looking buildings around Los Angeles. But it will achieve a dramatic new presence in 1996 with the opening of the Getty Center, Richard Meier's cloisterlike campus in Brentwood, for which the model was unveiled last week.
 Though the trust still seems shadowy and remote compared to its glamorous offspring, its involvement with collecting, scholarship, education and conservation reflects the ideological wars of the art world, from multiculturalism to the split between curator-connoisseurs who view art in strictly esthetic terms and academics who see it in social and political contexts.
 Like any other spending colossus, the trust has provoked at least as many detractors as supplicants. Some complain of its Eurocentric bias and elitism, evidenced by the decision to disengage from heavily ethnic Los Angeles and place the new complex on an "acropolis" in the rarefied precincts of Brentwood. Others say that its largesse is still controlled by corporate standards of "success." And there are those, mainly in the museum field, who think that the Getty money should be funneled entirely to the museum, which could expand to take on all the programs.
 The Getty Center, the lavish architectural statement commissioned by the trust to bring the programs together, is obviously designed to give all of them -- including the museum -- equal prominence. But many people in the museum world feel that the programs are undeserving of the same monumental treatment accorded the museum, and have usurped space and money that should go to it.
 The key question is how well the trust is using its massive resources, a question that intensifies as the trust gains visibility.
 Harold M. Williams, president and chief executive officer of the trust, says the Getty's money frees it to undertake "creative, innovative projects," and to support ventures beyond the reach of most public and private institutions. Driven by these aims, the trust has created an arts-humanities study center, a conservation institute, a center for art education, a computerized battery of historical information, an art-on-film collaboration with the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a museum management institute. A grant program finances projects not initiated by the trust.
 The grant program, in fact, along with the conservation institute, are two of the Getty's best programs. The grant program is admired for its wide range and its skill at finding worthy projects, the conservation institute for its gung-ho attitude toward tough jobs and its willingness to take on new ones.
 The education program and the Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, on the other hand, are both in the thick of battles about the nature of art and how it should be taught. The center's critics accuse it of encouraging a babble of trendy ideas without establishing a clear direction. The education program has been attacked as being in thrall to a single formula that excludes other approaches.
 The trust that has hatched the programs is the only major foundation devoted entirely to the arts. Its enormous budget and its work force of 600 make it the behemoth of the country's 2,000 private foundations. Its spending habits are dictated by tax laws requiring that it use a minimum of 4.25 percent of its endowment for programs, with an additional three-quarter percent for outside grants.
 Such is the trust's power in the art world that it is almost impossible to escape its gravitational pull. "The difficulty in talking about the trust," said one museum official, who asked not to be named, "is that almost everyone has served on the Getty advisory committees or been a consultant -- a recipient of plane tickets, hotel suites, parties and so forth. In a way, we've all been bought."
 Such power was undreamed of -- as was the trust -- when J. Paul Getty died in 1976 and left an estate worth more than $1 billion to the quirky little gallery he had established in Malibu in 1953. Removed, shortly before his death, to a lavish reconstruction of a Herculaneum villa that he had built nearby, the gallery was still a rich man's treasury that was a long way from ripening into a public collection. But besides the museum, Getty's will mentioned a "library for the diffusion of artistic and general knowledge."
 Stunned by the fiscal Niagara, the trustees felt that it would swamp the small museum. Seizing on Getty's words, they approved a plan for a broader organization that would support scholarship, a library and other endeavors to enhance intellectual opportunities on the West Coast. It was the basis for the trust.
 
The Corporate Touch
 In 1981, the board named as head of the trust Mr. Williams, a brainy lawyer whose robust corporate career took a nonprofit turn when he became dean of the graduate school of management at U.C.L.A. and then chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He is credited with the agile engineering of the sale of the museum's stock in the Getty Oil Company, eventually to Texaco, that more than tripled the original $1.1 billion endowment.
 "When I came to the trust, I told my skeleton staff, 'I'm not interested in what you or I think should be done," said Mr. Williams during a recent interview in his sumptuously understated office in West Los Angeles. "Get out there and get a sense of the field. What can we do that might not otherwise happen?" Based partly on the answers he got, Mr. Williams developed the trust's programs.
 Some critics feel that his corporate background has shaped the way the trust functions. George Marcus, a cultural anthropologist teaching at Rice University who was a visiting scholar at the trust in 1988, wrote in the magazine Cultural Anthropology: "There is an obsession with evaluation and assessment, a constant judging of the operation. Elaborate consultation occurs before any move or decision is made." In an interview, he added, "There is a sense of Harold Williams as a manager rather than a leader with a farsighted vision."
 Mr. Williams replies: "This is a complex organization, and you can't have each of the programs going off on its own. Also, I do believe in holding people accountable, just as I hold myself accountable. It is not true at all that we think quantifiably; everything we do has to be judged qualitatively by what it is and what it does. If we're spending $149 million, we have to work hard at whether we're spending it in the best way."
 But the trust's effectiveness can only be measured in terms of how well its programs succeed, and predictably, the reviews are mixed.
 One program that is counted a success is the conservation institute. Now headed by Miguel Angel Corzo, an educator and a former official of the Mexican Government, the institute employs 84 people and last year had an operating budget of around $10 million. In and out of its laboratories, 20 scientists pursue some 30 research projects, including the problem of bacterial growth in Egyptian royal mummies; the weathering process of adobe, the effects of indoor pollution in museums, and the damage wrought by earthquakes.
 
A Taste for Showy Third-World Projects?
 The institute also sends its people to work on such immovable properties as the Great Sphinx at Giza, on whose back Getty scientists have installed a monitoring station to register environmental effects. As the largest private body with such a heroic agenda, the Getty conservation institute is unique in the field. Even this program has its naysayers, however, who complain that the Getty emphasizes research over practice and pursues showy third-world projects.
 "We are in the business of research and training, not a conservation service organization," said Mr. Corzo. "We work with others to help arrive at solutions. And to the extent we take on these so-called showy third-world projects, we do it because no one else does anything about them."
 Dealing in the less tangible realm of ideas is the Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, headed by Kurt Forster, a provocative Swiss-born architectural historian who believes that "a work of art is too important to be left to art historians.
 "We should do everything we can to bring as many diverse perspectives as possible," he said. To that end, the center invites up to 12 scholars for an academic year of residence, joined for shorter periods by visiting scholars. Their work covers many fields besides art history: musicology, cultural anthropology, film history, comparative literature, psychology. In 1990-91, topics ranged from contemporary European feminist art and film to the architectural theory of Quatremere de Quincy, the 18th-century French archeologist and critic. A library of more than 600,000 books and a photo archive of two million images are available, along with a vast collection of unpublished letters, manuscripts and the like.
 The center, more imbued with its director's personality than the other Getty programs, is a hotbed of theory, ideology and clashing views, which Dr. Forster sees as giving it "some of the quality and vitality of a genuine university setting." But some scholars say that of all the trust programs, the center is the most unfocused and incoherent, interested more in the turnover than the content of ideas.
 
Contradictory Agendas
 "The center doesn't quite know what it is yet," said James Marrow, an art historian at Princeton University, who has been on Getty committees and has worked at the art and humanities center. "Part of its problem is that it's trying to serve a lot of agendas -- not only traditional ones but those of the intellectual left wing of art history. There is a problem of establishing a clear-cut identity."
 Dr. Forster responds: "That we haven't established a clear-cut identity may be one of our greatest virtues. Instead of a monolith, the center is a marketplace of many ideas and views. We make every effort to kick open as many doors as possible."
 
Nitty-Gritty Accounting
 Some staff members and visiting scholars resent what they see as rigid economies and nitty-gritty accounting procedures at the center. "I felt very controlled the whole year I was there, yet there was an atmosphere of excess," said Mr. Marcus. "They don't understand what scholars do. They think we're parasitic, and inclined to take the organization for a ride, so we have to be watched." Yet, he added, "after all is said and done, no one else provides this kind of help and support for scholars, not even Princeton or Stanford."
 The Center for Education in the Arts finances the teaching of art to elementary-school children through a demanding approach called discipline-based art education. The method, which integrates the making of art in the classroom with art history, criticism and esthetics, has children in Getty-guided courses around the country discussing such things as positive and negative space in Picasso and Matisse. In making their own art, they are guided by historical and critical concepts.
 
'Reading' Works of Art
 "Discipline-based art education is providing an important alternative in teaching art to children," said Leilani Lattin Duke, director of the Getty's education program. "Change in education takes a long time, and we're amazed at how quickly it's captured the public imagination and teacher willingness to implement it."
 By entertaining other viewpoints, the center has begun to defuse criticism that the discipline-based method is too rigid and puts too much emphasis on "reading" works of art rather than allowing children to follow their own creative impulses.
 "Once you put critics, history and esthetics on an equal footing with art production, you make it into a verbal discipline," said Howard Gardner, professor of education at Harvard and co-director of Project Zero, an art education research center in Cambridge.
 "To support different approaches would be a more farsighted and flexible use of the funding than to endorse a method about which many have reservations." He said, however, that in the last few years, the Getty had made "good faith efforts to be more ecumenical."
 The important thing, as Mr. Williams sees it, is that the center has focused attention on the content of art education and raised the level of discussion and argument in the field. "That's at least half the battle," he said.
 
Competing Empires
 While still in its infancy, the trust has come a long way from the small museum that spawned it. For Harold Williams, getting the most for the Getty's money meant branching out into programs. "Part of the yeast of this place," he said, "is that it represents diverse points of view. There's a freedom in each of our activities that's very different from what it would be under the umbrella of the museum."
 But there are still those who say that the trust is dissipating its resources by not putting all its eggs -- its ambitious constellation of programs -- in one big basket, the museum. They point out that the great museums of this country -- the Metropolitan, the National Gallery, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston -- carry on all or most of the programs that the trust has set up as separate entities. By absorbing them, the Getty itself could become a truly great museum, they say.
 "The trust's whole assumption about the role of the museum is that it is a sleepy cupboard," said Edmund P. Pillsbury, director of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, who in the early 1980's turned down an offer to become director of the Getty. "But it can be a major research institution involved with a study center, publications, conservation and so forth. By creating independent agencies, the trust has made a whole series of competing empires, with problems of overlap, communication and different priorities. Their existence -- some with very outspoken points of view -- lowers the importance and role of the museum and gives the impression of a lack of effective leadership."
 But Mr. Williams counters: ""We'll continue to work toward building an outstanding museum, but given the magnitude of our resources, our responsibility was to do something more. Frankly, the trustees' feeling that we needed to go beyond a museum was what attracted me."
 As he envisioned the trust's new prominence in its grandiose quarters, Mr. Williams reflected on the Getty phenomenon: "We've grown faster than I expected and accomplished more. One of the real challenges we face is maintaining the ability to be self-critical."
 As government support for the arts dwindles, the Getty will be called upon to improve the art of spending its millions. There will no shortage of advice on how to do it.
 
 
 
FROM NEFERTARI TO DATABASES
 Besides the museum, the Getty Trust sponsors seven other programs. They are:
* The Grant Program. Designed to foster works of "exceptional merit" in the visual arts and humanities. Last year it supported projects ranging from a catalogue for a show of Chicano art to the conservation of Romanesque sculptures in a Hungarian cathedral.
* The Conservation Institute. Conducts art conservation projects around the world. A current project, in tandem with the Egyptian Government, is restoring wall paintings in the ancient tomb of Queen Nefertari.
* The Center for the History of Art and the Humanities. Furthers advanced research in the history of art through a scholar-in-residence program that emphasizes a cross-disciplinary approach intended to "rescue" art from art historians.
* The Center for Education in the Arts. Supports the teaching of art to children through a method known as discipline-based art education. In addition to making art, the children learn art history, criticism and esthetics.
* The Art History Information Program. Creates databases -- like a bilingual index of literature about Western art -- that give researchers computer access to a vast array of historical information.
* The Program for Art on Film. Attempts to improve the quality of film, video and television productions about art. A joint venture with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it has set up a computerized inventory of information on art films and videotapes, and in 1989 and 1990 sponsored a production laboratory for innovative film and video projects.
* The Museum Management Institute. Provides a four-week course at the University of California at Berkeley to train museum professionals in leadership, management and business skills.
 
 
HIDDEN COSTS?
 The price of translating the long-planned Getty Center into brick and mortar, which officials now estimate at $360 million in "direct construction costs," has been a hot topic among Getty watchers. Speculation places the cost at between $500 million and $1 billion, which Getty officials dismiss as exaggeration. Not included in the $360 million estimate are costs for land acquisition, bonds, architectural fees and site preparation.
The crumbly hill that holds the center's 124-acre site has required extensive -- and expensive -- preparation. Even the freeway adjacent to the museum's parking garage has had to be buttressed with concrete.
To pay for the center, said Franklin D. Murphy, an influential Getty board member, a portion of the Getty's endowment was set aside several years ago and invested in high-yield securities. Earnings were plowed back into that segregated portion, which Mr. Murphy said has "grown substantially."
Mr. Murphy balked when figures higher than $500 million for the total cost were broached. "Those are beyond my ken," he said.
Asked if the Getty Trust's programs, including the museum's acquisitions budget, had been cut back to accommodate the building project, Mr. Murphy conceded that budgets had been "tightened up a bit," although he insisted that it was not because of the building program. The Getty had been spending too freely, he said. "We were shoveling the money out. The curators feel squeezed, but the museum's acquisitions budget is in excess of any other in the world. I've never seen a major picture come along that the Getty didn't go after."

HEADLINE: Private Schools Turn to Reconstruction

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
AFTER two years of living like academic nomads, the students and teachers of Nightingale-Bamford, a private girls' school on Manhattan's Upper East Side, are home again.
When the 1991-92 school year began last month, they returned to their 62-year-old, Georgian-styled schoolhouse at 20 East 92d Street after a $22 million expansion and renovation of the building. While the work was going on they held classes and ate lunch in 17 neighboring schools, churches, synagogues and community centers. 
 "We were trying to meet educational needs of the 20th and 21st century with a building from the 1920's and having a harder and harder time doing it," said Ann McChord, director of administration for the school, which has 475 students from kindergarten through grade 12. "To make the kinds of improvements we wanted, we had to leave the building. The work could not go on around us."
Nightingale-Bamford is not alone in its decision to put students and staff through the agonies of a reconstruction. By a rough count, New York City's private, or independent schools, as they prefer to be called, are spending more than $75 million on ongoing and recently completed improvement projects.
The Spence School, at 22 East 91st Street, spent $7.2 million on its expansion and upgrading and the Chapin School, at 100 East End Avenue, at 84th Street, spent $8 million. The Dalton School, which owns several buildings on the Upper East Side, this month began a campaign to raise $27 million for a new gymnasium and other capital improvements.
On the West Side, the Calhoun School three years ago bought a building at 160 West 74th Street from the defunct Baldwin League School and then put $7 million into renovating the building for its preschool, kindergarten and first grade.
In the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, the Berkeley Carroll School expects to complete in January a $5 million renovation and expansion of its upper and middle school building on Lincoln Place.
All this construction activity has put the schools in the improbable role of real estate developers. Administrators, trustees and parent volunteers have found themselves struggling with zoning and planning issues, pleading their cases before community boards and working with architects, contractors and construction companies to see the projects through to completion. With a few exceptions the schools are not creating new space to expand enrollment, nor are they anticipating a rush of applicants. Rather, they are upgrading to meet the changing needs of their students and putting money into more sophisticated science laboratories, expanded room for computer studies, new gymnasiums, larger cafeterias and libraries and more spacious and comfortable work areas for teachers.
Competition for students plays a major role in the decision to modernize.
"The main point, of course," said Dr. Gardner Dunnan, headmaster of the Dalton School, "is to improve educational programs. But schools also want to be sure that their science, math and computer programs are up to the other institutions." He said that in analyzing its strengths and weaknesses, Dalton had found it was not as strong in math and science as in the humanities.
Mildred Berendsen, headmistress of the Chapin School, said that the improvements in the girls schools are one way that they can reaffirm their commitment to science, math and physical education studies for young women.
"They have always been important," she said, "but they demand special spaces. When you create those spaces you are making a statement about the content of the education you provide and the environment for students and teachers."
In the last few years, several independent schools in New York City have closed or merged. This unsettling trend has even prestigious and generously endowed schools looking over their shoulders.
"We are not anticipating a major expansion of the applicant pool," said Frederick Calder, director of the New York State Association of Independent Schools, half of whose 138 member schools are in New York City.
"New York City will hold its own," he said. "But we are not looking for the kind of growth we saw in the 60's and 70's, largely because the students are not there."
Brooklyn is an exception, Mr. Calder said. In that borough, independent school enrollment is still increasing.
What makes these ambitious rebuilding plans all the more challenging is that the money to pay for them must come, for the most part, from parents and alumni. Moreover, they are being undertaken at a time when the schools are coping with not only a shrinking pool of potential applicants but also rising operating costs and a faltering national and local economy that is straining the budgets of some parents. Annual tuition ranges from about $9,000 to $11,000.
Still, many schools have no other choice.
By the time construction started at Nightingale-Bamford, space was so tight that hallways had been pressed into service for computer study and for book storage from an overflowing library. Lunch was starting at 10:30 A.M. so that everyone in the school could be fed, and the auditorium was doing double duty as a gymnasium.
Nightingale-Bamford students and teachers returned last month to find a schoolhouse twice as big as it had been -- almost 100,000 square feet, instead of 50,000. Now air-conditioned, the building has new science labs, a new skylit cafeteria, a new auditorium with foldaway seating for 300 people and a two-story library with homey touches like cushioned window seats.
"We built a completely new building inside the old skin," said Jack L. Gordon, who served as the project's architect. "It was one of the most complicated projects ever attempted in a landmark district."
EXPANSION included a 22-foot addition to the west of the existing building. The new space was added on an adjacent site that held two row houses the school had bought in 1978 in anticipation of the construction project. Another component of the reconstruction was the excavation beyond the depth of the original basement for the addition of the auditorium.
From planning to completion, the Nightingale-Bamford project spanned more than a decade. Part of the time was eaten up as the school sought, but was ultimately denied, a zoning variance that would have let it add four stories to the original structure. In a compromise move, only two stories were added.
"It was quite a struggle,' said Joan McMenamin, the school's headmistress since 1971. "But it was more than worth it. We found that our parents were tireless in their efforts to see this project through, and the generosity of our neighboring institutions was remarkable."
While the schoolhouse was rebuilt, lower-school classes were held in the Park Avenue Synagogue and the middle- and upper-school students studied at Temple Emanu-el. The Spence and Browning schools opened their cafeterias to Nightingale-Bamford students and Chapin offered the use of its labs for chemistry and biology classes.
Some students took physical education classes at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church or the Murphy Center for Sports and Arts while others used the gymnasium at the 92d Street Y.M.H.A.
Although admissions officials at Nightingale-Bamford had no school to show off to prospective parents for more than two years, Mrs. McChord, the director of administration, said applications did not drop.
IN the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, work is nearing completion on a $5 million renovation and expansion of the Berkeley Carroll middle and upper school at 181 Lincoln Place. Its lower school is in two buildings on Carroll Street -- the pre-school and kindergarten -- at 712 the elementary school across the street at 701.
Dr. Bongsoon Zubay, headmistress of the co-educational school, said Berkeley Carroll has seen a steady increase in enrollment, from 487 in 1982 to 647 in the current academic year.
Two years ago portions of the main building and a one-story wing were remodeled and upgraded. But most of the capital improvement budget is evident in the 17,500-square-foot, five-story red brick addition.
It is being built in the courtyard between the main building, which dates to the 1890's, and the free-standing gymnasium, built in 1936.
"The main purpose of the new building," said Bruce Fowle, a partner in Fox & Fowle, the architectural firm that designed the new building, "is to provide more space. But a side benefit is that the addition will hide a rather unattractive one-story structure that had to be built rather quickly in the late 70's. It gave the school urgently needed expansion space but did nothing to enhance the campus or neighborhood."
The addition, which will be connected on all floors to the existing schoolhouse, follows its neo-classic brick and limestone design.
Primarily for the upper school students, it will have classrooms, art studios, administrative offices and a basement commons where lockers, now squeezed into corridors, will be put.
Once the building has been opened, further work will include expansion of the library and learning center in the main building.
Most of the city's independent schools are in old buildings, some of them in renovated town houses or mansions. Many are in residential neighborhoods where there is virtually no space for expansion and zoning and landmark laws limit the size and design of new construction. A particularly complicated fit for these schools are the new physical education facilities that figure prominently in most of the improvement plans.
The Dalton School made its way to much larger gymnasium space by teaming up with a private developer. The school is taking four floors in a new residential building now under construction on East 87th Street and Third Avenue. Dalton is currently negotiating to buy its space in the new building.
The new 22-story condominium where Dalton's 30,000-square-foot physical education facility will be is three and a half blocks from its 89th Street building. The school's enrolment of 1,255 pupils makes it one of the largest independent schools in the city. Some students have physical education classes in a gymnasium in the 89th Street building and others travel by bus to a gym on 94th Street.
Dalton's new gymnasium was made possible in part because Norman H. Segal, the developer of the residential building, agreed to major design changes. The school facilities, designed by Fox & Fowle, will have two gymnasiums -- one with a 570-seat mezzanine -- a wrestling room, a training room with sports therapy equipment and a multi-purpose room with video projection equipment and movable partitions.
John Ciardullo, a Manhattan architect, designed the condominium building.
The new facility will free almost 8,000 square feet in the Dalton building on 89th Street. Dr. Dunnan said that classrooms and laboratory space have been planned.
LAST year, Dalton bought 63 East 91st Street, a town house adjacent to its lower school building. For the time being it will be used for office and conference space. But David Helpern, an architect, is working on a new interior design in anticipation of its conversion for classroom use.
The hurdles the independent schools have faced on their way to better buildings have been financial as well as logistical.
"The independent school that embarks on an improvement program has to be scrupulous in its financial planning," said Dr. Dunnan, who also is president of the New York State Association of Independent Schools. "You don't want to be stuck in a plan that will have to depend on tuition increases or for which you have not budgeted the extra costs for operating the added space."
In a pioneering move, Nightingale-Bamford became the first independent school in the city to take advantage of tax-exempt bond financing to cover its construction costs. A 1986 change in the state law provided an avenue for non-profit civic organizations and institutions to use this type of lower-cost financing. The bonds, arranged through the New York City Industrial Development Agency, gave the school a loan with an interest rate of 6.75 percent plus 1.25 points for its letter of credit to National Westminister Bank. The 30-year term will allow the school to repay the loan through fund-raising campaigns, not tuition increases.
The Calhoun School on the West side, and the Day School, which has buildings on East 90th Street, as well as West 88th and 89th Streets, have followed Nightingale-Bamford's lead. Both schools closed bond financing deals with the Industrial Development Agency recently. Dr. Zubay, headmistress of Berkeley Carroll, said the school's board is considering applying for the tax-exempt bond program.
But other schools, like Dalton, Chapin and Spence, have avoided taking on debt by raising money before construction starts. The $8 million spent to expand and renovate at Chapin was raised from parents and alumnae. The work, completed in 1990 and designed by the architectural firm of Buttrick White Burtis, of New York, gave the school a new gymnasium, six new science labs, a new dance studio, new faculty workrooms and a lounge and improved computer space.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The Zuccotti Role;
Looking Beyond Downtown's Downturn

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A MAN who builds a reputation on both the public and private sides of the fence does not spend his time sitting on it. John E. Zuccotti is no fence-sitter.
"The principal problem doing business in New York City is cost -- taxes and other costs," says the 54-year-old former First Deputy Mayor and City Planning Commission chairman, who became president of Olympia & York (U.S.A.) in January 1990. 
 "And transportation," he puts in as an afterthought. "I don't hear complaints about the availability of housing."
Mr. Zuccotti has a new platform for these observations, the chairmanship of a public-private planning venture known as the Lower Manhattan Project. It is an offshoot of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, which he also chairs. With staff support from the Department of City Planning and a director paid by the association -- Con Howe, who was the planning agency's executive director until he left in February -- the Lower Manhattan Project intends to recommend long-term improvements for Manhattan south of Chambers Street.
The recommendations will presumably dovetail with the thoughts of the department itself, which intends to come forth in a year with the first comprehensive plan for Lower Manhattan since the McHarg report of 1966. That consultant study was big on the need for housing downtown, and much has come. But "how much and where" are still issues, says Richard L. Schaffer, the chairman.
Mr. Zuccotti was central to the planning and taxation policies that helped lift New York City from the real-estate slump that accompanied the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's. Are similar policies appropriate now?
At the depth of that recession, Mr. Zuccotti pushed for the steep tax abatement for the Commodore Hotel next to Grand Central Terminal that set the stage for its reconstruction by Donald Trump and Hyatt Hotels Corporation as the Grand Hyatt Hotel. In real-estate circles this was considered the beginning of the turnaround in the hard-hit east midtown office market.
He also supported the use of the J-51 tax abatement program to recycle unmarketable loft buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn into housing. When the market later improved, that program was cut back.
Now "we are in the almost dead center of a major down-cycle in commercial and residential markets," he says. "The frailty of city and state finances and the condition of the major financial institutions exacerbate the real estate cycle."
FOR the so-called Class C office buildings downtown, Mr. Zuccotti says, a comeback as competitive office space will be difficult. It should be possible in selected areas to make their conversion into housing possible by offering the tax abatements that would ease the way to financing for the expensive reconstructions required. That would help shrink the office vacancy rate and give the buildings a better chance for constructive use, he thinks.
Also needed, Mr. Zuccotti says, is something similar to the five-year cap on real-estate taxes brought into effect in 1975, which paved the way for the real-estate comeback of 1979. It takes three or four years to work, he says, and it should focus on existing tenants. For major tenants renewing a lease, there should be a way of providing significant tax abatements, so that New York City can stay competitive in the region. The object is to help dissuade major tenants from moving out of New York.
When John Zuccotti left city government in 1977 he was ending two years as First Deputy Mayor to Abraham D. Beame. Mr. Beame was considering running for another term as Mayor at the time. Mr. Zuccotti, widely considered a possible candidate himself, would not oppose him. "I was not prepared to run for Mayor against a man I greatly respect and admire," he said.
He joined Peter Tufo, a law-school roommate, in law practice and came to represent many of the most active developers in New York City. To the firm -- later merged into Brown & Wood -- came many developer-initiated zoning actions or requests for special permits, and no small number of lawyers who had served in government.
NOW when he walks the streets of the city, "I have more continuity in my head," he says, adding: "I'm a walking history, 1970 to 1991. Every building is a memory -- a chuckle or a pain."
The general remark comes more easily than the specific recollection. But what arouses the greatest sense of frustration and failure, he said, has been the city's inability to get construction started on a new West Side highway. The planning for it began in 1969 and was pursued through three mayoral administrations.
He might chuckle with satisfaction over the success of the World Financial Center, Olympia & York's six-million-square-foot venture at Battery Park City. He represented the Toronto-based company in obtaining all the land-use approvals it needed for the project. The office development galvanized the previously languishing residential component of Battery Park City.
Olympia & York entered the New York scene in 1977 with the purchase of the Manhattan office buildings developed by Percy and Harold Uris. Now the company owns 15 million square feet in Lower Manhattan, part of the 26 million square feet it controls across the country. Its downtown properties are experiencing a 9.8 percent vacancy rate, Mr. Zuccotti said. The figure includes two-thirds of the space at 60 Broad Street, which Drexel Burnham once occupied.
The total Lower Manhattan inventory of primary office space is 108 million square feet, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the leasing firm, and 17.1 percent of it is available for leasing. The inventory of secondary space is 28.8 million square feet and 23.7 percent of it is available, the firm says.
FOR comfort, New Yorkers can look at Los Angeles. "Los Angeles will experience a real-estate recession far worse than New York's," Mr. Zuccotti said. He himself, when looking west, concentrates on San Francisco. There Olympia & York is developing the office component of the large-scale mixed-use Yerba Buena project. And in New York the company hopes to start reconstructing 320 Park Avenue, the former ITT building, at 50th Street across the avenue from St. Bartholomew's Church, late next spring.
The transportation-improvements side of the Zuccotti prescription was addressed by Mr. Howe. He sees opportunities to improve the subway entrances south of Chambers Street (there are 108 of them) and to constructively reuse the deteroriated city-owned East River waterfront properties from the South Street Seaport to the heliport at the foot of Wall Street.
Mr. Howe, like Mr. Schaffer of the Planning Commission, thinks New York should do more for tourists downtown and can improve its parks and public spaces. He also says the Staten Island ferry terminal needs to be rebuilt as an important civic space. That was to happen as part of a mixed-use development planned by William Zeckendorf and partners. The weak market unhorsed it, but then a devastating fire at the existing terminal last month made reconstruction planning an immediate necessity.
The planners are also keen on increasing the residential population south of Chambers Street. It already numbers 15,000, including the 7,000 people at Battery Park City. The residential clusters are typically near parks or the water. The structures that lend themselves best to residential conversion are slim and tall, without the excessive unlit inside space found on broad floors, Mr. Howe says.
The co-op owners who have already arrived are likely to be a new voice in conversion policy. Richard Landman, president of the Lower Manhattan Homeowners Association, with a membership of 60 co-ops, noted that conversions and state law had worked together to saddle owners of J-51 co-ops with extraordinary property taxes once the benefits ran out.
"Sponsors put the tax savings in their pockets and got a big mortgage and the city dumped a high assessment on the building," he said.
As Mr. Zuccotti sees it, the current downturn is part of the cyclical pattern of change that Lower Manhattan has experienced since World War II.
"There is still an opportunity for growth by the foreign financial institutions," he says. "In the eyes of Europeans, New York City is still the capital." But an upturn in jobs, no one denies, is the best curative medicine.

HEADLINE: Private Schools Wrestling With Diversity and Identities

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
THE most recent entries on the valedictorian plaque at the Pingry School in Martinsville would probably surprise John Francis Pingry, a Presbyterian minister who founded the school in 1861 for the sons of wealthy Elizabeth business leaders. The names Schmulewitz, Cheng, Friedland and Sachs have a distinctly different ring from the patrician surnames of those who attended his school back then.
The changes in Pingry's student body are not only reflected in academic achievement: This year's school president is Korean, as were the co-captains of last year's football team. There is the Afro-American Scholars' Society and the Asian Awareness Society. The halls are filled with students from different racial, ethnic, religious and economic backgrounds. 
 Motivated not only by survival instincts, but also by the belief that diversity strengthens education, Pingry and other New Jersey independent schools are enrolling students from different backgrounds in record numbers. Once perceived as homogeneous citadels for the priviledged, they are promoting their multiculturalism and aggressively courting new students to broaden their cultural composition. Along the way, they are reshaping curriculums, rethinking decadelong traditions and trying to balance diversity with preserving their identities.
"It's a very tricky situation," said Arlene Gibson, head of the Kent Place School, a girls' day school in Summit. "You don't want to toss out the traditions that bring tears to alumni's eyes. At the same time you need to be sensitive of who is here."
The transition has not always been smooth. When Jewish students wanted to light a menorah next to the yule candle at Pingry's annual Christmas concert last year, which coincided with a night of Hanukkah, school officials decided to remove the menorah and yule candle at the last minute and substitue a peace candle.. Kent Place convened meetings last year to work out racial tension among black and white seniors. At Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, students are divided along economic lines, school officials say.
The problems these three schools are confronting are ones that many school officials say they have seen. Next month, 200 New Jersey private school administrators, trustees and parents are to attend a symposium sponsored by the Parents Association of New Jersey Independent Schools at the Peck School in Morristown to pool perspectives on a number of issues regarding cultural diversity. One of the topics to be discussed is how to recruit minority faculty members and trustees, a pursuit the schools have found particularly frustrating.
Just how much New Jersey independent schools have changed is unclear. New Jersey and New York independent schools had a minority enrollment of 17.4 percent last year, up from 12.8 percent in 1981-82, according to the National Association of Independent Schools.
While New Jersey independent school admissions directors say they recently have seen a great change in the makeup of their enrollments, many acknowledge they do not know the best way to measure exactly how diverse they are.
"Our school is struggling to define diversity," said Peter Davies, director of admissions at Dwight-Englewood, which is often cited as a model multicultural school. "If someone is of mixed parentage or has lived here for some time, how do you classify him? We're trying to do a much more accurate assessment of who we are so we can celebrate that, design our curriculum and just know who we are."
Dwight-Englewood estimates its minority population has jumped to 30 percent from 18 percent 6 years ago, largely because of an increase in Korean students and, to a lesser extent, Indians and Pakistanis. The school promotes its diversity as one of its greatest assets and has restructured its curriculum to emphasize that.
For a week each spring, students can attend more than 20 presentations highlighting various cultures. The school's ninth-grade medieval history course was recently dropped for one that focuses on the early civilizations of India, China and Japan. This year 15 teachers from different disciplines are taking time off to integrate the study of Islam into the curriculum.
"We really broadcast quite loudly that this is a diverse place," Mr. Davies said. "It's so diverse, I don't think any one group can say they're in the majority."
 
Designer vs. Denim Jeans
 While there is general harmony among different cultural groups at Dwight-Englewood, school officials concede that students are often divided along economic lines. A dress code dropped in 1985 that allowed designer jeans but barred less expensive blue denims became a symbol of economic favoritism. Now students can wear whatever they want as long as it is "clean, neat and not offensive," said Gene Wojtyla, a spokeswoman for the school.
"That has helped a lot in terms of making kids feel comfortable economically on campus," she said. "But there is still a feeling between the haves and the have nots, like who gets a parking space on campus, what you drive and where you go on vacation."
To heal that rift, Dwight-Englewood, which has been working to shake its reputation as the school on the hill for rich kids, has begun requiring an ethics course and community service. The scholarship fund has also been increased, but because individual grants have been increased, there are fewer students on scholarship than four years ago.
For years, many schools had unstated admissions practices that excluded certain religious groups, especially Jews, a practice that has all but been abandoned today. Still, religious tensions remain. At Pingry, where chapel was a part of school life until the 1970's, a student committee is weighing the possibility of making the school's annual Christmas concert, with its heavy Christian emphasis, more inclusive.
"The music is overly religious, I feel, to the point that it makes me feel uncomfortable from a Jewish perspective," said Emily Goldberg, a senior on the committee who has sung in the concert for four years. "I don't know how people from other religions feel, but I assume it is probably equally uncomfortable for them."
John Hanly, headmaster of Pingry, said the decision to remove the menorah and yule candle at last year's concernt stemmed from "discussions about the nature of religious symbols" that occurred shortly before the concert was to begin.
"Because we were under the gun in terms of time, rather than create a situation that would be offensive to anyone, we decided to replace the yule candle and the menorah was a single white peace candle," he said.
After anti-Semitic graffiti was scrawled over the face of a Jewish student in a class photograph last year and several other incidents pointing to strained relations among various student factions, Pingry's Awareness Society, a student club that brings issues it deems important to students' attention, decided to devote itself to the subject of intolerance this year.Earlier this month, the society's president, Andrew Goldstein, began a series of assemblies and workshops that had been planned on the subject with a speech that received a standing ovation.
"There is intolerance at Pingry," he said. "Thgere is racism, there is prejudice, there are majorities who feel included and there are minorities who feel left out. And it is the responsibility of all of us to end this intolerance, to make the Pingry community a true community."
Some schools got off to a rocky start in the fall when they scheduled their first day of classes on the second day of Rosh ha-Shanah. At Gill-St. Bernard's School in Gladstone, which closed for one day of Rosh ha-Shanah but remained open on Yom Kippur, administrators have decided to close for both holidays in the future. Roughly 35 percent of the students were absent this year.
"It was fairly clear to us that attendance was low enough on the day we were open that we weren't getting much accomplished anyway," said Christine Cox, headmistress of the school.
More schools have been closing for major Jewish holidays in the past few years, said Dr. Daniel Kahn, executive director of the 59-member New Jersey Association of Independent Schools, but he added that that might not have to do with any significant demographic shift.
"I don't think there are more Jewish students," he said. "I think there is more vocalization. Jewish families have been in independent schools for a while now, and they may be more comfortable in articulating their needs."
Allan Strand, headmaster of the Newark Academy in Livingston, found he angered many people several years ago when he tried to make the annual holiday concert more secular after receiving criticism about the religious music and decorations. The school then tried a different approach.
"We decided that instead of trying to sanitize everything, we would be very open, thorough and forthcoming about the Jewish and Christian traditions," he said. "I told all our parents and kids that it's part of learning about each other's traditions. It's been wonderful since then."
 
The Role of Financial Aid
 Dr. Strand said the most dramatic change at the academy since his arrival in 1979 has been the increase in Asian students.
"Five years ago, the Asian population became larger than the black and it seems to get larger each year," he said, noting that the school is now 26 percent minority, including 8 percent Asian.
Dr. Strand said that while demographics have had a lot do with the makeup of his school, scholarships and financial aid have also played a large role in maintaining diversity. William E. Simon, an alumnus, recently pledged $2 million for a minority scholarship program that is to support up to 25 students a year by 1994. The academy also provides free bus transportation for students from Newark, operates a Saturday program for high-achieving inner-city students and opens its doors to gifted minority students during the summer.
Students and administrators at Newark Academy say that blacks and whites mingle easily. When only two students signed up for the Black Awareness Club this year, the club was informally disbanded.
"I like that, because that's my sense of the way the kids connect here," Dr. Strand said. "It's not Eden, but it's a very comfortable environment for different types of kids."
The transition for black students has been a bit bumpier at Kent Place, where the minority enrollment jumped from 6 percent three years ago to 14 percent now, mostly because of the enrollment of more black students. Last year, the senior class was divided over whether a minor argument between a black student and a white student over whether personal property should be left in the lounge was racially motivated.
"We looked at the dynamic that was going on there -- that two kids of different races couldn't have an argument without everyone jumping in and taking sides -- and decided there was something to be learned from this," said Mrs. Gibson of Kent Place.
In meetings and an overnight stay at the school, the class raised questions about race and ethnicity that Mrs. Gibson said "should have been dealt with a long time ago."
The school then began a major study of its curriculum to examine how it handles issues of ethnicity, religion, sex and class, and made some changes.
"If you define racial tension as being that which allows people to grow and address issues, then there has been some racial tension," Mrs. Gibson said, "but it's been a very positive force."

HEADLINE: In Singapore, a Search for a Second Act

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
Koh Boon Hwee is the kind of young executive Singapore would love to clone. Still a teen-ager when this island city-state was cast off from neighboring Malaysia, which distrusted its ethnic Chinese elite, he was educated in England and the United States and ran the Hewlett-Packard Company's giant manufacturing operations here upon his return, persuading the computer maker to develop new products for Asia using a potent mix of Singaporean engineers and American technology.
He cultivated Singapore's strong-willed leadership and its legions of industrial planners, who have left nothing to chance in building one of Asia's most incredible economic success stories. In the 1980's, he learned to cut deals with the Japanese, who with lightening speed have supplanted Americans as the region's most important investors. And a year-and-a-half ago, Mr. Koh fullfilled his Government's dreams, returning to the fold as head of Singapore Telecom, the state-owned and surprisingly dynamic telecommunications company. 
 If Singapore has a major problem today, its leaders say, it is that native talent like Mr. Koh, who is 41 years old, is scarce, as are the engineers and programmers, the corporate strategists and budding industrialists who will fulfill the country's goal of becoming the highest-tech nation in Southeast Asia. Twenty-six years after the country declared its independence, the fiber-optic cables are all laid, the skyscrapers are built, the computers are buzzing. But the days of hyperactive growth are over. The country's brilliant but autocratic Prime Minister of 31 years, Lee Kuan Yew, stepped aside a year ago, clearing the way for a new Singapore generation. The question now is whether that new generation can come up with a second act.
Having relied on cheap labor and some of the world's most finely honed economic incentives to shape itself into an island of other nations' multinational corporations, Singapore is now struggling to become an economic power in its own right. Its Western-trained planners, people like Mr. Koh who run the nation's cadre of state-owned enterprises, have embarked on an ambitious program to invest not only in Singapore, but also in technologies abroad. They are spreading Singapore's management techniques through Asia, funding venture start-ups in everything from chip-making to biotechnology, and prowling the world for good ideas to bring home.
 
An Asian 'Growth Triangle'
 With halting success, they are also turning to their quickly developing neighbors, Malaysia and Indonesia, to create a "growth triangle." Indonesia and Malaysia would supply labor and raw materials to this multi-lingual manufacturing hub while the people of Singapore contributed the brains and the organization, and kept the most profitable manufacturing processes on their island. Every morning, Malaysian workers pour over the causeway that connects Johor state to Singapore, while boats loaded with circuit boards ply the waters between Indonesia's nearby islands and Singapore's huge port.
Still, it is far from clear whether this nation, which has always prospered by its wits, will be able to muster the critical mass and the depth of talent to become the engine of Southeast Asia. Wages have soared, making the island less attractive than some of its neighbors. And multinational corporations, the bedrock of Singapore's success, are increasingly turning to up-and-coming economies for their next round of investments. Some have already moved operations out of Singapore. And Japanese money, important in an era when American companies seem to be disappearing from the Asian scene, is also headed elsewhere.
"It is not a popular view, but I do not think Singapore is ready to go out on its own," said Mr. Koh, one of the growing ranks of Singapore's business leaders willing at times to differ from the Government's perpetually rosy outlook. "The days of plentiful, reasonably priced labor here is a thing of the past. To upgrade our level of technology, and our command of technological processes, we need far more talent than we have available. We still have to learn how to develop products on our own. And to market them. I don't know how ready we are for that transition."
For its part, the Government clearly worries that its population may simply be too small and underskilled. The country now has a very Singaporean "procreation incentive," a tax break on second and third children intended largely for the well-educated Chinese majority, who make up 70 percent of the population. The new Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong, talks of a more "refined and compassionate" society that allows "people to behave more as adults," part of an effort to lure overseas Singaporeans back home. Starting a few months ago, it was even possible to see "R"-rated movies here -- or at least films the Government determines aren't too racy.
That Singapore should be experiencing growing pains at all seems remarkable, given the speed at which the country has overtaken its neighbors. Since 1965, its economy has averaged 9 percent growth a year. Per capita domestic income has soared tenfold, to more than $9,000 a year. Malaysia's, by comparison, still hovers at around $1,800. For years Singapore has been the world's largest producer of disk drives for small computers and has been such a key "swing" refiner that for a few months during the war in the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia was actually importing gasoline from here.
But many fear the magic is beginning to wear off. Growth is slowing rapidly, as is manufacturing investment, partly because wage rates have risen by double digits for three years running.
"There is a limit," says Friedrich Wu, the head of economic research at the Development Bank of Singapore, which is taking the lead in the strategy to invest internationally by financing many of the acquisitions. "The country has only so much ability to absorb new manufacturers and provide the labor and the land. Only 6 percent of the population is university educated. So there are a lot of questions to be resolved."
 
Emulating Japan
 Singapore is hardly alone in facing these problems. They echo throughout the "Four Dragons," the name attached to the world's fastest-growing economies in the 1980's: Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. The four were lumped together as the region's "newly industrialized economies" amid a lot of loose talk that they would soon replicate the success of postwar Japan, a goal that always seemed a bit overambitious. Now, none of the four is so new anymore, and growth rates, while still impressive, are not likely to see the pace of the 1980's return.
Each of the nations faces its own distinctive economic problems. South Korea is trying to contain burgeoning inflation, periodic labor strikes and growing trade friction with the United States, which is no longer willing to overlook its closed markets. Taiwan has been in a crisis of confidence since its market plunged, and it is uncertain how quickly it can capitalize on the reopening of economic ties with the People's Republic.
And then there is Hong Kong, convulsed in successive waves of optimism and terror over the prospect of China's takeover of the British colony in 1997. Hong Kong's crisis, in fact, is Singapore's opportunity: It is already wooing banks, investment houses and manufacturers to move their Pacific headquarters here, and it is waiving its usual sharp limits on immigration for Hong Kong professionals.
Whatever their unique problems, the dragons are all paying the price of quick wealth and quick growth: Workers have learned to expect an ever-increasing standard of living and steady demands for much higher wages have wiped out the chief advantage against Japan. And while each of the four talk about taking the next step -- toward achieving Japanese levels of automation and productivity -- few have the capital or the skilled work force to make that transition quickly.
Japan is not making it any easier. The dragons, once seen by Tokyo as struggling cousins, are now regarded as headlong competitors. The Japanese were never generous with technology, but have begun to cut off the flow, many Asians complain. "The Japanese are very, very reluctant these days to license anything of real value," Lee Hun Jo, a top executive of the Goldstar Corporation, the giant Korean consumer electronics company, said this spring. "Sometimes we feel like they are choking us."
Of the four dragons Singapore is the smallest. But it is also the most carefully planned, the most centrally controlled, the most politically stable, and the most adept at dealing with the Western multinationals, which have accounted for 90 percent of its manufacturing investment. As a result, the way it navigates its economic problems over the next few years will get more than its share of attention in Asia. "We are under a microscope," Lee Kuan Yew's son, Lee Hsien Loong, who is now Deputy Prime Minister, said early this year. "So we try not to make too many mistakes."
 
Colonial Heritage
 From the time it was founded in 1819, Singapore was born to commerce. Its location at the tip of peninsular Malaysia made it a natural port, and the days of rubber, tin and spices live on in the vivid literature about the lives of the colonial administrators and the "planters," British managers shipped out to Malaysia to keep the plantations running, who tried to create a Western oasis in the Asian jungle.
But modern Singapore was built largely by men like Lee Kuan Yew who spent their youth in the anti-colonialist movement, and who so dominated the political scene that they had a free hand to turn the country into the ultimate bureaucratic state, but one virtually devoid of corruption and dissent. Mr. Lee rebuilt the country, replacing the old row houses down by the piers with giant office towers and building one of Asia's largest petroleum refineries just off shore and, in the 1980's, an eerily accurate replica of Silicon Valley minutes from downtown. The gleeming airport, now vastly expanded, is widely agreed to be one of the world's most efficient.
At once charismatic and fiercely argumentative, Mr. Lee offered foreign investors a degree of freedom over their own operations that would have made the Japanese, the Koreans and the Taiwanese bristle, fearing that their own industries would be stifled. American companies loved it: Exxon and DuPont, Mobil and Hewlett-Packard all moved in.
"You have to remember that in the 1960's we were a trading nation with high employment and the prospect of more unemployment," said Lee Suan Hiang, the director of industry development at Singapore's powerful Economic Development Board. "Given the choice between developing local indigenous industry and going international, the choice was clear: go for the ready market and the ready technology."
But for foreigners, Singapore is no longer the manufacturing heaven it was in the 70's and 80's. In its relentless drive to become higher-tech, the Government has withdrawn the economic incentives to perform labor-intensive, low-technology manufacturing, rewarding automation, product development and engineering instead. To get a tax break and a spot in an industrial park today, companies must prove they are bringing in technology Singapore needs.
Some companies have changed with Singapore: General Electric moved from making radios to making aviation equipment. But because the Government has not solved the problem of the chronic shortage of well-trained talent, many other companies are balking at the thought of big capital expenditures in new plants. A recent survey of American firms showed that some are voting with their feet: disk drive makers are moving subassembly work to Malaysia and Thailand. Even the Japanese, who began outinvesting the United States in Singapore in 1986, have begun to turn elsewhere, pouring money into industrial parks outside Bangkok and factories in Indonesia.
And they have company: the Government of Singapore.
Much of the savings Singaporeans have been forced to set aside are invested in equity markets overseas, giving the country foreign reserves of about $28 billion. And over the last three years or so, the Singapore Government has led a direct-investment campaign abroad, putting at least $1.5 billion so far into foreign business ventures that promise a return of technology as well as profits.
Like everything in Singapore, it is precisely focused: Information technology, automation and biotechnology, three growth areas that Singapore's planners think can flourish on the island. Earlier this year the Government disclosed that it invested nearly $500 million in a New Zealand conglomerate, Brierly Investments. At Singapore Telecom, Mr. Koh has taken a $27 million stake in a Thai computer company and it is building a nationwide paging and data communications system for the country. The biggest single Singapore investment in the United States belongs to Singapore Airlines, which took a small equity stake in Delta Air Lines as part of a deal in which the two are linking routes.
 
A Legacy of Mistrust
 One of the many benefits sought from the overseas investments, Singaporeans say, is to avoid overdependence on the one power that looms over the Pacific: Japan. Few here forget that this winter will not only be the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, but the 50th anniversary of Japan's invasion of Malaysia, which culminated in a brutal sweep into Singapore. Those who were not massacred were imprisoned at the site of the current airport.
Singapore still woos Japanese investors, but Mr. Lee has made no secret of his distrust for the Japanese state. And so many Singaporeans, Mr. Koh included, worry about what they see as the flight of American capital from the region.
"In all of the countries in Southeast Asia the Japanese are by far the biggest investors, outstripping everyone," he says. "It is not something these countries have a choice in. If the choice is slower economic growth or more Japanese investment, they will go for the investment. And they will deal with the political cost later."
The Government says the next challenge is to establish a research and development base. There are efforts to start up more university programs, but it is with a very pragmatic air. "It doesn't matter if you have inventions galore," says Lee Suan Hiang of the Economic Development Board. "We have to pick carefully, because we can't afford to get carried away with blue sky, basic research. But then again, this has always been a very practical country."
 
 
CONTROLLING THE AUTO IN SINGAPORE FASHION
 Singapore has a nightmare, and it is Bangkok.
In the Thai capital, industrialization has proceeded at such a frenzied pace that the downtown streets are terminally gridlocked. Business executives decline to make more than two or three appointments a day. Police wear masks to protect themselves from auto exhaust. For the meeting of the Finance Ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations this week, Thailand declared a holiday so the ministers can move around the city without choking.
Clearly, such chaos and carbon monoxide would not do in pristine Singapore, the city made for business. So the Government has attacked congestion as it does most problems: with economic incentives and disincentives so severe that no one can ignore them. That is why Singapore is one of the world's most expensive places to buy a car.
Buying a car in Singapore is not just a simple matter of visiting the city's auto dealers. Starting a year ago, potential owners were required to enter a lottery to win a chance to buy one. The buying rights are not cheap, running upwards of $7,000 or $8,000 a car. Because so many applicants fail to win, a black market in buying rights has developed.
But that is just the beginning. The registration tax is 150 percent of the purchase price. The import duty is an additional 45 percent. So a $50,000 Mercedes-Benz -- this is, after all, a city of image-conscious entrepreneurs -- can cost as much as $110,000 or more.
And car owners may not be able to drive downtown. During rush hour, they must buy a pass to enter the "Restricted Zone." Parking tickets are severe, although not as severe as in Tokyo, where illegal overnight parking can cost $1,400.
Then again, Singapore isn't that big -- about 250 square miles -- and the subway is bright, shiny, automated and cheap.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
At the S.E.C., Another Move For Secrecy

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Globalization is the new Holy Grail at the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, 58 years after the Securities Act of 1933 made disclosure the cornerstone of American securities regulation, it is gradually being undone by the body charged with enforcing it.
The latest assault on the public's right to know what is happening in the securities markets came last week as the commission made it possible to trade stocks on Nasdaq from 3:30 A.M. to 9 A.M., New York time. That is prime trading time in Europe. 
 If it were only a matter of time, there would be no objections here. But to compete with London's secretive system, the S.E.C. agreed that there would be no disclosure of trading information during the session, and very limited information afterward. Information about actual trades, the S.E.C. says, is none of your business.
The S.E.C. also sanctions secrecy in the so-called Rule 144A market, in which institutions trade securities issued by companies that find it too bothersome to comply with America's normal financial disclosure rules. Once again, the justification is that if this country does not seek out the lowest possible common denominator, it might lose business to foreign markets.
It is odd to see the S.E.C. choosing this moment to allow shades to be pulled down over what goes on in markets. The Treasury bond trading scandal might not have happened, and certainly would have been easier to detect and police, had that market not been so opaque. Now the reformers are looking for ways to open it up.
The winners of such a closed system are, inevitably, the brokers with superior knowledge about what is really happening. The losers, just as surely, are brokers who are not members of the inner circle -- and the customers. Those customers may take their business elsewhere, but their options are limited. They must trade where the liquidity -- that is, the other trading -- already is, and that is likely to be the place favored by the brokers.
The desire for globalization does correspond to a trend among investors. They are not hostile to most American securities, but last week the bond market rally looked shaky, and evidence of economic recovery is mixed. In that atmosphere, overseas opportunities seem more attractive. Banks are rushing to make unsecured loans to Kuwait, and individual investors are pouring money into the new Argentina Fund.
It is conceivable that the S.E.C.'s efforts will bring in a bit more business for American brokers and trading systems, even as investors lose needed information. Some trading will be siphoned from other, more open, American markets, and perhaps they will demand to be allowed to keep secrets to stay competitive. In the current S.E.C. atmosphere, a meek assent is likely.
Eventually, the S.E.C. may regret the steps it is now taking. It is to be hoped that the markets will not have been irreparably harmed in the meantime.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Putting the Best Face on Nordstrom's Problems

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
Nordstrom Inc., the fast-growing retailer best known for its high standards of customer service, pushes its sales force always to be bright and cheery. So it was not surprising when James Nordstrom, one of the four co-chairmen of the Seattle-based company, was upbeat last week even after the chain shocked Wall Street with the news that it expects flat profits and a decline in sales for the quarter ending Oct. 31.
"I feel we are running our company today as well as we ever have," Mr. Nordstrom told an industry conference in Vancouver. "We are still making money. But our customers don't feel good right now and it's having an effect on our business. It's just something we will have to work our way through." 
 Wall Street was not feeling quite so sanguine. Nordstrom's shares fell $8.50, to $33.75, in over-the-counter trading on Wednesday, the day after the earnings estimate was released. Several analysts had been predicting that the chain would post a gain for the quarter, building on growth in the second quarter. During that period, same-store sales increased 3.5 percent, paced by a strong July. The stock closed Friday at $37, compared to its 52-week high of $53.
The weak outlook for Nordstrom dragged down other retail stocks as well, as analysts and investors concluded that consumers remain wary about the economy and their personal finances.
Indeed, concerns about a weak Christmas selling season grew late last week with reports from many of the nation's largest retailers that business in September was even weaker than predicted.
The poor results were spread throughout the industry, from discount chains like K Mart to upscale merchants like Nordstrom. Two exceptions: Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer, posted a sales gain of 32 percent, and sales at the Gap were up 41 percent. Overall, though, September sales rose only 1 percent compared with September 1990, as measured by an index of 22 leading retailers prepared by Merrill Lynch.
The downturn at Nordstrom poses a challenge to the four members of the family who run the company as a group: James Nordstrom; his brother, John; their cousin Bruce Nordstrom, and John A. McMillan, a Nordstrom brother-in-law. The company has been expanding rapidly from its base on the West Coast into the Middle West and the East, including New Jersey. It will open its 67th store later this month, in Maryland outside Washington.
The company plans to open three stores next year, down from four this year.
James Nordstrom said the chain had frozen salaries of senior managers earlier this year. But he said the company would not slash prices to bring shoppers in, and he pledged not to allow any erosion in customer-service standards.

COMPANIES
 
A New Market for the Baby Bells 

Last week Judge Harold H. Greene, at the prodding of a Federal appeals court, overturned the ban barring local telephone companies from selling information electronically. The ruling was contested by publishers afraid that the companies would raise phone rates to subsidize their information business. To blunt the ruling, Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, introduced a bill allowing the companies to sell information only where there is competition. Not to worry, the Baby Bells say. The Federal Communications Commission forbids them to sell information unless they set up separate companies. But the main obstacle to their dominating the information market may come from the companies themselves. "These guys come out of a heavily regulated environment," said Joel D. Gross, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "The don't really know what consumers are willing to pay for."
 
A Rash of Scandals Spreads . . .
 
Perhaps it is sunspots, which are at a seven-year high. Or maybe it's just human nature. But scandals in the financial community continue to proliferate. Last week, the American Express Company said it was investigating whether its executives falsified records to conceal defaults on the company's Optima credit card. News of the investigation comes a week after Amex said it was setting aside $265 million in reserves and write-offs on its credit card operations. "There were clearly instances where internal credit policies weren't followed properly, and we are conducting an extensive review," the company said in a statement last week. The firm said $24 million in defaults had been improperly reported for three quarters because of accounting problems.

. . . and Spreads Some More
 
Merrill Lynch & Company has rarely been accused of anything worse than extravagance. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it was investigating whether Merrill had engaged in trades that helped a Florida Insurance firm, Transmark USA Inc., disguise its deteriorating financial condition. The S.E.C. is investigating trades from 1984 to 1988 between Merrill and one of Transmark's subsidiaries. In the transactions, Merrill sold hundreds of millions of dollars of Government securities to the subsidiary. Almost at the same time, Merrill bought junk bonds of equal an amount from the insurer. This asset swap could have made Transmark's books look better than they should have looked. For Merrill, the deal may have allowed it to conceal which securities it owned. Merrill denies any wrongdoing.

Forget Pearl Harbor?
 
A lot of advertising agencies would rather forget Dec. 7, 1941. At least the ones that hawk Japanese goods. This year -- the 50th anniversay of the bombing of Pearl Harbor -- the television networks and many magazines are planning special coverage of the event. That has the agencies pacing the halls. Last week, an internal memo from one agency -- Bozell Inc. -- hit the streets. It regarded Bozell's Minolta account. "It is imperative for Minolta not to advertise in any issue containing editorials related to this event," the memo read. "I'm sure you understand the gravity of this matter." Other agencies are doing the same.
 
A New AIDS Treatment
 
It was a small victory in a long fight. Last week, the Federal Health and Human Services Department announced it would approve a new drug, called dideoxyinosine, for the treatment of AIDS. DDI, as the drug is called, is the first anti-viral medication approved since AZT won approval in 1986. Though it helps AIDS patients, DDI is not a cure. So far, 106,000 have died of AIDS; 182,000 Americans have the disease, and about 1 million have tested positive for the HIV virus. The dismal statistics sadly point out that DDI, which is made by the Brisol-Myers Squibb, is poised for strong sales. According to Samuel D. Isaly of Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Research, DDI should bring in revenues of about $100 million a year for its maker.

The Unsinkable Potamkin
 
For decades, Victor Potamkin was Cadillac's top salesman -- his dealership in Manhattan sold 6,000 cars a year -- but he did not have, well, Cadillac style. He was a brash discounter. When he sold out to Roger Penske, Cadillac was pleased. Mr. Penske brought potted plants into the showroom. But Mr. Penske closed down in May. Last week, Cadillac said it was bringing back the 80-year-old Mr. Potamkin to run the dealership. With Cadillac's sales 20 percent behind last year's, substance matters more than style.
 
A Deal Between Apple and Sony?
 
A week after Apple Computer and the International Business Machines Corporation signed a deal, John Sculley, Apple's chairman, turned up in Tokyo for talks with Norio Ohga, president of the Sony Corporation. The whispers in the corridors were that the two men were cooking up a deal. After all, Sony already makes many of the components Apple uses in its computers. Is that the case? "I can't talk about it." Mr. Sculley said.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Japanese Aid for the Soviets
 
Japan has been reluctant to grant aid to the Soviet Union, or what is left of it. But last week the government changed its mind and announced a complicated $2.5 billion aid package designed to get Japanese products into Soviet hands. The aid consists of $1.8 billion to ensure that the Soviet Union pays for its Japanese imports, along with $200 million in credits it can use to buy Japanese products. The remaining $500 million is for food and medical goods. The package is another triumph for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has kept money flowing into the Soviet Union despite objections from the donors that it still has no credible reform plan.
 
Easy Credit Terms for Kuwait
 
To raise money to rebuild the country, Kuwait said last week it would borrow $5 billion over a five-year period in the private capital markets -- the largest loan ever requested by a country. Kuwait's Ministry of Finance appoointed J.P. Morgan & Company to stitch together a deal involving dozens of banks from around the world. Analysts think Kuwait, which has plenty of oil, will get good terms. It will be able to borrow at half a percentage point above the London interbank offered rate, now 6 percent. The loan will be unsecured. But considering the way Kuwait's friends came to its aid once before, the banks don't think that is a problem.

Tokyo Bares Its Teeth at Nomura
 
At first it looked as if Japan's Ministry of Finance would let Nomura Securities Company off easy. Nomura admitted to a number of misdeeds, including manipulating stock prices in a deal with the late Susumu Ishii, a top Japanese gangster. But last week the Ministry bared its teeth, ordering Nomura to close more than half of its domestic branches for a month and shut down several other key departments. The Ministry's show of strength comes days before American officials go to Tokyo to discussopening up Japan's financial markets to more American firms.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Baby Steps To Spur the Economy
 
President Bush seems to be honoring history. Americans are pocketbook voters, and incumbents -- even popular ones -- lose during recessions. So last week, with bank lending down 8 percent from last year and growth creeping along, Mr. Bush tried to tackle the economy. He announced steps that he said would curb the credit crunch and ensure that banks lend. The proposals allow banks to value real estate more liberally and give them a way to complain about the auditors. But these proposals are no Desert Storm. "Banks have slowed down lending in response to sluggishness; they did not cause the sluggishness," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York. The proposals "really won't do anything," he said.

Retail's Disappointing Rebound
 
In this economy, consumers are the motivating force. If they spend, the economy will toot along. But according to the Commerce Department, September's 0.7 rise in retail sales was due to fleet-autombiles sales, and the rest of the sector was weak. Merrill Lynch & Company's index of retailers showed a 1 percent gain from last year, when the recession began. "Disappointing and below expectations," said Jeffery Feiner an analyst at the firm.
 
Growth Is Low, But So Are Prices
 
Optimistic economists see at least one benefit from an economy that bounces along at a sub-par rate of growth. If companies cannot sell goods, they usually do not raise prices. Last week, according to the Labor Department, that rule proved true. Producer prices for September rose barely at all -- a slim 0.1 percent. Producer prices have fallen this year by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent annual rate. That is the best showing since 1986 -- but for all the wrong reasons.

A Cash-and-Carry Bailout Bill
 
Congress relishes tussling with the Bush Administration over money. So last week, when the Administration asked the House Banking subcommittee for $80 billion more for the savings and loan industry, it got a yes, but with one large string attached. Congress added a pay-as-you-go amendment to the funding bill. Rather than allow the Government to borrow the money as it has in the past, the amendment would force the Administration to pay for the bailout by either raising taxes or slicing spending. While borrowing defers the pain, taxing people hurts immediately. So the Administration would rather put the bailout on its tab. Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson, who took the case to Congress, said he was "deeply disappointed by the actions of the committee and wants to get it corrected." If the bill reaches the President's desk with the amendment attached, Mr. Robson will recommend a veto.

HEADLINE: All About/Car Engines;
A New Consumer Passion for What's Under the Hood

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
As the new model year begins, auto makers are touting their engines as never before to consumers, who are increasingly savvy about power plants. Car buyers are concerned not only about horsepower and cylinder displacement, but also about fuel economy, emissions, technology and performance. They know their engines.
"It's really amazing how many people do their homework," said Frank Ward, president of MOR-PACE, a consumer research firm in Farmington Hills, Mich. 
 But different drivers also want different technologies. Some customers want gas-stingy three-cylinder engines, like the 1.0-liter engine in the Geo Metro. Others long for the power of a 5.7-liter V-8 in the new Cheverolet Corvette. "We want the right engine for the right product at the right price," said Donald L. Miles, chief engineer for the General Motors Corporation's 3300 and 3800 V-6 engines.
Car makers compete hard to win bragging rights to technological firsts. But missteps can be costly. Developing a new engine and the factory in which to build it can cost $750 million or more, according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, a Detroit-based trade group. G.M., for example, is investing the time of 400 engineers to develop and refine its family of automobile engines.
But new technology comes with trade-offs. As a result, auto makers are proceeding more carefully than ever before to develop new products.
 
The Auto Holy Grail
A Car That 'Torques' And 'Twists' Well
 Most car engines on the road today can be divided into two categories: "torquers" and "twisters." The terms, coined by Mr. Miles, describe the feel and performance of two different, widely used types of engines. Each engine has its advantages and limitations.
Torquers are engines that use pushrods to open and close the engine's intake and exhaust valves. This engine design provides maximum power, acceleration and torque at lower engine speeds.
But because pushrod engines have just two valves to control the flow of fuel and air through each of the engine's cylinders, they have trouble maintaining power and efficiency at higher engine speeds.
By comparison, twisters generally use more complex technology with four valves per cylinder and an overhead camshaft. This configuration enables engines to breathe more fully and maintain their power at higher engine speeds. But twisters do not have as much power at low engine speeds as torquers. They are slower than torquers from a standing start and more expensive to make.
Auto makers say drivers now want engines to have the attributes of both types of power plant. "If you can do the best of those, you've really got a winner for the customer," said Mr. Miles.
Car makers are rushing to develop that winner. Cadillac will introduce a new four-valve V-8 engine, called the Northstar, in next year's Allante, Eldorado and Seville models. The Northstar will have four valvesper cylinder, like a twister. But its sheer size -- probably in the 5-liter range -- will give it a lot of low-end power, like a torquer.
Other auto makers are also adding torque to their four-valve twisters. Mazda achieves the effect by changing the speed of the air moving into the six cylinders of the 1.8 liter engine in its new MX-3 coupe. At low revolutions, air is drawn through gates to create a fast-moving, pulsating stream. When mixed with fuel, the air fires more fully and provides more power and torque at low revolutions. At higher revolutions, the engine works so quickly that the air needs less massaging for peak efficiency.
 
More for Less
Taming Emissions For Fuel Efficiency

Besides increasing power at all engine speeds, auto makers are pursuing goals of fuel efficiency and cost-effective design.
Fuel-efficient engine technology has won recognition for Japanese auto makers such as the Honda Motor Company. The car maker recently unveiled a VTEC-E engine for its new Civic that uses a complicated system of valves to adjust the mixture of air and fuel going into the cylinder. More gas is added at lower speeds to boost power, but is reduced as the car reaches cruising speeds. This "lean-burn" engine, which analysts say improves efficiency by 10 to 25 percent, is not without its problems. Increased nitrogen oxide emissions prohibit Honda from offering the engine in California.
Engineers are also pursuing efficiency in production. Ford has invested $700 million to retool a former tractor factory in Romeo, Mich., to build different versions of the same basic engine on one assembly line. By using more common parts, the company can make different "modular" engines with two or four valves per cylinder, with various displacements and from blocks of iron or aluminum.
 
Refining the Basics
Different Strokes For Different Folks
 Engine designers tinker mostly with refinements to the traditional engine invented in 1876 by the German engineer Nikolaus Otto. It is powered with explosions created by sparking a mixture of gasoline and air which moves through the combustion chamber in each cylinder. The basic engine is called a four-stroke engine because each piston must move up and down twice to complete a cycle. A cycle includes the intake of fuel, an explosion and the expulsion of the exhaust gases. But engineers are researching changes to some of those basic engine ingredients.
If the technology could be perfected, lightweight two-stroke engines have the potential to transform the auto industry. The benefits of a two-stroke engine are power on every piston stroke, lighter weight and fewer parts. "The incentives of achieving it are so dramatic that everyone is working on it like crazy," said David E. Cole, director of the University of Michigan's automotive transportation program. But questions remain for the technology, including its long-term reliability, fuel efficiency and ability to pass emissions tests. Still, many auto makers have purchased development licenses from Orbital Engine Corporation, an Australian company that developed a two-stroke engine.
Car companies are also changing the fuel itself, are testing a host of different fuels, including methanol, propane, ethanol, natural gas and hydrogen. Experts predict that variety of fuels will be used in about 5 to 7 percent of vehicles by the year 2000.
By the end of the decade, many cars will not be using internal combustion engines at all. California law requires that 2 percent of new cars sold in 1998 have no emissions.
Many car makers are stepping up to the challenge of developing a workable, cost-effective battery system for cars. G.M. intends to put its electric car, the Impact, into production in the mid-90's. Nissan announced this summer that it had developed an electric car that can be fully recharged in 15 minutes. It must still clear many technical hurdles. Nissan and other auto makers say they are committed to finding solutions to avoid being shut out of the California car market.
 
THE ESTHETICS OF THE ENGINE
 Like car bodies, engines are designed to appeal to visual tastes. "Every engineer knows that this is one demand," said Thomas Gubitz, a spokesman for BMW, which highlights its engines in many of its advertisements for its new models.
Audi changes the designs of its engines for different customers. Its new V-6 was designed to be "esthetically pleasing but not intimidating" with a gaggle of lines or high-profile manifolds, said an Audi spokesman. Its V-8, on the other hand, is built to appeal to a more performance-minded customer, and its shape is more dramatic.
Auto makers also have worked to clean up the engine compartment itself. As engines grew more complex in the early 80's, creating a busier look under the hood, executives at the General Motors Corporation handed down a directive to clean up the engine's layout. The company rerouted wires and hoses and shifted components.
But David E. Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Automotive Transportation Program, said consumers should not be deceived by the simple look of some engines when they open the hood, as much of the wiring has been hidden from view.
"If you look under the engine, it looks like a bowl of spaghetti," he said.

Alternates as the C.D.'s Go Sour

SERIES: First of two articles on yields.

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
More than $150 billion invested in certificates of deposit are coming due this month, and many holders of these certificates are looking for new homes for their money. The reason: yields on C.D.'s and other short-term investments like money market funds have dropped.
As of Oct. 1, one-year C.D.'s were yielding just 5.66 percent on average, according to Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor in North Palm Beach, Fla. 
 The interest rates that banks could pay were deregulated in October 1983, and because C.D.'s are sold mostly in six-month and full-year units, October remains the biggest month for C.D. rollovers. Rates are now at their lowest level since deregulation, and a recent survey by Gallup and Fidelity Investments found that fewer than one-third of the investors with certificates coming due were committed to reinvesting in C.D.'s.
One easy alternative to C.D.'s is money market funds, but their yields are even lower. The seven-day compound yield for taxable money funds was 5.29 percent as of Oct. 1, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report in Holliston, Mass.
New Yorkers and investors in other high-tax states can do better with United States Treasury money market funds, where earnings are exempt from state and local taxes. The Dreyfus 100 Percent U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund was yielding 5.80 percent before taxes. This generally produces an after-tax yield of 6.39 percent for California investors and 6.61 percent for New York City investors.
Anything else involves more risk than C.D. or money fund investors are accustomed to. "To get more yield, you have to take more risk," said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research group in Chicago.
Investors can minimize credit risk -- the risk that issuers will not repay interest or principal -- by staying with high-quality bond funds. Even so, going longer than the 90-day maximum permitted for money funds exposes investors to interest rate risk. Investors in foreign bond funds also assume currency rate risk.
One way to minimize the overall level of portfolio risk is to mix the various types of risk, Mr. Phillips suggested. That said, what are investors' choices among high-yielding mutual funds? The following are suggestions, with discussions of the risk each entails.
* Short- and intermediate-term bond funds. Unlike C.D.'s or money market funds, bond funds can lose value if interest rates rise. So while the yield looks good, the total return -- yield plus changes in principal -- may not. In the long term, it is total return that counts.
To decrease risk, choose funds with shorter maturities. Short-term bond funds invest in securities maturing in one to five years. Among short-term government funds, Mr. Phillips recommends 20th Century U.S. Government, with a yield of 6.95 percent and a total return of 10.89 percent in 1991 through Sept. 30. On the corporate side, he likes T. Rowe Price Short-Term Bond Fund (yield, 7.17; total return, 10.05 percent).
Intermediate-term funds invest in securities maturing in five to 10 years, so yields are slightly higher. Mr. Phillips likes the Benham Treasury Note Fund (yield, 7.07 percent; total return, 12.97 percent) and the Fidelity Intermediate Bond Fund (yield, 7.64 percent; total return 13.29 percent).
* Mortgage funds. There are two basic types: adjustable-rate mortgage funds and Ginnie Mae funds. The adjustable-rate funds were developed to compensate for the volatility of the fixed-rate Ginnie Mae funds, whose prices move around to compensate for shifts in market interest rates.
The tradeoff: monthly dividends fluctuate more than they would with a standard Ginnie Mae fund. And the funds' yields drop when interest rates fall, as the borrowers' rates are adjusted downward. When rates rise, the funds lag because rates on the underlying mortgages are not adjusted immediately.
In both adjustable-rate and Ginnie Mae funds, when mortgages are prepaid the money is reinvested at lower rates, cutting the funds' yields. Mr. Phillips recommends the Franklin Adjustable U.S. Government Securities Fund (yield, 8.63 percent; total return, 9.59 percent) and the Vanguard G.N.M.A. Portfolio Fund (yield, 8.26 percent; total return, 16.67 percent.)
* Short-term global income funds. These funds take advantage of foreign interest rates that are higher than United States rates. To minimize credit risk, they hold government securities and high-quality short-term corporate paper. To control currency risk, they rely on sophisticated hedging techniques. For investors who want to go this route, Alliance Short-Term Multi-Market Trust class A (yield 9.95 percent; total return 10.64 percent) is Mr. Phillips's choice.
Next week: High-yielding stock funds.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
The Ginnie Mae Rate Puzzle

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
Today's falling interest rates are good news for bondholders because lower rates mean higher bond prices. For investors in Ginnie Mae funds, which hold issues of the Government National Mortgage Association, the story is more complicated.
Lower interest rates prompt homeowners to refinance their mortgages. When mortgages are prepaid, the money flows to the funds to be reinvested, but the rates now in effect pull down the fund's yield. 
 For most investors, the real story is total return -- yield plus principal changes. By this measure, G.N.M.A. funds have outpaced Treasury bond funds in each of the past seven years except 1986, when interest rates were also falling. But for investors who rely on yields to cover living expenses, lower dividends may be a high price to pay for an increase in their G.N.M.A. fund shares, said Stephen A. Schoepke, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services.

HEADLINE: Managing;
The Parables of Corporate Culture

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
STEWART J. LEONARD JR., president of Stew Leonard's, the Norwalk, Conn., food store known for its customer service, loves to tell employees the tuna fish story. It goes something like this:
"I unwrap one of our tuna sandwiches, and this package of mayonnaise rolls out. I figure, the sandwich has enough mayo already. So I call Bill Hollis, my deli manager, and tell him, get rid of the extra mayo, it's expensive. 
 "So next week, I open a sandwich, the Hellman's pops out again. I call Bill again, and he says, you gotta talk to Mary Ekstrand, she makes the sandwiches. I call Mary, who says, 'Sorry, Stew, the customers want the extra mayo, so I'm packing it again.' You know my reaction? Bravo, Mary!"
No one is likely to option that story's movie rights. But it sure serves Mr. Leonard's purposes. It shows him as an involved manager who tests products, questions procedures and cares about costs, but cares about satisfying customers and empowering workers even more. And it praises Bill and Mary for recognizing those priorities.
"Making employees giggle with a story is a better way to teach them something than reciting a list of rules," Mr. Leonard said.
Storytelling, an art generally associated with parents, standup comics and anthropologists, is emerging as a hot management tool. Numerous business professors and consultants, including fad master Tom Peters, are touting it in classes and workshops. The Journal of Organizational Change Management devoted its entire summer issue to storytelling as a way of diagnosing an existing culture or promulgating a new one.
"The best way to pass on a company's cultural themes is by telling stories," said David M. Boje, editor of the journal and an associate professor of management at Loyola Marymount University.
Added C. Warren Neel, dean of the University of Tennessee's College of Business: "A good company uses its oral legacy to embellish its history and focus its aspirations."
That certainly describes how David Armstrong, vice president of Armstrong International Inc., uses stories. The industrial equipment manufacturer, based in Stuart, Fla., doesn't even have a policy manual. But it has stories galore -- bound in books, hanging on bulletin boards, framed on office walls. Each is one page long, each was told by an employee to Mr. Armstrong, who wrote them up.
There's the one about the man who had bypass surgery and alerted the company to hospital overcharges. There's the one about how road congestion problems dating back 20 years led to a policy of letting office workers break for lunch five minutes ahead of factory workers. There's the one about how the controller of a new division came up with travel expense rules that let employees mirror their at-home life styles on the road.
"People remember stories and their morals a lot better than they remember written policies," said Mr. Armstrong, whose book, "Managing by Storying Around," is slated to appear in bookstores in March.
At the Saturn Corporation, the General Motors subsidiary in Spring Hill, Tenn., the assumption is that people remember what they see even better than what they hear or read. Saturn's communications people regularly videotape employees telling stories about customer service, teamwork and the like. They compile the tapes into a news show format and circulate them throughout the company every week.
Recent stories included tales of an engineer who helped an irate customer, of an employee's wife who helped teen-agers feel comfortable in new schools, of a dealer who handled a recall by inviting all his customers in for a barbecue while his mechanics fixed their cars.
"We use these stories to reinforce what we want Saturn to stand for," said Richard G. LeFauve, Saturn's president.
Since Saturn is only six years old, it is still in the culture-setting stage. At older companies, managers often elicit stories from their staffs to find out if their behavior is running afoul of their employee's expectations.
"If your people still talk about how you avoided layoffs in the last recession, you can bet they are unprepared for layoffs this time around," said Alan Wilkins, a business professor at Brigham Young University. "And if they talk about the abrasiveness of a dead plant manager as though he were still here, you've got an employee relations problem."
Of course, employee's stories need not presage problems; they can also solve them.
Frederick Nichols, a manager of organizational effectiveness at the Xerox Corporation, uses stories employees tell him about successful projects they worked on in the past to assign them to project teams.
"We like to match people who think success comes from all-nighters with those who relate it to technology," he said. "They'll bring different ideas to the project."
 
 
 
SHORT AND TO THE POINT
 Stories can be an excellent vehicle for comparing different cultures.
Robert F. Dennehy, a management professor at Pace University, has his students interview people from different countries and cultures, write up their stories -- complete with quotes -- and read them to the class. Lately, he's been asking them to compare and contrast corporate stories, too.
Here's one of his favorite story pairs:
"At I.B.M., people talk about the time legendary boss Thomas Watson Jr. forgot his name tag, was barred from the building by a security guard, and praised the man for his conscientiousness. Revlon people tell how Charles Revson fired a guard who did not recognize him without his identification.
"I.B.M.'s story shows a culture that respects rules; Revlon's story shows one that respects power."

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE: William & Mary;
Rules Tightened In Effort to Limit Student Drinking

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va.

 BODY:
The College of William & Mary has tightened its regulations about alcohol consumption to stem what the college's administration, local hospital officials and national fraternity chapters have increasingly depicted as student drinking that is out of control.
Kegs and other large containers of alcohol are now banned from fraternity houses and other residence halls, except during large-scale events like homecomings. Fraternities and other campus organizations must provide separate drinking areas, called beer gardens, at all events where alcohol is served. 
 Last fall, officials at Williamsburg Community Hospital told the college the number of severely intoxicated students needing treatment for alcohol poisoning and accidents sustained while drunk was increasing, said Kenneth E. Smith, associate vice president for student affairs. The college concluded that underage students had too easy access to large amounts of alcohol, he said, and students and administrators on the alcohol policy review committee proposed the regulations. The college president, Paul Verkuil, approved the regulations over the summer.
"There were not many campuses with as liberal procedures as ours were," Mr. Smith said. "Most people kind of felt it was inevitable for this to come."
 
Targeting Fraternities
 He said that national fraternities have pressured individual chapters nationwide to limit access to alcohol. Insurance companies, which charge fraternities rates comparable to those for stunt men and race car drivers, have threatened to stop providing coverage because of the rising number of personal-injury suits involving alcohol-related incidents at fraternity parties.
The need to curb student alcohol use was underscored by the highly publicized drug arrests of students at the University of Virginia last spring and by Gov. L. Douglas Wilder's formation of a substance abuse task force to examine problems at the state's colleges, Mr. Smith said.
The new policy has received mixed reviews from members of the 14 recognized fraternities at William & Mary. About 40 percent of the estimated 6,500 undergraduates at William & Mary are involved in the Greek-letter fraternity system. Unlike many other colleges and universities, most of the institution's fraternity parties are open to students who are not members.
Fraternity leaders have been charged with the primary responsibility for enforcing the new policy. Each house must designate its own drinking areas and check guests' identification, Mr. Smith said.
 
Some 'Negative Feelings'
 Stephen Welty, a senior who serves as president of Sigma Chi fraternity, said that many students resent having designated drinking areas and feel the college does not trust them to act responsibly. "The general student body was harboring negative feelings when this policy was set down," Mr. Welty, a senior economics major from San Diego, said. "They don't understand how the college thought this could work out."
W. Samuel Sadler, vice president for student affairs, said the policies are less Draconian than some of the ideas discussed by the Governor's task force over the summer, including making all Virginia campuses alcohol free.
"We have an obligation as a community to make certain people are engaging in safe practices," Mr. Sadler said. The ban on kegs, he said, is an important step in reducing the amount of alcohol students drink because, "When people have a keg, they drink until it's empty."
Fraternities now buy beer in cans, he said, which can be stored between social functions.
But John Marcoux, a senior in computer science from Rockville Centre, L.I., who serves as president of the Council for Fraternity Affairs, said the keg ban has created new problems. "Kegs did offer more control," Mr. Marcoux, a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said. "The chances of liquor and flasks being brought in are now much greater."
Many students say they fear tighter regulations will move the college's social center out of the fraternities and off campus. "When it's off campus, more people will be drinking and driving," Mr. Marcoux said. "If anybody's going to throw a party, the fraternities are the ones best prepared to do it."
But he said fraternities and the students who frequent the parties need to accept the new regulations. National fraternities, he said, prefer the use of cans instead of kegs, and many are putting pressure on chapters to have parties that are "bring your own beer" or alcohol free.
"We need to cut down on liability," Mr. Marcoux said. But, he added, this semester's first parties have shown that even with stricter regulations, "as far as how much alcohol is consumed, there has been no difference."

HEADLINE: Garden Q. & A.

BYLINE: By Linda Yang

 BODY:

Purple Turtles
Q. At a local nursery recently, I came across a beautiful purple flowering plant called turtlehead. What is it, and what does it need to grow well? -- Tracy Wilcox, Danbury, Conn. 
 A. The turtleheads (Chelone) are native American perennials with curved, tubular flowers that resemble turtles' heads. Very likely the plant you saw is Chelone obliqua, which has graceful, rosy purple flowers that bloom in late summer and linger through fall. This long-lasting bloomer can be a carefree addition to your garden if it is in moist, acid soil and gets partial shade.
 
Let There Be Light
 Q. I'd like to grow windowsill indoor plants, but I have no windowsill sun. What do I need to grow them under artificial light? Is this very expensive? -- Terry S. Rosenberg, Boston, Mass.
A. It is so easy to set up a small light garden that it's amazing more people don't do it. All you need are two fluorescent tubes and the reflector unit that holds them.
Although special bulbs have been touted as the last word in light-garden technology, they are relatively costly. Instead, many gardeners have found that the light spectrum that most plants need can be produced inexpensively by using a cool light or daylight fluorescent tube, together with a warm light tube, either 20 or 40 watts each.
Economical two-tube reflector units and bulbs can be found at hardware stores, but be sure to measure your window space so you know what size to buy.
Position the light unit so that the plants are no closer to the tube than about two inches, and no further away than about 10 inches. Since plants need both light and dark (day and night), it is wise to use an automatic timer to turn the lights on and off. A typical "day" for plants growing under lights is 14 to 16 hours, but there is no rule that this period must coincide with an actual day. You can reverse "day and night" to suit your decorating needs.
For a pamphlet titled "Learn to Grow Under Fluorescent Lights," by Pat Morrison, send $3 to M. T. Dieterich, 481 Great Road, Acton, Mass. 01720. It is published by the Indoor Gardening Society of America.
Although now out of print, two helpful books are "Fluorescent Light Garden," by Elaine C. Cherry (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1965), and "The Indoor Light Gardening Book," by George Elbert (Crown Publishers, 1973).
 
Small-Space Composting
 Q. I have a rooftop terrace that is not large enough for the three-bin compost system recommended by most garden periodicals. But I would like to make compost. Can I? And if so, how? -- Jeffrey G. Donnell, New York, N.Y.
A. You can make compost in even the tiniest space using a large plastic garbage pail or a wooden barrel, placed outside.
First, line the bottom with an inch or so of twigs or rocks, and cover this with several thicknesses of newspaper. Then, heap in all the fallen leaves from plants that are free of diseases, along with small pieces of soft kitchen vegetable matter, if you wish.
Every few inches add a thin layer of soil, and some packaged cow manure from a nursery. (Fresh horse manure is actually better, but most gardeners are too embarrassed to roam bridle paths or follow mounted police with a plastic bag.)
Turn the compost heap weekly and continue adding leaves until frost. If there's no rain, water enough to moisten. Next spring, a rich and fragrant soil will be your reward.
You might also consider buying a polyethylene composting unit that keeps the ingredients together in a neat, unobtrusive container. Mail-order suppliers include the Gardener's Supply Company, 128 Intervale Road, Burlington, Vt. 05401 (802) 863-1700, and the Natural Gardening Company, 217 San Anselmo Avenue, San Anselmo, Calif. 94960 (415) 456-5060. Both offer free catalogues.

HEADLINE: Budget Shell Game Hides Funds for Jobless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "A Standoff Won't Help the Jobless" (editorial, Oct. 3), you paint a one-sided picture of extending unemployment benefits by advocating additional employer taxes to pay for any extension. You favor the extension but argue the provisions of the 1990 budget agreement must be met: If you want more domestic spending, find the money to pay for it.
What a charade! Consider: 
 * A dedicated fund for payment of extended benefits exists -- $8 billion collected from employers under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. This money can be used only if the states meet certain criteria. But these criteria are so outdated that only Rhode Island and Puerto Rico meet them. Also, the prospects that other states will be able to pay extended benefits in the foreseeable future are dim.
The $8 billion sits in the Treasury.
* These supposedly dedicated funds (along with others like the huge Social Security trust funds) are in the Federal Treasury ostensibly to help balance the budget. They are used for every purpose in addition to those to which they are dedicated. In reality, this "unified budget" concept hides the true Federal deficit.
What chicanery!
Under the terms of the temporary bill passed in Congress with a July 1992 expiration date, it's not a sin to have used the $8 billion fund. It probably will be vetoed, unjustly, by President Bush.
These extended benefits paid to claimants are high-velocity dollars; they pay the butcher, the baker and (not the proverbial candlestick makers, but) the electric company.
Thus, the multiplier effect of these benefits would be powerful enough to give the economy a significant shot in the arm.

The theory raised in the Senate by Orrin Hatch was designed to explain how Prof. Anita F. Hill may have come to her accusations.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Democrats Find A Campaign Voice, And It's Singing A Different Tune

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
OUT on the Democratic hustings, where a grim silence reigned for so many months, a Democratic message is emerging.
It is coming from a group of five candidates who, by and large, are looking for the synthesis that eluded their party in the 1980's. They seek a message to carry the country past Reaganism, back to a more active Federal Government, and back to a Democratic Party that is trusted by the middle class to use that Government to help them. 
 The candidates are trying to tap into the anxieties of voters who are worried about the economy, education, health care and other domestic problems but need to be persuaded that a White House held by the Democrats can do anything about them.
When Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas entered the race two weeks ago, he said that middle-class voters "think that most of the help goes to those at the top of the ladder, some goes to the bottom, and nobody stands up for them." He promised to "put government back on the side" of the "forgotten middle class" -- the sons and daughters of Franklin Roosevelt's "forgotten man," moved to the suburbs but still struggling.
These candidates deliver a stinging indictment of the 1980's as a source of many of the problems today, clearly believing that the Reagan magic has lost its hold on the American people. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa compares supply-side economics to Communism, arguing that both benefited only the privileged few and both belong on the "trash heap of history."
These candidates largely dismiss President Bush as a man with almost no domestic agenda and almost no feel for the nation's problems. But most of the candidates, in their announcement speeches, have had little to say about foreign policy. Perhaps understandably they have often avoided mention of the war in the Persian Gulf, which paralyzed the Democrats politically for so many months and left Mr. Bush with towering approval ratings; it is the Democrats' version of the dog that didn't bark. The real struggle in the world today, Democrats often argue, is an economic one and the nation, because of Republican domestic policies, is ill-equipped to wage it.
The five major candidates, four of whom have formally announced their candidacies only in the past month, will spend much of the next six months emphasizing where they disagree. But they look at many of the same polls, are trying to navigate the same political terrain and are striking some of the same themes.
 
Middle-Class Squeeze
 All of the candidates talk about middle-income families who see the basics of the American Dream -- a decent job, a house, college education for their children -- harder and harder to reach. The Democrats blame both general economic decline and tax policies that, they assert, have consistently favored the wealthy at a cost to everyone else.
Senator Harkin has adopted a classic populist campaign, arguing that "George Herbert Walker Bush and J. Danforth Quayle" have been looking after their "fat cat friends."
Gov. Douglas L. Wilder of Virginia says the middle class is suffering because some Washington elites in both parties have mismanaged the Federal budget. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska casts the problem in generational terms, appealing to the baby boomers' fear: "Unless we do things differently now," he says, the children of the baby boom will fall farther and farther behind.
Still, sympathizing with the middle class is one thing; persuading it that the Democrats can help is another.
So, an implied promise has surfaced as part of the Democratic message from most of these candidates. The Democrats will be different this time.
Indeed, there are some new tunes being sung. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts delivers a scathing attack on Democratic corporate-bashing, calling it "Twinkie economics" that feels good for the moment but lacks longterm nutritional value.
Mr. Clinton flatly promises to "reinvent government," saying it has to reflect American values, including the value of personal responsibility. He pushes for stronger child support enforcement, for example, and welfare programs that require recipients to work.
Mr. Wilder presents himself as a budget cutter and a staunch advocate of fiscal discipline, not a customary appeal in a Democratic primary season.
And Mr. Wilder, Mr. Clinton and others also call for some form of middle-class tax relief, an issue that many in the party see as a comer.
 
Familiar Strains
 The party, of course, has not abandoned its old-time religion: there are also calls for new "investments" (read spending) on schools, highways, all the resources needed to help the country compete economicially. Mr. Harkin, positioning himself as the voice of unashamed liberalism, has the most full-throated appeal on this front -- and the collapse of Communism, conveniently enough, gives Mr. Harkin a ready explanation of how he will pay for it all.
Mr. Harkin presents a zero sum game: Spending money to protect affluent Western Europe from a collapsing threat, or to help rebuild America's economy. "Are you ready for a President who will declare a peace dividend and turn Star Wars into Star Schools?" he asks.
The Republicans plan to assail the Democrats as naive isolationists. Even Mr. Kerrey fretted aloud recently: "We do have to bring the rewards of the cold war home to America and to make sure we build a stronger America, but I hope and pray that it's not an America that isolates itself against the rest fo the world."
In this campaign, most of the candidates are also striving to pay close attention to the nation's feelings and the nation's soul. It is a reaction perhaps to the campaign of 1988, when Democrats suffered from the managerial, dispassionate style of Michael S. Dukakis.
In doing so, the candidates often begin with a head-on attack on Mr. Bush's promise of a "kinder, gentler America." Mr. Harkin, for example, says the Republicans have delivered "a vision of America that says you're supposed to get what you can, get it in the shortest amount of time, don't ask how you get it, just get it and to hell with everybody else."
Most of the candidates talk about restoring a sense of community. Most of the candidates also regularly accuse Mr. Bush of dividing the country along racial lines, and they cite his campaign against the pending civil rights legislation as a "quota bill."
Still, polls show voters already tend to think of Democrats as a more caring party; the candidates are also spending considerable time on the traditional values of patriotism, thrift, hard work.
The Democrats also talk about ending the nation's sour political mood, which Mr. Kerrey calls a "season of cynicism."
The common strain, in fact, throughout much of the Democratic oratory these days is a call to belief -- in government, in the party, in the abilities of these five Democrats to do better than a popular President. The leap of faith they seek is broad: Are the voters who not so very long ago wanted the Government off their backs ready now to believe in it again, at a time of bouncing checks on Capitol Hill, ugly and bitter confirmation battles and a politics that rarely lifts the spirits?

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Beyond Manhattan, Some Islands Of Growth

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
"THERE is no argument necessary but this: Long Island City will be the greatest apartment and factory proposition around New York in five years," crowed New York City's leading real estate newsletter in 1906.
As far as Long Island City's future was concerned, it was right -- up to a point. 
 Since then, Northwest Queens, the South Bronx, central Brooklyn and many other New York City neighborhoods have seen their fortunes rise and fall. The cycle of growth and decay swings with the city's economy, growing outward from the Manhattan core in good times, as in the 1920's, the 1960's and the 1980's, and stallingwhen incomes and investments lag.
While New York is currently in a downturn, the pale green glass and steel Citicorp office tower stands across the East River from Manhattan amid the old factories and rail yards of Long Island City, a monument to the last boom and perhaps a sentinel for the next. Dozens of plans for future development have been shelved at a time when the city's fiscal problems have made it harder for city officials to argue for the special subsidies to encourage building in depressed areas.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo cut through some of this gloom late last month with a $7 billion blueprint to develop several large unused parcels of land in the city and improve rail and subway lines. Developers praised him for his optimism and plans, some of which were repackaged versions of proposals made years earlier, but cautioned that another burst of prosperity would be needed to transform his wish list into concrete and steel.
 
Lower Land Values
 Until prosperity returns, most plans must wait, including those for the 6,000 homes the Governor wants at Hunters Point, Queens, or the 7,500 houses for the Arverne section of Queens, or the Penn Yards site on the Upper West Side. Those plans, made when land prices were high, would have to be modified to reflect today's lower values, particularly where the price the city expects developers to pay for the land is concerned.
Bolstered by $110 million in city tax subsidies, considerable construction has already taken place in most of the areas beyond Manhattan that are expected to become the focus of the next big push. In Long Island City 3,000 Citicorp employees are at work in its building. At the Metrotech development in central Brooklyn, work is more than half way to completion on a 4-million-square-foot complex covering 10 blocks. On Staten Island, the Teleport Telecommunications Center has grown to five low-rise office buildings, four of them fully leased by tenants such as Merrill Lynch & Company, Dun & Bradstreet and Allstate Insurance. In Flushing, millions of dollars in private funds have been invested in the last three years, most of it from Asian immigrants.
Even with prosperity, it is difficult to predict where the next wave of growth will occur. When city economic development officials and their silent partners, the builders, look at a map of the city, they see not only streets, subways and rivers, but also zoning districts, special subsidy areas, protected environmental areas, and, increasingly, obstreperous local planning groups. Each factor is a force in directing growth and each is easy to get wrong. In the 1960's, for example, when the Regional Plan Association, a planning and research group, published its forecast for future commercial centers outside of Manhattan, it pointed to 149th Street in the Bronx; Jamaica, Queens, and downtown Brooklyn. It was right about Brooklyn, partly because millions of dollars in development subsidies were poured into the huge Metrotech center and other office and housing projects between Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues.
 
Boom in Flushing
 "With all the gloom about New York, there are still nuclei of growth that will radiate outward after the recession," said Louis Winnick, a widely respected urban analyst now with the Fund for the City of New York. "My supreme example is Flushing. Flushing has more private, non-subsidized construction going on than in any part of the city. It has a big new hotel, several office buildings, five or six banks and some very large apartment complexes, all because of the big immigrant population that is settling there."
The growth of Flushing, including the new 175-room Sheraton La Guardia East hotel at 39th Street and Main Street, came from overseas Asian investors. The area was underbuilt with single-family homes occupying lots zoned for four- or five-unit apartments. Now bootstrap investors have built multiple dwellings for big profits. Transportation is also an important factor; the Flushing subway line contributes to the area's development.
Mayor David N. Dinkins is committing to renewing former Mayor Edward I. Koch's "other boroughs" program of using tax subsidies and cut-rate utilities to encourage commercial development.
The incentive plan lured Citicorp to build in Long Island City in 1989 with approximately $90 million in tax breaks over the life of the abatement; also persuasive were the area's proximity to Manhattan and the convenience of four subway lines.
Little has followed this bold step. The Hunters Point project, where Governor Cuomo would like to see a $2 billion complex of 6,000 apartments and more than 2 million square feet of office space as the next major step in rebuilding Long Island City and a keystone of Governor Cuomo's building plan, is still awaiting someone with both cash and confidence in the city.
But economic development has always been a long-term proposition, and slow times, according to David Vandor, a Queens planning consultant, are just when officials and developers should be looking ahead. "The urgency of particular projects is a little way off," Mr. Vandor said, "and now is when we should be thinking about how to save jobs, separate the buildings, plan for parking and access to the river."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Eastern Europe's Reactors Don't Seem So Distant Now

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
PROTESTERS coined the motto "A nuclear accident anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere," but lately it has been adopted by government regulators, looking nervously at the primitive reactors in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Meeting outside Paris last month, top regulators from the seven largest industrialized nations began laying plans for international safety standards. And in Brussels on Thursday, the European Community appropriated $60 million for assistance to the Soviet Union and discussed an aid program begun earlier this year for Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. Significantly, the aid is for improving the regulation of reactors. 
 "Before this summer, you didn't see one country tell another country what to do," said Michael B. Congdon, a foreign policy adviser at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who recently returned from a tour of reactors in the Soviet Union and the former East Bloc. "The European Community is placing a lot of pressure on Eastern Europe to close these plants," he said. For years the plants seemed distant, across an iron curtain, but the curtain was only a figure of speech and Western Europe is not very far downwind. The point was driven home Saturday morning with the report of an electrical fire at one of the surviving reactors at Chernobyl. Just as the community sets policy on farm subsidies and food additives, it now wants to set policy on nuclear plants.
There is a weak precedent for intervention. In response to the Chernobyl accident, in the Ukraine in 1986, plant owners from around the world met in Moscow in 1989 to form a World Association of Nuclear Operators, with headquarters in London. But that is an advisory group; its organizers took pride in announcing, for example, that by this spring they had arranged for the manager or chief engineer of every nuclear plant in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to visit a Western plant. But the continuing decline of Eastern Europe has emboldened the West to go further.
 
A Delicate Subject
 In Brussels, where questions of national sovereignty are an old thorn, officials put the issue delicately. "We are providing very significant technical assistance, and we are mandated to use part of this assistance to improve regulatory matters," said an official of the European Community's Directorate for the Environment, Nuclear Safety and Civil Protection. The official, who would not be named, said that a "byproduct" of improving the regulation would be to bring the plants up to international norms.
But Simon R. Carroll, a nuclear specialist in the Brussels office of Greenpeace, the environmental organization, called the standards a pre-requisite, not a byproduct. "One of the problems is convincing the Bulgarians," he said. "Because there was no accepted international criteria, it's been difficult."
Drawing standards is hard, however, because of the great variations in design. The oldest Soviet-built plants lack the concrete-and-steel containment buildings that would hold in radiation in an accident. They were also built without the pipes and pumps that would dump water into the cooling system in case of a leak.
American officials point out, however, that the Soviet-built plants have some design strengths. In an accident like the one at Three Mile Island, they would take far longer to overheat, because there is more water in their heat-exchangers. In addition, the cores are large compared with the heat they generate, so overheating would take longer.
Recent visitors to Eastern Europe, including Ivan Selin, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, were impressed in many cases that the operators were smart and well trained. But there were telling differences. Their years of experience are useless to them in an accident, he said, because nearly all they know is normal operation; they have no simulators to practice the "crash and burn" scenarios that American operators drill for regularly.
And there are short-term problems, like manuals at the Bulgarian plants written in Russian, even though most of the Russians have gone home. Mr. Selin speaks both languages, but he was just visiting.
Most of these problems would yield to an American engineering management technique: the continuous, heavy application of money. But that, say Western officials, is at the heart of the problem, because the Eastern European plants don't generate any money, and are not likely to under democratic regimes, with candidates promising lower prices for necessities.
"Unfortunately, every country that owns these plants is in shock," said Harold R. Denton, director of the N.R.C.'s Office of Governmental and Regulatory Affairs.
Getting too closely involved in Eastern Europe is also a hazard. Mr. Denton said that Americans risked "getting co-opted" by making suggestions or paying for safety improvements for a dangerous plant, when the better option would be to close it.
The nuclear official at the European Community, asked if his group had recommended closing the Bulgarian complex, replied, "Not officially," and said some of the community's aid was being used instead to find alternatives to nuclear generation, given the severe economic impact of a shutdown.
Antony P. Froggatt, a Greenpeace organizer in London, mentioned another reason for waffling. Western companies sent in to improve existing reactors are there in large part to gain a foothold in an area that may see new reactor orders, he said. But if they are too harsh in characterizing the existing reactors, said Mr. Froggatt, "people might not want them to build new ones."
"It's a fine line for them to say, these reactors are dangerous but not too dangerous," he said.

Soviet-designed plants, like those of other nations, differ by age. The oldest, the model 230, and the second oldest, the model 213, lack emergency core cooling systems, which would provide water in case of a pipe break. They also lack containment buildings, which would hold in radioactive gasses and particles in case of accident, although the 213 has a "confinement" which is meant to retain some of this material. An exception is the Lovisa plant, which was built by the Finns with a containment supplied by Westinghouse. An American manufacturer, as well as electronic controls from Germany. The Model 1000 comes closer to Western standards. (Sources: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; U.S. Council for Energy Awareness; Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)

HEADLINE: Group of Seven Edges Toward Soviet Debt Relief

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Sunday, Oct. 13

 BODY:
After an evening of meetings here with Soviet economic officials, the financial leaders of the world's seven largest industrial nations appeared ready to consider an important step toward some sort of emergency program to prevent a Soviet debt crisis, officials said early today.
Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the Soviet Union's key economic planner, said there had been good progress toward providing what could amount to substantial financial assistance to his country. 
 Calling the discussions "very interesting and very deep," Mr. Yavlinksy said, that the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven "will be more prepared to make some concrete steps in the direction" of financial assistance.
Mr. Yavlinsky added, "The goals which we jointly are trying to achieve are not far from us."
The discussions this morning followed seven hours of meetings among the Group of Seven leaders on Saturday and then a three-hour dinner with the Soviet officials focusing on ways to shore up the faltering Soviet economy.
The meetings were held in an atmosphere of growing drama, with the Group of Seven appearing to edge closer to some kind of major debt-relief program or other form of aid for the Soviet economy. The precise shape of any final package remains unclear, and is unlikely to be concluded in great detail here.
 
Postponing Payments
 Postponement of some debt payments or some emergency short-term loans have been mentioned as possibilities for an aid package. Beyond that, the delegations said they were avoiding public discussion of details because the meetings were still in a delicate stage.
But officials said there was a growing sense that if the industrial nations wanted to stave off serious economic chaos, they must act sooner rather than later. They said the meetings would possibly produce a solid commitment to forge a financial plan.
Until now the seven nations, which include the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy, have offered billions of dollars in humanitarian aid, like food and medical supplies. The agreement to meet at such a high level with Soviet officials to consider large-scale financial aid marked an important new stage in the West's efforts to help the Soviet economy through its crisis.
Soviet officials have told Group of Seven that they expect to be unable to meet about $5 billion of payments due on loans in the remainder of this year. They have also said that their gold reserves, an important cushion, are smaller than previously believed.
The fear is that if the Soviets default on their nearly $70 billion in borrowings from the West, that could disrupt the flow of foreign goods into the country and cause credit to the Soviet Union to dry up, aggravating already critical
"We got a very good presentation from Yavlinsky," said Theo Waigel, Germany's Finance Minister.
The United States Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, called the exchange "very useful." A senior Japanese official said there appeared to be a sense of teamwork in the Soviet delegation, which included representatives from three of the Soviet republics. Ten of the republics said Friday that they had agreed in principle to sign a new charter for an economic community. The officials meeting here took that as an encouraging sign that, economically, the Soviet Union might not be disintegrating.
After their first meeting this afternoon, the finance ministers and central bank governors emphasized that they needed more information from the Soviets before making any decisions. They indicated, though, that they had begun to agree that some action had to be taken.
 
'We Will Listen'
 "We've established the general line we will be taking," David C. Mulford, Undersecretary for International Affairs at the United States Treasury, said Saturday.
"The most important parameter agreed to this afternoon is that we will listen to what the Soviets have to say," Mr. Mulford added.
A two-page communique issued Saturday discussed other measures agreed upon by the senior economic officials, including greater steps towards reducing the debt burden of the poorest developing countries and the need for lower interest rates to encourage more rapid economic growth among the industrial countries.
The statement indicated that the group was satisfied with the recent sharp declines in the value of the dollar, particularly against the yen. A weaker dollar would help reduce America's large trade deficit and put downward pressure on Japan's trade surplus, which has expanded significantly recently after a four-year decline.
The group "concluded that the recent exchange market developments were broadly in line with continued adjustment of external imbalances," according to the communique.
It said that the group had agreed to make bigger concessions to reduce the indebtedness of the poorest countries, providing terms "that go well beyond the relief already granted." This is likely to mean debt forgiveness for some sub-Saharan nations and other very poor countries.
 
Weak Growth in the Big 7
 The officials noted that economic growth "has been weak" in general among the seven nations and said they had agreed to adopt policies that would permit lower interest rates to stimulate expansion.
"The ministers and governors emphasized the importance of fiscal and monetary policies which, while reflecting the differing situation in each country, provide the basis for lower real interest rates and sustained growth with price stability in a medium-term perspective," the communique said.
Although the Soviet situation merited just a single paragraph -- the last one -- in the communique, it dominated the discussions, officials said. Mr. Yavlinsky and Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the central bank, are leading the Soviet delegation that arrived here late Saturday.

HEADLINE: Jordanians Urged to Back Talks

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 12

 BODY:
King Hussein urged his people today to support Jordan's decision to attend a Mideast peace conference, saying peace was the key to "a brighter future we all seek."
"Peace is essential to us in leading a normal life," the King said in a nationally televised address before about 2,500 people representing a broad spectrum of Jordanian society. Jordan's economy has been hit hard by the Persian Gulf crisis and the return of about 250,000 Jordanians from Kuwait because of the war. 
 "Jordan is practically under siege" because of its difficult financial, social and economic conditions, he said, adding that the kingdom was finding it increasingly difficult to handle problems like unemployment, which is at about 30 percent.
"We will participate in order to protect ourselves and to safeguard our country and our people," he said of the peace conference that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is trying to convene before the end of the month. Mr. Baker was scheduled to arrive in Cairo on Sunday in his latest swing through the region to continue his efforts.
The King's support for the United States-led initiative has received strenuous opposition from Jordan's powerful Muslim fundamentalists, who oppose any negotiations or peace with Israel. But the King urged Jordanians, at least half of whom are Palestinian, to be realistic and seize the opportunity.
In the past, he said, "We have failed to deal with the events within the framework of what is possible and reasonable and have, consequently, lost one opportunity after another."
The King's speech outlined plans for the current peace process.

HEADLINE: Angolan Rebel Pleads for Help in Setting Election

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 11

 BODY:
After agreeing in the spring to end 16 years of civil war, the Angolan Government and the main rebel movement have brought their rivalries to this country, with both sides soliciting support from the United States Government, the American business community and the United Nations.
Jonas Savimbi, the United States-backed guerrilla leader of the civil war against the Soviet- and Cuban-backed Angolan Government, accused the Government in Luanda of seeking to delay a national election and has asked for American and U.N. support to insure a "free and fair" vote in September 1992. 
 In a weeklong visit scheduled to end this weekend, he also presented his plan for the structural rehabilitation of the devastated Angolan economy and urged foreign investment there.
Declaring that the cease-fire in Angola was holding up, except for "minor problems," Mr. Savimbi said on Thursday that contrary to a pledge to President Bush last month, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had recently hinted to European leaders that elections planned for September might be switched to October or November or delayed 36 months. Mr. Savimbi added that Mr. dos Santos told the National Assembly in the Angolan capital, Luanda, this week that the date of elections was not important, and that what mattered was a stable economy.
Frank Da Cruz, spokesman for the Angolan mission to the United Nations, said that President dos Santos plans to announce a date for elections on Nov. 11, Angola's national day, which marks 16 years of independence from Portugal. He said he believed that the date would be sometime between September and November 1992, as stipulated in the peace agreement.
In meetings with Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders last month, President dos Santos pledged that Angola's commitment to democracy and a free-market economy was "irreversible" and asked for help with the electoral process. He met with American business leaders to discuss trade and other economic matters, according to the Angolan Mission to the United Nations.
 
'Firm Commitment' to Peace
 In talks with both Angolan leaders, Mr. Bush repeated his "firm commitment" to the peace process outlined in the peace accords signed in May, the White House said. After a meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Savimbi this week, the White House noted that Mr. Bush repeated that he would prefer September elections.
In a meeting with more than 100 American businessmen and bankers, held by the U.S.-Angola Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Mr. dos Santos detailed changes in the Angolan economy and encouraged American investments in his country.
Mr. Savimbi, in his meetings in Washington and with the Business Council for International Understanding in New York, questioned the Angolan Government's commitment to reform. He accused Mr. dos Santos of trying "to lure American capital" to improve his party's image and warned that without outside pressure, elections might not be held before 1993.
Calling for U.N. and American observers to be involved in the electoral process, and not only in the last two months of campaigning, Mr. Savimbi accused the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola of endangering the election with acts of intimidation, denying freedom of movement and limiting access to news media.
A highlight of Mr. Savimbi's visit was a meeting on Thursday with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. Mr. Savimbi said he thanked the Security General for humanitarian aid to Angola and asked for his commitment to the peace process.
Mr. Savimbi expressed confidence that his organization, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, generally known by its Portuguese acronym Unita, could win a free and fair election because it was seen as "resisting Communist domination." Trying to deflect long-standing criticism for accepting military aid from South Africa, he said the aid was necessary because of the heavy Cuban support of the current Angolan Government.

HEADLINE: For Jews on West Bank, The Motive Is Economic

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARIEL, Israeli-Occupied West Bank, Oct. 11

 BODY:
It was hardly religious fervor that sent Erez Peer apartment-buying this week at a real-estate office here.
Nor was it an ideological imperative to expand Jewish settlement on largely Arab land in this part of the West Bank, which Israelis refer to by the biblical name Samaria, although he does not disagree that Israel has a right to populate territories captured in the 1967 Middle East War. 
 No, Mr. Peer said, he was driven to the beautiful, rugged, sometimes dangerous West Bank by the most prosaic, and most fundamental, of motives: Money. There is simply not enough of it from his job as a computer engineer for him and his wife, Feli, to build a family where they are now, in Yehud, near Tel Aviv.
"We don't have a lot of choices, frankly," the 26-year-old Mr. Peer said, talking about the new apartment in Ariel that he expects to be ready by December 1992. "Here, we get some financial aid. Here, we can get a mortgage for an apartment we can afford. Here, we can live."
 
Thousands of Couples
 Here, they have been joined by several thousand other couples, most of them young and at least 1,200 of them recent Soviet immigrants, who have left Israel proper for Ariel because, they say, they like its clean air, its new schools and its suburban American texture -- and its prices.
Thanks to Government incentives, there are income-tax breaks and generous mortgages. This means that a garden apartment with four rooms can be bought for $100,000. For that kind of money, one would be lucky to find two rooms in many sections of Tel Aviv, 25 miles to the west.
All of this has combined to make Ariel the fastest-growing Israeli town in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Its experience is echoed, if not fully matched, across the occupied territories, where the Jewish population has climbed to over 100,000 and the Israeli Government has stepped up its settlement activity to increase that number by 50,000 in the next two or three years.
Four years of a Palestinian uprising has not stopped people from coming, and neither have endless denunciations of Israel's settlement policy by domestic and external critics. If anything, the attacks are a badge of honor, some here say, making them feel a bit like old-time pioneers.
 
Population Has Doubled
 Despite the last four years of turbulence, Ariel has nearly doubled its population, to 11,000, and expects to double it again in two more years. Its leaders talk about reaching 100,000 some day.
Now that an American-brokered peace conference may soon begin, anti-settlement protests have intensified once more, along with warnings that Israel may have to trade territory for peace. The Bush Administration's opposition to settlements has been stated and restated.
In Israel as well, anti-Government critics accuse the Government of trying to block peace with settlements that they say are created to populate Arab territories with so many Jews that the Israeli occupation will be made irreversible. Amiram Goldblum, a Hebrew University professor active in a group called Peace Now, charges that financial incentives offered to people like Erez Peer amount to "a forced transfer of the population into the territories," and will lead to their "de facto annexation."
But no matter what the critics say, President Bush included, and no matter how many peace conferences may be convened, few here are prepared to budge.
"I don't think this will ever go back," said Becky Gil, an American-born Israeli who moved to Ariel three years ago. "I don't think we would have put so much work into this place if we thought we were living on borrowed time."
Their strength, people here say, comes not just from the Government's commitment to settlements but also from Mr. Peer and other newcomers. It is the ordinariness of his decision that sustains this town, they argue.
"It makes this place normal," said Deputy Mayor Yigal Rosental, who moved to Ariel in 1979, a year after it was founded. "We see our success first and foremost on this point. By sitting here and living here and working here, they convince themselves and others."
"If the land were held only by the dreamers and believers and religious people, our situation would be very different," he said.
There are, of course, members of ultra-nationalist groups who continue to plunk mobile homes on the hilltops in the West Bank and insist that they are obeying divine admonitions to populate all of the biblical Land of Israel.
A dozen towns alone account for well over half the Israelis in the territories. Nearly all the bigger communities -- Ariel, Maale Adumim, Karnei Shomron, Efrat -- hug the big cities of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, creating metropolitan sprawls intended to help the Government fulfill its goal of effectively erasing pre-1967 boundaries between the territories and Israel proper.
"Bush has this notion that settlements can be stopped because he thinks they are tents or shacks," said Meron Benvenisti, a critic of the Government and former head of a research group called the West Bank Data Base Project. "The whole concept here is metropolitan. If he imposes sanctions on settlements, he will have to impose sanctions on all of Israel."
Ariel is a good example.
It may have started as a settlement 13 years ago when a few tents were dropped by helicopter onto a hillside. But its administrative jurisdiction now sprawls across nearly eight miles.
 
Tract Houses as Well as Villas
 It is an increasingly varied town, of cookie-cutter tract houses and individually designed villas. About 1,000 new houses are now being built -- by Arab laborers from nearby villages who are put through a daily security check on the one road leading into town -- and 1,500 more are to go up next year.
There are 33 kindergarten classes, 5 elementary schools, a high school and a College of Judea and Samaria that offers vocational training and pre-university courses to 2,000 students a day.
Many of them come from Tel Aviv and its suburbs, and so do at least 400 of the 2,500 workers in the expanding Ariel industrial zone. That, Deputy Mayor Rosental say, underlines how integrated his town is with Israel itself.
Mr. Rosental admits to worries about the new political climate and the pressures he expects Israel will face to give up territory.
Some here say they are prepared to give up their town, if it comes to that. "But it must be for real peace, not just to give the Arabs this or this or this, and then it never ends," said the owner of a souvenir shop who moved here from Tel Aviv last year.
To a newcomer like Erez Peer, though, talk of peace and territorial concessions seems as remote as an affordable house in Tel Aviv. "I look at this town," he said, "and it is hard to believe that one day this will go back."

HEADLINE: Europe's Hopes for Political Pact Shaken by Dispute on Sovereignty

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 12

 BODY:
The European Community's hopes of defining its much-vaunted "political union" before a crucial meeting in early December have been thrown into doubt by sharp new disagreements over how much sovereignty different countries are willing to surrender.
The latest evidence of deep divisions among community members came Friday, when the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and Spain met in Paris to challenge an initiative on future foreign and defense policy begun by Britain and Italy one week earlier. 
 As current holder of the rotating presidency of the community, the Netherlands, in turn, chastised France for calling the separate meeting. Its prestige as a mediator, though, was badly bruised two weeks ago when its own draft treaty on political union was rejected by 10 of the 12 members.
In theory, all member nations believe the community should have a stronger political profile to match its huge economic weight, but they remain at loggerheads over whether the Twelve should eventually become a federation of nations and over what new power the community should have.
 
'Political Union' Proposed
 Britain is the strongest opponent of a federal Western Europe, but even France, Germany and Spain, which favor accelerated political integration, disagree on many specifics. Several governments also share Britain's determination to maintain NATO as the main pillar of European defense.
The Twelve have set a deadline for agreement on political union and on economic and monetary union -- including a timetable for establishing a regional central bank and a common currency -- by the time European Community leaders meet in Maastricht, the Netherlands, Dec. 9 and 10.
But while the intergovernmental conference dealing with economic and monetary union has made considerable progress over the last nine months, a parallel conference handling political union has so far served to highlight points of disagreement.
First proposed last year by France and Germany, the vague objective of "political union" was initially welcomed by all community members except Britain as a logical complement to their decision to create a single trading market after 1992 and their goal of full economic union by the late 1990's.
 
Talks in Disarray
 A rapid succession of events -- the fall of the Berlin wall, the Persian Gulf war and the conflict in Yugoslavia -- further underlined the community's difficulty in speaking with one voice on world affairs until it had fixed the rules for defining a common foreign policy.
With the United States beginning to reduce its troop presence in Western Europe, some governments, notably France, also felt the community should develop its own military capability, perhaps by absorbing a long-moribund regional military group known as the Western European Union.
When political negotiations began early this year, the most ambitious proposal involved creating a single community structure handling not only its existing economic portfolio, but also foreign and security policy and judicial and police questions. By June, though, faced with a likely British veto, the Twelve agreed to deal separately with the three areas.
Then last month, the negotiations were thrown into disarray when the Netherlands abruptly proposed a new draft treaty that not only reiterated the community's "federal goal" but also brought the three areas under a single umbrella, with new power being transferred to the European Parliament and the community's executive commission.
 
Future Defense Posture
 After every member except Belgium found some reason to object to it, the Dutch draft was abandoned in favor of a less ambitious working paper, prompting the disappointed Dutch Foreign Minister, Hans van den Broek, to note that no political treaty might be preferable to an "extremely weak" accord.
Britain, traditionally seen as the "spoiler," now wants agreement in Maastricht not only because it is eager not to be blamed for the summit talks' failure but also because prolongation of political negotiations might turn Europe into a campaign issue in next year's British elections.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORS MAKING BUDAPEST UNEASY

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Oct. 12

 BODY:
With the civil war in Yugoslavia raging on its southern border, Slovak separatism rising on the northern side of the Danube in Czechoslovakia, and increased tensions to the east in Romania, Hungarians have reason to feel insecure.
"We feel increasingly threatened not because of anything that might happen in Hungary," said Gyula Kodolanyi, a foreign affairs adviser to the Hungarian Government "but if there is a conflict in Yugoslavia, tensions are high between Bohemia and Slovakia, and things are on the move again in Romania -- all in all, it is not very easy to feel happy and calm." 
 Hungary's geographic location puts it in the eye of the storms that are now roiling across Central Europe. As the most homogenous and prosperous country in the region, it has been spared the nationalist hostilities and some of the economic hardships that have beset its neighbors. But still it feels vulnerable, in particular out of concern for the three million ethnic Hungarians living in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania and the Ukraine.
The fighting in neighboring Croatia, which has historic ties to Hungary, has already cut off Hungary's access to the Adriatic oil pipeline. Yugoslav fighter planes have crossed into Hungarian air space several times, and last month the Yugoslav Army accused the Hungarians of shooting down two planes, a charge vigorously denied by Budapest.
 
Stampede of Refugees
 One of Hungary's biggest fears is of being caught in a stampede of refugees, with those fleeing the war in Croatia colliding with those fleeing poverty in Romania and the Soviet Union. Last weekend, for the first time, Hungary turned back visitors at the Soviet and Romanian borders, requiring those entering Hungary to prove they have enough money to return home. As a result, about 3,000 people were denied entry at the Romanian border last Saturday, a Hungarian border guard said.
Hungary has accepted 72,000 refugees since 1988. About 2,000 Yugoslavs are now officially registered in refugee camps, and estimates on the number who have come across the border seeking temporary shelter from the fighting range as high as 35,000.
In Washington earlier this month and again at a meeting of top regional officials on Sunday in Cracow, Poland, Prime Minister Jozsef Antall of Hungary called on the West, in particular NATO and the United States, to help Eastern Europe's new democracies protect themselves.
"The point is NATO should assume responsibility for the security of the region lying between its borders and the Soviet border," Mr. Antall told the Foreign Policy Institute of George Washington University on Oct. 3. "The legal and organizational issues are of secondary importance."
Mr. Antall welcomed a U.S.-German proposal allowing for the participation of Eastern European countries in NATO councils, perhaps through a regional affiliate. He repeated Hungary's position that full membership in NATO would not be appropriate now.
 
New Hungarian-Soviet Treaty
 Since the withdrawal of Soviet troops in June and the defeat of Moscow's hard-liners in the failed coup in August, fears of Soviet dominance have ebbed here. A new treaty between Hungary and the Soviet Union is expected to be signed soon, after the Soviet Foreign Minister, Boris D. Pankin, removed a clause that would have blocked Hungary from joining any alliance the Soviet Union viewed as hostile.
Instead of the old Soviet threat, Hungary and other Eastern European countries are now confronted with a new and unpredictable situation as the Soviet republics sort out relations with one another, and their neighbors. They see the West's failure to cope with Yugoslavia's civil war as a bad omen for other possible conflicts.
"If it proves that the whole world is powerless, then Yugoslavia is a negative message for future crises," Mr. Antall said at a news conference after his meeting in Cracow with the Polish President, Lech Walesa, and the Czechoslovak President, Vaclav Havel. "You have to understand that it is not a problem of a small area, but a problem which concerns all of Europe."
In Washington, where he met with President Bush, Mr. Antall urged the United States to play a more active role in solving the Yugoslav crisis. "The United States cannot entrust the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis exclusively to Western Europe," he said.
 
History of Tangled Alliances
 Like much else in the region, Hungary's position on the conflict in Yugoslavia is dictated by a long history of tangled alliances, loyalties and suspicions. Before the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, Croatia was part of the Hungarian Kingdom. Those ties came up earlier this year, when Hungary was found to have been shipping arms to the breakaway Croatian republic.
After first denying the reports, Budapest was later forced to admit they were true. Faced with outrage from the Serbians and the federal Yugoslav government, Hungary declared a ban on all arms sales to Yugoslavia.
Since then, Hungary has tried to maintain a measured distance from the Yugoslav crisis, refusing to join in Germany's call for recognition of Slovenian and Croatian independence.
"We would not be accepted as mediators in the conflict," Mr. Kodolanyi, the Hungarian Government's foreign adviser, said in a recent interview. "That became clear very early on and has to do with deplorable reflexes, which are not shared on our part."

HEADLINE: Logging Regulation Bill Vetoed in California

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 12

 BODY:
In a move that could signal the renewal of a bitter conservation battle, Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed a logging-regulation bill on Friday that was meant as a compromise between enviromentalists and lumber companies.
Governor Wilson said the bill was too inflexible and would have imposed "unnecessary economic hardship on companies." But the Republican Governor immediately pledged to propose new legislation and asked the State Board of Forestry to begin implementing changes on its own. 
 Supporters of the legislation said they were outraged, and added that the veto could erode the good standing the Governor had cultivated with environmentalists. Conservation groups said that they were preparing a voter iniative, to be placed on next June's ballot, that would protect California's redwood forests and regulate logging more strictly than the vetoed bill.
"By vetoing a pragmatic, balanced solution to the timber wars, Governor Wilson has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory," said Dan Taylor, western regional representative for the National Audubon Society. Byron Sher, a Democratic Assemblyman from Palo Alto and sponsor of the legislation, said the Governor had "squandered an historic opportunity to resolve the timber wars through legislation."
The bill, meant to regulate logging on private timberlands, would have required lumber companies to cut trees only as fast as they grow new ones. The bill also banned clear cutting in old-growth forests and restricted clear cutting to 20-acre parcels in other areas, compared to 120 acres under the current law. Clear cutting refers to removing all the trees in a given area at once, leaving a swath of bare ground.
But the travails of the legislation, which might have been viewed as a model for the rest of the nation, suggests how difficult it will be to balance the demands of protecting forests and wildlife and protecting the livelihood of the forest products industry.
 
Attemept to Avoid Costly Battles
 The compromise was an attempt to avoid costly battles over voter initiatives, such as the one in 1990, when the conservationists and lumber companies spent millions backing rival proposals. The compromise was negotiated mainly by the Sierra Club and Sierra Pacific Industries, the state's largest timberland owner. It was supported by some environmental groups and a few lumber companies.
But several other large timber companies, such as Pacific Lumber and Louisiana-Pacific, opposed the bill as too restrictive, while many smaller environmental groups opposed it as too lax. For that reason, many environmentalists were happy the Governor vetoed the bill, though they were not happy with his reasons for doing so.
In the final days before the Legislature adjourned in September, Mr. Wilson proposed many changes in the bill that would have made it less onerous for the lumber companies. Most of those amendments were added, causing the Sierra Club to withdraw its support. But a few key proposals of the Governor were not added, including one that would have provided exemptions to some of the rules in counties with high unemployment.
Environmentalists say they believe the voter initiative they are preparing for June has a better chance of winning than the one that was narrowly defeated in 1990. That is because the new initiative lacks the provision for a huge bond issue to buy old-growth forests, a provision that is believed to have scared some voters last time.
Still, there was some hope held out that Governor Wilson could still avert a new eruption of the "timber wars." Environmentalists are especially heartened that some reform will be entrusted to Richard Wilson, the Governor's newly named Director of Forestry, who has long been active in efforts to save redwood forests.
Hal Arbit, a wealthy San Mateo investor who almost single-handedly financed the environmental voter initiative last year, said in a statement: "I know the Governor doesn't want this issue resolved at the ballot box. I only hope he will show us another alternative. If there was ever a need for statesmanship on this issue, it's now."

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS NOMINATION;
Excerpts From Senate's Hearings on the Thomas Nomination

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, with questioning of Judge Thomas.
 
Questions From Senator Patrick J. Leahy
Democrat of Vermont
 Judge, yesterday you said in answer, I believe, to a question that you had not watched or listened to the six or seven hours of Professor Hill's testimony. You're obviously under no requirement to do so, but I wonder if since then you've had either an opportunity to read or be briefed about what she said. 
 A. Senator, prior to coming here last night, I was briefed about much of what she said, and, of course, my wife watched significant portions of it and talked about some of the things that she had to say.
Q. The reason I asked, you may have followed a part of the testimony, where she spoke about going to dinner with you at the time when you, or when she, rather, was leaving the E.E.O.C. [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]. Are you familiar with that part of her testimony?
A. Senator, I am familiar that she said that. I didn't see it. I was briefed that she said that.
Q. Was there such a dinner?
A. Senator, I do not recall such a dinner. It was not unusual for me, when a staffer was leaving, to go to lunch, or to dinner would be more unusual, but not out of the question. But it was not unusual to take them out and just simply say thank you. In later years, I know we had much bigger dinners. We'd have the many members of the staff go out and be a cause for great celebration. But I don't specifically recall such a dinner.
Q. Do you recall at any time ever taking Professor Hill out to dinner?
A. No, Senator.
 
. . .

 
DENIES WARNING OF DAMAGE
 Q. Professor Hill said the two of you went out to dinner as she was leaving. Professor Hill, of course, further alleges, and this would be major, an explosive matter, that you said something to her to the effect, if you ever tell about this, it will damage or destroy my career. Now, that was her statement. I want you to have a chance to give yours. Am I correct in understanding your testimony now that, one, you have no recollection of ever having such a conversation at any time, is that correct?
A. No. I have no recollection of having dinner with her as she left, although I do not think that it would be unusual for me to have gone either to lunch, or particularly an early dinner with a member of my staff who was leaving. I would categorically deny that under any circumstances, whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, that I made those statements.
Q. So then it would be safe to say your testimony is any time, whether in a social business, or any other setting, you never made the statement, if this comes out it'll ruin my career, or anything even relating to that kind of a statement. Is that correct?
A. That's right.
Q. Thank you. Now, I just want to make sure I understand this, we'll move on to another subject, but do you recollect ever going to dinner with Professor Hill? I understand you're saying it would not be usual to go with a member of the staff, but do you ever recollect going to dinner with her at all?
A. I don't recall, other than the once I believe we had dinner, perhaps, with Charles Kothe, in Oklahoma. Subsequent to her leaving E.E.O.C., I don't recall ever having gone to dinner with Professor Hill.
 
. . .

 
POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT
 Q. Let me talk to you about, since you've been in the work force about 20 years, since leaving law school, have you ever witnessed sexual harassment first hand?
A. Senator, I have witnessed incidents that I would consider sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct. And as chairman of E.E.O.C., particularly, in the work force there, I was adamant that this conduct would not take place, and anyone who's worked with me understands that. I was adamant that it would not take place.
Q. In that being adamant, how did you translate that to staff of the people who worked for you, in statements, speeches, memos, personal -- how would you do it, Judge?
A. If you engage in it, you will be fired. Simple.
 
. . .
 Q. Now, Judge, you've said you've seen, you've witnessed sexual harassment firsthand. What was the nature -- can you just give me some idea of the type that you've seen?
A. Well, the types of things are, again, people using graphic language to subordinates, who are female, or women. There would be individuals who would expect certain conduct on the part of women, if they expect to stay in the work force or to prosper. Those kinds of things I've seen either when I was not in the position to do anything about it and I've heard about when I was in the position to do something about it. And in the latter instance, I did something about it.
Q. Judge, it's probably a difficult thing to do here under the circumstances, but could you just step out of the role for a moment of being a Supreme Court nominee and think back to being head of the E.E.O.C. for a minute. You get a call from the investigator in a district office, just had a woman come in with a claim of sexual harassment. He relays the claim to you and you look at it and say, yeah, this is. It fits all fours within the regulation statutes. And then he says, but Mr. Chairman, it was five years ago. The statute's run. What would you say to him?
A. Senator, that is a -- certainly something that never occurred during my tenure. There were instances in which there were older charges of that nature. What we would generally find would be that the person involved would have engaged in a pattern of that kind of practice. If that person is a manager that we're talking about, you can find a pattern and you can find more recent occurrence.
To my knowledge -- and again, this may not always be the case -- but when you have a person who's engaged in grotesque conduct or harassing conduct, you will find more than one person. If a person has a habit of harassing secretaries, you will find a series of secretaries. If the person has a habit of harassing professional subordinates or other employees, you will find a series of those. You will not find generally just one isolated instance. And I think that that would the trigger to look for more instances of them.
 
. . .

 
DENIAL OF GRAPHIC DISCUSSIONS
 Q. Now, back on the charges that Professor Hill made yesterday -- one was a discussion of pornographic films with her. She stated that this happened on a number of occasions, and that she had found it uncomfortable and asked you not to. Let me ask you. I mean, she's been asked whether this happened. Let me ask you. Did you ever have a discussion of pornographic films with Professor Hill?
A. Absolutely not.
Q. Ever had with any other women?
A. Senator, I will not get into any discussions that I might have about my personal life or my sex life with any person outside of the workplace.
Q. I'm not asking ----
A. I will categorically say I have not had any such discussions with Professor Hill.
Q. Please don't misunderstand my question, judge. I am confining it to the workplace. . . . Am I correct in understanding your answer, that within the workplace with Professor Hill, you never had such a discussion?
A. That's right.
Q. You never had such discussions within the workplace with any other women?
A. That's right.
Q. Or anyone, for that matter?
A. That's right.
 
. . .
 Q. When you had that discussion with them, did they ever mention or did you ever mention to them going to her apartment at any time -- to Professor Hill's apartment at any time?
A. I think I may have mentioned that I dropped her off at home and I may have mentioned that I had been in her apartment. I can't remember. I don't think they were focusing on that. I think they were focusing more on whether or not I -- the allegations that she made.
Q. I understand. You said yesterday in your statement that . . . "[I]f there's anything that I have said that has been misconstrued by Anita Hill or anyone else to be sexual harassment, then I can say that I'm so very sorry and I wish I had known. If I did know, I would have stopped immediately, and I would not -- as I have done over the past two weeks, I would tear away at myself trying to think of what I could possibly have done, but I have not said or done the things that Anita Hill has alleged."
I've heard people say, was there something further to that? I mean, can you think of anything? I mean, you say that if there was anything, then you're very sorry, but you're also saying you cannot think of anything that could approach this. Is that correct?
A. That's right, Senator. I have agonized over this. This has not been an easy matter for me. And I don't know how or why she would say these things. I don't know what I could have done that would have resulted in this.
And that is just to simply make that point, that if I did anything to anyone that would bring them to a point to suggest or to think that I engaged in sexual harassment, then I am sorry. Because it is certainly conduct that I would not approve, and conduct that I would not engage in.
Q. Well, let me follow up on that a bit. You said you searched your mind for why she'd do this. Now, as I understand, also, your testimony, and I'll try and give a summary, and please correct me if I am inaccurate in the summary, you feel that you gave Professor Hill opportunities in government service, as you have others. Is that correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And you have stated that you felt a particular responsibility, spoken really basically almost as family, the people that have worked for you in bringing them forward, and giving them these opportunities. Is that correct?
A. Yes, Senator. In Professor Hill's case -- and it's important to me that this be understood -- I believe that when I have assistance or interns, that I have a personal responsibility for them, as teacher, adviser -- not employer. I am the employer also. But they are my personal charges, for whom I have responsibility.
Anita Hill came to me through one of my dearest, dearest friends [Gil Hardy]. He was the best man in my wedding. We were at Holy Cross College together. We were at Yale Law School together. We were the two slowest guys on the track team. We spent a lot of time together. We lived across the way from each other in law school. We lived together during the summer. When my marriage broke up, I slept at his apartment. This was my dearest friend.
And when he brought her to my attention, it was a special responsibility that he asked me to take on. And I felt very strongly that I could discharge that in the way that I did, and that was to be careful about her career, to make sure she had opportunities, to be there to offer advice and counsel, and that's something that I continued with my other special assistants. They are family. My clerks are my family. They're my friends.
Q. Well, then having done all this, for Professor Hill, and knowing now what she has said here, and what you read, and hearing her statement under oath, explicit as it was, the statement that you have categorically denied, to use your term, why would she do this?
A. Senator, you know, I have asked myself that question as I told you. I haven't slept very much in the last two and a half weeks. I've thought unceasingly about this. And my wife simply said, 'Stop torturing yourself.' I don't know why family members turn on each other. I don't know why a son or a daughter or brother or sister would write some book that destroys a family. I don't know. All I can tell you is that from my standpoint, I felt that I did everything I could toward Professor Hill in the same way that I would do with my other special assistants, to discharge my responsibilities.
I don't know. I do not have the answer.
Q. Have you had any conversation with her since this began -- I mean, since these charges came out?
A. No, Senator.
 
Questions From Senator Orrin G. Hatch
Republican of Utah
 Judge, there are a lot of things that just don't make sense to me in Anita Hill's testimony. I liked her personally. I thought she presented herself well. There's no question she's a very intelligent law professor. She has graduated from one of the finest schools in the land -- law schools, that is -- and her undergraduate work was exemplary. She clearly is a very intelligent woman. And I think everybody who listened to her wants to like her and many do.
But, Judge, it bothers me, because it just doesn't square with what I think -- some of it doesn't square with what I think is common experience and just basic sense, common sense.
I hesitate to do this again, but I think it's critical. And I know it outrages you, as it would me, as it would anybody who was accused of these types of activities.
In her first statement on this issue, really given to the F.B.I., and all over the press, all over the media, "About [inaudible] Thomas originally asked Hill for a date. He started talking about sex. He told her about his experiences and preferences and would ask her what she liked or if she had ever done the same thing. Hill said that he discussed oral sex between men and women. Thomas also discussed viewing films of people having sex with each other and with animals. He told her that he enjoyed watching the films and told her that she should see them. He never asked her to watch the films with him. Thomas liked to discuss specific sex acts and frequency of sex." That's allegation No. 1, given in what I consider to be a pretty decent F.B.I. investigation -- pretty thorough, by a man and a woman -- F.B.I. agents.
In the four-page statement that she issued, which was of course, leaked to the press by somebody on this committee, in violation of law, in violation of Senate ethics, in violation of a stringent rule, formulated, because these F.B.I. reports contain raw data. The information from the F.B.I. report was released and this statement was given. In fact, the reporter who broke the story read the statement to her, according to her own remarks. She then said in this statement -- this is the second one -- "After brief discussion about work, he would turn the conversation to discussions about his sexual interests. His conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such things as women having sex with animals and films involving group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or breasts involved in various sex acts."
That's the second statement, which is considerably different from the first and adds some language in. And you've denied each and every one of these allegations last night. So I won't go through that again today, although if you want to say anything about it further, I'd be happy to have you do it.
Then yesterday, she appeared before this committee and her statement yesterday -- her written statement -- of which I have a copy that was distributed to the press and everybody else, she said: "His conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts. On several occasions Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess."
Three different versions, each expansive, each successively expansive. Now, Judge Hill -- I mean, Judge Thomas -- anybody who made all of those cumulative statements -- if you take one of them out of context, they're so graphic and so crude and so outrageous and I think so stupid, that would be enough in my opinion to find sex harassment against anybody -- if it happened. But if you add all of those cumulatively together, the person who would do something like that over a period of time -- really a short period of time according to her and twice -- not twice, but in two separate agencies, we'll put it that way -- that person, it seems to me, would not be a normal person. That person, it seems to me, would be a psychopathic sex fiend or a pervert.
Now, Judge, you've had to have thought about this. I know you're outraged by it and you've denied all these things, and you've said these things did not happen. They are simply untrue. And you've had an evening to think about it. Do you have anything further to say about it?
A. Senator, my reaction to this has been one of horror. I can't tell you what I've lived through. I can't tell you what my wife has lived through or my family. I can't tell you what my son's lived through. I don't know what to tell him about this. If I were going to date someone outside of the workplace, it certainly -- I would certainly not approach anyone I was attempting to date as a person with this kind of grotesque language.
Q. I have to interrupt you here, Judge. But there was an implication that you not only repetitively asked her for dates. I don't know -- I guess that could be construed as sexual harassment -- repetitively asking a woman for dates -- but the implication was and the clear implication, which she spoke about was that you wanted more than dates -- if her allegations were true.
A. Senator, I did not ask her out and I did not use that language.
 
. . .

 
STEREOTYPES OF BLACK MEN
 A. Well, the difficulty also was that from my standpoint is that in this country, when it comes to sexual conduct, we still have underlying racial attitudes about black men and their views of sex. And once you pin that on me, I can't get it off. That is why I am so adamant in this committee about what has been done to me. I made it a point at E.E.O.C. and at Education not to play into those stereotypes at all. I made it a point to have the people at those agencies -- the black men, the black women -- to conduct themselves in a way that was not consistent with those stereotypes, and I did the same thing myself.
Q. When you talk in terms of stereotypes, what are you saying here? I mean, I want to understand this. First of all, let me go back to your first thought. You said that if you wanted to date somebody or even if you wanted to seduce somebody -- you didn't say that -- but if somebody -- just put yourself in the mind of this -- if you had wanted to seduce her, is this the kind of language you would use? Is this the kind of language a reasonable person would use? Is this the kind of language anybody would use who wanted a relationship?
A. Outside of the work force, or outside of the workplace, that is not certainly the way that I would approach someone I would want to date. I would date that person for a long time or just go to dinner. That is not my approach. And I think that -- and I have to reiterate this -- that for someone in the work force to use that kind of grotesque language -- it has to show up with other staff members. When we looked at sex harassment cases, when we looked at cases of people involved in unacceptable conduct of this nature. There was always a pattern. The other point that I'm making that is of great concern to me is that this is playing into a stereotype.
 
. . .
 Q. Do you think an intelligent African-American male like you, or any other intelligent male, regardless of race, would use this kind of language to try to start a relationship with an intelligent, attractive woman?
A. Senator, I don't know anyone who would try to establish a relationship with that kind of language.
 
. . .
 Q. You said some of this language, is stereotyped language? What does that mean? . . .
A. Senator, language throughout the history of this country, and certainly throughout my life, language about the sexual prowess of black men, language about the sex organs of black men and the sizes, etc. That kind of language has been used about black men as long as I've been on the face of this earth, and these are charges that play into racist, bigoted stereotypes, and these are the kind of charges that are impossible to wash off. And these are the kind of stereotypes that I have in my tenure in Government, and conduct of my affairs, attempted to move away from and to convince people that we should conduct ourselves in a way that defies these stereotypes.
But when you play into a stereotype, it's as though you're skiing downhill. There is no way to stop it. And this plays into the most bigoted, racist stereotypes that any black man will face.
Q. I saw -- I didn't understand the television program, but there were two black men -- I may have it wrong, but as I recall, there were two black men talking about this matter, and one of them said, she's trying to demonize us. I didn't understand it at the time. Do you understand that?
A. Well, I understand that, and any black man in this country -- Senator, in the 1970's, I became very interested in the issue of lynching. And if you want to track through this country in the 19th and 20th century the lynchings of black men, you will see that there is invariably, or in many instances, a relationship with sex, and an accusation that that person cannot shake off. That is the point that I'm trying to make, and that is the point that I was making last night, that this is high tech lynching. I cannot shake off these accusations, because they play to the worst stereotypes we have about black men in this country.
 
. . .
 Q. Let me -- I hate to do this, but let me ask you some tough questions. You've talked about stereotypes used against black males in this society. In this first statement, he told her about his experiences and preferences, would ask her what she liked, or if she had ever done the same thing. Is that a black stereotype?
A. No.
Q. O.K. Hill said that he discussed oral sex between men and women. Is that a black stereotype?
A. No.
Q. Thomas also discussed viewing films of people having sex with each other and with animals. What about that?
A. That's not a stereotype about blacks.
Q. O.K. He told her that he enjoyed watching the films and told her that she should see them. Is watching X-rated films, or pornographic films, is that a stereotype?
A. No.
Q. He never asked her to watch the films with him. Thomas liked to discuss specific sex acts and frequency of sex.
A. No, I don't think so. I think that that could, the last frequency could have to do with black men supposedly being very promiscuous, or something like that.
Q. So it could be partially stereotypical.
A. Yes.
Q. In the next statement, she said, his conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such things as women having sex with animals, and films involving group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or breasts involved in various sex acts. What about those things?
A. I think the -- certainly the size of sexual organs would be something.
Q. Well, I'm concerned. Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess, the third statement.
A. That's clearly --
Q. Clearly a black stereotype.
A. Stereotypical, clearly.
Q. Do you think -- what do you feel about that?
A. Senator, as I've said before, this whole affair has been anguish for me. I feel as though I've been abused in this process, as I said last night. And I continue to feel that way. I feel as though something has been lodged against me and painted on me, and it will leave an indelible mark on me. This is something that not only supports, but plays into the worst stereotypes about black men in this society. And I have no way to changing it, and no way of refuting these charges.
Q. Now, let me just -- people hearing yesterday's testimony are probably wondering, how could this quiet, retiring woman know about something like "Long Dong Silver." Did you tell her that?
A. No. I don't know how she knows.
Q. Is that a black stereotype, something like Long Dong Silver?
A. To the extent, Senator, that it is a reference to one's sexual organs, and the size of one's sexual organs, I think it is.

 
 
COMPARISON WITH '88 CASE
 Q. It was an interesting case I found, called Carter v. Sedgwick County, Kansas, a 1988 case, dated Sept. 30. It's a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals case -- it's a district court case within the 10th Circuit. Do you know what circuit Oklahoma is in?
A. My guess would be the 10th Circuit. I remember serving on a moot-court panel with a judge from the 10th Circuit, and I believe she was from Tulsa.
Q. Well, I have to tell you something. I believe Oklahoma is in the 10th Circuit. Utah is also.
Interesting case. I'm just going to read one paragraph, anybody wants to read it. And I apologize in advance for some of the language; I really do. It's a civil rights case, interesting civil rights case. Again, I apologize in advance for the language. I just want to read one paragraph.
Plaintiff testified that during the course of her employment she was subjected to numerous racial -- by the way, this is an extremely interesting case, because the head note says black female brought suit against county and county officials contending she suffered sexual harassment, and was unlawfully terminated from her employment with the county on the basis of her race and sex. Anybody who wants it, we'll make copies for you. Or you can get it. I'll give the citation, as a matter of fact. The citation is 705 F. Supp. 1474, District Court, Kansas, 1988.
Let me just read the one paragraph. Plaintiff testified that during the course of her employment she was subjected to numerous racial slurs and epithets at the hands of Defendant Brand, and was sexually harassed by Defendant Cameron. Specifically asked, the plaintiff's claim of race discrimination.Plaintiff testified that Defendant Brand referred to plaintiff on several occasions as Jon's, J-o-n-apostrophe-s in brackets Cameron, close parenthesis -- token -- I apologize for this word, but it's in here, nigger.
Now, that's certainly racist. And at other times would tell plaintiff it was "nigger pick day." Plaintiff claims Defendant Brand kept a picture of a black family in his office and when plaintiff questioned Brand about the picture, he boasted of his own, and then the word is used again, "blood" and of his sexual conquests of black -- and I'm not going to say that word. It's a pejorative term. It's a disgusting term.
So this man was claiming sexual conquests. Plaintiff further testified that on one occasion Defendant Brand presented her with a picture of "Long Dong Silver" -- a photo of a black male with an elongated penis -- and I apologize again. Well, it goes on. It gets worse. Maybe not worse, but it goes on. This is public opinion that's available in any law library. And I have to tell you, I'm sure it's available there at the law school in Oklahoma. And it's a sexual harassment case.
 
. . .

 
LAWYERS AND 'THE EXORCIST'
 Let me tell you, the Juan Williams piece in The Washington Post telling how all these interest groups have scratched through everything on earth to try and get something on you all over the country, all over this town, all over your agency, all over everybody. And there's a lot of slick lawyers in those groups -- slick lawyers -- the worst kind. There are some great ones, too. And it may have been a great one that found the reference to "Long Dong Silver" which I find totally offensive. And I find it highly ironic that you've testified here today that used against you, by one who taught civil rights, who came from one of the five best law schools in the country, who is an intelligent, apparently decent African American, used against you a bunch of black stereotype accusations.
What do you think about that?
A. Senator, as I've indicated, for -- and I will continue to say this and believe this -- I have been harmed. I have been harmed. My family has been harmed. I've been harmed worst than I've ever been harmed in my life. I wasn't harmed by the Klan. I wasn't harmed by the Knights of Camelia. I wasn't harmed by the Aryan Race [an organized group of white supremacists]. I wasn't harmed by a racist group. I was harmed by this process -- this process -- which accommodated these attacks on me.
If someone wanted to block me from the Supreme Court of the United States because of my views on the Constitution, that's fine. If someone wanted to block me because they felt I wasn't qualified, that's fine. If someone wanted to block me because they don't like the composition of the Court, that's fine. But to destroy me, Senator, I would have preferred an assassin's bullet to this kind of living hell that they have put me and my family through.
 
. . .
 Q. She testified: "One of the oddest episodes I remember was an occasion in which Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office. He got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and asked, 'Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?' That's what she said. Did you ever say that?
A. No.
Q. Did you ever think of saying something like that?
A. No. Absolutely not.
Q. That's a gross thing to say, isn't it? Whether it's said by you or by somebody else, it's a gross thing to say, isn't it?
A. As far as I'm concerned it is, Senator, and it's something I did not nor would I say.
Q. Ever read this book?
A. No.
Q. "The Exorcist?"
A. No, Senator.
Q. Ever see the movie?
A. I have seen only the scene with the bed flapping.
Q. Well, I'm going to call your attention. Keep in mind -- keep in mind -- Juan Williams said -- this great journalist from The Washington Post -- I differ with him, but he's a great journalist. I don't differ with him on everything. We agree on a lot of things, and we certainly agree in this hearing. But he went down what they've tried to do to smear you. He went down that they have the whole country blanketed trying to dig up dirt, just like you've said it, just like you've said it.
And let me tell you, these aren't itty bitty tort attorney investigators. These are the smartest attorneys from the best law schools in the land, all paid for a the public interest expense. It's what's ruining our country, in large measure. Because some of these groups -- not all of them -- many public interest groups are great. I don't mean to malign them all. But a number of them are vicious. We saw it in the Bork matter, and we're seeing it here.
Let me just read to you from "The Exorcist." You've said, you never did say this -- "Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?" You never did talk to her about "Long Dong Silver." I submit those things were found. On page 70 of this particular version of "The Exorcist" -- " 'Oh, Burt,' sighed Sharon. In a guarded tone, she described an encounter between the senator and the director. Dennings had remarked to him in passing, said Sharon, that there appeared to be an alien pubic hair floating around in my gin."
Q. Do you think that was spoken by happenstance? And she would have us believe that you were saying these things because you wanted to date her?
What do you think about that, Judge?
A. Senator, I think this whole affair is sick.
 
. . .
 Q. These two F.B.I. agents told her to be as specific as she could possibly be, and yet she never said anything about "Long Dong Silver" or pubic hair to them. She didn't say it in her statement, her four-page statement, which is extensive single-spaced four pages. But she said it yesterday.
 
. . .
 Now, the memo that you issued to the E.E.O.C. on sexual harassment, this emphasizes the importance of an earlier E.E.O.C. order, issued shortly before your arrival at the agency -- and that memo stated in unequivocal terms that sexual harassment is illegal.
The final paragraph of the memo, which was signed by you, reads as follows: "I expect every commission employee to personally insure that their own conduct does not sexually harass other employees, applicants, or any other individual in the work place. Managers are to take the strongest disciplinary measure against those employees found guilty of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated at the agency" -- underlined.
Now, Judge Thomas, did this memo reflect a major policy commitment of yours?
A. It expresses my strong attitude and my adamant attitude that sex harassment was not to take place at E.E.O.C.
Q. Judge Thomas, I also have a copy of an E.E.O.C. plan for the prevention of sexual harassment issued in 1987 while you were chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which clearly states that sexual harassment includes "unwelcome sexual teasing, jokes, remarks, or questions." Now, is this consistent with the views that you personally have believed in and abided by during your lifetime?
A. Yes.
Q. Or certainly in these last 10 or 11 years?
A. Yes, Senator.
Q. Which are the years in question. Was sexual harassment tolerated within the E.E.O.C. by you as chairman or while you were chairman.
A. Absolutely not.
Q. Did you make clear your views to those who were around you and who were working with you on sexual harassment?
A. Yes, on many occasions.
 
. . .

 
 
Questions From Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Democrat of Delaware

Now, were there ever occasions -- again, attempting to find out where there's agreement -- were there ever occasions that you would have an opportunity or an occasion to be speaking with Professor Hill in either capacity, E.E.O.C. or as her boss at Education, where you would discuss matters either as her mentor in that general category, looking out for her interest, or in any other capacity, where you would discuss matters other than business matters?
A. I think that there may be occasions when we would debate politics, as I indicated. I was -- she was -- from Yale Law School. And, of course, I was interested in what had happened to the law school. There were some people, I think, who had clerked on the Supreme Court who had been in her class, that sort of thing, similar to what I'd do with my clerks.
They have their own friends. They have their ideas about the world. And occasionally they will chat with me about those. And if they have problems, I think Anita had -- Anita Hill had some health problems, from time to time, I can't remember exactly what they were, I believe either back or allergies or something like that, it would be those sorts of things.
 
. . .
 Q. Now, Judge, you testified that you never asked about Professor Hill on a date, ever.
A. That's right.
Q. Is that correct?
Now, as I'm sure -- if you don't know, I'm sure it was pointed out to you, and we all know that everything that is reported isn't true not because it is intentionally meant to mislead, but sometimes, there is a miscommunication, it was reported in The New York Times on the 7th of October on page A13 that Judge Thomas told the investigators, meaning the paper's investigators, that he had asked the woman out a few times, and after she declined, eventually dropped all advances. . . .
It says Senator Biden said in a statement today the allegations were investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the request of the Judiciary Committee. Judge Thomas -- this did not come from Senator Biden -- Judge Thomas told the bureau's investigators that he had asked the woman out a few times, and after she declined, eventually dropped all advances. That is incorrect?
A. That is wrong.
Q. Wrong.
A. The -- I had the occasion to be reinvestigated by the F.B.I. agents prior to this hearing. In fact, I believe it would have been on Thursday afternoon. And the F.B.I. agent in my living room stated that it was wrong, the very same F.B.I. agents who interviewed me, and indicated that he was distressed that this matter had been reported that way.
At no time did I ever indicate that I ever asked her out. I categorically denied that I ever asked her on a date.
 
SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATIONS
 Q. That's why I asked you the question, Judge, to make sure it's on the record what you said. I thought that's what you had said, but it's been sitting out there.
Let me return to your discussions, if any, with Professor Hill that may have been of a non-work nature.
A. Pardon me?
Q. That may have been -- as you've indicated, there were some discussions you've had with her about Yale Law School, about -- discussions or conversations or exchanges at work that did not relate to what was going on at work, which would be almost impossible for anyone in the whole world to not have in a business setting. Somebody -- you don't every time -- we don't, you don't, as you've testified, I want to make it clear, always and only talk to your staff about precisely what the business is. So you've indicated that you have had some discussions with her about Yale Law School, how it was going, how it's changed.
A. Mutual friends, particularly Gil Hardy. It may have been on current events, those sorts of things, the things that I talk with my clerks about or the other members of my staff.
Q. Did you ever inquire about or did she ever volunteer, to the best of your recollection, anything about her social life -- I can't stay late tonight, I've got a date; yes, that fellow you mentioned at the Supreme Court from Yale, I'm dating him -- or anything. Was there any discussion ever that you recall about her social life?
A. Someone might -- she may have said I've got to leave tonight because I'm going out to dinner. I can't recall a specific. Nor would there be any reason for me; it would be simply a reason for her not being at work. There may have been an indication of what she was doing -- there would be no extensive discussion about that. I don't see any reason why that would happen. I mean, today what my clerks would simply do is say I'm having dinner with a couple of friends of mine from law school. The only thing that I can remember -- and this is very general -- was that I believe -- and I could be misrecalling this -- was that she had dated someone in Oklahoma who came to New England, or something, and they weren't together, or something like that. That's really vague.
 
. . .
 Q. Was there any change between the Anita Hill that first started to work for you at E.E.O.C. and the Anita Hill -- I mean, I beg your pardon, at Education -- and who eventually worked for you at E.E.O.C., and just before she left? I mean, was there -- was it basically the same person, same modus operandi, same relationship relative to you professionally?
A. No, the relationship, as I indicated in my opening statement, Senator, Mr. Chairman, changed, primarily because my job changed, and the staff went from those two professionals to maybe 10, 12, 15 professionals, with a chief of staff, office directors of 14, I think, individuals, a chief of staff being in charge of my personal staff as opposed to the staff having direct access.
So even the special assistants couldn't see me on an as-available basis. The chief of staff could see me on that basis, but she could not.
Q. When you saw her, though, did you -- was it essentially the same professional woman in terms of her professional attitude? Did she more confident, less calm? Was there any -- was there any difference in the Anita Hill, not necessarily in terms of access, but the professional lawyer, Anita Hill, who worked for Clarence Thomas? Was there any -- was she the same woman when you were with her?
A. Senator, I can't -- all I can say is this, that I can't tell you that there was a specific change. What I can say is that she was having more of a difficulty, I felt, from my perspective, she was having more difficulty in the role at E.E.O.C., because there were so many more, other -- more staffers, and there was so many different levels of communications.
For example -- or responsibilities -- for example, I would rely on individuals with more experience to work on projects that were of great significance to me. There were routine assignments that were -- would be what I would call grunt work, much more than we had at education.
There was sort of a pecking order, and I don't think that she, in that role at E.E.O.C., was very high on the pecking order because of experience.
 
JOKES AND SENSITIVITY
 Q. You said, your very first, almost your first utterance yesterday, when you first appeared, that you can't imagine what you could have said that could have caused Anita Hill to say what she has said, but if there was anything she ever misunderstood -- I'm paraphrasing, I don't know this exact quote -- then you're sorry.
Now, let me ask you this. On its face that seems to me to be a completely reasonable statement for one to make. I don't think, to speak for myself, things that I might say -- jokes that I might tell -- with a male trusted aide that I've been with for 20 years, might not be the same joke that I'd be willing to tell with the female members of my staff. And I suspect that were I a woman there are certain things that I could say to the females on my staff that I couldn't say to the males on my staff. Now, in groping to try to figure out how we got to where we are in terms of this discrepancy, among the men on your staff, did you ever kid about, make reference to, say you saw, deal with, any of the subjects that Anita Hill says you dealt with, spoke to, mentioned to her?
A. No. Let me go back a second. There are a couple of comments I'd like to make about that.
Q. Sure.
A. I attempted to conduct myself in a way with my staff so that there were no jokes that I would listen to or tell to men that I could not listen to or tell to women. There were no jokes that I found acceptable that I could not listen to or tell to any ethnic group. The other thing: when I was speaking about something I may have missed -- I was talking about a kind of insensitivity. Let me give you an example, and it doesn't mean mean-spirited, and it's not in the area that we're talking about.
A former member of your staff came to work for me in 1982, Barbara Paris.
 
. . .
 Barbara Paris -- my offices were on the fifth floor. The elevator panel, button -- panel of buttons was at a level that Barbara Paris could not reach, because she's a short person. She did not tell me. I was insensitive to it because I could reach the panel. So someone had to inform me that she was climbing up four or five flights of stairs because she couldn't reach the panels. It is that kind of insensitivity, oversight -- and I made it a point to tell my staffers, if I do something, let me know what it is; if you see something, tell me what it is so we can correct it; if you hear something, tell me what it is. My grandfather used to have a statement: I can read your letter, but I can't read your mind. And the point is: let me know if I'm overlooking something.
And I think that the totality, the other component of my statement was: if something happened, if I had known, I could have corrected it. That has been my attitude.
 
. . .
 Senator, my attitude was, in my work environment: my staffs were almost invariably predominantly women. The senior person on my staff was a woman. I could not tolerate individuals making that environment uncomfortable or hostile; I could not tolerate individuals who had to segregate their language or conduct in order to get along. The conduct had to be purged of offensive attitudes. And I made that a constant effort, and that's something that I was proud of, and it was something that I'm sure the people who worked with me felt comfortable with and understood.
 
. . .

 
 
 
GIVING RIDES HOME
 Q. You -- did you inform the F.B.I. that you had -- had on occasion driven, I assume the way you describe it, as a favor, Professor Hill home? Or that you had, on occasion, a single occasion, or more than one, I'll let you describe it, gone in for a coke or a beer afterwards? Did you tell the F.B.I. that?
A. I think I did, Senator.
 
. . .
 Q. Can you give us any sense of how often it happened that you would go in and have a Coke or a beer afterwards?
A. Oh, it couldn't have happened any more than maybe twice, three times, nothing -- it was no -- it was nothing major. It was just a matter of, you know, we may have been arguing about something, debating something, a policy or something.
Q. What are the kinds of things you'd argue about?
A. I think we debated affirmative action. We debated busing. Those sorts of things, black colleges.
Q. Now, you said she had a roommate. Did you ever meet her roommate when you went in?
A. Yes, to my knowledge, it's the only times I've ever seen her. She was, as I remember, a basketball player. I think she was in a basketball league. And occasionally she would walk by in her sweats, or be there in her sweats.
Q. At the apartment?
A. That's right.
Q. So you'd be in the apartment with both of them?
A. In an open area -- yes, that's right.
 
Questions From Senator Arlen Specter
Republican of Pennsylvania
 The questioning yesterday of Professor Hill was obviously difficult from many, many points of view. And I attempted with her, as I have attempted with you during the earlier part of these proceedings to be scrupulously polite and professional and non-argumentative. And the purpose of my questioning her and the purpose of the round that I'm about to undertake with you is to deal with the issue of credibility.
 
. . .
 [W]hat I would like to cover with you in this round relates to questions on credibility on four specific subjects.
First, the USA [USA Today] article; second, her move from Education to E.E.O.C.; third, her testimony on not documenting the alleged comments; and fourth, the inferences on credibility arising from the telephone logs.
 
QUESTION OF PERJURY
 The issue of the article in USA Today, I think, is a very compelling one because I believe, and I'm going to ask you about this, that Professor Hill testified in the morning and demolished her testimony in the afternoon. And what I want to examine with you for the next few minutes is an extremely serious question as to whether Professor Hill's testimony in the morning was or was not perjury.
And I do not make that statement lightly. But we are searching here for what happened. And nobody was present with a man and a woman when this tragedy arose. And the quality of her testimony and the inferences are very significant on the underlying question as to credibility. And I'm going to read you extensive extracts from the testimony, which I reread this morning. And I think it ought to be noted that we proceed here on a very short timetable. Senator Thurmond asked me to undertake this job on Wednesday, and I started on it Thursday, and we're in hearings on Friday, and we're reading overnight text this morning.
And the start of it was my question to Professor Hill about the USA article on Oct. 9, where Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers her signed affidavit alleging sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas would be the instrument that would quietly and behind the scenes would force him to withdraw her name.
Now, I'm about to go through the transcript where I asked Professor Hill about this repeatedly. And at one point she consulted her attorney. And throughout an extensive series of questions yesterday morning, flatly denied that any Senate staffer had told her that her coming forward would lead to your withdrawal.
And in the afternoon, she flatly changed that by identifying a Senate staffer, who she finally said told her that she was told that if she came forward you would withdraw or might withdraw your nomination.
The transcript, which is prepared overnight, does not reveal the part where she consulted with her attorney. But I asked my staffers to review the tape, because I recollected that. And they did find the spot which I referred to. But I want to make that plain that it is not in the written transcript.
I start, Judge Thomas, on page 79 of the record, where I questioned Professor Hill. The USA Today reported on Oct. 9, quote, Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers her signed affidavit alleging sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas would be the instrument that would quietly and behind the scenes would force him to withdraw his name.
Now, I'm not reading all of it, because I can't in the time we have here, but if anybody disagrees with anything I read, they're at liberty to add whatever they choose.
On page 80, question: "Did anybody ever tell you that, by providing the statement, that there would be a move to request Judge Thomas to withdraw his nomination?
"Ms. Hill: I don't recall any story about pressing -- using this to press anyone."
Later on page 80, "Ms. Hill: Quote, I don't recall anything being said about him being pressed to resign."
Page 81, "Senator Specter: Well, aside from, quote, quietly and behind the scenes pressing him to withdraw, any suggestion that just the charges themselves in writing would result in Judge Thomas withdrawing, going away?
"Ms. Hill: I don't recall that at all, no."
Skipping ahead to page 82, this is the middle of one of my questions: "You have testified with some specificity about what happened 10 years ago. I would ask you to press your recollection as to what happened within the last month.
"Ms. Hill: And I have done that, Senator, and I don't recall that comment. I do recall there might have been some suggestion that if the F.B.I. did the investigation that the Senate might get involved, that there may be, that a number of things might occur. But I really, I have to be honest with you, I cannot verify the statement that you are asking me to verify. There is not really more that I can tell you on that."
Then skipping ahead to page 84, "Senator Specter: Would you not consider it a matter of real importance if someone said to you, 'Professor, you won't have to go public, you won't have to -- your name won't have to be disclosed, you won't have to do anything, just sign the affidavit, and this,' as USA Today reports, 'would be the instrument that quietly and behind the scenes would force him to withdraw his name.' Now, I'm asking you whether it happened. I'm asking you now only if it did happen whether that would be the kind of statement to you which would be important and impressed upon you that you could remember in the course of four or five weeks."
Now it's at this time that she consulted with her attorney according to my recollection and according to my staff's looking at the tape.
And then she says: "I don't recall a specific statement, and I cannot say whether that comment would have stuck in my mind. I really cannot say this."
Then in the afternoon session, I asked Professor Hill, at page 203, to begin if you could proceed from there to recount who called you and what those conversations consisted of as it led to your coming forward to the committee.
And then, on a long answer, inserted at the end, not responsively, because I wasn't asking about the USA article any more, she says, and this appears at the bottom of 203: "It even included something to the effect that the information might be presented to the candidate and to the White House. There was some indication that the candidate, or excuse me, the nominee, might not wish to continue the process."
Then on the following page, 204, continuing in the middle of the page, "Senator Specter: So Mr. Brudney did tell you Judge Thomas might not wish to go forward with his nomination if you came forward?
"Ms. Hill: Yes."
Now, Judge Thomas, what do you make of that change of testimony?
A. Senator, I think that the individuals such as Jim Brudney, Senator Metzenbaum's staff, who are on the ed and labor committee, should be brought to hearings like this to confront the people in this country for this kind of effort.
And I think that they should at some point have to confront my family.
 
. . .
 Q. Judge Thomas, I went through that in some detail because it is my legal judgment, having had some experience in perjury prosecutions, that the testimony of Professor Hill in the morning was flat-out perjury, and that she specifically changed it in the afternoon, when confronted with the possibility of being contradicted. And if you recant during the course of the proceeding, it's not perjury. So I state that very carefully as to what she had said in the morning.
But in the context of those continual denials and consulting the attorney and repeatedly asking the question, with negative responses, that, simply stated, was false and perjurious, in my legal opinion. And the change in the afternoon was a concession, flatly, to that effect.
 
. . .

 
TESTIMONY ON JOB CHANGE
 Let me now move to another issue of credibility, which is an issue very central to this proceeding. And that is the factors relating to Professor Hill's moving from the Department of Education to E.E.O.C. and whether she would have moved with you had you said the outrageous things which have been attributed to you.
In her statement on page 4, she states, among other reasons: "I also faced the realistic fact that I had no alternative job." She then quotes you in her testimony -- and I want to be precise, so I will cite the reference, page 172, Miss Hill, at the top of the page: "I was relying on what I was told by Clarence Thomas. I did not make any further inquiry.
"Senator Specter: And what are you saying that Judge Thomas told you?
"Miss Hill: His indication from him was that he could not assure me of a position at Education.
"Senator Specter: Was that when you were hired or when he was leaving?
"Miss Hill: When he was leaving."
Question to Judge Thomas. Did you tell her that you could not assure her of a position at Education when you made the move to E.E.O.C.?
A. Senator, I do not recall that conversation, and, as I reflect back, there would be no reason for me to tell her that. Anita Hill was a graduate of Yale Law School, was performing well and was a career employee -- she was a Schedule "A;" she was not a political employee. So she could remain in the department in other capacities. . . .
In addition, my successor was a close personal friend of mine, Harry Singleton, also a Yale Law School graduate, and if she wanted to stay at the Department of Education, it would have been a simple matter of bringing it to the attention of Harry.
In addition to that, Gill Hardy was not only a personal friend of mine; he was a personal friend of Harry's. We were all at Yale Law School at the same time. So there would have been no reason for me to have said that she could not remain at the Department of Education.
 
. . .

 
TESTIMONY ON RECORD-KEEPING
 Q. I want to now move to the issue of the record-keeping relating to my questioning of Professor Hill on keeping a record on the comments which she has said you made. At page 114 of the record, I asked her -- let me back up for just a minute to set the groundwork for what I had asked her, and I read her this as well. In her statement at page 5 she said: "I began to be concerned that Clarence Thomas might take it out on me by downgrading me or not giving me important assignments. I also thought he might find an excuse for dismissing me."
Now, in the context of that statement I asked Professor Hill this question, which appears at page 114 of the record. "In a controversy, if Judge Thomas took some action against you, and you had to defend yourself on the ground that he was being malicious in retaliation for your turning him down, wouldn't those notes be very influential if not determinative in enabling you to establish your legal position?
"Miss Hill: I think they would be very influential, yes.
"Senator Specter: So, given your experience, if all this happened -- since all this happened -- why not make the notes?
"Miss Hill: Well, it might have been a good choice to make the notes. I did not do it, though."
Now, my question to you is, knowing Professor Hill as you do, and based on your evaluation of her as an attorney, is it credible, with these kinds of things having been said and her being concerned contemporaneously about possible dismissal, that she would not make notes of these kinds of comments?
A. Senator, it's not credible that any career employee would be concerned that one individual could effectuate a dismissal. It would be a much better case if this were a Schedule C employee who can be dismissed summarily. Nor can you summarily downgrade an employee. The employees in the Federal system have an array of rights and opportunities for hearings, so that could not occur.
And I think you are also right that it is reasonable for any employee who's faced with the possibility or fear of downgrading or dismissal to document any adverse conduct that has resulted in that that is in some way not appropriate conduct. That happens in many instances in which you have employees against whom actions have been taken.
Q. When I pursued the question about making the notes, Ms. Hill -- Professor Hill responded, on a collateral way, which I think is relevant, and I'm going to ask you about, on the issue of credibility. And this appears on page 115 of the record.
"Ms. Hill: One of the things that I did do at that time was to document my work. I went through very meticulously with every assignment that I was given. This was, this really was in response to the concerns that I had about being fired.
"I went through, I logged in every work assignment that I received, the date that it was received, the action that was requested, the action that I took on it, the date that it went out. So I did do that in order to protect myself.
"But I did not write down any of the comments or conversations."
Now, my question to you is this, Judge Thomas: Where she says she's concerned about being fired, and she says that she is taking precautions, and writes down the details of work assignments. If she's looking for retaliation from you, is it credible that had the statements been made, that she would not make a written notation of those statements in the context where she writes down notes on all these other matters?
A. Senator, it doesn't sound credible to me. But I think there was a further point. Oftentimes, when individuals are concerned about their ratings, they will document their work product, the quality of their work product, or copies of their work product, and the speed with which they turn around the work product, so that they can then argue during the rating period that they should receive a higher rating.
 
. . .
 Q. Judge Thomas, final subject matter for this round is on the question of the telephone logs. And I begin this subject matter on the question as to how many times Professor Hill called you. The evidence already adduced demonstrated that there were 11 calls recorded, 10 at E.E.O.C., and one at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
And my first question to you on this subject is, were there other calls that got through where you talked to Professor Hill on calls initiated by her which because they got through would not have been recorded in the logs?
A. Senator, there could well have been. The -- if I were available when the calls were received, they would have gotten through and would not have been logged in. The purpose of our telephone log was only to log messages, so that I could return calls.
So there could have been any number of instances in which I spoke directly to her without having returned her call.
Q. Judge Thomas, The Washington Post reported on this issue that, quote, Ms. Hill called the telephone calls garbage, and said that she had not telephoned Thomas except to return his calls.
And I questioned her about that at page 173 and -74 of the record. And then, to abbreviate this, when confronted with the logs, I asked her, as it appears at page 175 of the record, "Then you now concede that you had called Judge Thomas 11 times?"
Answer -- following some other material -- "I will concede that those phone calls were made, yes."
And my question to you, Judge Thomas, is, what impact do you think that has on her credibility?
A. Senator, I think it's another of many inconsistencies that have occurred in her testimony.
Q. Judge Thomas, I was a little disappointed, maybe more than a little disappointed, that you didn't watch the proceedings yesterday in terms of seeing precisely what Professor Hill had to say, both from a point of view of wanting to know what it was, and from a point of view of being in a better position to defend yourself.
Why didn't you watch those hearings?
A. Senator, the last two and a half weeks have been living hell. And there was only so much a human being can take. And as far as I was concerned, the statements that she sent to this committee and her statements to the F.B.I. were lies, and they were untrue, and I didn't see any reason to suffer through more lies about me.
This is not an easy experience.

Questions From Senator Hatch

 
. . .
 I'd like you to describe now for this gathering what it's like to be accused of sexual harassment. Tell us what it feels like. And let me add the word "unjustly" accused of sexual harassment.
A. Senator, as I have said throughout these hearings, the last two and a half weeks have been a living hell. I think I've died a thousand deaths. What it means is living on one hour a night's sleep; it means losing 15 pounds in two weeks; it means being unable to eat, unable to drink, unable to think about anything but this and wondering why, how. It means wanting to give up. It means losing the belief in our system, in this system, in this process, losing a belief in a sense of fairness and honesty and decency. That's what it's meant to me.
When I appeared before this committee for my real confirmation hearings, it was hard. I would have preferred it to be better. I would have preferred more members to vote for me. But I had a faith that at least the system was working in some fashion, though imperfectly.
I don't think this is right. I think it's wrong. I think it's wrong for the country. I think it's hurt me and I think it's hurt the country. I have never been accused of sex harassment. And anybody who knows me knows I am adamantly opposed to that, adamantly, and yet I sit here accused. And I'll never be able to get my name back, I know it.
The day I received the phone call, on Saturday night, last Saturday night, about 7:30, and told that this was going to be in the press, I died. The person you knew, whether you voted for me or against me, died.
My view is that that is an injustice.
As I indicated earlier, it is an injustice to me, but it is a bigger injustice to this country. I don't think any American, whether that person is homeless, whether that person earns a minimum wage or is unemployed, whether that person runs a corporation or a small business, black, white, male, female, should have to go through this for any reason.
The person who appeared here for the real confirmation hearings believed that it was okay to be nominated to the Supreme Court and have a tough confirmation hearing. This person, if asked by George Bush today, would he want to be nominated, would refuse flatly and would advise any friend of his to refuse. It's just not worth it.
Q. Judge, you're here, though. Some people have been spreading the rumor that perhaps you're going to withdraw. What's Clarence Thomas going to do?
A. I'd rather die than withdraw. If they're going to kill me, they're going to kill me.
Q. So you'd still like to serve on the Supreme Court?
A. I'd rather die than withdraw from the process. Not for the purpose of serving on the Supreme Court, but for the purpose of not being driven out of this process. I will not be scared. I don't like bullies. I've never run from bullies. I never cry uncle, and I'm not going to cry uncle today, whether I want to be on the Supreme Court or not.

Questions From Senator Alan K. Simpson
Republican of Wyoming
 You've been before us for 105 days. We've seen everything, known everything, heard every bit of dirt, as you call it so well. And what do we know about Professor Hill? Not very much. I'm waiting for 105 days of surveillance of Ms. Hill, and then we'll see, you know, who ate the cabbage, as we say out in the Wild West. This is an impossible thing.
And now I really am getting stuff over the transom about Professor Hill. I've got letters hanging out my pocket, I've got faxes. I've got statements from her former law professors, statements from people that know her, statements from Tulsa, Okla., saying, Watch out for this woman. But nobody's got the guts to say that because it gets all tangled up in this sexual harassment crap.
I believe sexual harassment is a terrible thing. I had a bill in a year ago doubling the penalties on sexual harassment. . . . I don't need any test, don't need anybody to give me the saliva test on whether one believes more or less about sexual harassment. It's repugnant, it's disgusting in any form. And the stuff we listened to -- I mean, you know, come on -- from the moon! And it is a sexual stereotype. Just like asking you sexual stereotype questions about your personal life. Any woman would be offended by that. About your divorce. You did this, you did that.
Talk about in reverse. There isn't a woman alive that would take the questions you've had to take and be just repelled by it. That's where the watershed is here.
 
. . .
 So if we had 104 days to go into Ms. Hill and find out about her character, her background, her proclivities, and all the rest, I'd feel a lot better about this system. And I'm talking about the stuff I'm getting from women in America, who are sending me things, and especially women in Oklahoma. Well, that'll all become public.
I said at the time it would be destructive of her, and some said, Well, isn't that terrible of Simpson, a menacing threat. It wasn't menacing. It was true, that she would come forward and she would be destroyed. She will, just as you have been destroyed. I hope you can both be rehabilitated.
But I have a couple questions. . . . and if I may, Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
Q. I haven't taken time and I'll get to that. Angela Wright will soon be with us, we think. But now we're told that Angela Wright has what we used to call in the legal trade "cold feet." Now, if Angela Wright doesn't show up to tell her tale of your horrors, what are we to determine about Angela Wright? Did you fire her, and if you did, what for? You said that.
A. I indicated, Senator, I summarily dismissed her. And this is my recollection. She was hired to reinvigorate the public affairs operation at E.E.O.C. I felt her performance was ineffective and the office was ineffective. And the straw that broke the camel's back was a report to me from one of the members of my staff that she referred to another male member of my staff as a faggot.
Q. As a faggot.
A. And that's inappropriate conduct, and that's a slur, and I was not going to have it.
Q. And so you just summarily discharged her?
A. That's right.
Q. That was enough for you?
A. That was more than enough for me. That's my recollection.
Q. That's kind of the way you are, isn't it?
A. That's the way I am with conduct like that, whether it's sex harassment or slurs or anything else. I don't play games.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Wary New Hampshire Watches Campaign Unfold

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Oct. 11

 BODY:
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas was eating a salad in the cafeteria at Dartmouth College one afternoon this week when a reporter for the student newspaper asked why he had chosen now to return to his alma mater.
Mr. Tsongas, who has been campaigning for President almost entirely by himself since April, paused, shrugged and gave a rare smile. 
 "Well," he said, "This is New Hampshire."
Mr. Tsongas is no longer alone in the competition for votes in the state where the nation's first 1992 Presidential primary will be held on Feb. 18. Four of the five announced major Presidential candidates spent the week crisscrossing the state in a sort of political fall foliage tour.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska descended on college campuses, hotel meeting rooms and private homes, courting campaign workers and learning the landscape. The crowds seldom number more than 50, and the people who come to see the candidates neither applaud nor commit themselves easily.
"They fly up straight from Washington and they look like they're from another planet," said Paula Wolcott, who came to see Mr. Harkin at a luncheon in Littleton.
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, traveling in the Far East on state business, was the lone major candidate missing from what turned into a campaign kickoff week.
As the newcomers tested the waters, many New Hampshire political Democrats were shopping as well, carefully gauging the message the would-be Presidents were bringing to voters who are almost smugly comfortable with their role in the nominating process.
The 1992 New Hampshire primary is expected to be an even more important test than usual, since Senator Harkin is the presumed favorite in the Iowa caucuses.
Since the New Hampshire primary became a prominent indicator in 1952, no candidate has won the Presidency without first winning here.
In 1988, President Bush was on shaky ground after his loss to Senator Bob Dole of Kansas in Iowa. But a New Hampshire victory following an anti-Dole advertising blitz debilitated his opposition and restored a political edge that earned him the Republican nomination.
For old party hands who have been waiting for months for the campaign to begin, the five candidates who entered the race in recent weeks are virtual unknowns.
Most of the Democrats interviewed this week as the candidates made speeches and attended receptions said they planned to remain neutral for at least another month as they took the measure of the candidates and waited for the field to be fully assembled.
Jesse L. Jackson; Jerry Brown, former Governor of California, and Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma have said they may join the race.
So far, the New Hampshire Democrats have been welcoming but cautious about the new group.
"I have to admit that I do not know a lot about Governor Bill Clinton," John Lynch, a lawyer and former Merrimack County Democratic party chairman, remarked as he introduced the Arkansas Governor at a breakfast for state legislators in Concord.
Mr. Kerrey opened a talk to a gathering of social studies students at Winnisquam Regional High School in Tilton almost sheepishly. "I appreciate that you know practically nothing at all about me," he said.
In addition to the virtual anonymity most of the candidates share, they are also facing a wary group of Democrats, many of whom felt stung by Michael Dukakis's Presidential election defeat by George Bush in 1988.
Democrats are looking for a candidate the Republicans cannot make a fool of, said Henry Sullivan, a Manchester lawyer who attended receptions for Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton on successive evenings this week.
"He told me what he wanted to do, but he didn't tell me how," said Helene Higgins, the campus minister at Plymouth State College, after hearing Mr. Harkin speak at the town library. "I kept wanting to yell, 'How?' "
Democrats attempting to mount a Presidential campaign that underscores deficiencies in the economy found a useful backdrop in New Hampshire this week. On Thursday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation closed five New Hampshire banks that had fallen victim to the recession and bad real estate loans. Five hundred jobs are expected to be lost in the next 18 months because of the bank failures.
This week, each candidate proposed his solutions to the problems of the economy, focusing on job creation, health care and early-childhood education programs like Head Start.
"We need to reconnect the office of the Presidency to the problems of America," Mr. Clinton told state legislators in Concord.
That is as close as Mr. Clinton or Mr. Kerrey came to attacking President Bush. Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Harkin were more direct. The state of the economy, Mr. Tsongas said, is Mr. Bush's "center of vulnerability."
 
Bush's Rating Going Down
 Mr. Tsongas noted that the President's popularity has been sliding downward recently. The New York Times/CBS News poll taken last week found that 64 percent of those surveyed thought Mr. Bush was doing a good job, down from 70 percent last month.
The generational themes of some may also find fertile ground. Fifty-two percent of those surveyed said they thought the next generation of Americans would be worse off than today. In March, 26 percent felt that way.
The new candidates seem hesitant to criticize each other yet. "I'm not going to define my opponent," Mr. Harkin said after delivering a standard speech in which he vowed to "beat up on Bush."
"They can define themselves," he said.
Some Democrats also see New Hampshire's economic problems as an opportunity for Democrats in a state where Republicans hold a significant edge in voter registration.
Ned Helms, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 1992, said, "Not a soul in New Hampshire believes that" the recession is winding down, as Vice President Dan Quayle said this week.
"The difference is going to be with the candidates," he said. "What they say and what they've done."
But first, voters have got to figure out who these candidates are.
Will Kanteris, Mr. Kerrey's New Hampshire campaign manager, said his candidate will win voters with his directness and with the compelling story he brings as a Medal of Honor winner who lost part of a leg in Vietnam.
"But," he said, "we have people who still don't know if he's John Kerry or Bob Kerrey."

HEADLINE: Farm Profits Fall as Dairy Farmers Talk of Strike

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 10

 BODY:
At a time when some dairy farmers in New York are talking about striking because of low milk prices, state agriculture officials said this week that farm profits have been falling since reaching a record level last year.
In 1990, the net income of all the state's farmers, dairy as well as fruit and vegetable growers, was $938 million, up 6 percent from 1989, largely because of high prices paid to dairy farmers in the first 10 months of 1990, according to the Agricultural Statistics Service, an arm of the state Department of Agriculture and Markets. 
 But since then milk prices at the farm have fallen, resulting in a substantial drop in farm income and profits in 1991, said Richard T. McGuire, the Commissioner of the department.
"I expect the milk prices to be down 30 percent for the first nine months of this year," Mr. McGuire said.
For dairy farmers, who make up more than half of New York's $3 billion-a-year agricultural industry, the rapid turnaround in milk prices has provoked anger.
Early this month, a few upstate dairy farmers dumped their milk in a symbolic protest against low prices and began talking about withholding their milk from processors.
"We are definitely considering a milk strike," said Bruce Krug, state coordinator of a newly organized New York Milk Strike Committee. He has 55 dairy cows on his farm in Constableville in Lewis County.
 
Tied to Wisconsin Cheese
 Mr. Krug said that the protests were aimed at changing the milk-pricing system, administered by the Federal Government in a series of regional milk marketing orders. Prices paid to dairy farmers change monthly, based on the auction prices paid for cheese in Wisconsin, the nation's largest dairy state.
Last year the price for cheese, and therefore the price for milk, was high, reflected in a record total of $1.6 billion paid to the state's 10,300 dairy farmers for their milk. That was 53 percent of the total cash farm receipts of $3.142 billion in New York last year, the statistical service said.
It also said that other sources of income, like government payments and machinery rentals, pushed gross farm income to $3.267 billion. Production expenses rose slightly, by 3 per cent, to $2.329 billion last year from $2.258 billion in 1989.
In New Jersey and Connecticut, where dairy farming is small, the 1990 figures were much lower, according to the Economic Research Division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
In Connecticut, where most agriculture consists of nursery and greenhouse products, gross farm income for 1990 rose to $496 million from $462 million the year before. Net farm income, or profits, rose to $188 million, up from $164 million the year before.
Both gross income and profits in New Jersey declined, however. The gross income figures dropped from $767 million to $755 million; after production expenses, profits dropped from $276 million to $246 million.
 
Frozen Peach Crop
 "The reason for the drop in New Jersey is that the peach crop got frozen and labor costs increased," said Robert Battiglia, the state's agricultural statistician in Trenton.
Almost every segment of New York's agricultural industry recorded gains in cash receipts last year. The second-largest segment of the state's farming, greenhouse and nursery products, showed the largest increase, to $343 million in sales last year from $260 million in 1989.
Dr. Bernard F. Stanton, professor of agricultural economics at the State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University, said he foresaw a drop both in dairy income and in nursery sales this year, the latter because of the sagging real-estate market.
"The drop in milk prices marks a return to normal rather than the high levels we had in 1989 and 1990," he said. "The people who have been crying are the smaller individuals who are struggling to make it, who don't want to change with the times. The successful farmers are doing quite well."

HEADLINE: Executive Gets Top Sentence in Famine Fraud

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
A shipping-company executive who admitted sending hundreds of tons of cheap milk powder meant for animals to African famine victims was sentenced Thursday evening to five years in prison and fined nearly $2 million, the maximum possible under the law.
"This is the largest single combination of fine and restitution in our history," said Gene Richardson, assistant inspector general for investigations at the United States Agency for International Development. "We hope it sends a loud and clear message to anyone who may even contemplate doing such a thing." 
 The executive, Martyn Merritt, 46 years old, of White Plains, pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge last May after a Federal investigation that resulted in charges that he defrauded the Government and committed wire fraud. He must also repay the $936,000 that the Federal Government paid his company for the milk powder.
Investigators said Mr. Merritt, who was the principal owner of the company, AMG Services, won a $936,000 contract to provide low-fat powdered milk to the Sudan as part of a United States foreign-aid program.
Instead, he supplied animal feed that was "not fit for human consumption," according to court papers that describe it as having "scorched particles and appearance quite below that normally found in Grade A skim powder."
 
Confiscated the Delivery
 The animal feed was never distributed, Mr. Richardson said, because officials found out about the delivery and confiscated it in a Sudanese port.
Mr. Merritt also admitted supplying false documents stating that the milk powder came from Sri Lanka, thereby meeting a requirement that it be purchased from a third world country. Officials said the powder was bought from a supplier in the Netherlands.
AMG was paid in advance for the milk powder, and what became of that money was a major issue in hearings held prior to Mr. Merritt's sentencing before Judge John S. Martin Jr. in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The sentencing guidelines call for 24 to 30 months in such a case, said a prosecutor, Gerard Lynch.
 
Troubled History
 But the judge said he imposed a longer sentence because even after pleading guilty, Mr. Merritt had tried to keep the money he received from the Government. About $670,000 of that money was in a bank on the island of Jersey off the coast of Britain, where Mr. Merritt also had a corporation that owned his house, according to an opinion the judge issued earlier last week.
Mr. Merritt's lawyer, Roger J. Bernstein, said there was no evidence that his client "had actual control of any of the funds in 1991" and said he planned to appeal the sentence. He also defended his client's actions, saying the powder was not dangerous to humans.
 
A History of Fraud
 Court papers portray the company as having had a history of fraud. The Federal Maritime Commission ruled in 1987 that AMG defrauded the Government by mislabeling cargo in order to get a cheaper rate.
Another prosecutor, Baruch Weiss, said AMG had ceased operating as a result of the criminal action against Mr. Merritt.
Mr. Merritt was ordered to remain in prison, where he has been since his guilty plea in May.

HEADLINE: A Course in Capitalism For Soviet Enterprisers

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Chris Somers and Viktor Donyants have a lot to talk about as they ride back and forth to work each day: jobs and families, history and politics.
Mr. Donyants, 42 years old, is in the United States to learn new skills so he can expand his telecommunications company in Moscow. Mr. Somers, 30, is his American host; he sells phone systems for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. 
 A few miles away, in Emeryville, Calif., Sue Scott, a manufacturer of ornamental lights, is giving a crash course in sales and product development to Larisa Maslova so that her fledgling cooperative in St. Petersburg can break into the foreign trade market, exporting expensive mirrors and chandeliers to hotels and restaurants.
 
An Exchange of Visitors
 The Soviets and Americans were brought together by Sharon Tennison, a nurse who set out eight years ago to encourage links between private citizens because she was alarmed by the bellicose tone of politicians in Moscow and Washington.
Since then the Center for U.S.-U.S.S.R. Initiatives, founded here by Ms. Tennison, has brought Soviet visitors to 265 cities in the United States, where they spend three weeks living in American homes. And she has taken architects and educators, students and environmentalists, lawyers and doctors to the Soviet Union. The center also helped establish 47 Alcoholics Anonymous groups in 14 Soviet cities.
As Soviet leaders rush to end state control of industry, the center, which has a staff working to identify promising candidates in eight of the Soviet republics, finds itself out in front as the most experienced nongovernmental group prepared to help Soviet entrepreneurs. The distinction is both exhilarating and a little unsettling for an organization unaccustomed to such attention.
"We're moving quickly; no, we're racing," Ms. Tennison said recently. "We see Soviet citizens scrambling to build private businesses and to develop democratic institutions. They don't have the time for academic training. They must quickly grasp enough fundamentals to build their own businesses and create goods and services for their people."
 
Emphasis on Enterprise
 In May the center scaled back on most of its other activities to concentrate on its Enterprise Development Program, which has brought entrepreneurs like Mr. Donyants and Ms. Maslova here and has taken others like them to Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
This year 100 Soviet entrepreneurs were paired with their American counterparts. The number could increase, depending on the availability of qualified candidates, American sponsors and money. The center receives no government financing; it depends on a small but growing group of philanthropies and the willingness of companies like A.T.&T. to pay about $1,000, a modest share of the cost. The costs are low because company officials also provide housing and participants pay for their overseas travel.
So far the response has been enthusiastic from American hosts like Elliot Hoffman, founder and president of Just Desserts in San Francisco, who built his company from a home-kitchen operation into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.
Mr. Hoffman, a 44-year-old native of New York City, calls himself a child of the 60's. "I cut off my pony tail, shaved the beard but kept the ideals," he said with a grin. "I've always been attracted to causes."
Outside the rear door of the Just Desserts plant, paroled convicts tend tidy plots of berries, herbs and flowers, learning a skill and getting paid for their work. The strawberries will end up atop the company's cheesecake.
Yelena Kholina, one of the center's first Soviet entrepreneurs, spent a month at Just Desserts in January and was planning to start her own bakery in Moscow. But she lost her financial base when the ruble was devalued in February. Mr. Hoffman then promised to help with money and equipment. He also gave her 12 of his favorite receipes.
Sue Scott, like Mr. Hoffman, began modestly. She borrowed $25,000 and started turning out plastic lamps in the shape of lizards and fish. She has built her company, Primal Lite, into an enterprise that does business around the world, with annual sales of $3 million.
In addition to giving the center $1,000 for the program, she shares with Ms. Maslova her business plans, sales reports and bookkeeping records.
"I don't see myself as giving away trade secrets," Ms. Scott said. "I'm telling her what she needs to know to succeed. This has been one of the most exciting events of my life. I feel I am being part of history."
Ms. Scott, 37, said she was influenced by her grandparents, who traveled to Russia many years ago and brought home stories about the people there. "They wanted me to know the Russians were people like us, not monsters. They brought the world to me when I was young. But on a practical business level, I also believe we are a global economy and we cannot pretend otherwise."
A number of the center's participating companies are already moving toward joint ventures with Soviet businesses. Nevertheless, stimulating business between Soviet and American partners will not be a simple task, said Boris Khersonski, an entrepreneur from the Ukraine.
Mr. Khersonski, who has a degree in physics, came here earlier this year. He heads a cooperative that manufactures doors and windows, runs a private health service that offers porcelain dentistry, and manufactures metal badges.
After completing his internship under the center's training program, he returned to help write a series of manuals for prospective entrepreneurs in the Soviet Union.
Virtually all the placements made by the center appear to have been useful, Soviet participants said. The exception was one young woman who arrived, found romance and eloped.
Mr. Donyants, meanwhile, plans to pursue efforts to establish telecommunications services in Soviet airports with A.T.&T., a prospect that pleases company officials.
"Establishing relations with someone who is leading the way is very important to us," said Randall A. Shields, an A.T.&T. spokesman. "What a ripe market it is."
For Mr. Somers, Mr. Donyants's American host, the opportunity of doing business has a more personal prospect. "Viktor and I talk about how great it would be if one day his kids could play with my kids," he said. "At the very least, I've made a friend."

Goodbye, Skipper, Goodbye

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Either baseball owners and general managers are the greatest optimists since Pollyanna, or they are the greatest dopes since Goofy. They have had a long and gory history of firing their managers in order, of course, to hire new ones who, in almost every case, are fired, later if not sooner.
Not only does the brass think that the next guy in a dugout has to be better than the guy they've got, but then they also obviously can never figure out who the best next guy is. And he's told to pack his pajamas and hit the road, too. 
 During the regular work week last week, four managers were fired and a fifth, Jim Essian of the Cubs, understood that the end was near, after less than a full season as the captain of the ship, the lieutenant of the platoon, the head lemming. As it stood, 12 managers of the 26 teams have been dismissed since opening day for being ignoramuses, dolts, nincompoops. In other words, they didn't win any division championship lately.
One, Joe Morgan of the Red Sox, won two division titles in the previous three years. Another, Jim Lefebvre of Seattle, managed his team to its best record in club history, and also saw attendance records set in that dank and dismal cave known as the Kingdome. Both are unemployed, as of last week.
Never before have so many been dismissed in such a compact time frame. Why? Are the new owners -- often from the corporate world and rarely like some of the old-time bosses whose sole income was derived from baseball -- dumb about how to build a baseball team, seeking a quick fix, buckling to public pressure or simply trying to sell more luxury boxes?
Or does it matter? Is a baseball manager important in actual terms, or is the job overrated, and its significance just a figment of John McGraw's imagination?
"It must be pretty important," said Cito Gaston, the manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, who were down to the Minnesota Twins by a two-games-to-one margin in the American League playoff going into last night's game here. "Because are managers the ones who get the blame for not winning?"
"It's true that a manager can't hit or pitch or catch for his players," he added, "but maybe you can motivate them a little. You think, 'How would you like to be treated?' and treat them that way."
Anything else? "Let 'em play and get out of the way."
The other three managers in the playoffs -- Tom Kelly of the Twins, Bobby Cox of the Atlanta Braves and Jim Leyland of the Pittsburgh Pirates -- were asked the same question, "How important is a manager?"
Each paused and then said the same thing, "I don't know."
Each, though, went on to deplore the rash of recent firings. "If they fired Joe Morgan," Leyland said when he heard that news, "then none of us are safe."
Then each touched on what he believes is the most trenchant part of their jobs.
Leyland, whose spring-training confrontation with one of his stars, Barry Bonds, seemed to gain the respect of the players, said he actually tries not to be intrusive. "I keep one eye closed and one ear closed, and pull a pitcher once in a while, and turn 'em loose," he said.
While some managers have been fired for being too tough, some have been fired for being too easy. "Like now," said Leyland, "the players are in the clubhouse playing cards and playing a dunk basketball game. Should I tell them to cut it out and read Ted Williams's hitting book?"
Cox said: "I establish the rules. Try to be honest with 'em, and then say, 'Go get 'em.' "
Are these managers being overmodest, or oversimplistic? What about strategy? Aren't they supposed to be the Einsteins, the Napoleons, the Solomons of the diamond? How, for example, did the Twins jump from last place to first in just one season? "Better pitching," said Kelly.
Was he responsible for the better pitching? "Well, the ownership showed patience with the younger pitchers, and that helped me," he said. He added that the acquisitions of Jack Morris, Carl Willis and Steve Bedrosian also improved his mind.
"Otherwise," he said, "I just ask them to be prepared, help them a little with it, and tell them to run out everything and play hard. No half speed."
Certainly, as in other occupations, some baseball managers are better suited for the job than others. And dealing with people (including the press) appears today to be an even more vital requirement than knowing when to hit-and-run. After all, the players will take care of the execution. Or they will not. And as soon as they don't, they will, with ever greater frequency, watch as old Skip waves goodbye to them from the back of the fading caboose.

HEADLINE: Study Says Exxon Will Pay Less in New Spill Pact

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska, Oct. 12

 BODY:
The Exxon Valdez oil spill settlement will cost the Exxon Corporation about $5.5 million less over the next decade than an earlier agreement that was rejected, a state-commissioned analysis says.
That is because the $1 billion deal was structured so more of the payments would be tax deductible, a consultant, Milt Barker, told a House subcommittee on Friday. So even though Exxon is required to pay $25 million more than the previous settlement, its real cost will be far less, said Mr. Barker, a former deputy commissioner of the State Revenue Department. 
 The settlement of state and Federal litigation over the 1989 spill in Prince William Sound was signed early this month. A Federal judge in Anchorage approved the settlement on Tuesday.
The analysis said the state gained about $40 million more under the new settlement, after inflation, than it would have under the old agreement. That is because more money is going into a trust to restore the sound than into the Federal treasury.
The inflation-adjusted value of the settlement to the state is $754 million, as against $713.7 million under the old settlement, the study said. The value of the new agreement to the Federal Government is just $6.5 million, as against $52.3 million under the previous one.
"The Federal Government clearly comes out the loser in dollar terms," Mr. Barker said.
His analysis said the after-tax, inflation-adjusted cost of the settlement to Exxon was just $462.9 million, $562.1 million less than its paper value of $1.025 billion.
The financial burden to Exxon is also reduced because a large part of the money will be paid seven months later than it would have been paid if the first settlement had been accepted last spring, Mr. Barker said.
Under the original settlement, Exxon would have paid a $100 million criminal fine, split between the state and Federal Government. Fines cannot be deducted from state and Federal taxes.
But under the new agreement, the fine was restructured. The net result is that Exxon will pay a fine of only $25 million to the Federal treasury, and $100 million in "restitution" to restore the sound. Restitution generally is tax deductible, Mr. Barker said.
The civil portion of the settlement, which requires Exxon to pay $900 million over 11 years to the restoration fund, was unchanged. That money can also be deducted from the oil company's taxes.
The Exxon Valdez oil spill, the worst ever in United States waters, occurred on March 24, 1989, when the company's supertanker struck a reef.

HEADLINE: Climbing Back;
New York City's First Hurdle: Defeatism

 BODY:
New Yorkers are losing heart. And it is no wonder that many fear their city is disintegrating. A huge budget deficit probably means dirtier streets, unkempt parks and shorter library hours. Almost a million New Yorkers are on welfare, supported by an ever-thinner base of taxpayers. Homeless mental cases huddle in corners everywhere, or beg aggressively. Drugs so ravage neighborhoods that desperate parents in the Bronx are driven to chain their daughter to a bed to save her from the streets. And every macho teen-ager seems to be packing a gun.
Who can feel safe in an era of random shootings? Who does not fear the flare-up of race hatred when vicious whites from Queens club a black athlete senseless in Atlantic Beach and vicious blacks stab a young Jew to death in Crown Heights? 
 At a time when we crave strong leadership, Mayor David Dinkins has been dishearteningly passive and Gov. Mario Cuomo has been irresponsibly remote -- only rousing himself a few weeks ago to propose a revival plan whose payoff lies chiefly in the future.
But despair is an overreaction. New York has emerged from worse crises, over and over again, and been stronger than ever.
New York is no longer a great port, no longer a major manufacturing center, and even its role as a headquarters city is eroding. But new roles will emerge, just as they did the last time around. Great cities don't die; they adapt.
No one knows when a turnaround in the economy will start increasing municipal revenues. The urgent task now is to lay the groundwork for revival. New Yorkers need to set their governmental house in order and also make inspired investments in the future. That will require leadership from the Mayor and Governor -- and unselfish support from labor, business and all New Yorkers.
There are specific tasks. In coming weeks, we'll offer suggestions for economic development, for getting guns off the streets, repairing the infrastructure and education, among other pressing issues. But beyond specifics, what New York needs most right now is to put pessimism aside and start building, start coming back. With a determined attack on its problems, there is no reason why New York City must simply endure; it can once again prosper.
New York is suffering from four overlapping crises. All will be tough but none is insurmountable.
 
 
The Crisis at City Hall
 New York faces enormous budget gaps; taxes and other revenues have plummeted below projections. The city barely balanced its budget this year. Now it faces gaps of about $1.5 billion in each of the next three years.
One can blame the Reagan and Bush Administrations. A steep withdrawal of Federal payments to cities has deprived New York of billions of dollars. But this crisis is not nearly as severe as the one that brought the city to its knees in the 1970's.
At that time, the city resorted to gimmicks and up to $6 billion in short-term borrowing to hide the chasm. It accounted for more than 40 percent of all tax-exempt short-term borrowing in the United States. Ultimately, no bank would lend the city more and it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.
Today's crisis is far more manageable. The city's accounting practices are honest, and monitors stand ready to force the budget into balance.
The chief difference now is the lack of leadership and help from higher levels of government. In the last fiscal crisis, Gov. Hugh Carey made it his historic mission to save the city. He was able to advance needed funds, created institutions to monitor and manage city finances, lobbied successfully for Federal help and knocked heads to enlist labor and business in a rescue effort.
This time around, Washington seems indifferent to the cities, and Governor Cuomo confronts his own budget crisis. The Governor's new plan to take over Medicaid costs in future years and to back several big public works projects offers a welcome energizer. But much more is needed.
The city, which grandly expanded its work force by some 50,000 during the flush 1980's, now must scale back. Labor leaders, who have stoutly resisted layoffs and more productive work rules, need to think of the city's future. And business needs to get much more heavily engaged.
Unless New Yorkers are willing to accept higher taxes, declining services, or both, the work force must be made much more productive, delivering the same services on a smaller budget. The city has an extraordinary opportunity to achieve workplace reforms under the discipline of hard times.
 
 
The Crisis in the Economy
 The signs of recession are all around. Venerable department stores have closed. Huge office towers stand half empty. Layoffs and consolidations shrink the private work force in sectors synonymous with New York's pre-eminence: Wall Street, banking, the great law firms, the renowned retail merchants, television, publishing.
But this recession is less punishing than the recession that triggered the last fiscal crisis. Between 1969 and 1977, the city lost more than 600,000 jobs and unemployment climbed to 11.2 percent. In the current recession, the city has lost 150,000 to 200,000 jobs since a peak in September 1989; unemployment averaged 6.8 percent last year and reached 9.3 percent in August.
What makes the current downturn frightening is that no one is sure that the city's fortunes will turn up when the national economy eventually revives. The city was propelled out of its last recession by an unforeseen boom in finance, real estate and business services. No one can guess what sectors might rescue the city this time. The only sensible policy is to stabilize the city's budget while searching for ways to propel the next cycle of growth.
 
 
The Social Crisis
 The city's social problems sometimes appear overwhelming. Beyond the age-old scourges of poverty, drugs and disease, guns have proliferated beyond imagination. And New York must deal with the nation's largest caseload of AIDS victims, and probably the largest outpouring of homeless people.
The most intractable problem is poverty. Some 945,000 New Yorkers were on public assistance in mid-1991, the most since the total soared above a million in the 1970's. By some counts, more than half the city budget goes for services to poverty-stricken people and areas.
The poor live disproportionately in New York and other cities; supporting them is a problem that can only be addressed by higher levels of government. Unless Washington and Albany pitch in, the poor will remain a drain on the city and its taxpayers.
 
 
The Morale Crisis
 New York's problems are magnified by pessimism. When The New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll asked in June of 1990, "Do you think that 10 or 15 years from now, New York City will be a better place to live than it is now," only 20 percent said yes, the lowest percentage in two decades. One big question is whether some of the loss in confidence -- at least among whites and the business establishment -- is related to the shifting power balance that produced the city's first black mayor. The polls show that blacks are somewhat more optimistic than are whites.
The danger is that pessimism can become self-fulfilling, accelerating the city's decline. Major businesses might bail out, as Morgan Stanley is threatening to do, taking jobs as well as taxes. Or the young and the talented who traditionally flock to New York might look elsewhere to make careers.
The surest antidote to exaggerated negativism is reality. The subways, once dangerous and dirty, have become dramatically cleaner and more reliable. Huge capital investments are improving the infrastructure and housing stock. Reading and math scores are rising a bit, and school attendance has reached the highest levels in a quarter century. Infant mortality is down, as are complaints of child abuse, despite a few highly publicized cases. And, for all its pain, the recession is tempering the high cost of living, making it possible for young people to think about staying, or coming back.
This city remains a beacon for the world. Its cultural offerings are unequaled; its professions and businesses are often tops in their fields; its academic and medical institutions often first-rate. Immigrants flock here in astonishing numbers: almost 30 percent of the population is foreign-born, infusing energy and aspiration into the economy.
New York's ills are common to many American cities but its strengths are unrivaled. New York will come back. Strong leadership and committed citizens can hasten the day.

HEADLINE: When Hateful Words Lead to Hateful Deeds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Prof. Michael Levin of City College, in "The Lessons of Hate" (Op-Ed, Sept. 26), his blatantly self-serving defense of freedom of speech for hatemongers and racists, skillfully recasts the child's nursery rhyme "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me" in terms of John Stuart Mill's philosophy of liberty. I would certainly agree that odious deeds count for more than odious words. The sound of a truncheon cracking a skull in Soweto is more ominous than the half-whispered epithets that hover, like escaping sewer gases, over so many public arenas in New York City these days. 
 Professor Levin implies that theories linking race and temperament are not to be confounded with such direct hands-on agents of racial oppression as lynch mobs and cyanide gas. He chooses not to grapple with the paradox of a naive interpretation of freedom that sets free the forces of its own destruction by enabling the growth of intolerance. Finally, he seems to be unaware of the historical role that intellectuals have played, not only in setting off social revolutions but far more frequently in creating the conditions of complicity without which the slave ships would not have sailed and the ovens of Auschwitz would not have burned.
Consider the lies that Europeans told of the native Americans that they "discovered" five centuries ago. Both myths -- of the noble and of the bloodthirsty savage -- precluded the possibility of genuine intercultural recognition and coexistence and set the stage for the campaigns of genocidal slaughter that still negate the West's claim to an enlightened vision of political life.
Some lies can aspire to great longevity. The anti-Semitic lie is more than 1,000 years old. The anti-African lie goes back only four centuries to the rise of the sugar and slave economy that catalyzed the growth of industrial capitalism.
Both these lies are being retold and reworked by race theorists like Professors Levin and Leonard Jeffries Jr. around the central lie of 19th-century, pre-Mendelian, genetic science, that is, the notion that race is a fixed and bounded package of biologically critical traits as opposed to an open and evanescent, essentially trivial biological entity, quickly dissolved in the flux of contact, migration and human love.

Handle With Care

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:
LIKE INFANTS, ANTIQUES SHOWS quickly develop personalities of their own. It doesn't take more than a season before word spreads that a show has a particular look and a particular strength. In Paris, for example, the Biennale Internationale des Antiquaries is known for its sheer spectacle of over-the-top presentations and for its superlative offerings of fine French furniture. Grosvenor House, that other great bastion of showmanship, on the other hand, has long held a reputation for its staid but elegant English antiques. In this country, the International Antique Dealers Show, while only in its third year, is known for its European polish and its strength in decorative objects like the porcelains shown here.
Many attribute the extraordinary porcelains, which will be on view when the six-day antique show opens Oct. 19 at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, to the eye and taste of the London-based organizers, Anna and Brian Haughton. Themselves ceramicists, the Haugh tons are also widely recognized for the specialized decorative-arts exhibitions they pull together, namely the International Ceramics Fair and the International Silver and Jewelry Fair, both held annually in London. 
 "Just because we are ceramic dealers," Brian Haughton says, "when planning the International Show we've tried to cover all aspects of collecting." Nevertheless, the couple have handpicked top porcelain dealers from the United States and Europe, and the offerings are among the most substantial found in any general antiques show. "There's far better variety," says Letitia Roberts, who heads the porcelain department at Sotheby's. "Not just a lot of restored Famille Rose services as you tend to get in other shows. There's serious quality here." Not to mention serious prices. "This is a show for the mature collector," says Allan Chait, a New York-based dealer. "The Winter Antiques Show, on the other hand, plays to a variety of collectors, from the beginner on up."
Yet the International Antique Dealers Show is a great opportunity for beginners to learn more about a field and to meet the top people. Despite the staggering costs of participating (the average booth is about $13,000, not to mention installation and decorating, and, of particular concern to Europeans, shipping costs), dealers find it an excellent place to meet a new group of potential customers. "Shows like this one have become important promotional tools," says Paul Vandekar, president of Earle D. Vandekar, a New York gallery. "This is a way of making ourselves accessible to new buyers, which is crucial. We're merchants and we need to sell." Dominick Jellienk, a director of Bluett & Sons, another London-based shop, agrees: "New York is the center of the art world in the United States, and the show is a good bit of publicity for us."
While good publicity helps business, it doesn't solve another problem: finding fresh pieces to exhibit. Indeed, at a time when the art market is feeling the effects of the recession, collectors who don't have to sell aren't. "They're sitting on things," Chait says, "which means dealers now really have to beat the bushes." But unlike other areas of collecting -- Impressionist and modern paintings, for example -- porcelain hasn't been as badly affected by falling prices. "Chinese porcelain has done fairly well in spite of things," says Khalil Rizk of the Chinese Porcelain Company, a New York gallery. "Prices have held. Perhaps that's because the field has had a slower growth and a sturdier foundation." Still, dealers pride themselves on producing merchandise that is new to the market, a task that becomes harder each season.
"We've entered an era where the so-called speculators have disappeared and those who buy are people who truly love porcelain, which is good," Rizk says. Even so, dealers are holding their breath, hoping they will turn a profit at the International. "Everyone's counting on a return to normalcy, and that moods and attitudes in the art market will improve this fall," Chait says. "But who knows? Dealing is a gamble, and I've yet to find a crystal ball that works. They're all cloudy."

HEADLINE: In Rebuttal to Senate Panel, C.I.A. Nominee Seems Truthful but Incomplete

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO with DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Robert M. Gates staked his nomination to head the Central Intelligence Agency on an impassioned 20-point rebuttal to charges that he slanted analysis. But a review of his testimony suggests that he was both truthful and evasive, careful and incomplete, that he effectively rebutted some allegations but offered technical and misleading denials of others.
The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is to vote on his nomination on Friday, is struggling with the daunting task of sorting out the facts on a number of complicated, often murky issues. 
 While most of the Senate spent the week transfixed by the sexual harassment accusations against the Supreme Court nominee, Clarence Thomas, the intelligence committee's staff has been assembling thousands of pages of documents, testimony and affidavits dealing with accusations that Mr. Gates tailored intelligence reports and suppressed dissent, either because of his own pessimistic view of the Kremlin or to please his boss, William J. Casey.
The issue is so divisive, and senators and staff members so sensitive to accusations that they themselves may inadvertantly slant the data, that the report to committee members will not draw any conclusions about the seriousness of the assertions or the truthfulness of Mr. Gates's responses, some committee members said.
After the committee votes, it is expected to write a comprehensive report that will try to address and resolve some of the most sensitive issues as a guide for the full Senate.
Mr. Gates's rebuttal before the committee on Oct. 3 reflects a strategy of concentrated counterattack in which he focused primarily on the accusations of Melvin A. Goodman, a former senior analyst who now teaches at the National Defense University. Mr. Goodman said that the output of the Directorate of Intelligence under Mr. Gates "was systematically politicized" and the agency's mission to provide objective analysis "was compromised and the professional integrity of its analysts undermined."
Mr. Gates did not directly rebut two other analysts who testified against him, and it was only when pressed that he addressed a number of issues raised by Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat who has taken the lead in questioning the quality and veracity of much of the intelligence analysis produced under Mr. Gates's management.
 
Nominee Mentions Only Some Facts
 Mr. Gates's rebuttal illustrates his own approach to intelligence, as he put it at the hearings, "telling it like it is, with the bark off." But in defending himself, Mr. Gates also seemed to exhibit some of the same traits that his critics say flawed his tenure as the C.I.A's top analyst: selectively choosing his facts to make his case.
Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee have praised the chairman of the panel, David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, for making an extraordinary effort to be as thorough as possible. But the issue of tailoring intelligence is so broad that as of now, a number of accusations have not been fully aired before the committee.
The panel has not subpoenaed potentially important witnesses, like Morton I. Abramowitz, the former director of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, which was critical of some of the agency's analyses. The staff is still petitioning the C.I.A. for relevant documents, and in the last few days has received sworn statements from two more former agency officials who are also critical of Mr. Gates, said people who have seen the statements.
The White House, meanwhile, has sought to bolster Mr. Gates's standing by soliciting laudatory letters from four of the five former Directors of Central Intelligence.
After receiving phone calls from Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, Richard M. Helms, William E. Colby and William H. Webster wrote strongly supportive letters, while James R. Schlesinger praised the nominee, but added that he had no knowledge of whether accusations made against him were true. Stansfield Turner, who has privately told former colleagues of his opposition to the nomination, said he was not asked for his opinion.
In some instances in his rebuttal, Mr. Gates both narrowed the allegations and gave partial answers. For example, in denying that he repeatedly tried to insert accusations in agency documents that the Soviets had used a chemical toxin known as "yellow rain" in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia, he referred only to Afghanistan. And he said that there was only one instance, in 1985, in which an agency document referred to the subject of lethal chemicals.
But in a letter to the committee, Elisa D. Harris, a senior research analyst at the Brookings Institution and a leading expert on chemical and biological weapons, said that two State Department reports to Congress in 1982 made the accusation against the Soviets, using evidence provided by the C.I.A. The letter said that the accusations were also the subject of special interagency "estimates" produced by the C.I.A. under Mr. Gates's tenure. In addition, from 1984 on, the accusations were repeated in the President's annual reports to Congress on Soviet noncompliance with arms control agreements, she said.
"On the surface his response sounded pretty good, but Gates needs to be more truthful on what the agency line was on this issue," Ms. Harris said in an interview. "In my judgment, the judgments of the scientific community and a large part of the policy community, what the Reagan Administration called toxin warfare was, in fact, bee feces."
 
Denial of Ignoring Analysts' Objections
 In another instance, Mr. Gates denied the accusation that he endorsed, over the objections of his Soviet analysts, an estimate by an independent contractor accusing the Soviets of coordinating terrorist activities in Libya, Iran and Syria. He said that the estimate was written by a C.I.A. analyst, not a contractor, and that the result was a "useful" and "carefully drafted" document that was disputed only by the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
Former agency analysts say the report earned the nickname "the three stooges," because of its effort to link terrorist operations in the three countries. They recall that Wayne Limberg, a State Department official and former C.I.A. Soviet analyst, was instructed not to write any footnotes on the terrorism analysis, because Mr. Gates preferred that there be none. Mr. Gates denied that was so.
Since Mr. Gates's testimony, the committee has received a sworn statement from Mr. Limberg citing several instances in which he believed Mr. Gates slanted intelligence and suppressed dissent, people who have reviewed his statement say. He related, for example, an instance concerning a 1984 estimate on Soviet activity in the third world in which he said Mr. Gates instructed him to delete several footnotes stating that there were signs that the Soviets were rethinking their expansionist policy in the third world.
Mr. Gates also dismissed accusations that he influenced analysts on events in Nicaragua, a turbulent subject that provoked sharp disputes both within the C.I.A. and between the agency and outside intelligence organizations, like the State Department's intelligence bureau. But he limited his rebuttal to two points, denying that he inflated the successes of the contra rebels without supporting evidence between 1984 and 1986 and that he killed a paper that doubted the likelihood that the Soviets would send jet fighters to the Sandinista regime.
In his defense on the contra accusation, Mr. Gates cited two C.I.A. estimates on Nicaragua, one in 1985 and another in 1986. He said that each described "serious contra problems and forecast of further declines in effectiveness and unlikelihood of real improvement in contra performance."
Long before the issue of slanting intelligence arose at Mr. Gates's hearings, the House and Senate investigating committees examining the Iran-contra affair concluded in a November 1987 report that the C.I.A. under Mr. Casey "misrepresented or selectively used available intelligence to support the policy he was promoting, particularly in Central America."
But the record compiled in several investigations into the affair and the writings of several officials suggests that at times agency officials did inflate contra successes in recruiting fighters, magnify their difficulties in obtaining supplies and exaggerate the significance of Sandinista military incursions into Honduras as well as the threat of Soviet aid in the form of fighter jets.
 
Agency Perceptions About the Kremlin
 At times in his testimony, Mr. Gates selected one or two documents to support his point, while ignoring those that seemed damaging. For example, in rebutting the accusation that he and Mr. Casey created a view of the Soviet Union that ignored Soviet vulnerabilties, he referred to a memo he wrote in 1986. The memo spoke of his concern that the agency "was not being creative enough" in its analysis of Soviet economic and political developments, failing to give adequate attention to the achievements of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
What Mr. Gates did not mention was his own bleak view of Moscow that he detailed in more than a dozen speeches and articles between 1986 and 1988. His testimony that the agency was writing about Mr. Gorbachev's commitment to economic reform and his mixed record on political reform even before he came to power was at variance with accounts by Douglas J. MacEachin, the chief of the agency's arms control staff and a former head of Soviet analysis. Mr. MacEachin told the committee that the agency never approached the Soviet Union "as a society, and therefore, I think we were really not ready for the way to deal with the reactions when finally the lid did come up."
While Mr. Gates conceding under questioning that he should have done more, he said that he had trouble getting his economists to talk with respected emigres like Igor Birman, who has written several studies on the Soviet economy for the Defense Department.
But in December 1984, nearly two years before Mr. Gates's memo urging more creative analysis on the Soviet Union, Dr. Birman sent him a letter stating his opinion that the Soviet economy was not nearly as strong as the C.I.A. thought it was. In a second letter, Dr. Birman invited Mr. Gates to his home for "a dinner, Russian style," to discuss their differences. Instead, Mr. Birman said, he was interviewed in a rather cursory way by analysts who did not take his views seriously.
"I tried to tell Gates in the letter that his people were not convinceable," Mr. Birman said in an interivew. "Now he's castigating his people for not listening to me. Why couldn't he talk to me, especially since I was right?"
In his rebuttal, Mr. Gates also did not respond to a number of key accusations. These include the allegation that he misled the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about Soviet influence in Iran in January 1987, and that he verbally attacked an analyst for writing a report on the effect of sanctions in Libya that was inconsistent with American policy.
In those remarks, he did not seek to defend his memo to Mr. Casey in 1984 advocating the bombing of military targets in Nicaragua, nor did he mention a speech that he repeatedly gave in 1986 and 1987 that detailed Soviet expansionism in the third world despite the absence of intelligence data, although he later addressed those issues in questioning.
 
Convincing Rebuttal On Attack on Pope
 Mr. Gates's rebuttal, along with sworn statements of other agency employees, persuasively demonstrated that some actions attributed to him were actually undertaken by subordinates without his knowledge.
For example, Mr. Gates effectively parried Mr. Goodman's charges that he had stage-managed a 1985 study examining the likelihood of Soviet complicity in the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. Mr. Goodman said that Mr. Gates personally rewrote the paper's summary and conclusions, removing all references to inconsistencies that suggested the Soviets were not behind the shooting in 1981.
Mr. Gates provided four sworn statements of analysts who participated in the study. Each said that Mr. Gates, who ordered the project at Mr. Casey's request, played no personal role in recasting the report and never tried to influence the outcome.
Separately, the committee made public an internal C.I.A. review of how that agency had analyzed the question of who was behind the assassination attempt. The report, by a panel of three senior analysts, absolved Mr. Gates of trying to preordain the study's conclusions. But it found that entitling the paper "The Case for Soviet Involvement" had "stacked the deck" and concluded that managers beneath Mr. Gates did try to tailor their reports to the fit the preconceptions of their superiors.
Five of Mr. Gates's 20 points focused on a number of issues regarding Iran. The most contentious remains a 1985 interagency estimate that the Soviets were making inroads into an increasingly unstable Iran. The estimate was used by the White House as the basis for a directive to sell arms to Iran.
In his testimony, he acknowledged that he called Mr. Abramowitz, then the head of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, to persuade him not to dissent from the report in a footnote. Mr. Gates said that he, Mr. Casey and other senior intelligence officials believed the difference of view with the State Department was "so scant that it was unwarranted," adding that it only concerned the seriousness of Iran's instability, not Soviet opportunities.
Former and current State Department officials remember it differently. They said that their initial proposal included three dissenting footnotes to Mr. Gates, including one relating to Soviet influence. The officals added that there was so much concern about the thrust of the argument that when Graham Fuller, the National Intelligence Officer who drafted the estimate, wrote a subsequent paper on May 17 that laid out the situation in Iran in even starker terms, they wrote a critique of the paper to Secretary of State George P. Shultz complaining about the politicization of the process.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 20, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about Robert M. Gates's rebuttal of charges that he slanted intelligence information misidentified the Senate Intelligence Committee's source of statements from several analysts. At the committee's request, the analysts provided the statements, which concerned their role in a 1985 C.I.A. study assessing the likelihood of Soviet complicity in the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. The statements were not provided by Mr. Gates.

HEADLINE: State Assessment A 'Horrendous' Process

 BODY:
At a time of weak real-estate markets and disturbing increases in foreclosure rates, the New York State Equalization and Assessment Board is again seeking to perform its destructive "hatchet job" on the homeowners of Long Island by once more calling for reassessment of residential properties. In some unsuspecting areas where municipalities have acquiesced, it has been a painful and horrendous process.
 The state government has already done a great deal of harm here by forcing Long Island to bear the greatest brunt of the reduction in state aid to education of any area in the state, thereby causing increased taxes and major disruptions in education. 
The State of New York has also recently let the businessmen of Long Island down by reneging on last year's promises of economic development assistance which would have helped to increase employment and would have brought a lift to business here in general.
 For those who may not be aware, currently Nassau County performs the assessments, which remain constant until new construction is added. It is only the tax rate which we must thus keep our eye on.
 To consider (as the State E 7A would have us do) giving the County Board of Assessors the ability each year to use both increases in rates and assessments as a means of increasing the pipeline to our wallets would be a major blunder.
 Not only would such a system cost about $30 million to $40 million to initiate, but the constant instability would also cause a surge in foreclosures as has not yet been seen here.
 Who would then be interested in buying a home here? Who could afford to go on living here? The new families and the elderly would have to make tracks for some more affordable area elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Lieberman Thrives on His Fast-Paced Life

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
IN the quiet of his French country-style home in the Westville section of New Haven, Joseph I. Lieberman settled into a living- room chair and cradled a cup of tea. Cutting a lean, athletic figure in a denim-blue shirt and red tie, Connecticut's junior United States Senator said he had just returned from a conference in Budapest that explored the political transitions taking place in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. He said the region's academicians, writers and politicians were both tense and optimistic.
"Most people are worried about whether Yugoslavia is an indication of the whole region," he said. "The situation is very similar to a bottle with a cap on it with all sorts of pressures building up inside." 
 As he talked, his 3-year-old daughter, Hana, crossed back and forth through the room, followed closely by an au pair. Meanwhile, Mr. Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, a math and science-education researcher for the National Research Council, organized clothing for the family's return to Washington. The shuttle between New Haven and the Liebermans' town house in Georgetown, four miles from the Capitol, has been one of many adjustments the family has had to make since he was elected in 1988, he said.
 
'Invigorating and Incredible'
 The 49-year-old Democratic Senator, who marked his 1,000th day in office last month, described political life as a continuing exercise in research and development. He said his first term in the Senate has been highlighted by several major international events, like the fall of communism and the Persian Gulf war, and the opportunity to write several laws on environmental and consumer protection.
"It's been an invigorating and incredible two and a half years," Mr. Lieberman said.
Since narrowly defeating the incumbent, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., in 1988, Mr. Lieberman, formerly a State Senator and Attorney General, has been praised by members of both parties for his proficiency and grasp of issues. While his voting record is similar to that of his Democratic colleague, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Mr. Lieberman has shown an independent streak in several major areas.
He supported a cut in the capital-gains tax rate, which his party opposes, and an aggressive foreign policy. Last January, for example, the Senator became one of the handful of Democrats who voted to authorize military action in the Persian Gulf region. He also supported President Bush's use of military force in Panama in 1988.
On issues concerning the environment, Mr. Lieberman has helped to create several significant pieces of legislation. As a principal author of the 1990 Clean Air Act, he was instrumental in establishing a review board for toxic chemicals and an interstate commission in the Northeast to monitor air pollution and enforce regulations.
He noted that passing the air-quality law required a great deal of legislative wrestling. "The end result, I thought, was good," he said. "But to get there required a lot of compromising."
 
Worked for Alar's Withdrawal
 A member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Consumer and Environmental Affairs, Senator Lieberman wrote parts of the law passed last year that imposes penalties on companies that refuse to follow Government orders to clean up after oil spills.
He also wrote the Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990, which increases the number of investigators for the Environmental Protection Agency, and he served as a vital figure in legislation that led the Uniroyal Chemical Company of Middlebury to withdraw the ripening agent Alar from use on food. The chemical had been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.
An ardent spokesman against oil drilling in the Arctic National Refuge in Alaska, Mr. Lieberman said he would like to see less oil exploration and more Government tax incentives to encourage businesses to develop alternative energy sources, like solar and geothermal power. In May the Senate Energy Committee passed legislation that would allow drilling in the refuge, and the full Senate is expected to take the matter up this fall.
"To me, the Arctic National Refuge is one of those issues that says a lot about who we are as a country," he said. "The prospects of oil being found there are limited. And even if it is found, we can't justify the risk of destroying this unique system. Drilling in this natural resource is encouraging a policy that says we can't produce our way out of our energy problems."
Of particular interest to Connecticut residents is that the Senator was successful in urging the Environmental Protection Agency to create a Long Island Sound office, and he helped obtain $2.5 million for Federal studies of the Sound. In addition, last year he worked to establish the first National Historic Site in Connecticut at the J. Alden Weir Farm in Wilton and Ridgefield. Weir was a leader of the American Impressionist movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Mr. Lieberman has been a staunch critic of the national Democratic Party, saying it has retreated from its traditional emphasis on foreign policy and economic growth. While the party's commitment to social programs had been important, he said, it cannot regain the Presidency unless it begins developing policies to stimulate the economy, like Federal tax incentives for businesses and interest-free business loans, and encourages a strong economic and military presence abroad.
 
Constituents Opposed War
 "One of the biggest problems is that the Democratic Party has too often been seen not as an advocate but instead off on a tangent that really didn't matter to the great majority of people," he said. "And unfortunately, we're still going through that struggle."
Mr. Lieberman was one of only 10 Democrats who voted to authorize force in the Persian Gulf region last January, despite letters from Connecticut residents that overwhelmingly urged him to vote against such measures. During the war his home in New Haven was picketed by anti-war protesters five times, he said.
"It was a very serious time for me and an unsettling time for my family," he said. "It was the first time that I ever had to cast a vote that I knew would probably mean the lives of people.
"Yes, I listen to my constituents. But this was one time where I had to decide what was right. And there are simply times when governments have to use force to stop the bad to protect the good. And this was one of those times. And I hoped people would accept that."
One of the great lessons of the gulf war, he said, was the lack of Government control over the oil pricing system. Last spring Mr. Lieberman introduced a measure that aims to curtail price gouging by imposing a tax on oil companies' windfall profits.
Since taking office Senator Lieberman has conducted 17 town meetings across the state. His program of service to his constituents includes an office in Hartford and a van that has traveled to 55 communities to provide help and allow staff members to hear people's concerns.
 
Help for Lyme Disease Group
 After hearing the story of one Connecticut resident's ordeal with Lyme disease, Mr. Lieberman obtained $7 million for research and education on the illness. Karen Forshner, a Tolland resident, became infected with the disease while she was pregnant in 1985 and passed the bacterium to her son, who was born with severe disabilities.
Mrs. Forshner said in a recent telephone interview that at the time, lack of research prevented doctors from diagnosing her child with the disease until two years later. He died in June at the age of 6.
In 1988 Mrs. Forshner co-founded the Lyme-Borreliosis Foundation, a privately financed nonprofit group dedicated to educating the public about Lyme disease. With the help of Senator Lieberman, she said, she will be receiving $210,000 in Federal funds for an education campaign.
She added that before she talked with the Senator about the need for Lyme disease research, she had approached dozens of other government officials.
"Senator Lieberman was one of the few people who came through," she said. "He's the type of person who, when he tells you he's going to do something, he does it."
Before her son's death, Mr. Lieberman wrote her a handwritten note, she said, "to tell us he was there for us."
 
'A Time to Step Back'
 While in Washington, Mr. Lieberman said, most of his social time is spent with his family. An observant Jew, he remains deeply committed to his faith, he said. He did not campaign on the Sabbath but has worked on some Saturdays when there were votes in the Senate, he said.
The Sabbath is "a time to step back, reflect and appreciate what we have," he said. "For me it's a substantive celebration of life."
Mr. Lieberman said that one of the highlights of his recent trip to Europe with his wife was a stop in Prague, where Mrs. Lieberman was born. Her parents, who were Holocaust survivors, brought her to the United States when she was a small child. While she was growing up in New York City, Mrs. Lieberman recalled, her father would tell her stories about Prague and its people, and she longed to return.
"Going back there gave me the feeling that I had at last completed the cycle that my parents had started," she said. "Here we had survived Hitler, and now, after all this time, I was returning, married to a U.S. Senator. And that was a very special feeling."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Questions on Questions In 'The Engagement'

BYLINE: BY ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
TOM, Pat and Jeffrey agree that "marriage ruins friendships." So when their buddy, Tony, who has a "great business, money and all the women he wants," tells them he's going to get engaged to Susan, they set out to put a stop to that at once.
Even though Susan rejects Tony's roses and his ring, Jeffrey, a lawyer and a self-described "expert in relationships," knows just how to change their minds. He'll tell all: Sexual and financial transgressions. Names. Places. Dates. Details. Jeffrey, you see, keeps files on his friends. And on their girlfriends. On himself, too. He carries them around in his attache case. Just in case. 
 Don't ask why anyone would care to spend a couple of hours with the adolescent-fixated likes of Tom, Pat and Jeffrey. Especially Jeffrey. Or Tony. But then it isn't clear what they see in each other. Except that they like to "go out and break things."
In "The Engagement," which unaccountably opened the George Street Playhouse's new season, the playwright, Richard Vetere, fails to invest such off-putting characters with stage life, or for that matter, to validate their bonding. It's tough to find ways where he, positively, succeeds, save for those moments where the "guys" have moments of shared truths ("If you weren't my friend, I'd swear you were an idiot") or self-revelation ("I'm a selfish creep"), though one such declaration ("I'm no dope") is arguable.
For all that, it isn't just a playwright's faulty craftsmanship that casts an almost irredeemable pall over the proceedings. "The Engagement" raises questions, mostly rhetorical, unanswerable or just plain random and unavoidable, but distressing all the same. Innocuously inept plays may not invite such sorts; only insistently inept ones do.
Is theater a real alternative to television? What was on the tube the night we saw "The Engagement" and why did we miss it? What manner of works were rejected by the theater in favor of this play? Does this one reflect the sensibility of the George Street Playhouse and its audiences? Or is it just one of those crazy things?
Come to think of it, Rosemary Clooney's classy rendition of that Cole Porter standard is played at the top of the second act, before the pall is reset. It is in that second act, after the moment of redemption according to Porter and Clooney, that Mr. Vetere, with redundance rather than facility, makes it obvious the torturous first act was indeed leading up to something.
These emotional wrecks, who brag about "what women'll do," who know that "women say these things" and who insist that you "gotta take possession" of them, are really panic stricken by commitment. They get to have a meaningless little insight while, with a single possible exception, keeping their sexist sensibilities intact. There is a plot turn that should not be divulged though the theater's newsletter, in cavalier disregard for the denouement of Mr. Vetere's play, blows the whole thing, and in further disservice to the playwright, allows him to explain, with scant attention to economy or syntax, his reasons for writing "The Engagement."
Failing to differentiate between farce and fatuity, Mr. Vetere has contrived a series of sight gags that the director Matthew Penn, who appears unable to find a connection between one scene and another -- Melinda Mullins as Susan is lost in befuddlement at the end of two of them -- makes neither sense nor good nonsense of. Most incoherent is a desperate attempt to wring laughs from Jeffrey's plight, when he gets his hand caught in a mailbox during a rain storm, all the while trying to make a telephone call with the other.
Although Jeffrey is by far the play's most odious and finally buffoonish character, none are authenticated by interesting characterizations or stage worthy, as opposed to overheard, dialogue. Unsupported, the cast flounders, Miss Mullins especially, and ought not to be appraised by these performances, especially Joseph Siravo, whose exaggerated whining as a stereotype of an Italian restaurant owner is in itself cause for indignation.
Given such an appalling piece, one can even fault the extravagant production design -- three spiffy apartments, or parts thereof -- by Deborah Jasien. In an economic pinch, the mailbox and the phone booth were hardly necessary. Nor was the rain.
"The Engagement," by Richard Vetere, at the George Street Playhouse, 9 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick. Performances through next Sunday. Box office: (908) 246-7469.

HEADLINE: JACQUES OF ALL TRADES

BYLINE: By Antony J. Blinken; Antony J. Blinken is the author of "Ally Versus Ally: America, Europe and the Siberian Pipeline Crisis."

 BODY:
FRAMED ON THE podium by his former boss, President Francois Mitterrand of France, and Prime Minister John Major of Britain, Jacques Attali recites his acceptance speech impatiently, each cluster of words following too swiftly upon the echo of its predecessor. On this dreary spring day in London, the newly elected president of the equally new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (or BERD, in the French acronym) gives, delivery aside, a typically high-flying performance. With the flags of 39 nations as a backdrop, he tells his listeners that the bank, born in Attali's fertile brain a mere two years ago to guide the transition of the Soviet Union and the rest of Eastern Europe to capitalism and democracy, will be "the first institution of the post-cold-war period . . . the first institution of a united Europe . . . the first institution of the new world order."
The heads of state and finance ministers from the BERD's member countries strain in vain to keep up with the soaring rhetoric. Attali, whose owlish face turns handsome when animated, spews out references to Spinoza, Tolstoy, Hobbes, Voltaire, Goethe, Kafka and Sakharov. He ends with a prayer that the bank will one day help "700 million Europeans unite in a single ideal of peace, tolerance and light." 
 Later, in an interview, Attali reflects on the symbolism of his creation. "It's important," he says, "that the first organization to gather all the European nations [along with the United States, Japan, Canada and a smattering of smaller states] is a bank." The BERD does neatly underscore the ascendancy, throughout Europe, of the idea of market economy, and, it is hoped, the idea of democracy. Atop the symbol, though, rests a delicious irony: the man tapped to teach Eastern Europe the joys of capitalism is the very same fellow who, as Mitterrand's chief adviser, helped lead the charge to nationalize France's economy in the early 80's. In Attali, the West is banking on a Socialist to bail out Eastern Europe.
Attali's political past, his tendency to infuriate staid international bureaucrats with visionary discourse and his utter lack of banking experience have made the BERD's beginnings volatile. The European press lampoons him as a pretentious, autocratic intellectual who sees the bank as his personal fief. Many diplomats denounce him, off the record, as an "outrageous" choice to head Europe's largest international institution.
At the same time, the BERD is struggling to take flight in increasingly difficult conditions. Conceived amid the general euphoria over the collapse of the Berlin wall, the bank begins life just as the reality of Eastern Europe's economic predicament sinks in with Western leaders. "There's a fear," says a high-ranking United States Treasury Department official, "that the BERD will turn out to be an impotent bureaucracy led by a loose cannon." Or, as The Economist put it in one of its many stinging critiques of "Mr. Attali's bank": "If the [BERD] did not exist, it would not need inventing."
Such aggressive skepticism does not appear to give Attali pause. The very fact of chaos in Eastern Europe should allow his institution to thrive. Indeed, after the aborted Soviet coup, the question of economic aid to the East has become the focus of debate in the West. "It's concentrated the minds of policy makers on the need to help stabilize democracy in the Soviet Union and throughout the East," Attali says. The BERD -- the sole international financial institution to which all the Eastern European nations except Albania belong -- has a lead role to play in defining the sum and substance of Western assistance. As a result, and not for the first time, the bank's effervescent president finds himself center stage in what promises to be a compelling and long-running drama.
ALONG WITH A KNACK FOR ATTRACTING unfriendly fire, Jacques Attali (pronounced ah-ta-lee) has an uncanny ability to turn talk into fact, and such a distressingly wide range of activities and interests that he cannot be pigeonholed. His undeniable brilliance and almost frightening energy lead even naysayers to concede that Attali could make the BERD an effective force for progress in Eastern Europe.
Born in Algeria in 1943, Attali moved to Paris at age 12 when his father, a prosperous perfume merchant, concluded that the anti-colonial sentiment in the country had all the makings of a bloodbath. Attali's parents were determined that he and his twin brother, Bernard -- who now presides over Air France -- should succeed. The Attalis were the kind of parents who, when the children complained of boredom, responded, "Don't you have anything to read?"
Armed with six languages and degrees from four of France's top universities, Attali joined Mitterrand's team in 1974 and quickly became the Socialist leader's eminence brun. A skilled teacher, he bolstered Mitterrand's presidential credibility by making an overly literary politician economically literate. When Mitterrand won the presidency in 1981, he installed Attali in an office next to his own; visitors, including the Prime Minister, had to pass through Attali's office to get to Mitterrand's. When not feeding Mitterrand ideas -- "for every 10, I use one," the President once said -- Attali churned out books, some 16 to date. These he continues to write from 4 to 7 every morning. Among his subjects: the history of time; changing conceptions of property rights and the relationship of music to the political culture. He is also the author of two best-selling novels: one will soon become a television mini-series and the other has been bought for the movies. Married to a former model, Elisabeth Allain, and the father of two sons, Attali often appears at several social functions an evening -- unless it's Friday. A religious Jew, he occasionally stops his relentless charge through life to observe the Sabbath.
Until Attali left the Elysee Palace in April, Mitterrand was the prime beneficiary of his aide's facile conversation and erudition. "In the course of a two-page memo on a transportation strike, Jacques would somehow bring in French Surrealist literature and cybernetics," an admiring former colleague says. President and adviser met daily and played golf together weekly. Mitterrand had Attali attend Cabinet meetings and entrusted him with being his "sherpa" at the major international economic and political summits.
During his decade at the Elysee, Attali had so many ideas that one commentator called his mind "not simply fecund, but incontinent." When thousands were left dead by flooding in Bangladesh in 1988, Attali urged the building of a multibillion-dollar system of dams and canals, to be overseen by satellite. He championed the Eureka project, a high-technology alliance of European countries. Sensitive to Mitterrand's edifice complex, Attali talked up the idea of a new national library for Paris, which will be the world's largest book repository. And it was Attali who thought to link the 1989 Paris economic summit with the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution, providing the President with a term's worth of dramatic photo opportunities.
Critics charge that Attali excels mostly at appropriating the clever thoughts of others. "He fancies himself a man of ideas. Unfortunately, they are rarely his own," one journalist, Franz-Olivier Giesbert, wrote about Attali in "Le President," his generally authoritative account of the Mitterrand reign. Giesbert's chapter on Attali, an unambiguous hatchet job, still feeds dinner-party talk in Paris. He portrays the "special counselor" as an emotionally erratic, possessive figure, fawningly obsessed with his boss's comings and goings. Giesbert accuses Attali of taking up golf solely to be able to tee off with the President. When Attali, who had in fact persuaded Mitterrand to learn the game, complained about Giesbert's book to his boss, Mitterrand is said to have answered with a sigh, "You, Jacques, are only one chapter. I am the entire volume."
FORCED TO CHOOSE among his many pursuits, Attali describes himself as "a writer first and foremost." Considering the odd hours he is able to devote to his craft, he has been remarkably successful. Most of his books are best sellers and receive laudatory reviews. His first novel, "Eternal Life" (1989), a sort of allegorical history of the world, sold more than 100,000 copies in France and evoked blurbs of which publishers dream. Bernard Pivot, the television personality who has been the principal arbiter of French literary taste for the past 15 years, admires Attali's body of work. "It's not that he's a great stylist," Pivot says. "He's a compelling author because you sense in the amazing range of his writing the passion of a man for his century." And for other centuries: his latest best seller is a history of the year 1492.
Not all of Attali's prose is so praiseworthy. His economic essays can be plagued by jargon -- rich on formulas, poor on specifics. Michel Rocard, the former Prime Minister now favored to succeed Mitterrand in 1995, found "The Word and the Tool" (1975) "difficult to read . . . to such an extent that doubt sets in."
Then there was the scandal that arose in 1982 over "Histories of Time." A number of well-read reviewers noted that Attali had reproduced passages from other writers' works without quotation marks. Attali's explanation has been that he goes through "about 40 drafts of each book, and on the 30th revision of that one, the citations in question accidentally got dropped." The critics were unmerciful. "Let's try to imagine what the author's pre-dawn writing sessions are like," wrote Daniel Rondeau in the daily Liberation. "In the still of the night, the noise of his scissors is no doubt more audible than the quill of his pen."
Attali's most recent essay, "Millennium," is a good and provocative read. In the book, he warns that the United States, faced with declines in manufacturing, infrastructure, health care and education on top of increasing crime, drugs and homelessness, risks becoming a junior partner to Japan in economic competition with a unified Europe. Some readers have scoffed at this thesis, seeing in the gulf war victory a reaffirmation of American prowess. Attali stands by the argument, insisting that his essay is not wishful thinking but a warning, "It's a bit like the Bible where there are two kinds of prophets -- those who say what they want to see happen, and those who say what they don't want to see happen so people will react to prevent it," he told me. "I'm trying to get people concerned about the increasing fragility of the American industrial system, which is in no one's interest."
TO GOVERN, BUT to leave big capital, the No. 1 enemy of Socialism, intact, would be absurd," Mitterrand wrote just prior to his 1981 election. In the first months of the new administration, Attali urged his boss to pursue the Socialist economic platform that elected him. The Government promptly nationalized five industrial groups, the 36 largest banks and two major financial holding companies. Half-measures were not acceptable: instead of taking 51 percent participations in the target companies, as some moderate Socialists advocated, Mitterrand, guided by Attali, had the state claim 100 percent stakes. Taking into account equity and interest payments, the French Government would be contractually obligated over the next 15 years to set aside about one-third of its annual budget to fund the buying spree.
Less than two years later, with unemployment swelling, the franc anemic and the economy sputtering, Mitterrand tossed Socialist dogma by the wayside. The Government instituted a draconian austerity program, pushed through a tax cut, devalued the franc and switched its "profit is evil" rhetoric to something approximating "greed is good." At the President's side throughout this radical break with Socialist economics, whispering in his ear, was none other than Jacques Attali.
Today, Attali -- who calls himself a "social democrat," not a "socialist" -- insists that there was no flip-flop in 1983, that he and Mitterrand remained true to their principles. "When we came to power, we undertook a major structural and social reform: abolition of the death penalty, decentralization, retirement at 60, the 39-hour work week, the nationalizations. No one has called these reforms into question, and we never retreated from them. The austerity program was not a structural reform, it was the politics of conjuncture."
To listen to Attali, the nationalizations were less an ideological imperative than a clever ploy to transform France from a nation of passive landowners to one of aggressive investors. "We were faced with a situation very particular to France, which was that people invested in real estate, not in stocks. There were no private investors to put money into industry. If the state hadn't become a shareholder, we would have been obliged to sell our companies, bit by bit, to foreigners." The former owners of the nationalized companies, pockets bulging with billions of the Government's francs, moved quickly into the stock market. "France has finally developed a modern economy and real financial markets, so it would be unnecessary to go the nationalization route today," Attali says. "What we did was not a question of ideology, but of necessity at that time."
IN 1985, ATTALI RAISED eyebrows by publishing a flattering portrait of Sir Siegmund Warburg, one of the century's great capitalists, and thus a curious object of praise from a left-leaning intellectual. Titled "A Man of Influence," the biography almost obsequiously traces the career of a personality whose most notable contribution to the world of banking was the hostile takeover. "The British Aluminum takeover that Warburg masterminded happened in the mid-1950's in London, not the 1980's in New York," Attali explains. "It was an incredibly reactionary and closed-off environment, and Warburg shook things up. He was an instrument of economic democracy, saying that business doesn't belong to the managers, but to the shareholders. In the 1980's, people used a technique he invented for very different ends."
Attali seems especially fascinated by Warburg's ability to influence events without holding elective office. "He managed to blend political power, financial innovation, creativity and morality," Attali says. Indeed, he concludes in the book that "over the last two centuries, the individual with the most clear-cut influence is the financier." Little wonder, then, that the one job compelling enough to draw Attali away from his privileged position next to Mitterrand was the presidency of a bank with the potential to help shape the economic and political future of Europe.
As he readily admits, Attali is no banker. While "A Man of Influence" succeeds admirably as a history of merchant banking, it also reveals its author's modest comfort level with the nuts and bolts of finance. In his new job, Attali vows to surround himself with technocrats and to concentrate on issues of "macro" policy. That declaration, however, has something of the ring of a George Steinbrenner promise to leave the managing to his managers.
"WHEN YOU'RE THE adviser to a President, you don't have ideas, the President does," Attali responds when asked the genesis of the BERD. In fact, French Treasury Department officials acknowledge that the bank was Attali's concept. In early November 1989, he told Treasury Director Jean-Claude Trichet to flesh out the structure for an organization that would rebuild the economies of Eastern Europe. A month later, Mitterrand submitted his Treasury's quickly drawn plan to the 11 other members of the European Community, and they gave France the authority to convene a conference to negotiate the details.
From the start, American officials were skeptical of the need for a new development bank, particularly one in which the Soviet Union would be a shareholder. France, however, was able to capitalize on the general desire in the West to help the nascent democracies of the East, and became the first country to make a concrete proposal. "The French were the only players on the field," says an aide to Theo Waigel, the German Finance Minister. "There were no competing proposals."
By securing support from the European Community first, and then inviting the Americans to the negotiating conference, the French cleverly presented Washington with a fait accompli: the bank was going to happen with or without American participation. "We wanted America to play an important role," Attali says. "But it's like throwing a dinner party -- if one of the guests can't make it, you don't cancel the dinner."
After six months of negotiations, the participating countries agreed on the bank's basic structure and mission. They also made London the headquarters for the bank, and Attali the president-designate. While the United States is the largest single contributor-shareholder with a 10 percent stake, the countries of the European Community, together with the European Commission and the European Investment Bank, control 51 percent of the shares. Even the Eastern European borrowing countries, including the Soviet Union, had to put up some money -- in return for 13.5 percent of the shares. Just how the Soviet shares and voting power will be apportioned within the disintegrating union is a question with which bank officials are now grappling.
The BERD has tremendous flexibility in deciding how to use its $13 billion in capital, of which $3 billion has already been paid in: it may lend money to public or private companies, take equity positions in new ventures, underwrite securities issues and provide training and technical assistance. At Washington's insistence, at least 60 percent of its resources must be devoted to the private sector, or sectors "in the process" of being privatized. Finally and uniquely, the bank has an expressly political mandate. To be eligible for investment or assistance, a country must be "committed to the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics." Yugoslovia and some of the soon-to-be-independent, but authoritarian-minded, Soviet republics may prove interesting test cases for these requirements. In short, the BERD is a hybrid investment-development bank with a hefty political stick -- in Attali's words, "one-third Lazard, one-third World Bank and one-third European Community."
During the negotiating sessions, American officials grew alarmed when the Attali-drafted bylaws placed excessive power in the presidency: there would be no second-in-command, and the president would decide all major issues of policy, hiring and firing. With the bank a reality, the Bush Administration began to throw its weight around, insisting on establishing a resident, 23-member board of directors with power of approval over each bank project. Washington also demanded that the BERD hire an American as second-in-command -- a post accepted in June by a Salomon Brothers managing director, Ronald M. Freeman.
Attali goes out of his way to insist that relations between the United States and the BERD are just peachy. But American officials privately complain that the bank's president has an unfortunate tendency to put his foot in Washington's mouth. Upon taking office, Attali announced that the bank would soon begin to "privatize Moscow." This is just the sort of grandiose proclamation cautious American diplomats abhor. "The problem with Jacques," a State Department official says, "is that you just can't take your eyes off him."
Indeed, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's remarks at the BERD's opening sounded very much like a warning that Washington planned to keep its sights trained on its unpredictable friend. "The board of directors should be fully involved and informed," Brady said. "We do not view the activity of the board as advisory, but as a critical element of the bank's operations." Although Attali claims to delight in a powerful board ("Why shouldn't I," he says. "I'm its chairman"), it's hard to imagine how a cumbersome decision-making process can benefit a bank that fancies itself "one-third Lazard." Besides, the petty flaps over power obscure a much more important issue: in the shambles of Eastern Europe, can this bank make a real difference?
CARSTEN GERLACH is the pizza delivery king of Germany. Educated in America, he learned firsthand there is money to be made bringing fast food to people's doors. In 1988, he opened his first delivery outlet, in Hamburg; today, he runs an 19-store franchise, and boasts the highest sales revenues in what used to be West Germany. But Gerlach has given up for the time being his attempts to bring pizza to East German homes. A market analysis last year revealed that only about 10 percent of East Germans have telephones. "Even if they wanted to order our pizza," Gerlach says, "they could not."
From telephones and highways to capital markets and legal codes, Eastern Europe lacks the basic infrastructures necessary for capitalist seed to take. Estimates of the cost to build or refurbish these nations' physical plants and to clean up their environments are staggering; most experts talk in the hundreds of billions, and even trillions, of dollars. Reforms like defining property and ownership rights -- prerequisites to foreign investment -- will demand lots of two other commodities: time and will.
Meanwhile, the dislocations provoked by fundamental restructuring, whether political or economic, make for an uninviting investment climate. In what remains of the Soviet Union, Western entrepreneurs do not know with whom to deal -- the central government, the republics, municipalities, private companies -- or whether their interlocutors of today will be around tomorrow. Restructuring also soaks up resources that otherwise could be used for productive investment. In 1990, Bonn invested $26 billion in eastern Germany solely for unemployment benefits; this year, the projected outlay for this safety net is $34 billion.
The disintegration of the old Comecon trading system sorely aggravates Eastern Europe's dire straits. The Soviet Union had been the most important trading partner for its former satellites; its present difficulties have effectively decimated bilateral trade. Hungarian exports to the Soviet Union are down 85 percent from one year ago, Poland's have slipped 80 percent. Given the shoddy quality of goods produced in Eastern Europe, Western markets won't be taking up the slack any time soon.
The BERD, with its $13 billion in capital, is not the panacea for Eastern Europe's ills. To be sure, Attali and his lieutenants understand this. In taking small, 10 to 15 percent participations in many projects, they aim to make the bank a catalyst to private sector and Western development bank activity, thereby generating about 10 times its capital in investments. They also intend to emphasize training and technical assistance in the early going, and to devote bank resources to building basic infrastructures like transportation and telecommunications.
Longer term, Attali maintains, the bank's relatively limited funds -- to be fortified by borrowing on the capital markets -- will not prove a handicap. Because of a paucity of consumer goods, most Eastern European countries have substantial internal savings. The BERD's mission is to help them, together with other Western investors, find or create productive outlets for their money. "We should be less an institution of finance than of influence," Attali says.
One important area where the BERD could wield influence without having to write a check is market access. A General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade report in April took the European Community to task for blocking foreign imports in an effort to protect its markets. The report underscored the deleterious impact such barriers have on Eastern Europe's economies. For example, the very areas the European Community tries most to insulate -- agriculture, steel and textiles -- represent 50 percent of Poland's exports to the E.C. "We can't help these countries with one hand," Attali says, "and then stop them from exporting to our markets with the other."
Still, the region's problems are vast, and the BERD small. Rather than feeding a new bureaucracy, it is argued, the West's money could be better spent on existing institutions like the I.M.F., the World Bank or its affiliate, the International Finance Corporation. The BERD's officers have grown accustomed to this criticism, parrying it with a litany of reasons why their institution is unique. They note that most Eastern European countries do not belong to the other organizations, that no other bank requires beneficiaries to meet political criteria, that the BERD's investment-development bank structure allows for greater flexibility and that the I.M.F. and World Bank were designed to help the third world, which has not, up to now, included Eastern Europe.
Typically, Attali emphasizes a somewhat grander, and more abstract, raison d'etre for the bank. The BERD -- which he insists on calling "the European Bank" -- is "first and foremost a political response to a new situation in Europe. We needed to create an organization where all the nations of Europe could meet. Just as the European Coal and Steel Community in the 1950's served as the embryo for the Common Market, the European Bank signals a continent-wide raising of consciousness to build a peaceful political future."
It's a lofty, admirable goal, but one that makes Attali's American and European partners nervous. Where they see a bank, he sees the blueprint for a "greater Europe." The world needs visionaries who dare to imagine the future, and even more those who, like Attali, can begin to deliver on their dreams. The BERD is a reality. Its first president must now take care that in guiding his creation, he does not blind himself with his own, brilliant light.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
'Grace for Grace': A Performing Space Gets Into the Act

BYLINE: By ROBERT WILSON

 BODY:
On Saturday, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in upper Manhattan will present "Grace for Grace," an evening of music, dance and dramatic readings staged by Robert Wilson. Featured artists include Jessye Norman, in Spanish lullabies, and Philip Glass, in excerpts from "Einstein on the Beach." Here, Mr. Wilson discusses his conception.
Last Spring, when I was asked to stage a performance at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, I was excited for two reasons. First, working in Europe as much as I do, I am always grateful for an opportunity to work in New York, my hometown. Second, as an artist who directs and designs for the theater, I have long believed that new avenues must be sought for the presentation of theater, new spaces explored beyond the traditional venues. This is vital for the continual development of the art. 
 The theater world is undergoing hard times. With financing becoming more scarce, there are fewer and fewer places for artists to work. Where can young people come together to develop new work? When I started in the theater, in the mid-60's, the most exciting work for me in New York was taking place at Judson Memorial Church. St. John, like Judson, is committed to broadening its role in the community by providing support and a venue for cultural programs. In doing so, it serves as a model for a true social "center" for the city.
As a student at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, I designed a model for a city that consisted of an apple with a crystal cube in its center. This cube represented a window to a world wherein, ideally, people from all social backgrounds, regardless of political, religious or philosophical beliefs, could congregate to exchange ideas and learn from one another. People would assemble briefly, then return, taking the experience they had shared to their communities.
Theater can serve this function because it is a forum for ideas. It can have poetry, philosophy, politics, economics. What modern cities most need are centers -- forums -- from which all forms of expression can radiate.
This is a role St. John has strived to maintain for more than a century. Its founders insisted that the new cathedral should serve as "a house of prayer for all nations." This vision has proved prophetic, as both the surrounding neighborhood and the city itself have become truly multiracial, multinational and multilingual. Saturday evening's program will reflect this identity, bringing together artists from diverse backgrounds and disciplines who will reflect the culturally variegated audience that is New York.
Upon returning to the cathedral last summer, I became fascinated with the opportunity of staging "Grace for Grace" so that the building itself becomes a participant. Its sense of space is enormous; the structure stretches over 600 feet from one end to the other, the equivalent of two football fields, and in the nave the ceiling rises 124 feet. The lighting will not only highlight the performers but also bring the architectural space into play: the rising piers, the curving arches, the stained-glass windows, the open spaces and the shadows.
The performance will take place "around" the audience, so that everyone attending becomes a participant, not just an observer. Clearly, what one person sees from the great choir in front of the high altar will differ from what another sees from the nave. Some things will be seen, others only heard. It may not be possible to know where the sound is coming from at any one moment.
What emerges from this collaboration between diverse performers and a monumental performing space is sure to include some surprises.

HEADLINE: The Struggling Writer: Gissing Had It Right

BYLINE: By George Packer; George Packer is the author of "The Village of Waiting," a memoir about Africa, and the novel "The Half Man," which will be published this month.

 BODY:
If you're one of the millions of Americans trying to launch or advance a literary career -- with the mix of elation, envy, self-loathing, paranoia and arrogance that seems to be the writer's normal frame of mind -- you should read a few pages of George Gissing's diary. It is a record of 15 years, 1887-1902, in the life of a Victorian novelist; begun when Gissing was 30 years old, and ending a year before his death in 1903, and its 500 pages of entries go by with a devastating sameness. Their accumulated effect seems to say: This is what it amounts to.
"Thursd. Nov. 20. Dull, rainy, warm. Morning did nothing. Went to Museum to get particulars of pneumonia, for Reardon's death. Wrote from 2:30 to 9, doing 4 pp. -- A steamroller at work all day down in the street; maddening. 
 "Frid. Nov. 21. Dull, rainy. Did 4 pp.
"Sat. Nov. 22. My wretched birthday. Sunshine in morning, changing to rain. Am 33 yrs old. Letters from Mother, Madge and Edith. Did 4 pp."
As in Gissing's novels, the weather is always foul, the mood always depressed. It starts to sound a little comical, Woody Allenish -- until you come across an entry that would strike any writer a blow of recognition: "Again blank discouragement. Have no heart to write details." And yet somehow the four pages get done, and in those 15 years Gissing published 19 long books that no one reads anymore. A visit to the Gissing shelf in the library stacks can be almost as upsetting as a look at his diary: near the bottom of a wall of English literature I found all those uniform triple-decker novels standing in a dignified row, and not one of them checked out in the last five years. Except "New Grub Street," Gissing's masterpiece about London literary life in the 1880's, which he wrote in two rainy months and which has its 100th wretched birthday this year.
Even "New Grub Street" (the title refers to London's Grub Street, which, Gissing noted, became known in the 18th century as the "abode, not merely of poor, but of insignificant, writers") is hardly famous, though it deserves to be, as do "The Odd Women," "Born in Exile," "In the Year of Jubilee" and "The Whirlpool." Gissing is third-rate in the second-rate qualities and first-rate in the first-rate ones. He has little stylistic grace (Joyce compared his style to a "Triestine noodle and bean soup"), only a rare grim wit and none of the inventive energy of his idol Dickens: the form of the three-volume novel that set Dickens free was an intolerable burden for Gissing. Q. D. Leavis wrote that Gissing "is an example of how disastrous it may be for a writer whose talent is not of the first order to be born into a bad tradition. . . . The absence of what now enables anyone in Bloomsbury to write a readable novel made Gissing's efforts mostly futile."
Fill in New York or Iowa for Bloomsbury and that statement is even truer today. The careful second-rate qualities we write and read for -- perfect-pitch dialogue, the choice word for the choice detail for the choice nuance, luminous lyricism -- Gissing couldn't do. He gets no nice effects. He's worth reading for other hard-won qualities: a strong empathy with almost all his characters, especially the women, broadened and deepened by a grasp of the way ideas shape experience and social forces overwhelm the individual. Gissing was willing to risk suffering, to face private pain and social pain, poverty and its quiet humiliations. While correcting the page proofs of "New Grub Street," he wrote to his brother: "I am astonished to find how well it reads. There are savage truths in it." Even at its most graceless, his writing has a quality of deeply felt, honestly earned truth that can't be guaranteed by any M.F.A. degree. To write it well, he had to endure it first. The wilderness of diary entries turns out to be a stamp of authenticity, the key to whatever greatness Gissing has.
Almost all his novels are about a single subject: the cost of poverty and social isolation to people of intelligence and sensitivity. They're full of thin-skinned novelists in garrets; bright, passionate, unmarriageable young women; lower-middle-class intellectuals torn with hatred and sympathy for the poor and hatred and envy for the rich -- victims of a perverse, money-soaked social order that they can neither enter nor reject. Orwell said, "Gissing's novels are a protest against the form of self-torture that goes by the name of respectability," but the protest is muted by the fact that Gissing himself partly craved respectability. He might have been a socialist if he'd had more money; instead, the vision is of endurance and defeat. "New Grub Street" carries it to almost unbearable intensity.
If such concerns and lives seem dated, that helps explain Gissing's obscurity. He was no genius, but he was the next best thing: a writer fully awake to the conflicts and illusions of his own age. He understood what it meant to be alive in a time when the pursuit of money had begun to rot the moral base of daily life, even of literature. Yet one reason for marking the centennial of "New Grub Street" is that, on its lower frequencies, I think the novel has something to do with us. Because Gissing's nose for corruption and personal deterioration is so strong, "New Grub Street" acts as a mirror that distorts and simultaneously reveals, at a time when there may be no one able or willing to do it, the features of a writer -- of anyone -- struggling to maintain integrity in our own age.
In "New Grub Street," literature has become nothing more than a product. It still carries whiffs of pretense and higher purpose, but Gissing -- a great boiler-down of things -- shows that the sediment at the bottom is hardly different from cloth or mutton. Any writer who doesn't grasp and accept this is bound to be destroyed. Jasper Milvain, a literary journalist on his way up, lives by it, and he articulates the brutal truth better than anyone: "Literature nowadays is a trade. Putting aside men of genius, who may succeed by mere cosmic force, your successful man of letters is your skillful tradesman. He thinks first and foremost of the markets; when one kind of goods begins to go off slackly, he is ready with something new and appetizing."
Milvain's rise is paralleled by the fall of Edwin Reardon, Gissing's pale hero, a novelist whose first few books showed signs of talent. But Reardon is doomed, for several reasons: he takes his work seriously, he is not a genius, he lacks hard drive, and (worst of all) he has married a woman of conventional middle-class ambitions. Gissing believed that such women could never tolerate the mean life that marriage to a man in his own position would entail (and his two marriages to working-class women -- the second nuptial came as "New Grub Street" was being printed -- were both disasters). Reardon's wife, Amy, is attractive and intelligent, but her interest in his work soon shows itself to be snobbish and mercenary. She wants to be the wife of a famous and wealthy writer.
When we meet him, Reardon is in a state of mental exhaustion. The demands of the expensive life he's tangled himself in have all but killed his creative powers, and for a chapter we watch him "racking his fagged brain in a hopeless search for characters, situations, motives." The novel he's hacking away at has clearly died but he can't afford to abandon it, and his self-contempt and failure of nerve have paralyzed him. Nothing comes. For hours on end he fidgets, dips his pen in ink, and stares at a sheet on which "Chapter III" and nothing else is written. The sun goes down; he puts his head on his desk.
Amy enters the room, exasperated: "What is the matter?" she demands, "Why can't you get on with the story?" When Reardon lays bare the reasons, her reply echoes Jasper Milvain: "Art must be practiced as a trade, at all events in our time. This is the age of trade. Of course if one refuses to be of one's time, and yet hasn't the means to live independently, what can result but break-down and wretchedness?" There can't be a more painful picture of that failure of confidence known as writer's block anywhere in English literature. Some of the phrases come straight out of Gissing's diary.
I've read "New Grub Street" twice, and the difference in my responses says a great deal about the special power of this book for the class of humanity that calls itself writers. The first was four years ago, during a time when I particularly welcomed cynicism and squalor; so I relished "New Grub Street" with a morbid pleasure and recommended it to a number of friends -- including ones who, like me, had literary ambitions. In other words, the novel didn't find me at the level where the most private desire and self-knowledge and pain lurk.
Then I began to make part of my living by writing, to go through long periods when, like Gissing, I had no heart to write details. I reread the novel recently, and this time I hesitated suggesting it to anyone -- least of all to young writers. Coming upon the passage of Reardon's impotence, where he cries: "I am at the mercy of my brain; it is dry and powerless. How I envy those clerks who go by to their offices in the morning!" I felt a sort of numbness spread from my spine through my limbs. It seemed actually dangerous to go on. Gissing had bored into me like a high-speed drill, not just because he described failure so well but because he understood from the inside out why people fail.
Somehow Reardon gets back to work, like a kicked machine, "ticking off his stipulated quantum of manuscript" as if he were simply milling paper. He finishes the novel, which he knows is awful, and summons the energy to give it the title "Margaret Home"; his publisher accepts it because of his previous success, but at reduced price; Reardon then squeezes out a novel that isn't even publishable. And his writing life is over. So is his marriage, though Victorian Puritanism draws the agony out. When her husband abandons his trade, Amy refuses to join him in the obscurity of a clerk's life and goes back to the genteel home of her mother, whose horror at Reardon's failure is matched by her mortification at the prospects of a divorce. Reardon takes lodging in a slum and sinks into bleak poverty.
Jasper Milvain has foreseen all this in the first chapter. And from the first scene between Reardon and Amy there is a feeling of inevitability. We know Milvain will make it, we know Reardon won't, we know Amy will leave him. Then what makes "New Grub Street" such compelling reading? One answer is its array of characters, all snared in the literary world Gissing knows so vividly. There's Whelpdale, an amiable flatterer who rises from writing fiction to teaching it and on up to marketing it through a literary agency, before achieving his final apotheosis as editor of a weekly that runs no articles longer than two inches. There's Reardon's friend Harold Biffen, a half-starved novelist who is painstakingly, cheerfully recording the "ignobly decent" details of modern life in a tome called "Mr. Bailey, Grocer." Biffen is too poor to marry, but in Gissing's hands no good-hearted character can stay happy for long.
There's Alfred Yule, "a battered man of letters" who once cared for books but has been reduced by decades in the trenches of criticism to pedantry and jealous grudges. Nothing stirs him more than hearing that his archrival Fadge's weekly magazine has inadvertently run contradictory reviews of the same novel. Yule brings to mind a tenured English professor living on low-stakes intrigues and bile; his daughter, Marian, foreshadows the Ph.D. drudge -- except that it's her own father, and not a degree, that she slaves for. Marian is one of Gissing's most sympathetic creations, doubly victimized as literary grunt and female. If she had somehow landed among the independent working women of "The Odd Women," Gissing's novel about feminism, she might have found a degree of fulfillment. But in the world of New Grub Street she spends her hours among the underfed residents of the British Museum reading room, which Gissing imagines, for once, with the metaphorical power of Dickens:
"The fog grew thicker; she looked up at the windows beneath the dome and saw that they were a dusky yellow. Then her eye discerned an official walking along the upper gallery, and in pursuance of her grotesque humor, her mocking misery, she likened him to a black, lost soul, doomed to wander in an eternity of vain research along endless shelves. Or again, the readers who sat here at these radiating lines of desks, what were they but hapless flies caught in a huge web, its nucleus the great circle of the Catalogue? Darker, darker. From the towering wall of volumes seemed to emanate visible motes, intensifying the obscurity; in a moment the book-lined circumference of the room would be but a featureless prison-limit."
Marian has the misfortune to see the utter futility of all this writing -- "exhausting herself in the manufacture of printed stuff which no one even pretended to be more than a commodity for the day's market."
A lesser novelist, one more victim to his own self-pity (a quality Gissing himself exhibits in other novels), would have divided this story into decent failures and vicious successes. No such pleasure here. Milvain, though crassly ambitious, has enough energy and frankness to attract Marian, and enough sensitivity to be attracted to her. However, cool calculation wins out and he dumps her for Amy Reardon. "If I were rich," he tells Marian bitterly, "I should be a generous and good man." Amy herself is a creature of the late Victorian social system, no more evil than a Dallas debutante who would refuse to move with her boyfriend into a slum. Reardon has integrity but -- unlike Gissing -- no guts to back it up.
In the long scenes where Reardon quarrels with Amy, what strikes me is not who is right or wrong but how completely they fail to understand each other and how much Gissing understands about both. He seems to know things that a Victorian shouldn't -- for example, that Reardon would begin to hate the baby that Amy has given him after she transfers her affection from Reardon to it. When she finally leaves him, Reardon sits reading the paper "and became quite interested in the report of a commercial meeting in the City, a thing he would never have glanced at under ordinary circumstances" -- "a sign," Irving Howe says, "of the novelist's true power: to notice so accurately the mechanical gestures of a man left numb by sorrow."
When Milvain proposes to Marian, straightforwardly but without much passion, her disappointment is subtly edged with self-awareness and self-deception: "She did not want truth such as this; she would have preferred that he should utter the poor, common falsehoods."
Such moments account for the strange effect "New Grub Street" can have -- simultaneously depressing and bracing, like any hard truth steadily encountered. Few books inspire me as much as this one, though there should be nothing very inspiring about a novel that says "Fail or sell out!," and that leaves me feeling I've done both.
Few writers are all Reardon or all Milvain -- most have elements of both, which is why "New Grub Street" can make you feel crass and defeated. In life the choice is rarely as drastic. One could, for example, be Gissing and spend a quarter-century writing in fairly slender success before dying (like Reardon) poor, tubercular and relatively young. Or else be Biffen, and toil in the dingy rooms of art and integrity and not give a damn whether you're a success (a degree of stoicism admittedly beyond most writers). But Gissing's power doesn't come from the objective accuracy of his vision of failure; it comes from capturing the experience of failure. And the choice in "New Grub Street" boils down to Reardon or Milvain: sink caring about literature or barter your soul for money and reputation. The starkness of these alternatives, the depth of feeling that accompanies them, the lack of nuance and nice effect in them, is what makes "New Grub Street" painfully alive for a reader a century later. It doesn't matter that things are seldom so extreme; what matters is that they feel that way.
This emotional truth has to span a great distance between the English 1880's and 90's and the American 1980's and 90's. My contention that Reardon's and Milvain's dilemma applies to us, too, flies in the face of some obvious differences. The pressures of the social code, the problems of marriage and propriety for people without much money, don't warp contemporary American personalities to the degree they warped the Victorians. Partly this is because few writers today are in serious danger of starvation -- it's a fatter country, and colleges cushion and smother them. Literature is no longer the path of the best and most ruthless: today Milvain is optioning properties for Paramount.
In fact the notion of literature as a steady livelihood now seems pretty absurd. We don't have millions of people grubbing a living as writers (though someone has to fill the magazine racks and produce the 48,000 books churned out every year). Instead, every 25th American is writing a novel in his spare time. Instead of "New Grub Street" 's hacks and mercenaries, we have a huge population of workshop attenders and "Writer's Market" readers who send stories to magazines read exclusively by other would-be writers and once every few years see one accepted. We have graphomania. But far from being producers of a commodity, this population is utterly cut off from the commercial life of the country. Writing has become one of the higher forms of recreation in a leisure society.
In other equally obvious ways, recent years have seen literature poisoned and swollen beyond the bitterest vulgarity of "New Grub Street." The seven-figure advances for unwritten novels, the obsequious profiles in "serious" magazines, the power of agents, the editors hopping from house to house to unemployment, the pervasive networking and shopping and thumping and scratching and oiling and rising and falling -- it's well known what happened when books started being published by entertainment conglomerates, writers suddenly found they could be media celebrities, and vice versa. Today's paper says that Suzy is going to write a novel. But Gissing wouldn't write satire about Suzy. He is not Tom Wolfe. He would write about the effect of this situation -- hopelessness in almost every case, wild success in a few; failing or selling out -- on the psyche of the individual writer attempting to produce serious fiction.
What would Gissing's pale hero find?
That it's like standing on the street at rush hour and trying to concentrate on piano music a block away. That it's a sordid struggle not to think his publisher is secretly undermining him and that his success depends on the size of the ad/promo budget. That he nonetheless has to face how these things will shape his readership, his future, his chances of staying with it. He would try not to care when he can't help caring. The young Faulkner was described by his longtime friend Phil Stone as having "one eye on the ball, one eye on Babe Ruth." By contrast, a young writer today feels compelled to keep an eye on anyone making a few million a year and hitting .230.
All the while, he can't forget the period of waiting six months for computerized rejections from magazines in North Dakota or Arizona. That, too, has had a distorting effect on him: an abiding sense of inadequacy, resentment against the blind bad luck that's thwarted him, corroding envy mixed with inflated awe for published writers. And worst of all, a faithful imitation of the prevailing mode in magazines whose minds he's been trying to read.
In his least guarded moment he imagines the mood of the overnight sensation -- something like ecstasy, alternating with terror and disbelief.
His mind's eye fills with these two visions: one of staggering success, of "breaking through," as if abrupt stature could guarantee a whole career of good work; the other not of slow, bitter decline but of sudden disappearance, as if the first time up he has to hit it over the wall or be sent back to the minors permanently. An extreme hallucination -- but today it carries an undeniable bit of truth.
It's not a good mental atmosphere for creative work. Eventually it reduces the available subject matter to stays at artists' colonies. It saps your courage, your willingness to stand alone; it induces you to accommodate, to ingratiate, to give over, to play safe. What's ruled out by this mad double vision is an idea of writing as something worked at steadily and alone over a lifetime, the vehicle for a writer's deepest concerns as they grow and change -- the kind of career that Gissing had a hundred years ago, that gave us "New Grub Street" and a handful of other powerful, forgotten books.

HEADLINE: Shore Tourism Rebounds, Slightly

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH tourists began returning in good numbers to the Jersey Shore last summer for the first time in four years, state and local tourism officials and merchants say a poor economy and inadequate marketing efforts by the state prompted many beach towns to wonder if the visitors had left their wallets at home.
Rentals of cottages and rooms at bed-and-breakfast inns, for example, were up 40 to 100 percent over last year's rate. And beach-tag revenues in most of Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May Counties increased about 30 percent, according to the State Division of Travel and Tourism. 
 But business owners and tourism officials said in recent interviews that food establishments, hotels, souvenir stores and other retail shops had marginal increases of 2 to 8 percent. "I had more customers this year than I ever had, but everyone spent a little less," said Frank Panzone, a restaurant owner in Beach Haven.
 
Double-Digit Increases
 Peter Schnell, director of the Ocean County Tourism Council, confirmed that spending was way down despite an overall 15 to 20 percent increase in tourists there and the $149,000 that the county spent on promotion. Mr. Schnell added, however, that merchants were "looking forward to these people coming back when the economy improves and generating more income."
Eugene Dilbeck, the state tourism director, said the summer would be remembered as the time that the decline in visitors was decidedly reversed. "It was the third consecutive year of double-digit increases in tourists since the loss in business due to the pollution scares of 1987 and 1989," he said.
A major reason for the improvement, he said, was "more innovative marketing along the Shore."
While agreeing that marketing efforts had been a key factor in the improvement, others question how much Mr. Dilbeck's agency had to do with it.
 
5 Percent Increase
 "The state did not promote the Shore like it should have this year and that meant that the private sector had to spend a lot more," said Fern Schoderer, the promotion manager for Fantasy Island amusement park in Beach Haven and the advertising director for the Southern Ocean County Chamber of Commerce.
"Unfortunately," she said, "Fantasy Island would have needed half again the number of people who visited us this year to make the kind of profit we hoped for." The amusement park's net increase in revenue was about 5 percent, she said.
Some real-estate agents indicated that rental volume increases of 40 to 100 percent reported by the division did not accurately reflect the actual increase in total rental revenues.
Rentals in Lavallette were good, for example, "but not as great as the local media would have you believe," said Andrea Carter Schlosser, a third-generation owner of Schlosser Real Estate.
She said cottage rentals were "better than the last two years, but the people are still not renting for as long as they used to and this year they picked cheaper places."
 
Random Surveys
 But Mr. Dilbeck said that Shore tourism revenues might have reached $7 billion this summer, just $700 million less than the $7.7 billion the division had estimated for 1987. He acknowledged that in the continuing absence of a thorough economic study of Shore tourism, the figures were based on random post-summer surveys. He declined to estimate how many tourists visited the Shore this summer.
The division's budget for promoting tourism statewide is $7.6 million this year, down from $9 million in 1988, and the agency has declined to say precisely how much of the $7.6 million was spent on luring vacationers to the Shore.
Whatever the vicissitudes of the Shore were this summer, coastal pollution could hardly be counted as an influence. John Hagerty, a spokesman for the State Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, said ocean water quality was excellent, with only 10 individual beach closings in 5 municipalities. The closings lasted 12 to 24 hours each, he said.
That, he said, compared with as many as 800 beach closings in 1987 and about half that number in 1988, mostly due to fecal coliform bacteria and medical wastes that had washed up on beaches.
 
Tour Packages
 Despite the absense of water problems, there was little proof of the so-called tour packaging that the state and regional tourism officials had been touting since spring.
Mr. Dilbeck said the only tour packages he knew about were in Atlantic City and Cape May. Mr. Schnell said there were more discounts and special passes given away by merchants last summer than in any other year, "but not really any tour packaging per se."
In tour packaging, things like travel, accommodations, dining and special tours are offered in combinations as incentives to the tour traveler, a category of vactioner who statistically spends more time and money taking vacations.
Thomas Popa, a marketing spokesman for the Ocean Place Hilton Resort and Spa in Long Branch, said tour packaging was not part of the new hotel's promotional campaign. But he said a substantial advertising program there had led to a 90 percent occupancy rate on weekends this summer and a rate of 65 percent during the week.
While Spring Lake did not have tour packages, either, Larry Rosehaus, the treasurer of the local Chamber of Commerce, said the $5,000 that was spent for print advertising had doubled the number of responses to the chamber's $150 vacation discount coupon book. Over all, Mr. Rosehaus said, tourist traffic in the upscale seaside resort increased 15 to 20 percent over last year.

HEADLINE: States, More Than Ever, Need Federal Help

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am gratified that New York State government is maintaining a competitive position on state taxes in the region, as you report Sept. 22. 
 You raise the concern that while state tax disparities in the Northeast have been reduced, we may now collectively face a loss of regional competitiveness. And you argue that quality-of-life issues may be at least as important as taxation in determining where people or businesses settle. Both are good points but, of course, if we had not held the line on income taxes, we would now be faced with quality of life and tax pressures.
There is a common denominator to both these concerns, however, and that is the national recession. The impact of the national slump has been especially hard in the Northeast, forcing unprecedented tax increases in some states. And after a decade long withdrawal of Federal aid in areas such as housing, mass transit and education, states and local governments throughout the region are hard pressed to finance those services that help determine quality of life.
It will be difficult to address either regional tax competitiveness or the financing of essential services without recognition in Washington that our states and our cities are in trouble and in need of the kind of help that only the Federal Government can give. We in New York are doing what is within our power to keep the city and the state economically sound, and provide the opportunities that have made New York great. My recently announced New York, New York, program of fiscal reforms and public and private development is intended for just that purpose.
But without help from the Federal Government, states in our region and throughout the country will, I'm afraid, slip further and further behind our real needs. We have demonstrated our resolve to come up with cost-effective solutions to the problems that we face; the Federal Government has not.

HEADLINE: Why Getting Tough With China Won't Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There are those in this country who favor a get-tough approach to the Chinese Government as a way to compel the old men who run China to admit the jig is up and peacefully fade away. This emotional approach is dangerous, founded on a fundamental misreading of the situation in China and its alleged similarity to the Soviet case. The democratic revolution is not on the verge of victory in China, contrary to popular impressions, and our publicly threatening the Chinese leadership with severe sanctions won't bring it closer. 
 There is no Mikhail S. Gorbachev among the top political leadership in Beijing, much less a Boris N. Yeltsin. China is led by men who make such leaders look like raving anarchists. Moreover, China's leaders are not isolated from their society and culture. Their ruthless, personalized approach to power and their suspicion of the West stem from basic impulses rooted in Chinese history, particularly from imperialist exploitation.
These men maintain (indeed, have strengthened) personal control over the organs of coercion and the news media, and they know how to use nativist, anti-foreign beliefs and the widespread and deep-rooted Chinese fear of chaos to bolster internal support if they must. Indeed, they have supporters among the next generation of party and military leaders, just as immersed in the game of power politics and no doubt willing to use Western relations in that game.
If we knew that these younger men could and would challenge the ruling gerontocracy in the name of perestroika, it might make sense for the United States to put stronger pressure on the regime.
But we don't know this. On the contrary, all available evidence indicates that younger "leaders" are dominated by the old men, and that many of them (including the Premier) would respond to increased sanctions by arguing for a harder domestic line, thus raising their stature among the old guard.
A tougher, uncompromising and punitive United States stand will allow these individuals to argue more forcefully that the United States is indeed committed to the destruction of socialism and the creation of chaos in China. What will those among the Chinese leadership supportive of continued close ties to the West say in response to this charge?
China's economic situation also suggests the folly of drawing lessons from the apparent success of United States economic sanctions against the Soviet Union. Trade with the West did not play an integral role in the economic life of the Soviet people, and we could easily deny most favored nation status to Moscow without much risk. The Chinese economy is now linked to the outside world just enough to cause serious adversity to large segments of the Chinese population if those links were severely disrupted, but not enough to topple the regime or even hasten its demise.
At best, a get-tough policy with Beijing would throw many Chinese and Hong Kong workers and merchants out of business, while further reducing United States influence upon all types of Chinese elites. At worst, it would severely destabilize those coastal areas that have served as the bastions of progressivism in China. Such adversity could contribute to the emergence of an unstable economic and political regionalism detrimental to the interests of both the United States and the Chinese people.

HEADLINE: Citibank to Cut Its NOW Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Citibank, the nation's biggest bank, said Friday that it would halve the interest rate it pays on its NOW checking accounts in response to lower money-market interest rates.
At the same time, the bank said it was increasing the monthly service charge on regular checking accounts to recoup the rising costs of providing services. 
 Effective Dec. 1, the unit of New York-based Citicorp will cut its NOW checking account interest rate to 2 percent, from 4 percent. It will also lower the rate on its Holiday Club savings deposits to 4 percent from 5.5 percent.
The drop in the rate payout will offset a reduction in the rate Citibank charges for car and installment loans, which takes effect later this month. All the moves will affect only Citibank customers in New York, not in other states.
A Citibank spokesman said the NOW -- negotiated order of withdrawal -- rate reduction was largely in response to the narrowing gap between NOW and money-market rates.
Citibank said it would raise the monthly charge on regular, non-NOW checking accounts to $9.50 from $7.50 because of increasing costs. Less than half of Citibank's New York customers have non-NOW checking accounts, the bank said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Setback at Convex: Challenge or Catastrophe?

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
The Convex Computer Corporation will report a big quarterly loss in a few days, and analysts say the company will probably complete 1991 with its first yearly loss since it became profitable in 1983, a year after it was organized.
Convex, which makes high-performance computers priced mostly between $300,000 and $2 million, was hit during the summer with numerous problems: delays in fine-tuning important new products, the slumping market for high-performance computers and its first head-on confrontation with the colossus of supercomputing, Cray Research Inc. 
 The company said late last month that revenues for the quarter would be as low as $35 million, compared with the $50 million that had been anticipated on Wall Street, and that its loss for the quarter would be at least $5.8 million.
The company's shares, which traded as high as $19.75 in the spring, have fallen in recent weeks to a range of $10 to $12. They closed on Friday at $11, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Are these early warnings of an approaching catastrophe for Convex, or just the rough edges of a temporary setback before orders and sales revive in 1992? Probably the latter, analysts say, but Convex has some harsh realities to wrestle with.
The first is that it will be dueling more frequently with Cray at the lower-price end of supercomputing. And sooner or later, Convex must contend with inroads from a growing crowd of companies like Sun Microsystems Inc. that make ever-more-powerful computer work stations used primarily for engineering and scientific computing.
Buyers of engineering work stations now can knit together several machines, each priced at $10,000 or less, into systems whose performance can compete on some tasks with Convex's older models, which are priced near $300,000.
Convex built a solid reputation in the last six years by dominating smaller rivals like Alliant Computer Systems and Floating Point Systems, as well as by outwitting the Digital Equipment Corporation with faster designs and more flexible software for minisupercomputers. Typical users of those machines were military and university researchers, corporate scientists and engineers, but many of their budgets were crimped this year by recession and declining Pentagon spending.
"It's a very unforgiving market out there right now," said Gary Smaby, president of the Smaby Group, a research firm in Minneapolis that specializes in supercomputers
Still, Convex, which is based in Richardson, Tex., near here, is considered a company with "a very strong management team and will be a long-term, viable player," said Jeffry Canin, an analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco who covers the market for scientific and engineering computing.
"But now Convex has to go into the big leagues against Ditigal, I.B.M. and, more ominously, Cray," he said. He estimates that Convex will lose $8.3 million in 1991; until late September, he had figured it would break even. He and Richard Edwards, an analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco, both said the company should earn 50 cents a share next year.
Cray Research, based in Minneapolis, has for years assembled the industry's fastest and most expensive machines, priced as high as $30 million. But Cray has been slower than Convex in marketing and may be bloodied before it learns to deal in a more freewheeling market for computer sales.
Analysts expect both companies to generate sales growth approaching 10 percent next year, but they are counting on a revival in capital spending.
"This whole industry has become a highly speculative" recommendation based on levels of capital spending in 1992 and 1993, said Joseph Payne, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons. "We're putting Convex in the hottest category, but more because of the quality of their systems software than the new products themselves. People now are more concerned about systems software features than raw computing performance."
Convex seems to have laid the groundwork for a solid recovery next year, analysts said. Its financial health is good, with little debt and more than $90 million in cash, and technical problems with gallium arsenide circuits in its new C3800 and C3400 supercomputers appear to have been solved.
The company's chief executive, Robert J. Paluck, and its chief technical officer, Steven J. Wallach, gambled that research with gallium arsenide circuits had advanced to the point where the speedy computer chips could be mass produced at high quality.
They calculated that the chips would prove faster and generate less heat than conventional silicon chips. So to obtain more speed and power, Mr. Wallach designed as many as eight processors with gallium arsenide circuits into the new C3800 model, compared with a maximum of four in previous models.
It was problems earlier this year at the Texas Instruments Corporation and Vitesse Semiconductor, makers of the chips used in the C3400 and C3800 models, respectively, that forced Convex to delay shipments.
But output of the chips and new Convex models should pick up before the year ends, said George E. Lindamood, director of high-performance computing at the Gartner Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn. "They have taken the handcuffs off their salesman, saying it's safe now to go out and sell these things," he said.
Convex installed two C3800 computers, at more than $2 million each, on schedule late last month. The company also outdueled Cray two weeks ago in winning a $14 million order from the Air Force for four new C3800 machines.
Cray is expected to throw a counterpunch before the end of the month, though, with "subcompact" supercomputers priced below $500,000. Convex customers have withheld orders that might already have been booked until they get a look at the Cray model, some analysts said.
Cray Research once vowed never to use its resources to build a computer priced below $5 million, but the company had to change course as Convex began stealing orders in the low-price range of supercomputing in the last few years. Cray agreed to pay $3.25 million last week to acquire some assets of a defeated Convex rival, Floating Point Systems, which is now known as FPS Computing. FPS entered bankruptcy reorganization proceedings last week.
"These guys are going to see each other quite a lot in the days and months ahead," Mr. Lindamood said of Convex and Cray. "There is going to be a lot of blood on the floor on the issue of price and performance."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Yields Are Expected to Cool Down

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Credit market analysts said the rise in long-term interest rates last week was merely a temporary correction to the strong summer rally, not the start of a significant reversal in the direction of bond yields.
Long-term rates will probably fall a bit further, and the Federal Reserve Board will almost certainly ease monetary policy at least once more before the year is out, the analysts said. 
 Further easing is foreseen partly because the regulatory changes announced by the Bush Administration last week to increase the pace of lending by financial institutions to the household and business sectors are not expected to live up to expectations.
More important, analysts noted that recent data did little to dispel the notion that inflation remained tame, that money-supply growth was still weak and that consumers were not about to start spending a lot more.
 
Concern Over Government Role
 In the credit markets, the lending changes announced last week were seen as a threat to the outlook for slow growth and low inflation that has slowly gained currency in the last several months.
The key elements of the President's plan call for the easing of restrictions on the amount of preferred stock that banks can sell to raise capital, the creation of a new process for banks to appeal decisions by examiners and the establishment of new guidelines to clear up -- and perhaps ease -- regulations covering real estate valuation and loan-loss reserves.
To the extent that the President's actions may be a preface to more substantive priming of the pump in the future, fears among market participants may be justified.
"I would be almost willing to bet that we are going to get more fiscal stimulus from the Government," said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow, a financial consulting firm.
But given the size of the 1992 Federal budget deficit, the Administration's ability to provide much stimulus appears limited.
More immediately, analysts said the somewhat easier lending standards announced last week would not do much to alleviate the shortage of credit.
"Although regulation and supervisory practices have played a role in the U.S. credit slowdown, decisions made in the private sector -- by bankers and by their potential loan customers -- have also been significant in the process," Marcos Jones, an economist at Deutsche Bank Capital noted in a weekly letter to clients. "This newfound caution in private financial behavior will not be undone by fiat."
Banks have become much more restrictive in making real estate loans, said Laurence G. Kantor, a vice president at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. But with slow growth in employment and earnings, consumers have been paying down debt rather than accumulating it. In turn, the slowdown in consumer spending has dampened business borrowing.
"The lending slowdown is more a demand phenomenon than a supply phenomenon," Mr. Kantor said. "Under current conditions, slightly more relaxed capital requirements and somewhat more flexible regulatory procedures will not be sufficient" to promote a turnaround in lending.
Even though many analysts are projecting the economy may have expanded by 3 percent or more in the third quarter, recent reports, like the September retail sales numbers released Friday, suggest momentum was lagging as the fourth quarter began.
"The numbers appear to suggest that the economy is turning over again," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International. "And if the numbers aren't coming in, the only thing left to do is to lower interest rates some more."
So far this month, soft employment and retail sales numbers and a very good report on producer prices have not persuaded the Fed to ease monetary policy.
Nevertheless, analysts said another move is imminent and may come after the release of consumer price data for September on Thursday.
"We think the Fed will move soon, and it probably won't be for the last time," Mr. Kantor of Morgan Guaranty said. "I think they will ease twice more between now and the beginning of 1992."
The spotlight will be on the Fed, and how it reacts to consumer price and other economic data to be released during a week shortened by the Columbus Day holiday.
 
Expect Favorable Price Data
 To most analysts, the consumer price figures will be the most important statistics released this week.
If the favorable producer price numbers are any indication, the report should be pleasant reading to both the Fed and the bond market.
Over all, for the fourth straight month the Consumer Price Index probably rose by two-tenths of a percentage point in September, Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said.
According to Mr. Jones, the especially good news in the report will be a moderation in the index that excludes food and energy.
With those volatile components taken out, the "core" inflation rate probably rose by two-tenths of 1 percent, Mr. Jones said. If his prediction is accurate, that would break a string of increases of four-tenths of 1 percent that stretches back to June.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
A Change in Administration At a Cable TV Trade Group

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
The Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau, in the first change in its top administrative job since its founding a decade ago, has named a president and chief executive with extensive experience in broadcast television and radio as well as in cable.
Thomas E. McKinney, 49 years old, who has been executive vice president since July of last year, is succeeding Robert H. Alter, 62, who becomes a vice chairman of what is the cable industry's national advertising trade association. 
 Mr. McKinney is believed to be the first black executive to head such a media or advertising organization.
"Cable has played a great role in changing the television medium," Mr. McKinney said in an interview last week before the bureau's board elected him president. "Now, we must make this medium easy to use for advertisers of all levels and sizes."
Mr. Alter, who joined Mr. McKinney for the interview at the bureau's midtown Manhattan office, called him "the right man at the right time to take over."
Thomas F. Burchill, the bureau's chairman, concurred. Mr. McKinney "knows how to lead," said Mr. Burchill, who is president and chief executive of Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services, owner of cable properties like the Lifetime network. "I'm delighted Thom is getting his shot to propel the organization forward."
Mr. McKinney said that when he joined the bureau, the expectation was that he would become president in about three years. But, Mr. Alter said, "Thom is ready, and there were other opportunities I had. It all came together." In addition to serving as a consultant to the bureau, Mr. Alter will be advising on starting Star TV, a Pan-Asian satellite television programming service based in Hong Kong.
When the bureau began operations in 1981, "we started with a budget of $250,000 and two people," recalled Mr. Alter, who came there after more than two decades at the Radio Advertising Bureau.
"Now, we have a budget of over $4 million," Mr. McKinney said, "and a staff of 26 -- and growing."
That growth at the bureau, which represents 32 national cable networks as well as owners of groups of local cable systems known as multiple system operators, reflects the booming growth of cable advertising.
According to statistics compiled by Paul Kagan Associates, a consulting firm, cable ad revenue has been soaring, reaching $2.55 billion last year, compared with $230 million in 1982. The forecast for this year, despite the recession that is battering most other media, is for a 19 percent increase, to more than $3 billion.
Even so, "our revenue hasn't caught up yet with our shares" of the total viewing audience, Mr. McKinney said. In order to fuel additional gains, he added, the bureau ought to "make sure advertisers know what kind of cable programming is out there" -- that is, to familiarize advertisers seeking to target their ad messages to specific consumer groups with the cable programming those consumers watch.
Mr. McKinney has become a familiar figure within his industry, through his work as an executive for Group W Cable, once the industry's third-largest multiple system operator, and for the bureau, which honored him with a President's Award in 1986. Still, he is aware that reaching a level apparently not achieved before by a black media or advertising executive will bring him recognition beyond the world of cable.
"That is why I feel that extra pressure to do an outstanding job," he said. "Perhaps this will start to change attitudes, and somebody else might say, 'Now it's O.K. for me to take a chance.' "
Rather than see "a glass ceiling," he added, "you can find a way to break through that sucker."

HEADLINE: Executives Ponder Urban Problems

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., Oct. 12

 BODY:
Corporate America must broaden its horizons to include an attack on drugs, crime, welfare dependency and poverty, a panel of specialists on problems of inner-city areas told the nation's most elite business club. Business has "gotten the message," the panel said, about the need to help improve education.
Businesses "need to be part of the solution" because they cannot escape being hurt financially by unaddressed urban pathologies, Jerry E. Abramson, the Mayor of Louisville, Ky., told reporters after addressing a closed-door session of the Business Council, whose fall meeting here at the Homestead Resort ended today. "And once you hit them in the bottom line, their hearts and minds and pocketbooks and wallets will follow," he added. 
 Mayor Abramson was joined by five others, including Prof. Shelby Steele of San Jose State University in California, in challenging 100 chief executives to expand their social commitments to embrace issues of housing and transportation and to lobby for Federal programs like Head Start, the preschool program for poor children, and the nutrition program WIC (Women, Infants and Children).
The others in the group, whose presentation constituted almost half of the meeting's formal agenda, were Harold L. Hodgkinson, director of the Center for Demographic Policy at the Institute for Educational Leadership; Peter H. Reuter, director of the Drug Policy Research Center at the Rand Corporation; Geraldine L. Carter, executive director of the Survival Skills Institute, and David T. Ellwood, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
But while Professor Ellwood said he was "quite astonished" by the attention of the businessmen -- the council has no female members -- to urban problems, the dominant view of the executives was frustration about the magnitude of those problems and doubts about how to tackle them.
"People are struggling with how to do it," said Charles S. Sanford Jr., chairman of the Bankers Trust Company, which he said had "all along" made low-profile efforts to address social problems in New York.
Andrew C. Sigler, head of the Champion International Corporation, said that while businesses had immense amounts of knowledge, it was mostly "in a very narrow area" that is not easily harnessed for explicit social goals.
And Howard P. Allen, chairman of the executive committee of SCE Corp, the holding company for the Southern California Edison Company, said that while he thought new initiatives were likely, regulators and other authorities were more often obstacles rather than facilitators. "Government doesn't create an environment to let us help," Mr. Allen said.
 
An 'Encouraging Sign'

Kay R. Whitmore, head of the Eastman Kodak Company, agreed with the panel that the problem was not one-dimensional but insisted that education, which he said was far from being adequately addressed, should be pre-eminent. "We still believe that education is the key issue," Mr. Whitmore said.
Hamish Maxwell, chairman of Philip Morris Companies, took the Business Council's agenda itself as evidence of increased interest in helping improve conditions in urban areas. "The fact that everybody is talking about it is a pretty encouraging sign," he said. Philip Morris has interests in beer and cigarettes, two businesses that are sometimes criticized for targeting inner-city and minority populations.
But while the panelists talked about a host of inner-city problems, which they said would inevitably become more widespread if not dealt with, Kenneth H. Olsen, president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, said he wished they had also mentioned the doleful effects of television.

HEADLINE: A Page From Fast Food's Menu

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Inspiration recently struck George Loesch during breakfast at Denny's. In scouting the competition, Mr. Loesch frequently holds breakfast meetings at fast-food restaurants, where he picks apart the sausage biscuits and eagerly devours new menu items.
Mr. Loesch works not for a rival restaurant chain, as his fast-food fieldwork might imply, but for the Campbell Soup Company, best known for its home heat-and-serve offerings. Inspired by the popularity of a large-portion breakfast on the Denny's menu, Mr. Loesch recently shepherded to market a line of "Big Start" home breakfasts. The meals, which offer such entrees as pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon, are the newest addition to the Great Start brand sold by Swanson's, a division of Campbell Soup.
 
Boasting About Borrowing

Mr. Loesch freely acknowledges that he got the idea from Denny's, a restaurant chain owned by TW Services Inc. He even boasts of it in a sales brochure for grocers that invites them to "take a bite out of the restaurant business" by stocking the new Swanson product line, which was introduced in July. 
 More and more makers of packaged foods are taking cues from fast-food menus. In addition to breakfasts like eggs and sausages on biscuits, the supermarket freezer case is filled these days with products like the Geo. A. Hormel & Company's Bacon Cheeseburger, Swanson's Chicken Nuggets and Tyson Foods Inc.'s Hot 'n' Spicy chicken wings -- all products that food experts say were prompted by the success of similar offerings in restaurants.
Such are the tactics in the fierce fight over "share of stomach," the food industry term for the consumer's food dollar. Americans spend more than $500 billion a year on food, and restaurants account for an increasingly larger portion of the total.
Consumers' restaurant spending will reach $262 billion this year, or 48.5 percent of total food spending, according to estimates by Technomic, a Chicago food consulting firm, while grocery store food sales will reach $278 billion, or 51.5 percent.
For packaged-food retailers, that is a disturbing drop from 1980, when supermarkets attracted nearly 60 percent of food spending. The trend reflects the growth of single-parent households and of households where both parents work -- situations that create a time squeeze that has benefited fast-food chains in particular.
To fight back, supermarkets are devoting more and more space to salad bars and deli sections. And increasingly, food companies are offering grocers packaged foods that mimic items popular in restaurant settings.
"Instead of having a breakfast sandwich at McDonald's, you can pick one up from the freezer of your grocery store," said Ron Paul, president of Technomic, who predicted that many more fast-food products will show up on the grocers' shelves and freezers.
In recent weeks, for example, Conagra Inc. and the Quaker Oats Company have joined other food companies by introducing low-fat ground beef products. The Conagra offering, which is sold at the meat counter of grocery stores, has only 4 percent fat, compared with the 20 percent or so typically found in regular ground beef.
 
Stalking the Mclean Deluxe
 The lean-beef trend follows McDonald's introduction last spring of Mclean Deluxe, a 91 percent fat-free hamburger that has received widespread attention.
"McDonald's stirred up an awful lot of interest," said Bill O'Neill, vice president of sales and marketing at Fairbank Farms, a maker of low-fat ground beef in Ashville, N.Y., 75 miles southwest of Buffalo. "We piggybacked off that, big time," he said gleefully.
As McDonald's introduced its Mclean in various parts of the country, Mr. O'Neill's sales force was there at every turn. "We tried to get the scoop on where they were moving next and take the information to retailers," Mr. O'Neill said. That allowed retailers to tie their advertising to McDonald's Mclean introduction.
In the case of Conagra, however, executives said their company had been working on low-fat ground beef for a year, and the timing of its introduction had nothing to do with McDonald's. With its Healthy Choice line of low-fat, low-sodium frozen dinners, Conagra has proved a nimble innovator in recent years.
But the influence of McDonald's on the packaged-food industry is clearly evident. Mary Adolf of the Beef Industry Council in Chicago said she was deluged by calls from meat buyers at large supermarket chains seeking the names of suppliers of low-fat ground beef after the McDonald's announcement.
"Retailers and food service operators are duking it out for consumer dollars," she said. "The move by McDonald's prompted retailers to want to market a similar type product for home use."
Tim Hammonds, senior vice president for the Food Marketing Institute, a supermarket trade group in Washington, acknowledged that the growth of the fast-food chains over the last 20 years had hurt grocers. "That industry has gained largely at the expense of the supermarket industry," he said.
Recently, he said, there are indications that the weak economy has led people to eat out less and buy more food at grocery stores. With the new products, Mr. Hammonds said, "There is a real opportunity for us to hold on to some of those customers as the economy improves."
Armed with stocked freezers, supermarkets are ready to do battle with the Egg McMuffin. Although McDonald's introduced the Egg McMuffins in 1975, it was not until the company expanded its menu with a variety of breakfast sandwiches in 1986 that the category caught fire -- and the food companies' attention.
 
'Clones of Fast Food'
 "We've had a tremendous onslaught of frozen breakfast products that are the clones of fast food," said Martin Friedman, editor of the Chicago newsletter, Gorman's New Product News.
Executives at large food companies, however, reject the notion that fast-food restaurants act as product development labs for packaged food makers. And they argue that their companies have done a better job than restaurants of making healthy food availble.
"It's a real race to see who is picking up on these trends and responding," said William Zick, a vice president with International Flavors and Fragrances Inc., a company that makes flavorings for the prepared-food industry.
For several reasons, restaurants tend to be more nimble. Introducing a product can cost a major packaged-food company up to $30 million, because it involves retooling production lines, creating television advertisements and new packaging.
To test a breakfast burrito, however, McDonald's can simply ask a few stores to start serving the product.
"The cost of trying a new item is very small for restaurants," said Mr. Paul of Technomic. "They can literally change production runs everyday."
 
Blurring the Boundaries
 Based on the number of restaurants now experimenting with skinless fried chicken, Mr. Paul expects such products to show up soon at the grocery store.
The very boundaries between supermarkets and restaurants are becoming increasingly blurred. In a striking illustration of the overlap, Taco Bell, the fast-food Mexican restaurant operator, opened a small kiosk in a supermarket in Phoenix earlier this month.
"The lines between the segments are starting to come down," said John E. Martin, president and chief executive of Taco Bell, a unit of Pepsico Inc.
"Everybody is looking at everybody else," he said.

The Economy
The Fed is expected to report that blacks and other minorities are denied mortgages far more frequently than whites with comparable income. While the Fed has not yet made public its data, one official warned a meeting of the American Bankers Association last week that a study would show "dramatic disparities in loan rejection rates." In advance of the report, a detailed picture of some lending policies along racial lines has come from large banks involved in mergers. [Page D1.] Corporate America must broaden its horizons to include a broad attack on urban problems like drugs, crime, welfare dependency and poverty, a panel of specialists on the inner city told the Business Council. [D2.] 
 A leading lobbyist for the insurance industry has succeeded in twisting the banking overhaul bill from one that would help banks to one that would roll back advances that bankers have already made in getting into the insurance business. But the reputation of the industry has been tarnished in recent months, and he runs the risk of overplaying his hand. [D1.]
The $50-billion-a-year produce industry is trying to create a brand-name consciousness. And along the way, one grower has built a better strawberry. [A8.]
 
 Companies
The choice of a buyer for Executive Life will largely ride on whether California regulators feel the sale of the failed insurer should be structured to sever the company from its huge portfolio of high-risk junk bonds, analysts said. Of the eight bids submitted, five are considered to warrant serious consideration. Two of those five are based on selling the junk bonds. [D1.]
Food companies are increasingly challenging restaurants in the battle for consumer's food dollar. The latest trend has food companies mimicking fast-food restaurant items. [D1.]
 
 International
The leading industrial democracies accepted a plea from Soviet officials to help formulate a reform program and to stabilize the country's increasingly shaky finances. The first practical step is that the deputy finance ministers of the Group of Seven will be heading to Moscow within a few weeks to begin consulting with Soviet planners and to study Soviet financial difficulties. [A1.]
 
 The Media Business
Television is leaving Aaron Spelling distressed these days. But despite his easy-going grumpiness, his company produces a show that is perhaps No. 1 in popularity with 1990's youth. [D1.]
The Arkansas Democrat seems poised to oust its rival from the newspaper business. The Little Rock newspaper's publisher succeeded with a combination of business acumen, ruthlessness, deep pockets and near obsession with winning. [D6.]
NBC has gone from big winner to big loser among the Big Three television networks. Three years ago it was making $500 million in profits. NBC executives are predicting that the network will make no profit at all this season. Bill Carter: Television. [D6.]
The talk at the Frankfurt Book Fair is mostly about the chill the industry is feeling. The American contingent is also up in arms about a change in the location of their exhibition space. [D6.]
The Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau has named a new president and chief executive. The change is the first in the bureau's top administrative job since its founding a decade ago. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D7.]

Are Convex Computer's lower-than-expected revenues an early warning of an approaching catastrophe for Convex, or just the rough edges of a temporary setback before orders and sales revive in 1992? Probably the latter, analysts say. Market Place. [D4.]

HEADLINE: Far Rockaway Journal;
Weeds Hide a Precious Patch of Past

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
Alberto Garcia has been living on New Haven Avenue in Far Rockaway, Queens, for 10 years, but it was news to him that across the street from his apartment building, behind a row of small houses, was an official New York City landmark.
"I don't know anything about it," Mr. Garcia, a hotel worker, said of the Richard Cornell Graveyard, a cemetery dating from the 17th century. 
 Even if Mr. Garcia had ventured behind the houses, or the nursing home or the overgrown vacant lot that also hide the cemetery, he still would not have known that he was standing on a precious patch of past.
The 75-by-67-foot cemetery, which the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated a landmark in 1970 because of its "special historical and esthetic interest and value" in New York City's development, is a long-neglected tangle of weeds, fallen tree limbs and construction rubbish dumped there in the last two decades.
What's more, there is not a single gravestone to mark the graves of Richard Cornell, the first white settler in the Rockaways, who died in the 1690's, or nearly 30 of his descendants and relatives.
The half dozen or so gravestones that local history buffs say stood there in 1970, when the cemetery was already in decline, have disappeared. So have pieces of the other stones that were scattered on the site then. The history buffs, who have followed the cemetery's decay with dismay, say the city took the stones for safekeeping shortly after the cemetery was made a landmark. Then, there was talk of a restoration, which never fully materialized. The city has since lost track of where it stored the gravestones, the buffs say.
The chief of staff of the Landmarks Commission, Joan R. Olshansky, insisted recently that any removal of the stones "was not done under city auspices."
In any case, all this is the lamentable legacy of the past. Now, if Ms. Olshansky's agency can convert aspiration to actuality, a new chapter will be written in the site's long history.
Working with the local historians, Rockaway's civic leaders and some Cornell descendants, the Landmarks Commission has spurred still another effort to restore what it hailed in 1970 as "one of the few old burial grounds in the city which have survived to the present day."
"About a year or so ago a couple of my staff people were in the neighborhood and went to see it and were appalled," Ms. Olshansky recalled. "The Cornell family, who owned the property, didn't have a great deal of interest or the necessary funds to maintain it."
As for the commission's own role, she said, "We've always had a small staff and not enough funds to monitor all the landmarks."
Mary Cornell, the wife of Richard Cornell of Kew Gardens, Queens, a 14th-generation descendant of the first Richard, said: "The family really didn't know they owned it anymore. We thought it belonged to the city."
At the cemetery the other day, Stanley Cogan, president of the Queens Historical Society, who heads a 13-member task force to carry out the renewed rescue effort, described the effort's theme as "bringing the Cornell cemetery back to life."
He and some other task force members guided a visitor to the site by stepping gingerly through the garbage and weeds of a city-owned lot fronting the cemetery near New Haven and Caffrey Avenues, a lot they hope will be converted to a park-like access.
After removing the debris in the cemetery, which the task force hopes to start soon, the cemetery will be returned to its 18th-century appearance, they said. The disappeared gravestones? Emil Lucev, another member, said they still might be found, possibly buried in the graveyard itself. If not, there is always the possibility of producing "facsimiles" of all the markers once in the yard, said the other members on the visit, Mel Cantor, Leon Locke and Craig Bachrow. Preservation purists, however, could object to reproductions.
Peering beyond such details, Mrs. Cornell, also active in the restoration, focused on the ultimate concern. "People shouldn't be forgotten," she said, "especially people who did so much in getting the area started."

HEADLINE: 7 Rich Nations To Help Soviets Plan Economy

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The leading industrial democracies took a major step today toward helping in the reconstruction of the Soviet economic system and its integration with the West, announcing that they had accepted a plea from Soviet officials to help devise a reform program.
"They have asked us to come be a part of a process that sets up a new system in the Soviet Union," the United States Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said at a press conference after a series of meetings he and other top officials had with senior Soviet financial officials. "That's a very important statement in my view." 
 Norman Lamont, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said: "It was a very useful, historic meeting. They clearly feel that support from the West in their efforts enhances their credibility and chances for reform."
 
Visit by Western Officials
 The first practical step is that the deputy finance ministers of the world's seven leading industrial nations, the Group of Seven, will go to Moscow in a few weeks to consult with Soviet officials on their reform plans and to study current Soviet financial difficulties. This means that the industrialized nations have started to treat the Soviet Union in some ways as a developing nation mired in debt and in need of basic reform before new aid can be granted.
The two days of meetings between the top financial officials of the Group of Seven, and a Soviet delegation led by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a top Soviet financial planner, resulted in a conceptual leap in the West's dealings with the Soviet Union, moving toward far greater cooperation and an increase in the West's influence over Soviet affairs.
The economic leaders here said pointedly that Mr. Yavlinsky and the other Soviet officials did not ask for and were not offered direct financial support, although they acknowledged that Soviet economic problems were reaching a critical stage. Inflation is rising swiftly, they said, and there is a looming prospect that the Soviets will not have the hard currency to repay billions of dollars in debts coming due to Western banks and governments.
But there was clearly an implicit promise of large-scale aid if the Soviets are able to effect a program to transform their collapsing centrally planned system into a market-oriented economy, a reaffirmation of Western policy that has so far been blocked by Soviet inability to agree on concrete details for such a plan.
Although most Western officials went out of their way to avoid direct discussion of money today, their comments underscored the general idea that if the Soviets do move toward reform and greater openness, they would be rewarded for doing so.
 
Signs of Disagreement
 The Western commitment seemed to be an inducement Mr. Yavlinsky wanted to use to prod the paralyzed Soviet decision-making apparatus. "The goals which we jointly are trying to achieve are not far from us," Mr. Yavlinsky said in a break from the meetings.
There were some signs of disagreement among the seven nations meeting here on the topic of aid, but they issued a one-page communique this afternoon outlining their agreement. In addition to the United States, the group includes Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
The group said that the Soviet Union had to undertake "appropriate adjustment and reform policies with the support of the international financial institutions," like the International Monetary Fund, in which the Soviet Union recently became a special associate member. That meant the Soviet Union must take measures to bring down inflation by cutting its soaring budget deficits.
The group said it "strongly endorsed" the plan of the central Government and the Soviet republics to work out the terms of their economic cooperation, but insisted that these plans should make certain the Soviet Union will honor its debts to the West, currently estimated at $70 billion. The leaders of 10 Soviet republics said Friday that they had agreed on a pact to form an economic community.
The Group of Seven communique went on to say that an effective reform program and a workable financial relationship between the central Government and republics would insure that the Soviet Union would continue to have access to the loans on which it has grown dependent.
The communique was issued here just before the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, and the terms sketched out were very similar to the doses of bitter medicine that the fund has meted out to countries such as Mexico and Brazil.
The sketchiness of the agreement means numerous questions remain. One is whether there really is broad agreement in the Soviet Union to have the Western countries so actively engaged in their affairs. Another is whether the republics will agree to shoulder the central Government's debt.
The seriousness of the debt problem was underscored here when Mr. Yavlinsky confirmed his earlier assertion that the central Government has only 240 metric tons of gold in reserve, a fraction of what the reserves had been estimated to be. Gold is an important financial cushion for governments and can be used as collateral for loans.
 
Conditions for Major Aid
 The Western leaders here were careful to deny that they were getting involved in domestic Soviet politics. But they made it clear that, if the Soviets wanted the large-scale aid, a certain pattern of reform would have to be instituted.
For instance, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board, said, "A single currency and a single central bank would make the transition easier."
As the Soviet republics continue to negotiate over the terms of a pact on economic community, the communique issued today is likely to add impetus to the drive to complete an accord. The subject of the accord took up much of the closed-door discussions between the Soviet officials and the Western officials.
 
'Inestimable Value'
 "There is no blueprint in the sense of a detailed articulation of what the program might be," Mr. Brady said. "What they really asked for today was for us to help articulate what the program might be. They said, 'Your help will be of inestimable value to us.' "
The agreement was something of a coup for the 39-year-old Mr. Yavlinsky, a tireless proponent of fundamental economic reform who has run into resistance from conservative members of the Communist old guard and even President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Mr. Gorbachev failed to win the enthusiastic support of Western countries when he sought financial aid at a group of seven meeting in London in June and left the meeting empty-handed, an embarrassment that some believe contributed to the failed coup against him in August.
Some signs of discord among the Western nations were apparent today. The United States has made clear it believes the Soviets may need some form of debt relief soon. Previously the Soviets have suggested they may be unable to make about $5 billion in debt payments coming due in the next several months, but today they were quoted as saying they would not default on loans for at least the next two months.
But when the American delegation proposed a postponement of Soviet debt payments at a meeting this morning, the idea was rejected by both the European countries and the Soviet Union, French officials said.
A senior American Treasury official told reporters this afternoon that the differences were a matter of "nuance" and that "a consensus exists."
The Germans have also been frustrated by the unwillingness of the United States and some other countries to take on a greater share of the immediate financial burden of aid to the Soviet Union. The Germans reportedly sought to raise this issue of "burden sharing," but were rebuffed as the talks focused more on what the Soviets needed rather than where it would come from.

An Eloquent Man And His Musings On the Presidency

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
For a man of his words, Mario M. Cuomo spends a lot of time explaining why he has been misunderstood. The Governor's musings evoke a political version of "Rashomon," leaving some listeners hearing only what they want to believe.
On Friday, his wife, Matilda, left a breakfast for potential campaign contributors with the distinct impression that Mr. Cuomo had said he intended to run for Governor again. 
 After the same breakfast, John Marino, the Democratic State Chairman, reported that Mr. Cuomo's remarks represented "a step toward making a decision" about running for President and that "in the next couple of weeks he'll have more to say."
Mr. Cuomo insisted later not only that he had said nothing new, but also that "nothing happened this morning that changes anything."
What did happen? Before or after he was importuned by supporters to reconsider his no-plans-and-no-plans-to-make-plans position on the Presidency, Mr. Cuomo delivered an unusually detailed account of his plans not to make any over the next few weeks.
"What am I going to say, no?" he asked later, maintaining that it would have been impolite, if not impolitic, to summarily rebuff entreaties from contributors.
Instead, he said he would think about running. But would he really think about it? "I'll try to keep it out of my mind," Mr. Cuomo replied later.
What was on his mind Friday? As supporters who had leaked his ambiguous remarks were still wiping the Regency Hotel's eggs off their faces, reporters were finding his words tough to swallow. At one point, what he said he had said was, "I'm disinclined to vote for president." Even if that wasn't what he meant to say, it might have been what he meant.
"Whatever is going on is not because I want it to go on," the Governor argued. Nonetheless, he risks being dismissed as a tease for insisting that no Sherman-like disavowal of candidacy would be credible or sensible.
Indeed, the Governor's previous attempts to do so were greeted skeptically, despite his consistent record. In 1987, on Art Athens's WCBS radio program, Mr. Cuomo flatly announced that he would not run for President the following year. Last week, when Mr. Athens asked the Governor to drop the other shoe, Mr. Cuomo playfully did so, literally. The Governor is due on the program again this week and may bare his soul.
After being told that his plans to make plans for a fourth term had been disclosed by no less a source than his own wife, Mr. Cuomo mused: "Either she knows all about me or I am an enigma; I pray I am an enigma."
For domestic consumption, Presidential rumors may divert attention from New York's problems to the nation's and promote ticket sales to Mr. Cuomo's fund-raiser in December.
But Mr. Cuomo is conflicted. He genuinely does not want to run for President, particularly while serving as Governor, although he seems more confident about his ability to be President.
Mr. Cuomo is unequivocal about one perceived consequence of noncandidacy: He is frustrated and even furious that reporters are more interested in a hypothetical campaign than in the condition of the country.
"I cannot get two minutes to talk about the economy," he complained, "but I can get a half hour to talk about a candidacy."
And yet, he said, the nation is yearning for "a debate on national policy." In between breakfast and eating his words for lunch, Mr. Cuomo delivered an inspiring address to several hundred students from Alternative High Schools and Programs of New York City.
Sounding the theme of what could be a Presidential campaign, he belittled the American role in Iraq and redefined patriotism to include winning "the war in the streets."
Mr. Cuomo's remarks might have been inspired by the previous speaker, Bill Cosby, who pressed one youngster to admit that in leaving school he had "made a decision." Another student said she decided to return to school because "you look around you and see people passing you by who are younger than you."
The 59-year-old Governor told the students that even he still searches for the meaning of "What is it that's important?" He invoked the theologian Pierre de Teilhard de Chardin, who concluded, "You've got to believe in something bigger than yourself."
The Governor also recalled the Simon and Garfunkel song from the film "The Graduate," which asked in the political void: "Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you."
Two decades later, he said, the nation is still searching for leadership. It doesn't have to look far. Today, Mr. DiMaggio will be marching on Fifth Avenue as grand marshal of the Columbus Day Parade. Nearby, Mr. Cuomo will be walking, but not running.

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS NOMINATION;
With Each Round of Testimony, The Mood at the Hearing Sways

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Like a tree in a storm, the mood in the Senate Judiciary hearing room has bowed in one direction or another, pressed by the force of testimony, first by Anita Hill, then by Clarence Thomas, and again today, by witnesses who backed up her story and then by witnesses who praised his character.
After a day in which Judge Thomas succeeded in cowing the skeptical Democrats on the panel, blasting them with a gale of words about a bruising process and racial discrimination, the four impressive witnesses who backed up Professor Hill succeeded in refocusing the issue: It is her word versus his. Did he, as her superior and as the nation's top enforcer of employment discrimination laws, sexually harass her or not? 
 Saturday had belonged to Judge Thomas. Today, the wind shifted back the other way for most of the day, as friends eloquently defended Professor Hill with hard testimony that she had told them that her boss had made inappropriate advances long before it became a public issue.
 Then, late in the day, a panel of women who had worked for Judge Thomas tried to shift it again, defending him in broad terms of rectitude.
 
Fox in a Hen House?
 Joel R. Paul, an American University law professor who said that Professor Hill told him in 1987 that she had left the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission because she had been sexually harassed by her superior, described her story by echoing the phrase of a colleague, "This was a case of the fox guarding the hen house."
In trying to discredit Anita F. Hill, Clarence Thomas and his supporters have protrayed many faces of the Oklahoma Law School Professor.
Indeed, they painted so many pictures that some of them seemed contradictory. She was said to be malleable enough to become the tool of special interest groups or, on the other hand, so strongly opinionated that she would stomp out of meetings if she did not ger her way. His supporters have suggested that she was a troubled woman who fantasized about a relationship with him that did not exist, and, on the other hand, that she was a ambitious woman with her eye ever on her career. Judge Thomas has claimed that Professor Hill was so conscious of blackness that she criticized him when he dated or promoted women with lighter skin than hers, but also that she was now capable of using racial stereotypes damaging to blacks to destroy him.
In a panel tonight, women who had worked at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with both Judge Thomas and Professor Hill also offered contradictory images: One witness described her as stridently aggressive; another as reserved. They all called her aloof; yet J.C. Alvarez, a former aide to Senator John Danforth and staffer at the E.E.O.C., suggested that she might want to turn her experience before the Senate into a book or movie, saying she wanted to be "the Rosa Parks of sexual harassment."
 While one witness, Phyllis Berry, gave her theory, without illustration, that Professor Hill might have had a crush on Judge Thomas, Ms. Alvarez said that the two were not romantically interested in each other at all.
 A third, Nancy Fitch, prompted by Republican Senator Arlen Specter, suggested that, based on her non-professional reading of psychology, that perhaps Professor Hill was engaged in "transference," a psychological condition where you transfer your feelings about one person to someone else.
 They all said that the incident she described could not have occurred, that she was not telling the truth, but that they also were firm in the view that she was not the sort of person to lie or make things up.
In the first panel, four people who knew Professor Thomas, including Susan Hoerchner, a workers' compensations judge in California, and Ellen Wells, the project manager for the American Welfare Association in Washingotn, and a former beau, John Carr, a Wall Street lawyewr, said that Professor Hil told them she was being sexually harassed by her boss.
Her friends described Professor Hill as neither malleable nor vengeful. They said she was a private, reserved, pragmatic, moralistic woman who did not have fantasies.
"She's one of the most level-headed people I have ever known," Judge Hoerchner said.
Mr. Paul appeared to blow a hole in the Republican contention that Professor Hill was a pawn of liberal interest groups when he revealed that she had ardently defended the nomination of Judge Bork to the Supreme Court during a lunch at American University in 1987.
The "he said, she said" drama, with its attendant circus of spin doctors, interest groups and partisan lobbyists, continued to confuse and frustrate the Senators sitting in judgment. Professor Hill's lawyer scored a public relations coup by offering the results of a two-hour lie detector test that she took today, showing a result of "no deception."
"It may not be admissible in a court of law, but it's certain to weigh heavily on the minds of the Senate," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.
 
'Like a Football Game'
 All around the Russell Office Building, the two sides collided.
Outside the hearing room, women's groups defended themselves from Republican charges that they had concocted a plot to "get" Judge Thomas and fed the words and images to Professor Hill. Nearby, conservatives supporting Judge Thomas insisted that if she was telling the truth, she would have come forward eight years ago.
Outside the building, women lined the steps, holding signs that read, "Black women for Thomas," as other women chanted "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Clarence Thomas has got to go."
"Look, it's just like a football game," Fred McGrath, a lawyer from Arlington, Va., told his 3-year-old daughter, Mary.
Int he second panel of the day, the four women who worked with Judge Thomas at the Equal Employment Oportunity Commission defended his management style with women as progressive and professional.
 They echoed each other in saying the probability was "zero" that Judge Thomas could use the type of obscene language that Professor Hill described her former boss using with her. In response to a question by Senator Leahy, who noted that some of the Judge's Yale Law School colleagues have said that Mr. Thomas liked to go to see X-rated movies and then humorously describe the plots, the women said they had not had such experiences at work with the Judge.
The judge's supporters offered sometimes-contradictory descriptions of Professor Hill, with some presenting her as completely professional and confident and one presenting her as a scorned woman.
 Ms. Alvarez said that Professor HIll's testimony seemed "like schizophrenia" and that she had a view of herself that was so confident that it "did not seem to be based on reality."
 On Friday, she played the role of a meek, innocent, shy Baptist girl form the South who was the victim of this big bad man," she said. She said that the woman she knew was "a very hard, tough woman."
 
Explaining Moves
 While Ms. Alvarez said she saw no evidence of romantic interest between Anita F. Hill and Clarence Thomas, Ms. Berry repeated her now-familiar charge, not corroborated elsehwere, that "she had a crush on the chairman" and "wished she could have had a greater relationship with the chairman than just professional."
 For Mr. Thomas's supporters, the crux of the issue has been this: They contend that Professor Hill would not have followed the Judge from one job to another or kept in touch with him if he had done what she said.
 Today, her two friends, Ms. Wells and Judge Hoerchner, tried to explain, from the woman's point of view, why a woman would not want to penalize herself economically after suffering emotionally, and why women must sometimes swallow insults from bosses just as men do to get the best opportunities in their careers.
 
'Don't Burn Your Bridges'
 "If you hope to go forward," said Ms. Wells, who said she had been the victim of sexual harassment herself, "and, by going forward, move out from under their power and control, you sometimes have to put up with things that no one should be expected to put up with."
Ms. Wells added, at another point, in trying to explain why Ms. Hill would not cut off all contact with someone as well-known and helpful to her career as Judge Thomas had been: "We're all told about networking, I mean my goodness gracious, you can open up any woman's magazine and you can go to seminars on how women are supposed to learn to network, since we don't have the old boys' club. Take up golf, ladies, take up tennis, learn to get there so you can do these things to maintain these contacts. And so you don't burn your bridges.
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the chairman of the panel, defended male sensitivity, noting that he could see the issue from the male point of view.
 "I wonder how men there are, if in fact they were approached by a man on the job who was, had a different sexual preference than they do, I wonder how ready they would be to go open and say, 'By the way, my boss, that fellow up there, approached me.' "

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS NOMINATION;
Blacks Say the Blood Spilled In the Thomas Case Stains All

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Wherever black Americans gathered this past week -- in churches and hair salons, in offices and on college campuses -- they talked of little else but the sexual harassment accusations against Judge Clarence Thomas.
Some said they believed him. Some said they believed his accuser, Prof. Anita F. Hill. But regardless, what stood out was dismay: a sickening feeling that the episode had damaged lives and tarnished reputations far beyond those of the two principals. 
 While white Americans tend to view the case as a dispute over sexual harassment and the credibility of two believable witnesses, many blacks say it is much more: an embarrassment to their race, one that will be caricatured in history.
And they are angered that two highly accomplished black people, in whom they might otherwise take pride, are at the center of such a nasty, lurid political soap opera.
"We have two African-American people pitted against each other," said Raymond A. Anderson during a break in choir rehearsals at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles. "It really doesn't matter whether Judge Thomas is guilty or innocent. It doesn't matter whether Ms. Hill has credibility or not. What the image is throughout the country, throughout the world, is that we are not credible, trustworthy people, but vulgar, shiftless . . . . I could go on."
Another choir member, Victoria F. Hicks, agreed. "There are so many educated, just stellar lawyers who are African-American in this country that I am embarrassed that President Bush put someone up there who he knew had skeletons in the closet."
Conversations this past week with four dozen blacks around the country of varying ages, professions, political persuasions and socio-economic groups revealed those who suspected the allegations were a conspiracy to scuttle the nomination and those who were offended a black woman's claim of harassment could be ignored.
But there was wide agreement that the case would have deep social, cultural, political and professional repercussions for all blacks, particularly black men.
Even if it did not reveal how they felt about Judge Thomas himself, or the allegations against him, Judge Thomas's words struck a chord deep in the black male psyche. Many were swayed by the nominee's comments that the sexual allegations against him perpetuated the worst stereotypes about black men and their views of sex.
"Black men will feel it reinforces negative stereotypes about them as sexual animals out of control," said Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, the Harvard psychiatrist, from his home in Cambridge, Mass. "It will increase their level of tension and vulnerability around charges of this type and make them tiptoe carefully because they may feel they will be more likely targets."
No less than the 100 senators who are to vote on the nomination on Tuesday, black Americans have agonized these past few days over separating their judgment of Judge Thomas, his conservative views and the accusations against him from the larger points he made in defense of himself.
"We can't let our feelings toward him get in the way of whether there was sexual harassment," said Ronald Prince, a hair stylist at Details Hair Design on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. "He's not on trial. Even if he were, none of us, especially those white men on that committee, have the right to stand in judgment of him."
 
Seeing a Racial Element
 John McGee, a 23-year-old legal assistant who lives in Washington, said: "As a black man, as a black American, it's been painful for me to watch this. I feel for both of them. And I know what Thomas is going through because this happened to me once. My crime was saying hello to a white cheerleader at my high school. She read that as me hitting on her and told my coach she felt intimidated."
While many said they were at first reluctant to believe the case had a racial element to it, their minds were changed when they watched Judge Thomas having to defend himself to a panel of white male politicians.
"Those who are very insightful saw the racial overtones," said Randy Treece, 43, of Albany, who has represented women in sexual harassment cases in his 15 years as a trial lawyer. "What are the ramifications on the black community when you have two stellar personalities talking about some of the most private, offensive things that could ever be brought up. Will it mean that black professionals may be judged on their private, personal lives rather than their ability to do the job? I don't know."
Black men and women alike spoke of fears that the allegations would kill Judge Thomas's chance to be confirmed and make it impossible for another black to be nominated. Others questioned Professor Hill's motivations, asserting that she was acting as "a tool" for white men to ruin the life of a black man at the peak of his career.
 
Deepening Resentment
 And many said the controversy would undoubtedly strain the already fragile state of relations between black men and black women.
"There's a high level of anger among black men," Dr. Poussaint said, "be they low-income or professional, that black women will betray them; that black women are given preference over them; that white men like to put black women in between them to use them. Black men feel that white men are using this black woman to get another black man. It's troubling."
From the moment Professor Hill's allegations were made public, there were blacks who saw racial overtones. The hearings, which many had hoped would reveal who was telling the truth, only seemed to fuel some of their suspicions: why Professor Hill, given her legal background, had not confronted Judge Thomas when the offenses first occurred? Why, despite feeling sexually harassed, she had followed him to another agency? Why had she maintained friendly contact with him throughout the past 10 years?
"I think it's just another plot for the white man to put the black man down and keeping us against each other," said Clarence M. Brown Jr., a collection agent who was attending choir rehearsals at First A.M.E. Church, which has one of Los Angeles' largest black congregations. "It's another black role model shot down."
Kenneth Alberty, a client at Detail Hair Designs in Manhattan, said: "Who knows, maybe this is a sister who doesn't want to see a black man get ahead. They used a black woman to get to Marion Barry, remember."
 
The Lens of Race
 Some wondered whether Professor Hill would have been taken more seriously if she had been white. "I think that if they were white, this would have been handled in closed-Senate chambers, rather than aired all over national television," said Monica Scott, a 50-year-old visiting nurse in New York City. "If Anita Hill were a white I think the Senate committee would flown her in and asked her face to face about this, rather than dismiss it out of hand."
Dr. Robert T. Carter, associate professor of psychology and education at Teachers' College at Columbia University, said the differences in how blacks and whites view the situation reflects the "continuing significance of race in American society."
"There is a lot of diversity of blacks with respect to where they fall in terms of identity," he said. "A lot also depends onon where they are and what's going on in their lives."
Some blacks theorize that Judge Thomas's personal life, in particular his marriage to a white woman, has left him more vulnerable to to criticism, especially from black women.
Other blacks, however, don't think race is a factor and view this as a case of sexual harassment, pure and simple.
"This is a personalized situation that deals with relations between two individuals," said H. Carl McCall, senior vice president at Citibank and a president of New York City's Board of Education. "We shouldn't draw any implications that it goes beyond that. Nor as a black man should I feel threatened by anything I've heard. Thomas doesn't represent all blacks."
Others argue that Mr. Thomas's race should not be an excuse for harassing women. Nor, they say, should a black woman, or any woman for that matter, stand by silently and take such treatment. "It's the coming of age of black women," said LaShaune Armstrong, a 21-year-old student at Lehmann College. "She's bringing to the fore a decade of mistreatment by men of all races, and that's something all women can identify with."
The split in opinion in many ways mirrors that of the white community about sexual harassment. Some black men interviewed tended to identify most with Judge Thomas and what they view as his persecution for an act that many men could well have been guilty of.
"I've got a husband and two sons," said Brenda Canty, who is majoring in elementary education at Hunter College. "As a woman, I can relate to Anita Hill. God knows we've all been subjected to some form of sexual harassment in our lives. But as a mother and wife, I know this society has a history of mistreatment and abuse toward black men. You have to wonder, what if my son is accused of this. Is he going to get a fair shake?"
But others said the case reflected badly on the race as a whole. "This is going to come back to haunt all blacks, just watch," said Tan Wood, a professional model who was discussing the case with friends at the hair salon. "They, I mean whites, won't just see this as a case of did he or didn't he sexual harass her? No. They're going to say a black man had a shot at the Supreme Court and blew it. If he's not confirmed, you can bet the next nominee won't be a black man, that's for sure."

HEADLINE: This Lottery's Jackpot Is Green, but It's Not Money

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MERRIFIELD, Va., Oct. 13

 BODY:
They were not huddled masses exactly: a Swiss investor, a Polish carpenter, a ski instructor from Ireland. But they came by plane, train and automobile, slept in cheap hotels and parking lots, and fought long, jostling lines outside a post office to fill mail bins with the pristine white envelopes that might prove to be their passage to America.
If there was one thing they all agreed on, it's that this was no way to run an immigration program. 
 "I just love it here, but I just can't understand why they distribute the their green cards they way they do," said Torsten Murat, 24 years old, a German student who made a 15-hour, overnight drive from Nashville to drop off his applications for a much-criticized lottery for the cards, which offer permanent legal residence.
Under a 1990 law, the Government will accept the first 40,000 applications it receives from citizens of 34 countries, mostly in Europe, to correct what some have described as their underrepresentation among immigrants. By law, 40 percent of those accepted for the first three years of the lottery, which will be an annual event, must come from Ireland.
 
Long Shots
 Applicants can mail as many letters as they want, with many sending hundreds and even thousands, and the Government expects as many as five million applications to arrive by the Oct. 20 deadline. Those odds have had would-be legal residents, who otherwise might have to wait as long as 10 years for one of the 700,000 cards the Government grants a year, spinning elaborate strategies for getting letters to the head of the line.
One problem is that those received before 12:01 A.M. Monday are being disqualified. Another is that the Government has not announced how it will decide which among the millions of pieces of mail got there first. A previous such lottery simply registered them all and chose the winners by computer, a process that many immigration lawyers say would relieve the current process of its chaos.
The Government designated the post office in this Washington suburb as the sorting site for the letters. While officials say that delivering them by hand here brings no special advantage, the crowd in the parking lot surged to as many as 3,000 at 7 P.M. Saturday, rumored to be prime time, since letters that arrive afterward are not processed until the first thing Monday morning .
"It was a mob. It was like Berlin Wall," said Cezary Smulski, 22, who already has his legal status but was helping two Polish friends from Staten Island seek theirs. Some of those in the rear of the crowd threw their boxes of letters, and one man was knocked into a bin.
By this morning the line had thinned to throngs only hundreds strong, some making multiple strolls past the two dozen canvas bins, to space their letters at strategic intervals.
 
500 Letters and Strategy
 Lester D., 29, once of Dublin and now illegally of Northern California, flew in from San Francisco on Thursday, armed with 500 letters that he and his girlfriend had printed on her personal computer.
He mailed some before he left. He had friends in Maine, Utah, England, and Ireland do the same, in his name. He rented a car and mailed others from various Washington suburbs.
Then he came to Merrifield on Saturday night, and at three different times on Sunday, making as many bets as he could.
"I'm just trying to spread it out to cover as many possibilities," said the ski instructor, who refused to give his last name for fear of being arrested by immigration officers. "They're not releasing very much information about how they're going to do this."
Lester D. said that Irish community organizations in San Francisco were collecting letters and offering to deliver them for free, but he spent $500 on the trip in order to get a little peace of mind. "There's a lot at stake for a lot of people here," he said.
 
Hoping to Lick the Odds
 With applications limited only by the price of a 29-cent stamp, one of the toughest questions everyone faced was: how many letters are enough? On Sunday morning, Monique R., from Poland, sat on the ground in the parking lot where she'd spent the night, glumly licking her way to an answer.
After reading about the lottery in a Polish newspaper in New York, she drove to Virginia with 10 letters, only to find herself among competitors with thousands. She scrounged enough money to copy 200 more, and a roll of stamps, but argued that the process was biased toward those from wealthier backgrounds.
"Japanese people send million letters per person," she said in tentative English. "This is crazy idea. This is big job, preparing million letters."
Exasperated, frightened and hopeful, many of the would-be immigrants milled about the parking lot, even after mailing their letters, telling their stories of hard work and old-fashioned values to reporters, one another, and anyone else who would listen.
"I work! I pay taxes! I never get one dollar from unemployment," said Mark O., a carpenter on Staten Island, who said he arrived from Poland illegally seven years ago and has proved his mettle with 90-hour work weeks that recently allowed him to buy a $100,000 house with cash. Wearing a black leather jacket, three days' stubble and the musk of Marlboros, he described himself as a captive of his chosen country, unable even to return to Poland last year for his father's funeral because he feared being unable to come back.
Joining him, a Swiss man wearing a gold chain and designer jeans offered his angry agreement.
"Yes, we are in prison here, though we chose it," said the man, who gave his name only as Michael, and said he had flown in from Florida with 600 letters. He said he was living off his assets of approximately a half-million dollars in Switzerland, needing twice that to immigrate under a special program for foreign investors.
Michael looked suspiciously at the television cameras in the parking lot and asked the reporter to strike a detail about his family that might identify him. "I worry," he said.

 BODY:
CARMEL QUINN, who sings Irish songs, is philosophical about performing at benefits. "If it's a good dinner, the guests get logy and the act suffers," she said. "If it's a bad dinner, they get cranky and the act suffers. So I just put my faith in God, say a couple of prayers and do my best."
That approach will come in handy on Wednesday, when she is to sing for six cardinals: JOHN CARDINAL O'CONNOR of New York; ANTHONY CARDINAL BEVILACQUA of Philadelphia; JAMES CARDINAL HICKEY of Washington; BERNARD CARDINAL LAW of Boston; G. EMMETT CARDINAL CARTER of Toronto, and MIGUEL CARDINAL OBANDO y BRAVO of Nicaragua. 
 Ms. Quinn, who will perform at the Michigan League at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, will help raise money to build a new cathedral in Managua. The new cathedral will replace one that was nearly destroyed by an earthquake in 1972. The Catholic community there has been struggling to rebuild it ever since but has been hampered by the depressed economy.
When she was younger, the prospect of entertaining such an audience would have unnerved her. "The biggest person in my life was the parish priest, now we're talking cardinals -- and six of them at that," she said. "I'm delighted. I must remember that they were once struggling young priests hoping to make it to monsignor."

HEADLINE: Farmer Suicide Rate Swells in 1980's, Study Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WAUSAU, Wis., Oct. 13

 BODY:
More than 900 male farmers in the Upper Midwest committed suicide in the 1980's, and in some years the incidence of suicide in that group was nearly double the national average for white men, a study shows.
The National Farm Medicine Center, which conducted the study over nine years, said it planned further research to determine if there was a link between the suicide rate and the economic hardship that affected many Midwest farmers in the 1980's. The group plans to make the survey public on Monday. 
 The decade was a particularly stressful time for farmers, with record indebtedness, unstable prices, declining land values and drought. There were thousands of foreclosures and bankruptcies.
The study reported that 913 male farmers killed themselves in the 1980's in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana.
 
Rate Peaked in 1982
 The farm medicine center, founded at a clinic in the central Wisconsin town of Marshfield in 1981 to conduct agricultural health and safety research and education, also found that 71 female farmers, 96 farm children and 177 farm workers killed themselves from 1980 to 1988, the last year figures were compiled.
Using information provided by public health agencies, the study found that there were 44 suicides for every 100,000 farmers and ranchers in 1980, said Paul Gunderson, who helped conduct the researchn.
Nationwide in 1980, 31 suicides occurred for every 100,000 white males age 20 or older, he said.
After peaking at 58 suicides for every 100,000 farmers in 1982, the rate fell to 42 suicides in 1985, then climbed slightly again. In 1988 there were 48 suicides in 100,000 farmers, as against a national rate of 22.
A study of the first half of the decade, conducted by Mr. Gunderson and others for the Minnesota Center for Health Statistics, showed many of the suicides were prompted by serious injuries, alcoholism, terminal illness and family problems. It also found the depressed ecomony contributed to the problem.

HEADLINE: Ron Silver Hits The Ground Running At Actors' Equity

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL

 BODY:
Ron Silver received rave reviews as Alan M. Dershowitz in "Reversal of Fortune" but he won't rest until he knocks 'em dead as Eugene V. Debs. Mr. Silver is the newly elected president of the Actors' Equity Association, perhaps the only union in the country with a 90 percent unemployment rate. For a man whose idea of a great time is to invite 10 people to dinner who won't get along, it's a perfect fit.
At his desk in the Equity offices in mid-Manhattan the other morning, Mr. Silver was jazzed and ready to go. He was meeting with union officials about his pet cause: establishing a national health care system by organizing a coalition of labor organizations and public interest groups to lobby it through Congress. He had researched the health bill exhaustively and when he discussed it, his sentences were crammed with legal jargon. You could hear the results of the semester he spent at Yale Law School last spring studying the First Amendment. 
 The three men sitting across his desk, actors of course, played their supporting roles eagerly. They nodded in all the right places, shuffled their documents, laughed at their new president's jokes. Mr. Silver was clearly the star. He had the deepest tan, the longest hair and, in a roomful of caps, the best teeth. The truth is, it has probably been years since the union has had someone as informed and committed in the unsalaried post, which has often been little more than a figurehead for public appearances.
 
An Actor's Instincts
 But the staff is still not used to him. In the middle of the meeting, one official launched into an overheated monologue on the government's unjust distribution of health benefits to AIDS patients. Mr. Silver interrupted, saying, "The best way to counter that is not with a surplus of passion." He knows a bad performance when he sees one.
As president of Actors' Equity, Mr. Silver has the unenviable task of succeeding the late Colleen Dewhurst, the earth mother of the American theater who was beloved by the staff not only because of her warm personality, but also because she let them alone. "Ron is very different from Colleen, who was really nice and sort of spacey," says one employee who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He's very focused, very intense. He reads everything, and can grill people for 45 minutes on one issue. We all can't wait for him to get a movie."
Overdrive is Mr. Silver's normal speed, but he's easy to like, and his management style at Equity is based on communication. He wants everyone to know everything all the time. (Except his age. He says he needs to protect his job prospects.) In public, he is quite amiable, smiling and shaking hands, acknowledging every compliment.
At Delsomma, an Italian restaurant in the theater district, he is greeted like a long-lost son. Other customers must order from the lunch menu, while he's allowed to turn to dinner. "Hey, how's 'Blue Steel'?" calls out the only man sitting at the bar, referring to a movie Mr. Silver was in with Jamie Lee Curtis. Mr. Silver waves.
 
Other Reputation-Makers
 He is also frequently recognized for his role in the Paul Mazursky film "Enemies, a Love Story" and for his Tony Award-winning performance in David Mamet's "Speed-the-Plow." His career has never been better. Why bother with this job? Not to mention the presidency of the Creative Coalition, a nonprofit political education advocacy group he founded in 1988.
"Everyone has a duty to be an optimist," he says. "If you get everybody talking and yelling and participating, you can go beyond cynicism or apathy."
"I also love actors," he continues, "and I think what they do is an underappreciated resource in this country."
It sounds good, but it is early in his tenure. Mr. Silver missed the controversy his predecessor endured last year over the multi-ethnic casting in "Miss Saigon." The producer Cameron Mackintosh wanted Jonathan Pryce, a Caucasian, to play the role of a Eurasian pimp on Broadway as he had in London, while members of Actors' Equity insisted the role be played by an Asian.
 
Big Issue; Two Sides
 "I would have considered myself fortunate to be the president then," Mr. Silver says. "There are very few times an organization has an opportunity to take a position on an issue with such broad implications. Clearly, the unfairness of this business is magnified if you are a minority. But I am very much against taking away the autonomy of a producer and director on casting decisions."
What would he have done differently? "With hindsight," he says, "I would have had a very good internal debate and not taken action until everyone's point of view was on the table. I would have made up a briefing booklet, so all the members would have known what the objectives and implications were."
"I think I deserve many roles I don't get either," he continues, "but this business we're in is not a meritocracy. The minority actors are laboring under even more hardships. The union's job is to sensitize people to the issue. Before we go to the mat we have to get information. Be educated. Make colorblind casting a goal to increase minority employment. But that's a long way from mandating what directors, producers and writers can do."
Mr. Silver is presiding over another nontraditional casting dispute in "The Will Rogers Follies." Actors' Equity has filed a grievance against the show's producers, for excluding minorities from a musical that glorifies the life of a man who made his reputation denouncing discrimination. "While the grievance is going on I have no right to comment on it," Mr. Silver says.
 
Things He Hasn't Done
 Though Mr. Silver is adept at handling the job's messy politics, he admits to shortcomings in other areas. "There are definite gaps in my experience that are a weakness," he says. "I've never been in a national road company or a bus-and-truck tour. I've never done a musical. So I'm not up on those details."
"But," he continues, "what I hope to do is to use our weight as a union more effectively. Actors' Equity should have a stronger voice in city affairs, because our well-being is vital to the city. Forty-nine percent of tourists list the theater as the first reason they come to New York. And the voices you do hear representing theater in the city are heard from the employers' side. Hopefully, now, we will have a louder voice."
The playwright Wendy Wasserstein, who is on the board of directors of the Creative Coalition, became friendly with Mr. Silver when he played a driving instructor in a short play she wrote for "Trying Times," a public television series. "He kept asking all these questions about the driving instructor," Ms. Wasserstein says, "and finally I said, 'Ron, please, it's a half an hour on PBS."
"The reason he will be a great president of Equity," she continues, "is that he really wants to keep the theater alive, and he's interested in politics generally, not just the politics of Equity. He always has an opinion, he's lively and he's got a great wife. He also gives a great seder."
 
'Nothing Is Skipped Over'
 This Passover seder given annually by Mr. Silver and his wife, Lynne Miller Silver, a magazine editor, is something of an obsession for people in the entertainment industry, because over the last few years it has become the toughest invitation in town. With guests like Madonna, Paul Simon, Rudolph Giuliani and Ron Darling, the Four Questions are suddenly the epitome of chic. But glitter aside, Mr. Silver says: "We read every word of the service. Nothing is skipped over."
And because such a variety of people are invited, he gets to have his arguments. "In L.A., you're soiling paradise if you yell at a dinner party," he says, laughing. "Not at my house."
He learned to speak his mind, he says, growing up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. "I've always had a sense of responsibility to a greater community other than myself. The most intimate community, of course, is your family. And in the Jewish religion, when you pray for salvation, it's for the community, not the individual. I never forgot that."
He was back in his old neighborhood recently to cut the ribbon, along with Mayor David N. Dinkins, at the new Variety Arts Theater on Third Avenue at 14th Street. A large crowd was assembled out front and Mr. Silver was in top form. He hugged and kissed a paparazzo. He embraced the Mayor. When he stepped up to the microphone, a middle-aged woman behind one of the sawhorses suddenly became distraught. She and her friend had waited an hour, protecting their view, and now, the Mayor's security men had blocked her. She spotted a professional photographer who was allowed up front, and waved her Instamatic.
"Please, please, this is a great moment for us," she begged, until he agreed to photograph Mr. Silver. "I just love him," the woman said, "especially in that film. You know, 'The Enemy Within.' "
Before Mr. Silver helped cut the ribbon, he made a brief speech in which he said: "The city and state reflexively support sports, thinking that they build character through adversity. I would argue that the arts build character better. Not on competition, but through compassion."
The woman behind the barrier sighed. The crowd applauded. Compared to this, Alan Dershowitz was chopped liver.

HEADLINE: 4 Killed and 2 Are Wounded in Queens Rampage

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
A 47-year-old neighborhood eccentric went on a rampage with a rifle at his Queens home early yesterday and, leaving his father and three other men dead and two neighbors critically wounded, broke into a Nassau County home nearby, took a retired couple hostage and held off a cordon of police firepower all day.
In a drama that the police said began with killings and a manhunt and brought terror to a quiet neighborhood of elegant homes and leafy streets, the rifleman, Andrew T. Brooks Jr., holed up at a home in Lake Success, L.I., fired on a gardener, punctuated the afternoon with gunshots at the police and talked sporadically by telephone with hostage negotiators. 
 The police said Mr. Brooks, who had no criminal record or history of mental illness, was coherent and did not seem to know his captives, apparently having chosen their home at random. He demanded only a six-pack of Coke, which was hoisted by rope up to a bedroom window where he sat most of the day, taking potshots at the ground, at nearby homes and at officers besieging him outside.
 
Hostage Escapes After 13 Hours
 But he was persuaded to release one of the hostages, Dr. Paul Gregory, a 71-year-old retired psychiatrist from Hungary, unharmed in the morning. And late in the afternoon, after being held for nearly 13 hours, Dr. Gregory's 61-year-old wife, Paige Eva, escaped without injury, running out the front door when her captor began to doze off.
"Come on! Come on!" an officer shouted as she fled to freedom. The police said Mr. Brooks might have shot at her but did not do so.
As searchlights played over the scene, the standoff lasted into today, with the gunman adamantly refusing to surrender and surrounded by a small army of officers in flak jackets with high-powered rifles behind the cover of trees, cars and the evacuated homes of neighbors.
Late last night, however, the police began closing in. A robot with a camera eye trundled into the house to spy on the gunman, who fired at it. A special weapons assault team then crept in and seized the ground floor, leaving the gunman isolated upstairs.
Earlier in the day, the police said Mr. Brooks had shot all six victims many times with a .22-caliber rifle at his home at 53-42 254th Street in Little Neck, about four blocks from the house where he took refuge and hostages. But authorities said it appeared that not all of the victims were slain yesterday.
They said the gunman's father, Andrew T. Brooks Sr., a 75-year-old retired teacher with whom he lived, and Brian Ducker, 30, of 53-26 254th Street, a neighbor who had missing since Thursday, were found dead in a backyard toolshed and may have been slain several days ago.
The others -- two men killed and two others wounded -- were believed to have been shot early yesterday in the assailant's home. The police said all four were residents of the Little Neck neighborhood and were longtime acquaintances of the man who shot them.
The police identified the slain men as Daniel Gantovnik, 23, of 53-15 254th Street, whose body was found in the living room, and Michael Zarabi, 27, of 60 Fairview Avenue, found dead in the kitchen. Mr. Gantovnik worked in his family's garment business and Mr. Zarabi worked in an auto body shop in Great Neck, L.I., friends said.
The wounded men, whose addresses were not released because they are potential witnesses in the case, were identified as Stanley Sultan, 25, and Andrew Lazan, 22.
 
Spotted by Wedding Guests
 Mr. Sultan, who managed to stumble out of the house after being shot, was spotted by guests who were leaving a wedding reception at a nearby synagogue. They called the police, and Mr. Sultan was taken to Booth Memorial Medical Center in Queens. Mr. Lazan, who was found shot in the Brooks's kitchen, was taken to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. Both were listed in critical condition today with multiple gunshot wounds.
A 12-gauge shotgun was found in the Brooks home, but it had evidently not been used in the assaults, the police said. They said Mr. Brooks had shot his victims with a .22-caliber rifle with a sawed-off butt. Numerous shell casings were found in the house and he apparently still had considerable ammunition, investigators said.
The police said the suspect's mother, Marion Brooks, was missing yesterday, and investigators said they feared she, too, had been a victim of what they called her son's unexplained rampage, though they said they had no evidence. A search was under way for her.
The shootings echoed another multiple slaying in another New York City suburb last week. On Thursday, a dismissed postal clerk killed his former supervisor and her boyfriend in Wayne, N.J., then descended on the post office in nearby Ridgewood and killed two mail handlers before surrendering to a police siege.
While the police said they did not know of any motive for the shootings, neighbors said they were not surprised at the eruption of violence. Andrew Brooks Jr., who had lived with his parents and been unemployed nearly all his life, was known as an eccentric who prowled the neighborhood swinging a golf club, peered into windows, talked to himself and stared at and followed young women on the street.
A heavyset man with long, grayish-brown slicked-back hair who often wore the same black-and-white plaid shirt and usually appeared unkempt, Mr. Brooks was said to do occasional odd jobs for neighbors, watching homes while people were away, but more often made money by renting or selling pornographic videotapes. He also occasionally lent a little cash to young people who otherwise spurned his company, neighbors said.
 
Especially Strange Recently
 A woman who spoke on the condition of anonymity said she had grown up next door to Andrew Brooks. She said he had always acted strangely, but had begun to behave especially so in recent days. She said he had told her that he was taking medication for allergies and that it was damaging him.
"The damage is irreversible; it's in my blood," he told her a few days ago, she said. And on Wednesday, she said, he told her: "You won't be seeing me around." She also quoted him as saying that his mother and father were "bothering" him, preventing him from healing his allergies.
Another neighbor who identified herself only as Wilma said she had known Mr. Brooks for more than 20 years. "He treated his parents like garbage and they were afraid of him," she said. "I told his father, 'How can you live with someone you're afraid of?' I told him, 'He's going to kill you.' "
But another neighbor, Dan Gallo, 24, said: "He wasn't bothersome. He was just a local hobo trying to wheel and deal to make a quick buck."
The exact sequence of events that led to four deaths and the critical wounding of two neighbors was unclear, the police said. But they said Mr. Brooks's elderly father and Mr. Ducker, who was reported missing Thursday after a friend who was unable to reach him by phone and found the door of his home ajar, may have been slain Thursday or Friday. Their bodies were found in a 4-foot yellow toolshed in the backyard.
The four other victims may have been shot early yesterday, the police said, probably about 2 A.M., after going to the Brooks home, a two-story red-brick detached ranch on 254th Street, near Little Neck Parkway, which skirts the Nassau border a few blocks inside Queens.
Julio Gantovnik said his brother Daniel and Mr. Sultan went to the house to discuss money that Mr. Sultan owed Mr. Brooks, but it was unclear why Mr. Zarabi and Mr. Lazan went there.
Though critically wounded, Mr. Sultan stumbled out of the house and made his way toward Temple Torah at 55-27 Little Neck Parkway, where someone called 911 at 2:20 A.M. to report the shootings. But even as the police rushed to the house to find the victims, Mr. Brooks was escaping with his rifle in a family car.
He apparently did not drive far. The car was found abandoned a few blocks away in Lake Success. Mr. Brooks left the car and apparently wandered around, trying doors in search of a place to hide. Several homeowners reported that their locked doors were rattled in the early-morning hours.
 
Awoke Hostages Before Dawn
 While the police searched the tree-lined streets and large, manicured yards of the uppermiddle-class neighborhood on foot and in prowl cars and helicopters, Mr. Brooks broke a window pane in a rear door about 5 A.M. and entered a two-story red-brick and white-shingled house at 44 Bates Road in Lake Success.
Two hours before sunrise, he awoke Dr. Gregory and his wife and held them at gunpoint for hours. The police, meantime, discovered where he was -- and the hostage situation -- about 8:30 A.M., when Mr. Brooks fired four shots at a gardener arriving for work at the Gregory home. The gardener was unhurt and called 911.
Although the jurisdiction had shifted from New York City to Nassau County, city and county police joined forces in the siege at the Gregory home.
After evacuating eight homes nearby, the police stationed sharpshooters behind trees and cars, sent a rolling robot with a camera up the lawn in front of the house and formed a command post in a home next door. There, hostage negotiators called him up.
 
Hostage Hoists a 6-Pack
 Inspector James G. Courtney, the executive officer of Queens detectives, said Dr. Gregory was released at 10:30 A.M. as a result of negotiations with Mr. Brooks. Dr. Gregory was admitted to Long Island Jewish Hospital where he was treated for trauma and listed in stable condition last night.
Later, Mr. Brooks requested a can of Coke, and then a six-pack of the soda, which Mrs. Gregory lifted on a rope to a second-floor bedroom window where the rifleman was holding her at gunpoint. Several hours later, Mr. Brooks closed the window and took the telephone off the hook.
But a negotiator re-established contact with him over a bullhorn: "Andy . . . pick up the phone. We have a message for you. Pick up the phone."
At 5:40 P.M., when Mr. Brooks began to nod off, Mrs. Gregory crept downstairs and fled out the front door. The police said she was unhurt, though shaken. Mr. Brooks did not fire at her. But, stripped of the leverage of hostages, he still declined to surrender, and the siege continued early today.

HEADLINE: Washington Voters Weigh Aid of Doctors in Suicide

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Early next month voters in this state will decide an issue that has never appeared on a ballot in the United States: Should doctors be allowed to kill terminally ill patients who have asked to die?
The ballot measure, Initiative 119, would make Washington State the first jurisdiction in the Western World to legalize euthanasia. And it raises the possibility of overturning a 2,000-year-old tenet of medical tradition. 
 Called the Death With Dignity proposal, Initiative 119 earned a spot on the Nov. 5 ballot after more than 223,000 signatures were gathered by people who believe that the timing of one's death is a basic right. If the initiative passes, terminally ill patients would be allowed to commit suicide with the help of their doctors, and it would clarify the conditions under which life-support systems could be withdrawn from patients who have already stated their intentions in a living will.
And in the most controversial part of the initiative, doctors would be allowed to kill patients who had been told they had fewer than six months to live and had made a written request to die. Many doctors say lethal injection is the form of euthanasia that is most likely to be adopted, although specific procedures will have to be worked out later if the initiative passes.
Unlike the other dramatic proposal on the ballot here this fall, a term limit initiative that would throw out the entire Congressional delegation three years after the vote, Initiative 119 is not likely to be held up by an immediate Constitutional fight. Opponents say it is unclear that a basis exists for a court injunction, but they say they may still mount a legal challenge.
The campaign has brought out into the open the private anguish of doctors, some of whom say they wonder whether their role as healers would be compromised if they become agents of death. Other doctors see the initiative as a humane and long-overdue response to patients who want as much control over their own deaths as they have in their lives.
 
'Not an Alarmist'
 But no matter which side of the issue they are on, doctors from around the country say voters in Washington State would change the nature of American medicine with passage of the initiative.
"I'm not an alarmist by nature, but I am absolutely terrifed of what this could mean," said Dr. Carlos F. Gomez, a doctor at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center and the author of a book on euthanasia. "The proponents talk about physician-assisted suicide as a right. But I don't understand how you can have a right to be killed."
For the Hemlock Society, whose supporters nationwide are backing 119 with a flood of donations, the initiative is a chance to put into law what the membership has long believed: a philosophy of death that was once dismissed as a fringe belief.
With the help of "Final Exit," by Derek Humphry (Hemlock Society/ Carol, 1991), a suicide-manual that has become a best seller, the society is also trying to make a mainstream concern of a topic that was once taboo. Having failed to place a similar measure on the ballot in California and Oregon, the society succeeded in Washington, which has a tradition of creating novel legislation through a vote of the people.
Around the state, at gatherings in high school gyms and churches and on television, voters are drawing on images of dying loved ones and quoting scripture as they debate the last act of life. In early private polls, a majority of people backed the initiative. And with more than $1 million raised, the initiative's supporters have a 5-1 fund-raising advantage. But the lead could slip as the euthanasia part of the measure is highlighted.
The campaign has been high on emotionalism and personal stories and low on sound bites from politicians, most of whom have not taken a position on the initiative.
In one television advertisement in favor of the initiative, an unconscious man is shown hooked up to a feeding machine in a hospital. "This isn't what Dad wanted," an announcer says, referring to "patients kept alive by machines against their will." Another advertisement, this one against the initiative, features a middle-aged nurse speaking directly to the camera. "I'm a hospice nurse," she says. "Initiative 119 would let doctors kill my patients."
 
2,000-Year-Old Traditions
 For the Roman Catholic Church and the medical establishment, the ballot measure portends a dangerous precedent because it removes some of the onus of suicide and sanctions an act that goes against more than 2,000 years of religious and medical traditions.
Two weeks ago, the Washington State Medical Association's House of Delegates voted by a wide margin to oppose the initiative. But the full membership, polled last spring, was split nearly 50-50.
Regarding people without means, some social workers have said they fear that, faced with choosing between months of costly medical treatment or a quicker and less expensive, deliberate death, the terminally ill patient who is poor or without health insurance is more likely to choose death.
As written, the initiative says a patient can request "aid in dying," doctor-assisted suicide or euthanasia, only if two doctors have concluded that the patient has less than six months to live. Also, two people who have no family or financial ties to the patient must witness the written death request. A person in a coma, without a living will -- that is, a set of written instructions in which a patient will outline in advance how they would like to be treated if faced with a terminal illness or if they fall into a coma -- would not qualify under either circumstance.
More than anything else, proponents speak of a desire for control and choice over the last months of their lives. But many doctors say estimates of how much time a terminally ill patient may have are often wrong. It is not uncommon, the doctors say, for someone who is expected to live for only three months to live another three years. These doctors say they worry that patients may choose death when a considerable burst of life may still be left inside them.
If the measure passes, doctors in this state will be grappling next year with a medical procedure for which there is no set of standards -- death by physician.
 
Bad Medicine and Policy?
 And while supporters of Initiative 119 see the vote as an attempt to take perhaps the most important decision of all out of the hands of doctors, many physicians say the proposal could have just the opposite effect.
"If people are sick of us playing God now, wait until they see what happens if 119 passes," said Dr. Peter McGough of Seattle, who is a leader of a group of doctors opposed to the measure. "I would be placed in a position where I would be asked to take the life of a patient. That is bad medicine and public bad policy."
But supporters argue that mercy killing, by back-alley or home-rigged operation or by covert assistance of doctors, is already a fact of life.
"Allowing a terminally ill patient to make the decision on when to die is the ultimate extension of patients' rights," said Dr. Linda Gromko, who favors the initiative. "The reality of life is that not all illnesses are treatable."
Dr. Gromko, a Seattle family physician, says she formed her philosophy on dying after watching patients suffer through the last months of their lives.In the case of the 60-year-old man with a terminal lung disease, Dr. Gromko said, she was frustrated by her inability to honor his last request.
"I felt so bad," she said. "I felt like I let down this dying man, who had withered away to less than 100 pounds. I could not, by law, honor his last request."
Whether doctors can honor a dying patient's request to end a life has been debated since the time of Hippocrates, the Greek scholar who is considered the founder of Western medicine. This year, the American Medical Society's ethics committee quoted Hippocrates in reaffirming its opposition to doctor-aided suicide and euthanasia.
Patients already have a right to refuse life-sustaining treatment, the committee said in a report. What terminally ill people really want is an assurance that they can die with dignity and without prolonged pain, the ethics group said.
"Medicine is a profession dedicated to healing," the doctors wrote. "Its tools should not be used to kill people."
 
'The Dirty Little Secret'
 But other health professionals argue that the medical establishment is insensitive to the needs of the dying and that it too often favors measures that needlessly prolong life through costly technology.
"Death has been the dirty little secret within the walls of the medical community," said Sara McMacken, a Seattle nurse who favors the initiative. "Patients and their loved ones are not given any choice. Doctors make all the decisions, and that's the way they would like to keep it."
Initiative 119 will be a very personal decision for Ms. McMacken. Two years ago, she was told that she had breast cancer. Her disease is in remission. "But the cancer forced me to think about death, and I would want to have that option to make the decision for myself," she said.
Since 1984 euthanasia has been tolerated, by agreement between prosecutors and doctors, in the Netherlands; it is not technically legal.
A study by the Dutch Government released last month found that less than 2 percent of all deaths in the Netherlands were brought about with the assistance of doctors and that figure is being used by supporters of the Washington initiative.
But Dr. Gomez, author of a just-published book, "Regulating Death: Euthanasia and the Case of the Netherlands," (Free Press) argues that a significant number of terminally ill patients in the Netherlands have been killed against their will. He said that though these cases are underreported, they were substantiated by interviews and anecdotal evidence.
"My real fear is that euthanasia will be used, as it sometimes is in Holland, as a tool of social and economic control," he said. "Poor people, especially in this country where we deny medical services to many of them, are the most vulnerable to be euthanized."
If Initiative 119 passes, some medical experts say, they fear that Washington State could become a magnet for people who want help in dying and that profit-minded doctors might set up shop to cater to that demand.
"There will be a flood of persons seeking aid in dying, coming from all over the United States and Canada, since only in Washington will their desire to end their lives be honored without fear of prosecution," wrote Dr. Albert R. Jonsen, chairman of the ethics department at the University of Washington's medical school, in a recent issue of the magazine Commonweal.
But the Rev. Marvin Evans, a Unitarian minister and leader of a group of clergy supporting the inititive, says Dr. Jonsen's argument assumes that any hastening of death is wrong.
"Death is not the enemy," said Rev. Evans. "Death is part of life. People want control over their own lives, and this is the final and perhaps most important thing in a life."
In one respect both sides agree: the voter turnout on Nov. 5 will set a record.

HEADLINE: Robbers Rape 3 Girls in Inwood Home

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Three young girls were raped by two armed men who pushed their way into an upper Manhattan apartment, tied up the five children and one man who were there and ransacked the home, the police said yesterday.
The oldest of the girls -- a 17-year-old, who was in the apartment with her sister, 12, and another girl, 14 -- was led at gunpoint through the apartment Saturday night as the robbers demanded that she point out her family's valuables, her father said yesterday. 
 "They said it was not enough, they wanted more, and started hitting her," the father said yesterday afternoon outside the building where he had lived since 1960. "They took the two youngest and raped them first, and my oldest was raped last."
 
A Pistol and a Knife
 Investigators believe that the two suspects -- one carrying a semiautomatic pistol and other a knife -- may be responsible for several other incidents of rape and robbery in the Inwood section, said Sgt. Angel Flores of the 34th Precinct detective squad.
The two men pushed their way into the apartment about 9 o'clock Saturday night when the 14-year-old girl arrived with two young children, 8 and 6, in tow at the apartment where the two sisters had been watching television with a 26-year-old male friend, said Officer Scott Bloch, a police spokesman. The suspects bound the occupants with cords and took the girls into another room, where they each raped them, he said.
The parents of the two sisters came home from celebrating their 19th wedding anniversary in Connecticut to find police officers scouring their apartment for clues after their children were hospitalized. The robbers took jewels that were family heirlooms, as well as $800 in cash.
The father said the suspects called a car service to make their getaway.
Like hundreds of his fellow Irish and German neighbors who once packed the apartments along Inwood's wide and sloping streets, the father could have made his own getaway decades earlier, when the neighborhood changed and became a haven for Hispanic families, especially those from the Dominican Republic.
 
A Neighborhood Commitment
 But the girls' father, who moved to Inwood as a teen-ager and married a neighborhood girl, was committed to raising his children in the same apartment where he grew up, and remained one of perhaps four what he called "American" families in the building. It was important they develop a sense of acceptance and open-mindedness toward other ethnic groups, he said.
"I felt my children needed to get to be a part of New York," he said, speaking with the broad, easygoing cadences of his native Bronx. "Why should we run if they can stay here and be a part of it? I grew up in a mixed place in the Bronx, until it was ripped up."
He has been active in community groups over the years, helping establish and run an athletic club for neighborhood youths until a recent schedule change at work cut into his spare time. He also volunteered to work with disadvantaged and homeless people.
A solidly built man with tousled salt-and-pepper hair, he walked slowly toward his home after filling a prescription for his daughters yesterday. They were upstairs in the apartment after being treated and released from Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center.
A neighbor approached and placed his hand gently on his arm.
"I'm so sorry," the neighbor said quietly in a Spanish accent.
 
'Darkest Day for Me'
 The father raised his hand to his forehead and sobbed, his large shoulders heaving inside his dark pinstriped suit. His hazel eyes were puffy from crying all night.
"This is the darkest day for me," he said later, speaking on condition of anonymity. "I hope the system takes care of it the way it's supposed to."
He took care of his family as best he could, he said, sometimes supplementing his income from a job as a midtown Manhattan doorman with a second job on Wall Street or selling sneakers at athletic-supply stores.
"I tried to be a good father, and my daughters know that," he said. "They call me Mr. Softee because if they need something they know who to come to. Mom is always a little harder on the daughters."
 
'A Part of New York'
 He and his wife sent their daughters to parochial school, where they both did well. His oldest daughter, a college freshman in the City University system, had hopes of becoming a police officer after college and had already taken the department's written test. "She's a tough girl, very open-minded," he said. "She just wanted to be a part of New York -- she didn't want to just be the person wearing the uniform; she wanted to go higher than that."
He and his wife had returned from having a belated anniversary dinner in Greenwich, Conn., when they were met by police at their apartment Saturday night. Their anniversary had been the week before, but they stayed home that time because of a weekend downpour.
"I think we were watched for when we went out," he said.
His neighbors agreed with him that while the building has been untouched by serious violence in the past, some of the nearby streets had changed for the worse since the advent of crack. Sometimes, strangers would enter the building when the lock on the front door was broken and lie in wait for possible robbery victims in the stairways.
 
An Overworked Precinct
 The father lamented the drug dealing that has scared people off some nearby streets at night, and he said the local police precinct was too overworked and understaffed to grapple with the problems.
"If you pick up the phone to call the 34, it'll ring and ring," he said. "And 911? They're slow to answer in this neighborhood."
In the face of this, he said he and his neighbors were determined to forge a sense of community despite ethnic differences. "It's a neighborhood trying to stay together," he said. "Nobody is against anybody. It's a little difficult, but people are trying to do so. Otherwise I would have moved a long time ago."
Competing for attention in the crush of emotions since the crime is the nagging thought for him that perhaps the time has come to give up on the neighborhood. Of course, he said, this could have happened anywhere, but given his modest salary as a doorman, he cannot move to just anywhere.
"Where do you go; what do you do?" he asked. "We tried to have an open mind. You try to hold a job, but at the same time the economy tells you where you live."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Total War Almost Over for Arkansas Papers

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
With a combination of business acumen, ruthlessness, deep pockets and near obsession with winning, Walter E. Hussman Jr. has made his Arkansas Democrat the dominant paper in Little Rock and seems poised to run the long-dominant Arkansas Gazette out of business.
 Since 1974, when his family-run communications company acquired The Democrat, Mr. Hussman has twice beaten The Gazette in a bitter war for advertising and circulation. 
The victory has come despite arguments by some that the politically conservative Democrat is inferior journalistically to The Gazette, the state's main liberal voice and long one of Arkansas's most powerful institutions. For instance, The Gazette won two Pulitzer Prizes for its coverage of school integration in the 1950's and has traditionally dominated Arkansas journalism competitions, winning the top award in the three main contests for the last two years.
 
Slashing of Ad Prices
 Mr. Hussman principally used extreme slashing of advertising prices to force the Patterson family to sell The Gazette to the Gannett Company in 1986; he then shifted tactics and has whipped Gannett, one of the most sophisticated newspaper chains.
 Though Gannett does not acknowledge it, the company is known to be trying to sell The Gazette to Mr. Hussman, who is widely expected to close it. An executive familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity, said The Gazette would probably cease publication within 10 days. A last-minute local effort to buy The Gazette is currently under way, but its chances look slim.
 Though both The Gazette and The Democrat are unprofitable, Gannett is said to be losing more than $30 million annually and is apparently unwilling to sustain such losses as a public company with an obligation to shareholders. Mr. Hussman has voting control over his far smaller but private company, which effectively has given him a free hand to absorb losses.
 
Profit Seen if Gazette Closes
 John Morton, a newspaper analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington, estimated that if The Gazette closes, The Democrat could earn about $30 million annually on revenues of about $110 million.
 In one sense, Mr. Hussman's success is an inspiration to the underdog small businesses competing with bigger, entrenched rivals or leviathan conglomerates.
 "Given a certain level of ability, I don't think anyone can beat an owner-operator," Mr. Hussman said late last week. "Unfortunately, there aren't that many of us left in the newspaper business."
 But Mr. Hussman's success is also a demonstration of how price cutting and shrewd public relations can win a newspaper war where, on the surface, the battle should be over quality.
 Hugh Patterson Sr., who ran The Gazette for his family, said that the Pattersons were actually the only independent operators in the fight and that Mr. Hussman unfairly used his family's profits from other papers and cable television to subsidize losses that the Pattersons, with no other properties, could not sustain.
 Gannett, which had revenues of $3.4 billion in 1990, cannot claim any economic handicap, and the newspaper industry generally expected Gannett to make fast work of Mr. Hussman. But Mr. Hussman won again with hardball business tactics, aided by some Gannett misteps and by successfully portraying himself as the local boy beseiged by an exploitive conglomerate.
 In one typical move after Gannett became the competition, Mr. Hussman changed The Democrat's front-page slogan from "Arkansas's Largest Newspaper," which had helped beat the Pattersons, to "Arkansas's Newspaper." He labeled the opposition "Gannett's Gazette."
 "The Democrat systematically painted a picture of Gannett as a company not committed to Arkansas," said J. Keith Moyer, editor of The Gazette since March 1990.
 
From Survivor to Competitor
 Mr. Hussman, who is 44 years old, said his only goal at first was The Democrat's survival. The event looked very unlikely when the paper was acquired in 1974 by the Camden News Publishing Company, the Hussman family's holding company situated in Camden, Ark., about 100 miles from Little Rock.
 The family business, started by Mr. Hussman's grandfather, now includes six small dailies in Arkansas and Texas, including The Camden News; KTAL-TV, an NBC affiliate in the Shreveport-Texarkana market; AM and FM radio stations in Camden and Shreveport-Texarkana, and about 100,000 cable subscribers in 17 cable systems, mostly in Arkansas.
 In 1974, the afternoon Democrat was in decline. Mr. Hussman thought he saw an opportunity and purchased the paper for $3.5 million.
 His initial strategy was to cut costs, and he did so largely by combating and eventually removing the paper's unions and installing labor-saving equipment. But The Democrat's advertising and circulation were so marginal that the paper lost money despite efficiences.
 In 1977 and 1978, Mr. Hussman tried unsuccessfully to persuade Mr. Patterson to forge a joint operating agreement in which the business and production aspects of both The Gazette and The Democrat would merge but the papers would remain separate new organization.
 After calling other No. 2 papers in competitive markets for ideas, Mr. Hussman increased the size of the paper, especially its sports coverage, and offered unlimited free calssified advertising to individuals, though not to businesses. The Democrat's circulation began to rise.
 He then offered to sell large advertisers ads for $1 and inch, compared with about $9 an inch in the Gazette.
 
Deal With Dillard's
 Dillard's Department Stores Inc., a Little Rock-based chain and the city's top advertiser, was spending $150,000 on The Democrat in 1983, compared with $1.1 million on the Gazette Mr. Hussman offered Dillard's all the advertising it wanted for $500,000 a year, thus raising his revenues and giving The Democrat more credibility with other advertisers.
 The Democrat continued to lose money, but The Gazette had to cut its own ad rates and its profits went into steep decline.
 Mr. Patterson brought an antitrust suit against Mr. Hussman, and when he lost that case in 1986, he quickly sold to Gannett for $51 million in cash and assumption of a $9 million debt.
 Gannett invested heavily in new presses, a bigger staff, more color and a thorough revamping of what had been known as the "gray lady" of Arkansas. It also changed its senior manager repeatedly.
 The Democrat noted every change as a departure from the tried-and-true old standards and an attempt led by outsiders to make The Gazette into USA Today.
 When The Gazette cut circulation rates drastically. The Democrat successfully countered by casting the new reduced price as reflecting a decline in value.
 Gannett adopted the expensive strategy of offering free classifieds and cut ad rates in a free-for-all of discouting.
 Dillard's stopped advertising in the paper in 1989 when Mr. Hussman used invoices from The Gazette to prove that small advertisers were getting better rates.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Goodrich Has a 59% Decline

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The B. F. Goodrich Company said today that its third-quarter net income fell 59 percent from the 1990 third quarter, when the company reported one-time gains that lifted earnings.
Third-quarter 1991 net income totaled $20.7 million, or 73 cents a share, compared with net earnings of $50.6 million, or $1.91 a share, in the third quarter of 1990. Sales reached $649.5 million, up 2.4 percent from $634.5 million. 
 Special items in the 1990 period included gains on the sale of its Uniroyal Goodrich tire operations to Groupe Michelin of France and a loss on the closing of two vinyl production operations in Canada.
John D. Ong, chairman, said the company's results improved from the second quarter of 1991 because of a stronger performance in vinyl products and some specialty chemical businesses. "Nevertheless," he said, "we continue to experience the effects of weak economic conditions, and we remain cautious about the near-term outlook."
Goodrich shares closed today on the New York Stock Exchange at $43.75, down 12.5 cents.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher in Light Day; Gold Declines in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained against most major currencies yesterday in a lightly traded session dominated by speculators.
Gold prices fell, with gold for current delivery declining $1, to $358.90 a troy ounce, on the New York Commodity Exchange. A late bid at the Republic National Bank in New York quoted fold at $358.40, down $1.10. 
 Most banks and currency dealers had skeleton crews on hand during the quiet Columbus Day holiday.
Traders said there was no significant economic news during the day to affect trading. Some players were speculating about what interest rate policy might emerge from a meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Thailand, said Debra Middleton, assistant vice president at the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
"The only thing I can still sink my teeth in is that rates in the U.S. are still going to be coming lower," Ms. Middleton said.
Lower rates would likely cause the dollar to fall. All currencies are supported by higher rates, and undermined by lower yields.
Ms. Middleton said most of the trades were speculative, although some customers were buying dollars to protect their positions, she said.
Most of the action surrounded trading of Japanese yen against the German mark.
The dollar fell sharply against the yen in Tokyo trading, closing at 128.70, its lowest level since Feb. 13. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 129.40 yen. The dollar recovered somewhat in New York, closing at 129.95 yen, up from 129.58 late Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7145, from $1.7195 late Friday. At closing in New York, sterling cost $1.71225, less expensive than the $1.7235 late Friday.
The Italian lira advanced, with the dollar closing at 1,239.00 lire, down from 1,264.00. But traders took little interest in the movement in light of the weak volume.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.70175 German marks, up from 1.6895; 1.4865 Swiss francs, up from 1.4793; 5.79175 French francs, up from 5.7575, and 1.12925 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1285.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Inch Up Overseas

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in thin overseas trading yesterday.
With banks and other major institutions closed in observance of Columbus Day, the cash market for Government bills, notes and bonds was closed in the United States. 
 Trading in bond futures contracts did take place in Chicago, however, although the hours of operation were shortened. Prices of bond contracts dipped modestly at the Board of Trade.
The bulk of the day's activity was concentrated in short-term Treasury bills.
After reviewing economic data released on Friday, which included a report on modest inflation and poor retail sales results for September, foreign traders seemed to concur with their American counterparts that signs pointed to a move by the Federal Reserve Board to lower short-term interest rates to help stimulate the economy.
 
Auction Reset Today
 Because of the holiday, the weekly auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills will be held today.
At the close of trading in Europe, three-month bill rates were offered at a discount rate of 4.94 percent, down six basis points, or six one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were offered at 4.99 percent, down five basis points.
Movement in prices of Treasury notes and bonds overseas was minimal. The 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at 102 26/32, up 2/ 32, to yield 7.87 percent, compared with 7.88 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 102 27/32, unchanged from late Friday, to yield 7.45 percent. And the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 15/ 32, up 1/32, to yield 5.86 percent.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, the nearby December bond contract closed at 99 25/32, down 3/32.
Activity in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond markets was nearly invisible, traders said.
In both markets, prices of most issues were flat.
