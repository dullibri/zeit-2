HEADLINE: In Cuba, Baseball Provides Solace to Anxious People

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLGUIN, Cuba, July 3

 BODY:
When an American baseball team of college-age players arrived in Cuba the other day for a pre-Olympic warmup against this country's top players, a one-hour wait at Havana's airport for a flight to this provincial town gave a strong hint of the superior attitude the Cubans had brought to the contest.
While the Americans stood waiting, their older Cuban counterparts slouched in chairs, smoking cigarettes and sneering as they eyed the anxious competition across the departure area. 
 In many matters having to do with the United States, Cuba clings to the role of a feisty and pious David versus an arrogant Goliath, an attitude that serves not only as a rallying theme for the people but also as an official excuse for suppressing dissent.
"A big part of the Cuban game is intimidation," said Bob Bensch, an American team assistant, referring to the mannerisms of a team that thrashed the United States in two of three games here. "They swagger onto the field and act real aggressive; this affects a lot of the teams they face."
Behind the swagger, however, Cuban sportswriters and the players themselves whispered that with the country listing into a demoralized state, a convincing victory over the island's traditional foil had become imperative, since baseball provides a rare and dependable source of contentment.
"It is almost unfair the burden they are carrying," one Cuban sportswriter said of his national team. "They are the best in the world and are not expected to lose to anyone, but they know that a loss against the United States would be more than a sports defeat. It would be a national betrayal."
While American baseball writers here saw Cuba's lopsided victories as the consequence of a matchup that pitted a new team of American college recruits against a finely tuned national team that only happened to play in a stadium bearing a huge red banner proclaiming "Socialism or Death," the games were an especially dear affirmation for Cuban officials.
During a five-day visit by the American delegation, tours were organized to factories and party headquarters here, 400 miles southeast of Havana. The frequent message was that if Cuba is struggling without the Communist friends of the past, baseball has shown that Cuban Communism is capable of home-grown success.
 
Strong, Strong, Strong
 "So you see, we Cubans are strong," Geraldo Delva, a television station manager, said in repeating a line that was drilled home in the news after a 16-to-1 victory. "Strong in baseball, strong in health care, strong in defense, but most importantly, strong in the psychological preparation of our people."
But for the Cuban fans who pressed their faces against the iron gates of the stadium here each morning waiting under a hot sun for a coveted seat for the evening games, such political messages seemed to have little meaning.
Limited food rations and a severe energy shortage have made life especially difficult for Cubans, many of whom have to walk or ride bicycles to work in the summer heat because of a faltering public transportation system.
For many of these people, the three baseball games, which were accompanied by rumba bands that played blaring dance music between innings, helped blot out for a moment the pressure of their daily lives.
"You would need three or four stadiums to seat all of the people who would like to be in this ball park tonight," said Francisco Hernandez, a 21-year-old resident here who got one of the more than 30,000 seats in the stadium after a three-hour wait. "Of course we want the Cubans to win, but with nothing else to do, it is great just to be here."

HEADLINE: BANK CRISIS STIRS POLITICAL FALLOUT

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARWICK, R.I., July 2

 BODY:
For 539 days, in cold weather and warm, Connie and Daniel Thornton marched here, outside the closed credit union where their dreams had been on deposit.
But their picketing ended this week, when they joined 38,000 depositors who reclaimed 90 percent of their money in a state-financed bailout. These depositors were the last to be repaid. 
 The checks came 18 months after Gov. Bruce Sundlun, an hour after his inauguration, closed 45 banks and credit unions in the state, saying that the private fund that insured them had collapsed because of bad loans.
More than $1 billion belonging to 350,000 depositors, or one-third of the state's residents, was frozen in the closings. The crisis galvanized a political movement led by angry depositors, who negotiated for months with the Governor over the terms of the bailout.
Joseph Devine, a computer consultant from Cranston who has become a leader of depositors' protests and an independent candidate for Governor, says the problems with the bank provided only the first hint of widespread corruption in the state.
"What started out as a banking crisis ended up revealing the lack of ethics in government," he said.
 
Still Waiting for Money
 Many hailed the June 30 payout as a sign that the worst banking crisis in the state's history had come to a close. All but five of the closed institutions have reopened. But depositors were quick to note that they were still waiting for the final 10 percent of their money, that they would probably never recover the millions lost in interest payments, and that taxpayers woulld be paying for the bailout for many years to come.
"This is far from over," said Mrs. Thornton, 53 years old. She and her husband are still waiting for more than $10,000 from the state. "Aside from taking our money, they've taken a chunk of our lives."
She was echoed by Mr. Thornton, who is 61. The Thorntons lost access to more than $100,000, forcing them to postpone their retirement and making it difficult to meet mortgage payments on their new house.
Under the $471 million payout plan, financed through state borrowing and sale of credit union assets, depositors with less than $4,000 were paid in full, while the rest received checks for 90 percent of the value of their accounts. The remaining 10 percent is to be paid over the next 20 years by the state's bailout agency, unless the money is recovered sooner in civil suits.
"I'll be dead before I collect the rest of my money," said Helen Pare, a 68-year-old bookkeeper from this city south of Providence. Like Mrs. Pare, many of the depositors are over the age of 60 and question whether they will be able to collect their money.
But Governor Sundlun said today depositors would be paid in a matter of months, when the state is expected to recover millions of dollars from civil suits filed against bank executives and the Rhode Island Share Deposit Indemnity Corporation, the private fund that insured the banks and credit unions.
"This crisis is largely over," the Governor said in a telephone interview.
 
Political Reverberations
 But the fallout from the credit union crisis and subsequent revelations of government corruption -- including reports of state officials withdrawing thousands of dollars weeks before the credit unions were closed -- will continue to be felt at the ballot box in November. Last week, in part because of the depositors' anger, 35 legislators announced that they would not seek re-election.
Sixteen bank executives, developers and state officials are also awaiting trial on charges ranging from bank fraud to conspiracy and falsifying documents to embezzling funds.
Joseph Mollicone Jr., the bank president who is accused of starting the credit union crisis by embezzling $15 million from his bank, Heritage Loan and Investment Company, is in prison awaiting trial. The bailout of Heritage in November 1990 led to the collapse of the private bank insurer.
 
Newcomers Seek Office
 Mr. Devine is one of at least 50 depositors, all political newcomers, seeking state office in the hopes of changing the way government is run in the nation's smallest state. Governor Sundlun, a Democrat whom they accuse of prolonging the crisis, is a primary target of their anger, but hundreds of other political newcomers of every party are hoping to replace other incumbents in the fall.
"We decided the only way to change things is to run for office," said Mr. Devine, who founded Reform '92, the political wing of the depositors' movement, last October.
"Even if we are not elected to office, we've won this war," Mr. Devine said, referring to the number of incumbents who plan to leave office.
Mrs. Thornton agreed. "I used to believe you can't fight city hall," she said. "But you sure can. We're going to change the way business is done in Rhode Island."

HEADLINE: No.1 on Agenda: The Limits to Promoting Growth

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 5

 BODY:
With the world economy mired in its worst slump in a decade and a united response to the slowdown seemingly impossible, a new menace hangs over leaders of the world's major industrial countries: a gradual drift toward increasingly protectionist trading blocs.
While leaders of the seven most powerful industrial democracies, meeting here on Monday, will seek to revive their flagging domestic fortunes and revive business confidence through fudged statements full of good intentions, they appear increasingly unable to act cohesively on the issues delaying a recovery. 
 "The recovery is invisible so the theme is clear: stimulating growth," said John Lipsky, the chief economist for Salomon Brothers Inc. "But single prescriptions are not available, and the longer the slowdown continues, the more danger there is of a shift to protectionism and regional groupings putting up barriers."
Three main areas for stimulating the recovery exist: trade, monetary policy and fiscal policy. But in all of them, the seven countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy -- appear either to be hopelessly divided or to have already done what they can.
 
A Battle With Vagueness
 Meanwhile unemployment is surging: 20 percent of adults under 25 years old are out of work in the European Community, and the United States jobless rate jumped to 7.8 percent in June. And political unease is spreading in a world bereft of the cold-war certainties that bound the heads of leading democracies together from their first economic summit meeting, at Rambouillet, France, in 1975.
It is in this uncertain context that economists fear a drift to rival economic blocs in America, Europe and Asia -- what J. Paul Horne, chief international economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company called "a Balkanization of world trade and economic policy."
In Europe, the 12-nation European Community is trying to put together a frontierless market by Jan. 1. The United States is pressing forward to complete a North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. And Japan is assiduously developing its economic ties with the fast-growing economies of several Asian neighbors.
Such associations have generally been considered beneficial to the world economy: they spurred growth within the blocs without putting up barriers to multilateral trade. But the fear now is that a continued downturn, combined with failure to show cohesive leadership, could bolster the kind of protectionist sentiment already being voiced by Ross Perot in the United States.
 
U.S. Looks Over Its Shoulder
 "I believe we are going to have weaker international organizations, more friction and greater focus on regional development," said Alan Stoga, the managing director of Kissinger Associates Inc., a consulting firm in New York. He noted that the United States Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, had conferred with Latin American finance ministers before the Munich meeting, something he did not do before previous summit talks.
In areas like steel, automobiles, computer chips and farm subsidies, trade wars are looming that may only be headed off by strong leadership.
But the leaders at Munich look as though they will be hard pressed to paper over the splits among them and to offer a convincing recipe for world economic growth. Only in the area of aid and debt relief to Russia, where a first $1 billion payment from the International Monetary Fund may be approved in Munich, do real decisions look likely. But they are decisions that will do nothing to stimulate the world economy over the short term.
In long-stalled and crucial talks on the world's $4.3 trillion in annual trade, France and the United States remain at loggerheads. While the chief focus of disagreement has been the charges and countercharges of unfair farm subsidies, a broader struggle between Europe and the United States appears to lurk behind the talk of grain.
 
Don't Expect Stirring Initiatives
 Indeed, in appealing last week for France to accept Europe's ambitious plans for monetary and political union, President Francois Mitterrand described European unity as the only way to "confront the economic power of countries outside our continent, such as the United States and Japan."
Although a successful outcome in the trade talks, held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, could rally business confidence and add at least half a percentage point to annual world growth, which is sputtering along at no more than 1.8 percent, French and United States officials have said the chance of any breakthrough in Munich is remote. But after Mr. Mitterrand met with President Bush tonight, Reuters reported, a spokesman for Mr. Mitterrand, Jean Musitelli, said, "On the key question of agriculture the positions have moved closer together and the prospect of global balanced accord is quite possible to envisage."
On the question of interest rates, an essential tool for spurring recovery because cheaper money encourages people to invest and spend, Europe and the United States are once again far apart. Only in Japan, economists say, does some room remain for a relaxation of monetary policy.
 
Interest Rates Not the Answer
 Still absorbing the greater-than-expected costs of reunification and battling with an unfamiliarly large budget deficit, Germany remains committed to a policy of high interest rates intended to curb inflationary pressure. While the United States discount rate, which banks pay when they borrow from the Federal Reserve, is 3 percent, the equivalent German rate is 8 percent.
But after senior United States Treasury officials criticized the German rates earlier this year as a hindrance to world growth, it now appears that the seven leaders want to avoid further, fruitless conflict on this question. "It is dangerous to put public pressure on the Germans," said a senior French Finance Ministry official. "They react very badly."
Germany's determination was underlined this week by Horst Kohler, the state secretary in the Finance Ministry, when he said, "It is the Bundesbank's decision what to do about interest rates and they are not going to let anyone force them into policies that could exacerbate inflation."
 
Germany Is the Key to Europe
 But high interest rates in Germany mean high interest rates throughout Europe because the continent's currencies are linked within the European Monetary System. That means sluggish growth at best.
"Europe's going to be weak for some time to come," said David Walton, the senior international economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
In the United States, after 23 reductions in interest rates by the Federal Reserve since mid-1989, economists say there is little if any further room to lower rates.
Last Thursday, in response to the unexpectedly high unemployment figure, the discount rate was lowered again, to 3 percent, but the United States recovery continues to look erratic and uneven. There is no sign of the country acting as a locomotive for the rest of the world.
 
Fiscal Stimulation Unlikely
 With interest rates offering the leaders scant room for maneuver, they will inevitably seek the possibility of fiscal stimulation. But Germany and the United States are battling to lower their deficits and cannot afford to spend their way to growth.
That leaves Japan, among the world's three largest economies, with the burden of coming up with some fiscal stimulation. It seems ready to do so, but economists remain skeptical that Japan can emerge from its current downturn soon.
The Government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has already indicated that it plans to stimulate the economy by increasing public spending by $45 billion or more later this year, so few surprises are likely in Munich. In theory, this spending should attract imports, stimulating world economic activity and reducing Japan's growing trade surplus.
"Each of the countries seems to have already done what it can, which leaves the summit with little more than words," said Mr. Horne of Smith Barney. "It remains to be seen if that will be enough to head off more stagnation and a move toward protectionism similar to the fracturing we have seen in the world political sphere."

HEADLINE: Investors Face More Risk in Quest for High Yields

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Stubbornly conservative investors found that their scant returns from money market funds and C.D.'s shrank some more last week after the Federal Reserve cut two key interest rates. Financial strategists are telling them that they will simply have to take more risks to get higher returns.
But with the economy wheezing and many securities already high priced, these advisers say, Janus-like, to take risks cautiously. Buy bonds with longer maturities, but not too long, they say; invest some money abroad -- but not too much; buy some stocks -- but not the risky or overheated kind. 
 Reports of rising unemployment and the Fed's quick response last week left many risk-free investments paying too little even to keep up with 3.5 percent inflation. Shorter-term interest rates -- reflected in money-market funds, savings accounts and certificates of deposit -- have plunged to 20-year lows. The most timid investors are earning less than half as much as two years ago.
 
Little Yield From Savings
 Kenneth B. Herz, a spokesman for Chemical Bank, bashfully cited a savings account rate of 3.05 percent, the same as for six-month certificates of deposit. "Lower than I ever thought I'd see as a child of the 80's," he said.
Ian A. MacKinnon, who manages fixed-income mutual funds at the Vanguard Group, said he was pleased to find that customers fleeing such low rates were generally taking his advice to stick with short- and intermediate-term investments.
In 1987, he said, yield-seekers flocked to longer-term funds. When the credit markets turned against them in April and August, he said, "They got clobbered."
Many analysts now predict that if the recovery gains any strength, interest rates will bounce back up, and since principal and yield move inversely in the credit markets, that means the value of outstanding issues will drop. Vanguard's long-term Treasury bond fund yields 7.61 percent, but it will lose 9.5 percent of its value if interest rates rise 1 percentage point.
Shorter maturities gain more in safety than they give up in yield, Mr. MacKinnon said. The intermediate-term Treasury bond fund, yielding 6.74 percent, would lose only 5.6 percent of its value, and the short-term fund, yielding 5.19 percent, would lose 2.6 percent.
Even many stocks and stock funds now yield more than money market funds and C.D.'s. But mutual funds report that investors in stock are becoming more careful.
"People are getting more pessimistic about the economy," said Neal Litvack, senior vice president of marketing at Fidelity Investments. "If they do come back in, I expect they will skew to the very conservative end of the stock spectrum."
Mr. Litvack recommends income funds, which aim more for high dividends than growth. The Fidelity Balanced Fund, with 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, yields more than 5 percent.
Early in the year, he said, many investors were choosing riskier investments -- cyclical stocks, smaller companies, sector funds. Since then, he said, they have had so little appetite for risk that they have invested $600 million more in the Balanced Fund, leaving it with $1.3 billion.
Those searching for higher yields, but not wanting to buy junk bonds, can look abroad. Fidelity's World Income Fund invests mostly in short-term foreign securities, with a 9.2 percent yield.
 
C.D.'s From Abroad
 More exotic still, several banks offer certificates of deposit in foreign currencies. Mark Twain Bank of St. Louis has them from at least a dozen countries. Six-month C.D.'s from Germany yield 8.75 percent, from Britain and France 9 percent.
Foreign investing, of course, carries the risk that exchange rates could turn the wrong way, more than swallowing any extra interest. Mark Twain Bank tries to discourage smaller investors by demanding a minimum of $20,000 for its foreign C.D.'s, and advising them to invest no more than 15 percent of their money.
As Frank O. Trotter, vice president in the capital markets group, put it, "This is not for the average C.D. user."

HEADLINE: Cellular Phones Fill Gap in Hungary

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
In this bustling city on the Danube, entrepreneurism is on the rise, with 80,000 small businesses having been formed in the last two years.
But try to cajole customers, plan with partners or yell at recalcitrant suppliers over the telephone, and the chances are 6 out of 10 that the response will be silence. Hungary's phone system is so creaky that many phones are still hand-crank models from the 1920's, and the network simply cannot handle the volume of calls. 
 That is why cellular telephones that bypass the traditional networks have become something of a rage in this capital city. In the last two years, Westel Radiotelefon, the joint venture here of the state-owned carrier and U S West, the regional Bell operating company based Englewood, Colo., has signed up 12,000 subscribers for its cellular service.
Westel's customers talk on their cellular phones an average of 400 minutes a month, triple the average in Germany and more than four times the average in the United States.
In many ways, Westel could provide a model for introducing modern telecommunications into the formerly Communist Eastern Europe, putting in place a sought-after service before the Government has time to upgrade the existing land-line telephone network.
 
Dialing Instead of Pedaling
 "We are providing running water in the middle of a thirsty desert," said Andras G. Sugar, Westel's managing director, an ebullient engineer with white hair and a tan, who bears a striking resemblance to the fashion designer Giorgio Armani. "We still have much to learn, but our customers are already almost putting a halo around our heads. Ah, that is good for business."
By the end of this year, Westel's cellular telephone coverage will extend to more than two-thirds of Hungary, up from one-third in 1991. That will allow many of the more than 10.5 million people in this country to get their first taste of personal phone service. Many villages have only one telephone, previously housed in the local police station and now -- post-Communism -- found in the church or post office.
In the countryside, more and more people are hearing on radio broadcasts the chirpy Westel advertising slogan, "Put down your bicycle! Use your Westel telephone!"
 
Technical Limits
 But there are problems, too. Westel's network uses frequencies in the 450 megahertz range on the electromagnetic spectrum, because that was the only portion of the radio-frequency band not being used by the military. That frequency is incompatible with both the current analog and coming digital equipment of Western Europe and the United States.
And because of the limited size of Westel's network, it has a theoretical maximum of about 48,000 subscribers, or less than 5 percent of the 1 million subscribers of the regular phone network.
And within Hungary, while cellular telephones are highly reliable for calling other cellular telephone users, they have only as much luck as Hungary's regular phones -- a call-completion rate of 40 percent -- when calling the vast majority of homes, businesses and government offices.
What is more, Westel's cellular phones cost more than $2,500 to buy (triple the most expensive cellular phones in the United States, though about the cost of a regular phone in Hungary) and $1,000 to activate. That is in a country where the average laborer makes about $230 a month.
Of course, this is also a country where taxes are high, tax evasion is a popular sport, and the all-cash underground economy is Hungary's biggest growth industry. Many more people, in other words, may be able to afford a cellular phone than the official wage data would indicate.
Sales of cellular phones and service will generate at least $50 million for Westel this year, up from $25 million last year, and the company is well on its way to profitability, despite high start-up costs. It has 220 employees and expects to have 10 sales offices nationwide by the end of the year.
Demand, no doubt, stems from a dilapidated phone network of 1 million regular phones, 400,000 of which are in Budapest. As in the former Soviet Union, the Communist Party wanted to keep phone service scarce and primitive to facilitate eavesdropping while crimping the flow of communication among citizens. The Party itself had good phone service, known as the "K" line (for the first letter of the word for "central" in Hungarian). The K line, however, was open to only 4,000 elite subscribers.
Today, as a result, there are only 2 telephone lines per 100 inhabitants in a country of more than 10 million people, one of the lowest levels of phone penetration in Eastern Europe. By comparsion, France has 50 lines for every 100 people and Sweden nearly 70 -- the highest rate in Europe.
"So now in Hungary today and especially Budapest," said Dr. Geza Gosztony, the wiry, intense chief adviser to the state-owned Hungarian Telecommunications Company, in an interview, "it is relatively easy for the top officers of concerns to talk to each other, but not to any normal people below them, the ones who do the actual work!"
As in other Eastern European countries, Hungary's economy is faltering because of the economic collapse of its principal trading partner, the former Soviet Union. Inflation is still high, currently about 25 percent, but down from 35 percent last year. Hungarians are feverishly trying to increase trade with their main Western trading partners, nearby Germany and Austria.
An improved phone service is essential to economic growth pursuit -- and the more phones the better for a company like Westel. There was much muttering among Hungarian entrepreneurs recently about a deal for a large Hungarian dairy cooperative that fell through because the potential purchasers, from Italy, were shocked to find there was no telephone or phone lines anywhere nearby.
Hungary is so backward in terms of telephones that the country's telecommunications officials think the nation has the chance to scrap its antiquated system and leapfrog the current cellular and regular phone technology, once standards and technical approaches that are still being developed by international conferees are settled within the next five years.
 
An Extensive Investment Plan
 Meanwhile, the Hungarian Government plans to spend 112 billion Hungarian forints, or about $1.7 billion at current exchange rates, from government funds and Western loans to modernize the telephone network. The amount constitutes a vast number of Hungarian forints in a country still burdened by $21 billion in foreign debt, the highest per capita of any country in Eastern Europe.
The network investment is badly needed however, for the introduction of advanced digital switches to replace 40-year-old electromechanical switches, the source of the abysmal call-completion rate.
Hungary, therefore, is actively looking for European and American financial institutions for investments. "Are we looking for partners?" said Dr. Gosztony, the Hungarian Telecommunications official. "The door is always open."

HEADLINE: The World's Stock Markets Did an About-Face in the Second Quarter

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The second quarter was topsy-turvy for world stock markets. What was up in the first quarter was down in the last three months -- and vice versa.
High interest rates in Europe, worries about the American economic recovery, and political and economic uncertainties in Japan all helped erase much of any gains made early in the second quarter. European markets also got an extra jolt from Denmark's surprising vote in June: The Danes rejected by a narrow margin the plan to unify Europe economically by the end of the century. 
 "The decision by the Danes did provide a catalyst for European markets to take a breather," said Henry B. W. de Vismes, head of international investments at Citibank Global Asset Management North America. He suggested that with the advent of summer, when trading interest in Europe normally lags, the markets could be in for some more volatile moves. "We are now in a silly season," he said.
 
Free Trade -- and a Free Fall
 The starkest about-face was made by the Mexican stock market. The top performer in the first quarter, Mexico's market dropped to the bottom in both dollar terms and in local currency in the second, according to the Financial Times index of world markets.
The Mexican market was undermined by rising interest rates, which will slow economic growth, and fears that Ross Perot, the undeclared independent candidate for President, might oppose the free-trade agreement that Mexico and the United States are negotiating. The economic lift expected from such an agreement had largely driven Mexico's rally.
The dollar, which had risen during the first quarter, sank. It fell 7.9 percent against the mark, 10 percent against the British pound and 5 percent against the yen.
The drop was positive for American investors. A dollar decline means that foreign-capital gains are worth more when they are translated back into dollars. Therefore, a barely perceptible two-tenths of 1 percent rise in European stock markets in the Financial Times index was swollen to a 9.1 percent gain by the dollar's drop. For the world, a 2.8 percent decline was transformed into a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter.
While the dollar's fall was helpful, it masked the decline in European stock markets. They are troubled by not only the continued high level of German interest rates but also by the worry about the clouded outlook for economic recovery in the United States. The Federal Reserve was worried enough that on Thursday it cut the discount rate by half a percentage point and pushed down the Federal funds rate.
The British stock market, the third-worst performer in the first quarter, rose to become the second-strongest market in dollar terms in the second quarter. But that jump came mostly from the dollar's decline. While the market rallied sharply after the surprise victory of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister John Major in April, by the end of the second quarter most of the gain had evaporated.
Germany and France also had second-quarter declines, when the dollar factor is excluded. In local currency, the German market fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter compared with a 9.21 percent rise in the first quarter. In France, the market slipped 2.1 percent, according to The Financial Times, in contrast to a first-quarter rally of 10.3 percent.
And in Spain, Italy and Norway, the markets fell to their 1992 lows in the last three months. In local-currency terms, European markets slowed to two-tenths of 1 percent growth in the second quarter, compared with a 3.43 percent rise in the first quarter.
Some markets did not change significantly in the quarter. Hong Kong was still at the top, moving to No. 1 from No. 2 in the first quarter. Its super-hot rally, which has taken it to repeated records, has been powered by the belief that China is moving toward a more open economy. And this is positive for Hong Kong because it is the gateway to China.
Japan, which was depressed in the first quarter, was second to last in the second quarter, just ahead of Mexico, in both dollar terms and local currency.
The Japanese market is now down 29 percent for the year in dollar terms and almost 60 percent off its high at the end of 1989. Investors are still leery, and they await evidence that Japan's Government is willing to take bold action, like increasing spending in a supplementary budget, to help support the economy and the stock market.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
The Curative Power of Celebrations

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
THE summer of 1976 was a Prozac moment in the emotional life of New York City.
Celebrating the nation's Bicentennial and playing host to a Democratic national convention for the first time in 52 years infused New Yorkers with a euphoria that seemed to purge the depression induced the year before by New York's brush with bankruptcy and, earlier, by Watergate and the Vietnam War. 
 The Bicentennial celebration and the convention also "added to the city's self-image and to its perception by worldwide investors," the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey later concluded, and heralded Manhattan's economic revival.
"I think the same sort of circumstances that prevailed then prevail now," says Rosemary Scanlon, the Port Authority's chief economist.
The city is mired in an economic and an psychological slump, much like it was 16 years ago. But it is arguable whether the spirit of '76 will prevail again or endure.
The current slump is more prolonged than the one that was triggered in 1975 when a fiscal crisis was precipitated by a single factor -- the refusal of banks to lend the city any more money. The economic and social causes and manifestations of the latest decline are more amorphous. They have provoked neither the same degree of crisis nor inspired the same urgent solutions.
In 1976, few people were ambivalent about the Bicentennial celebration, even if women and blacks had reason to question the "all men are created equal" part. Response to Columbus has been more equivocal. The political climate has demanded a more inclusive celebration -- though not quite so broad as to include an Arab-American who, after referring to New York as "Ziontown," was dismissed last month from the Mayor's official Columbus committee.
Since the Bicentennial, the city has thrown two other big birthday parties: the 100th of the Brooklyn Bridge and of the Statue of Liberty. New Yorkers are not partied out, but the novelty may have worn off.
The same may be true about another party, the Democrats. They convene here next week (Goodbye Columbus, Hello Clinton) for the second time time since 1976, which was the first time they returned to the scene of their disastrous 1924 marathon.
Delivering a rousing nominating speech that year, Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked Wordsworth in dubbing Gov. Alfred E. Smith of New York "the Happy Warrior." But virtually nobody, Governor Smith included, was happy when the convention finally nominated John W. Davis on the 103d ballot. (In a rare display of boosterism -- "Hickville on the Hudson," William Allen White dubbed the city -- the New York press reported that while 254 people had been treated in Madison Square Garden's emergency hospital, only one had died).
The 1976 convention produced the last Democratic President. Four years later, the Democrats returned to re-nominate Jimmy Carter, who, that November, became the last Democratic incumbent to be defeated for re-election.
This year, more delegates attended several other conventions in New York than are expected at Madison Square Garden next week, but few New Yorkers noticed the influx of tens of thousands of motorcycle or variety merchandise enthusiasts. Still, a political convention, like the breathtaking tall ships, can bring out the best in a party.
"A political convention blows in and out like a 90-mile gale," James A. Farley, the Roosevelt-era Democratic leader, once said. Nowadays, the same volume of wind is generated, but it usually blows like a zephyr. Also, New York's influence has diminished since 1924 when William Jennings Bryan warned: "You New Yorkers are always forgetting that there is quite a bit of country outside of this state."
If the convention is successful, local politicians hope the euphoria will last. Mayor David N. Dinkins is already on a roll, but his once and future Republican rival, Rudolph W. Giuliani, recently suggested that just being able to balance a budget and to keep the city from burning should not merit Mr. Dinkins's re-election next year. In 1977, though, despite the euphoria generated the year before, Mayor Abraham D. Beame was defeated -- in part because he was perceived as having failed both those very tests.
Whoever wins next year will end his, or her, four-year term on the eve of still another anniversary -- the 1998 centennial of the consolidation of Greater New York. The spirit that year may depend on whether Staten Island and Queens have seceded from the city. Also, on whether the fact that Andrew H. Green, the father of Greater New York, was later shot to death while entering his Park Avenue home is recalled smugly or with alarm as evidence of how far the city has progressed in a century.

HEADLINE: Free Spending Survives Port Authority's Attempts at Restraint

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH with RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
On a humid morning last August, an aviation manager of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and an associate stood outside the agency's offices at Kennedy International Airport waiting for a lift.
Promptly at 9 A.M., a Sikorsky helicopter clattered from the skies and plucked the two men from the tarmac for a swift flight over bumper-to-bumper traffic clogging the roads to Manhattan. Minutes later they were deposited at the downtown heliport in time for a meeting at the Port Authority's World Trade Center. The subject: "New snow and ice products." 
 A year later, Port Authority officials were at a loss to explain the urgency of the mission, which required use of a $970-an-hour helicopter and two of the agency's five pilots. Each weekday, logs show, the helicopter crisscrosses the region, ferrying officials to and from routine meetings, medical appointments, ceremonial events and flight connections at airports.
 
Millions of Dollars
 The helicopter trips are among an array of expensive perquisites that emerged in an examination of agency records by The New York Times. Officials spend millions of dollars each year for ceremonial events to host world leaders, entertainment, a fleet of automobiles for top executives, seminars at area hotels, memberships in two dining clubs and meals at Windows on the World, the luxury restaurant atop one of the twin towers of the World Trade Center.
Some of the spending can be attributed to the Port Authority's role as a business enterprise with the mission to promote trade through the region's harbor and airports. Tenants must be wooed and business lured from competing markets. But the Port Authority is also a government agency that gets 27 percent of its financing from bridge and tunnel tolls paid by the public.
"Perceptions are important," said Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority's executive director. "The bottom line is, if you take someone's four bucks every day, you have a heavy responsibility to spend your money wisely."
But despite some sharp cutbacks aimed at reforming the agency's free-spending ways, helicopter flights and other perks survive at the Port Authority with a tenacity that irks even the agency's chairman, Richard C. Leone, who heads the 12-member commission that oversees the agency.
Such vestiges of the agency's extravagant past, he said, undercut the Port Authority's ability to win public support for important projects at a time when its judgment has been questioned because ambitious plans to rebuild Kennedy Airport have fallen victim to a deteriorating economy.
The helicopter rides, Mr. Leone said, account for only a small fraction of the agency's more than $2 billion annual budget but stand as "an irritating symbol" of the agency's reputation for excess.
 
A Symbol of Waste
 "I have been an anti-helicopter crusader to an extent that some people have said I'm unreasonable," Mr. Leone said in an interview last week. "They are a magnet for the press and are constantly used as a symbol for inefficiency and waste."
Recognizing the potential for political backlash, Port Authority officials have made a series of budget cuts intended to show they are in tune with new economic realities. Mr. Brezenoff has also moved to strengthen internal scrutiny by giving greater autonomy to the agencies' often underutilized inspector general.
Some cuts seemed acknowledgments of past excess: the travel budget was reduced by 25 percent; an executive dining room was closed, saving up to $700,000 a year; one of two executive helicopters was put up for sale; an official's private club membership was canceled, and out-of-town seminars and parties were scaled back.
"I know there are a lot of people in the agency who are very angry with me and a lot of people who think we're destroying the Port Authority," Mr. Leone said. "But it's a disadvantage in the current environment to insist on these perks."
While declining to say that spending had been out of control, Mr. Brezenoff, a former New York City Deputy Mayor who took over as the Port Authority's executive director in late 1990, said the budget cuts "suggest that costs were too high." He said he had pared $100 million from the budget, adding, "I think my efforts have been geared toward a new reality."
 
Responsibility And Power
 Chartered by Congress in 1921 to defuse a growing war between the rival ports of New York and New Jersey, the Port Authority operates the region's three major airports, the George Washington Bridge and five other New York-New Jersey crossings, PATH trains, the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, nine marine terminals and the twin-towered World Trade Center.
Despite its lack of regulatory and taxing powers, it wields enormous and near autonomous power through its ability to charge tolls and rents and to float bonds against revenues.
But in 1977, a spending scandal set off a wave of investigations and demands for tighter control of agency perks. Commissioners and managers were authorizing themselves to fly around the world first class, or trading in first-class tickets for economy tickets for themselves and their spouses; taking Port Authority helicopters on shopping expeditions, and getting reimbursed for fictitious guests on expense accounts.
Some of the officials were later forced to reimburse the authority and many of the practices were ordered stopped. But the tradition of perks has been hard to eradicate and harder to live down, Mr. Brezenoff and Mr. Leone acknowledged.
In fact, the reputation of the Port Authority as a flush agency of legendary largesse has drawn poorer public agencies to its door in search of financial help in recent years.
The Port Authority has promised New York and New Jersey $400 million each over several years, in part as the price of winning a $1 bridge toll increase in March 1991, Mr. Leone said.
"Both states and the cities have used the Port Authority fairly heavily in the past few years when they have had budget cuts," he said. "It's fairly routine in this region to ask the Port Authority to foot the bill."
 
From Full Pockets To Ragged Budgets
 In November 1990, the Port Authority sponsored a $16,970 dinner at Windows on the World, a restaurant at the World Trade Center, for an Urban Summit of the nation's mayors presided over by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Mr. Leone said the gathering gave the Port Authority an opportunity to counter the "awfully bad rap" the city has around the nation and the world. "We're trying to give people a good experience," he said. "The problem is whether that's done in a prudent fashion."
The agency has even been tapped by the United States Government. In an event that seemed to have only a tangential relationship to the Port Authority's mission of promoting trade for the region, the agency sponsored a two-day program last July for Panamanian legislators at the request of the State Department. A memo described the program as an attempt to assist the Government "in preparing the Panamanians for the transfer of the canal to Panamanian hands." The event included a $2,500 dinner at Windows on the World.
Mr. Brezenoff said he had been skeptical that the event was an appropriate expenditure of Port Authority money, but that his staff persuaded him that the smooth operation of the Panama canal was vital to the New York-New Jersey port.
In October 1990, the agency paid $7,750 toward a reception at Windows on the World for Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the President of Mexico. The President of Greece was honored with a $5,355 reception at the restaurant in June 1990.
In fact, the Port Authority is such a frequent patron of Windows on the World that it maintains a standing account and has spent $153,000 there in the last 18 months.
One bill from the restaurant -- for $525 -- was for the 12th annual Jets-Giants pro football luncheon last September attended by two Port Authority officials and five of their guests. The invitation described the prospects of each team and promised that attendees would get to meet two "former all-pro greats" and four current players. "All the fun begins at 12 noon with a cocktail reception," it noted.
Mr. Brezenoff said that the expenditures were carefully monitored and that all had legitimate business purposes. The Jets-Giants event provided an opportunity to entertain several important port clients who might have taken their business elsewhere, he said.
 
A Round Of Party Politics
 The agency also held a series of receptions at Windows on the World last December 16 to celebrate the signing of a lease by a Russian trade and cultural group for space in the World Trade Center. The events included a cocktail reception for 11 Russian guests and 139 others at a cost of $6,480.
The guest list comprised 65 officials and employees of the Port Authority; Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine and 10 other members of the Governor's office, including three state police officers, a security agent and a chauffeur, and two representatives from the State Department.
Later that day, three Russian guests joined 11 Port Authority officials and three American businessmen for an agency-paid dinner at the rooftop restaurant at a cost of $2,590. Afterward, Charles J. Maikish, director of the Authority's World Trade Department, took 15 of the guests for late-night snacks of oysters, steak and drinks in the restaurant's Hors d'Oeuvrerie at a cost of $345.
The agency also has lavish parties for others with whom it does business. In March, an annual reception for 300 port-industry agents and guests cost $27,425. It featured an open bar and a buffet tables offering iced shrimp, clams, oysters and a range of ethnic dishes.
In May, 400 bond underwriters and investment advisers were treated to an annual luncheon and chartered yacht tour of New York and New Jersey harbors, at a cost of $33,391. Last year's outing for 300 cost $37,042.
The Port Authority relies heavily on the sale of bonds to finance its projects and now has $4 billion in debt. The agency would probably have little trouble selling the bonds even if it canceled the annual outing, Mr. Brezenoff said, but added, "I'm not taking that risk. Why should I?"
Other government agencies entertain the bond-underwriting community but at a far lower cost. Last month, for example, New York City treated bond underwriters to a half-hour talk at New York University at a cost of $700 in refreshments. Two days later, the city sold $1.4 billion in notes at 2.72 percent interest, the lowest rate in 20 years, said Louis Haber, a spokesman for City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.
 
An Agency Celebrates Itself
 Sometimes the agency just fetes its own employees, though less lavishly than in the past. Last October, the annual Port Service Club luncheon employees and retirees with 25 years of service honored 1,050 at a cost of $51,482 -- down from a larger party that cost $94,000 in 1988. Mr. Brezenoff said he was attempting to cut costs for all such events.
But he said the authority has no plans to cut back on its fleet of 154 cars and minivans, 49 of which are assigned to top executives and staff members for business and personal use. Seven cars and five drivers are designated for use by the 12 commissioners, who are appointed by the Governors of New York and New Jersey and serve part time without pay.
But Mr. Brezenoff said the agency is selling one of its two helicopters. The Port Authority employs five full-time pilots and for the $970-an-hour helicopters.
Several commissioners and many executives regularly use the helicopter, according to a review of logs covering the last eight months. When the board holds its monthly meetings, a helicopter is dispatched from its base at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to ferry several of that state's commissioners from locations near their homes to lower Manhattan, often making separate trips for each.
Mr. Brezenoff defended the practice, saying the commissioners would have to travel long distances to meetings. "We make a lot of demands on them," he said.
Mr. Leone took occasional flights from Princeton, where he lives, to Manhattan. He said only used the service when it was unavoidable.
Mr. Brezenoff, records showed, took occasional flights to make speaking engagements and ribbon-cutting ceremonies and last November flew from Manhattan to Republic Airport on Long Island for lunch with the editorial board of Newsday.
Daily helicopter flights shuttle managers and staffers to routine meetings and ceremonial events. On a typical day, 10 to 20 employees travel by helicopter from one Port Authority location to another for planning sessions, department meetings and medical appointments. One employee was put on a flight to Manhattan to file his retirement papers, records showed.
Peter Yerkes, a spokesman for the authority, said officials told him to point out that "it can take up to an hour and a half to reach Kennedy Airport at rush hour."

HEADLINE: Company Says Pullout Is a Possibility

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BROOKVILLE, L.I., July 5

 BODY:
Canon U.S.A., the Japanese-owned camera and electronics company, is considering its options, including leaving Long Island and taking its 1,800 employees elsewhere, because its plans to build a new corporate headquarters here are in jeopardy of being rejected by this exclusive North Shore village.
Many of the village's 3,700 residents fear an increase in traffic and further commercialization of an area that is already home to the New York Institute of Technology and the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University. 
 But James L. Larocca, the president of the Long Island Association, a business group, warned that the 25 Japanese-American companies and other international businesses on Long Island were watching the events in Brookville "as a measure of how friendly and how hospitable Long Island is to their presence."
He noted that the possible departure of Canon, based in Lake Success, comes as business leaders are stepping up efforts to attract new businesses to the region to help pull it out of the recession that began in mid-1989. He estimated that Canon has pumped $500 million a year into the Long Island economy, including payroll, business contracts and taxes.
The decision by Brookville officials to reject Canon's plan was outlined in a letter sent to residents last week, and it caught the company by surprise. David Farr, the company's general manager, said, "A decision like this is devastating."
Mr. Farr has said that if the Brookville project is rejected, Canon might have to look for a site off Long Island.
However, he said Canon is still "truly eager" to find a way for the company to remain on Long Island.
 
Meeting This Week
 Canon executives are scheduled to meet this week at the Lake Success headquarters, which they say the company has outgrown, to discuss their options, including moving to another state, after eight years of seeking a new location on Long Island.
Nassau County officials, shaken by Canon's reception here, are scrambling to head off such a move and hope to find an acceptable site for the maker of cameras and copiers.
"This comes at a time when we're feeling the effects of the worst recession to hit this area since the Depression," said Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive.
He pledged to smooth Canon's ruffled feathers and to win over Brookville officials or to find another site. One possibility is Westbury, where Canon tried four years ago to purchase a 50-acre site at the long-deserted Roosevelt Raceway for $50 million. It was blocked by a local building moratorium that has only recently been lifted.
When the race track deal unraveled, Canon sought to purchase a 100-acre site for research laboratories and offices on a corner of the sprawling campus of the Institute of Technology. The $15 million deal would have given a financial boost to the institute and preserved the deSeversky Conference Center, an elegant brick mansion built in the 1920's. It was once surrounded by English rose gardens and sweeping lawns and polo fields over which the local gentry, dressed in red riding jackets, chased the local red fox.
 
Less Golden Coast
 Red foxes still roam the remaining estates, but the Gold Coast life style is long since gone, even though many residents cling tenaciously to the remaining mansions, gatehouses and riding trails.
Polo fields have turned into parking lots. The C.W. Post estate is a campus of Long Island University. And the neighboring deSeversky estate is now the conference center, which caters weddings when not used by the Institute of Technology.
Canon proposed in plans filed with the village to use 5 acres of the 100-acre parcel on Northern Boulevard to build campuslike research laboratories and offices employing nearly 1,800 people. The plan would maintain the deSeversky center and a 95-acre greenbelt. A two-level garage for employee parking was to be built out of view. The area is now zoned residential, with a 5-acre minimum lot size.
Despite the prospect of substantial tax revenues from Canon, Brookville village officials, reacting to stiff local opposition, declared that the plan would not comply with the zoning. Mayor Michael P. Galgano and the board of trustees sent a letter to residents indicating that they planned to reject the Canon project.
The letter said, "There was no basis in law to permit a modification of the existing special use permit" under which the Institute of Technology uses the site. It said that granting Canon's request "could be interpreted as spot zoning." The board is expected to vote on the rezoning in September.
Mayor Galgano said the issue had "caused a lot of acrimony." He said opponents were concerned that if Canon moved in, it would not only change the way of life in Brookville, but in surrounding North Shore villages.

HEADLINE: Offtrack Betting Profits Hit Record Low

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
The Offtrack Betting Corporation, which has been criticized for its spending and management practices, saw its profits sink to a record low this year.
In a report to be released today, the agency said it ended the 1991-92 fiscal year last Tuesday with a profit of $600,000 for the city. The showing was the poorest since the agency, which was established to generate revenue for the city and to discourage illegal gambling, expanded into a major operation in 1975. 
 OTB's profit in the 1990-91 fiscal year was $2.9 million.
The report on the dwindling profits follows proposals by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan and the City Council Finance Committee that the Dinkins administration consider selling OTB to a private company.
In addition to the $600,000 profit, OTB provided the city with $25.7 million from a 5 percent surcharge on winning bets. Some state officials and Council members, however, challenge OTB's characterization of the surcharge as profit, maintaining that it is equivalent to a sales tax and has no bearing on OTB's overall success.
OTB's profits and surcharges have declined steadily since the 1987-88 fiscal year, when it produced $15.9 million in profits and $31.5 million in surcharges, a total of $47.4 million. The handle, or gross wagers, also has fallen from a record $1.032 billion in 1988 to $887.3 million in the 1991-92 fiscal year.
State law prohibits OTB from using the surcharge for operating expenses. If profits continue to decrease, the agency would have to cut expenses, and possibly discharge employees at its Times Square headquarters and its 95 betting branches.
Edward T. Lewis, OTB's board chairman, and Leland T. Jones, the chief spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, attributed the decline mainly to the recession, which they said had discouraged wagering.
"These figures make it sound like OTB is going out of business, but it is not," Mr. Lewis said.
Mr. Jones said that city and OTB officials were "looking at ways to cut overhead until such times as OTB's fortunes turn around."
"The idea of privatization has been one of many ideas swirling around," Mr. Jones said. "But no decision has been made."
 
OTB Predicts Improvement
 OTB is a semi-independent agency created by the Legislature in 1970. The Mayor selects an unpaid board of directors to set policies.
In its financial report, OTB said it anticipated a profit of $2.8 million in the current fiscal year that ends next June 30, and $3.7 million by 1996.
Hazel N. Dukes, whom Mr. Dinkins appointed in July 1990 as the agency's president and top executive, declined to be interviewed. Her spokeswoman, Marjorie W. Longley, said the brighter projections were based on assumptions that the handle will rise and on the opening of several branches in Manhattan with live television coverage of races.
"We think we have reversed a downward trend," said Ms. Longley.
 
Council Has Criticisms
 She emphasized that before the city can reap any earnings, OTB is required to pay the racing industry and the state a total of $70 million a year.
The City Council Finance Committee, in a report in March, admonished OTB for what the Council members called excessive expenses for entertainment and office furnishings and for poor management policies. According to the committee, OTB has a manager for every three employees, compared with one for every seven employees in private business.
"The meager profits prove that restructuring of OTB is in order and that privatization must be considered," Councilman Herbert E. Berman, the chairman of the committee, said in an interview.
Mr. Regan, in a statement, said, "It's ridiculous that OTB is unable to generate any more than 0.1 percent profit on betting volume of almost $1 billion."
Ms. Longley, disputing the criticism, said that in the two years of Ms. Dukes's administration, full-time employees had been cut to 1,590 from 1,695 and the annual budget trimmed to $101.6 million from $107.5.million.
She noted that $669 million, about 75 percent of the $887 million handle, was returned to customers for winning wagers.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Electronics Chain On Roller Coaster

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
THE stock of the Good Guys Inc., the West Coast consumer electronics chain, has not lived up to its name of late. After rising to $29.75 a share last September, the stock took a wrenching roller coaster ride to $13.625 in January, back up to $22.50 in March, then down to its 52-week low of $9.75 in mid-June. It ended last week at $10.25.
What is behind the fall and rise and fall of Good Guys' stock? In broad terms, the problem lies in doubts about future performance, a concern rarely mentioned in the same breath as the company's name in recent years. 
 After going public in 1986, the company posted year after year of double-digit growth in comparable same-store sales, while many competitors worked to muster single-digit increases. It expanded rapidly to 39 stores -- all but one in California -- using its strategy of thoroughly training salespeople to sell a broad selection of products, including some high-end merchandise, at low prices.
But a hotly competitive market and a weak California economy have analysts wondering when they will see strong earnings gains again, prompting many to place a neutral rating on the stock, which trades over the counter.
While retail stocks have also been under pressure lately, some predict that Good Guys will track the general performance of retail stocks until the outlook improves for California's economy and for the next Christmas selling season. The introduction of new digital audio recording formats -- Sony's mini-disk and Philips's digital compact cassette -- is also expected to raise industrywide sales this fall.
It appears that competition will ease somewhat for Good Guys. Rogersound Labs of Canoga Park, Calif., a leading Good Guys competitor, entered liquidation proceedings last month for its 11 locations in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. Good Guys, which is based in Burlingame, a San Francisco suburb, and operates 13 stores in greater Los Angeles, is expected to garner roughly a quarter of Rogersound's $60 million in annual sales. "Good Guys will benefit from the shakeout in the industry," said Lynn Sawyer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. "It's a well-managed, well-positioned company."
The enthusiasm of Ms. Sawyer and other analysts started to wane in December after they learned from the company that the stiff competition would hurt earnings. The stock plunged roughly 50 percent in less than a month.
The stock rebounded to $22.50 in March on the strength of Good Guys' reputation as a consistent performer, which it earned with its five-year track record of 36 percent annual growth in sales and 40 percent annual growth in earnings per share.
A lackluster 3 percent same-store sales gain from January through March started the most recent slide. "They had built up so much credibility with investors because of the management team that people came back into the stock each time," said Sharon E. Rappaport of Morgan Stanley, who is also neutral on the stock. "When sales began to slow, people started wondering how long this is going to last."
The stock's current low price makes it good buy for the long-term investor, said David A. Bolotsky of Goldman, Sachs. He applauded recent strategy changes that included focusing Good Guys' advertising on higher-end products instead of loss-leader promotions. Also, the company's gross margins will be helped somewhat by its decision to end a "Double the Difference" promotion and go back to its former program of refunding 110 percent of the price difference when a competitor's price falls below the Good Guys' price for an item.
Eliminating the "Double the Difference" promotion, which it offered from last Thanksgiving to Memorial Day, will add up to two-tenths of a percent to the company's margins, said Robert A. Gunst, president of the company.
A key strength of Good Guys' top management, Mr. Bolotsky said, is its policy of meeting regularly with store-level managers, a costly but important means of insuring quick response to market changes. Mr. Gunst visits each store about twice a year, and top executives meet four times a year with all salespeople in groups of up to 500.
An important next step for Good Guys will be breaking out of the California market beyond its single store in Reno. Mr. Gunst said the company planned to make that move sometime in the mid-1990's.
Some question whether its format will work outside California, where many audiophiles and videophiles are willing to pony up for higher-end, more profitable models. But Mr. Gunst said the company's products had enough broad appeal to sell well in all markets.
"We do not carry tweeky, esoteric, high-end product lines," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Premiere, Growing Film Magazine, Looks Abroad

BYLINE: By JAY E. ROSEN

 BODY:
Premiere magazine, which immigrated to the United States from France five years ago, is returning to Europe.
K-III Magazines, which publishes the monthly film magazine, has reached an agreement with a London publisher, EMAP Metro, to start a British edition in October. 
 "Since Premiere sells so well in the U.K., it only seemed natural to do a British edition," says Susan Lyne, editor and publication director of Premiere, which itself is based on a French film magazine with the same name but a different focus.
The American Premiere sells approximately 15,000 copies a month in Britain, and K-III is projecting an initial circulation of 50,000 for the British edition.
Ms. Lyne said one reason for the strong sales in Britain was the popularity of American films. "Eight out of 10 film tickets sold are for American films," she said.
 
Second International Edition
 The British magazine will be the American Premiere's second international edition. A Japanese edition, published by the Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Company, was started in May 1990. Japan is Hollywood's second-largest market.
Starting international editions is only one of the ways in which Premiere has sought to cash in on its popularity. Its other ventures include television specials about the movies and Preview, a magazine given away at some theaters.
Indeed, the growth of Premiere contradicts the doubts that some people in publishing and entertainment had when plans for the American magazine were first announced. These skeptics wondered whether there was a large audience for a film industry magazine aimed mainly at movie enthusiasts.
But Marian L. Schwindeman, now publisher of the American Premiere, believed that the film-making process was becoming more newsworthy than the movies themselves.
 
Covering More Than Glamour
 In 1986, Ms. Schwindeman approached John B. Evans, then president of Murdoch Magazines, about starting a film industry magazine. "I wanted to create a magazine that would not only cover the glamour of Hollywood, but the craft and process as well," she said.
At that time, Murdoch Magazines and Hachette S.A. of France were studying ways to introduce some of the French publisher's magazines to the United States, and Premiere, a popular film magazine in France since 1976, was a strong possibility.
But after seeing the French Premiere, Mr. Evans quickly lost much of his initial enthusiasm, in part because of different tastes on each side of the Atlantic. "I could not understand how a magazine that could put Jerry Lewis on the cover and be a triumph could ever be successful here," he said.
Moreover, to succeed, an American magazine would need to be more critical of Hollywood than the French Premiere was. "The French were very fawning toward Hollywood," Ms. Lyne recalled. "We wanted to do investigative pieces."
What did impress Mr. Evans about the French Premiere magazine was its access to the studios, which often enabled its writers to go right to the movie sets for articles. He believed that a magazine reporting from inside the industry could be successful.
The introductory issue came out in June 1987 and sold more than 300,000 copies. Regular publication began in September 1987.
In the last half of 1991, circulation averaged 492,940, and the magazine says it now sells about 530,000 copies.
Premiere attracts readers by taking a hard look at business and production practices in Hollywood. It has examined the role of blacks in the industry; the disaster in making "Twilight Zone: The Movie," in which the star Vic Morrow and two children were killed, and reports of mismanagement at Robert Redford's Sundance Institute. Premiere says some of its articles have cost it studio advertising. "We have been punished by every studio at one time or another," Ms. Lyne said.
The American Premiere was supposed to be a joint venture of Hachette and Murdoch Magazines. But in 1989, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation acquired Hachette's 50 percent stake in the venture.
And last year, K-III Holdings, a partnership of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, bought most of Murdoch Magazines, including Premiere, for $650 million and set up K-III Magazines.
 
Still Seeking a Profit
 Despite its growth, Premiere is still not profitable, Ms. Schwindeman said. In the last year, Premiere lost about 100 pages of advertising because of the recession. But Ms. Schwindeman predicted that advertising in September's issue would be up about 5 percent from a year earlier and that the magazine should run roughly 700 ad pages this year, up from about 680 in 1991, but still below the 820 pages of 1990.
Dick Hawkes, executive vice president of K-III Magazines, said the magazine should be profitable within a year, with a circulation of 600,000.
Premiere competes with a variety of other, smaller magazines, including Movieline, Movies U.S.A. and Film Comment. And, of course, there is Entertainment Weekly, which Ms. Schwindeman does not see as a direct competitor because it covers the entire entertainment industry, not just film.

Conditions for Higher Rates Fade

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The unwelcome and surprisingly strong rise in market interest rates that came after the Federal Reserve Board sharply cut rates in December is unlikely to recur in the wake of the action taken by the Fed last week, analysts and traders say.
Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds briefly fell to 7 3/8 percent on the last day of 1991, about a week after the Fed cut the discount rate one percentage point and trimmed its target on the overnight Federal funds rate a half point. But in the next three months, yields on the long bonds rose above 8 percent, and rates on short-term securities also moved higher, though not nearly as much. 
 While acknowledging that rates could temporarily move higher after last week's strong rally, traders and analysts argue that conditions are different than they were six months ago.
 
Rush of New Issues
 The Fed's move last year set off a record volume of new issues in the corporate and municipal bond markets. The surge, coupled with Government estimates that the Federal budget deficit would reach $400 billion in the current fiscal year, helped push rates higher. Statistics showing the economy was improving in January and February advanced the upward momentum.
The drop in rates engineered by the Fed on Thursday -- a half-point cut in the discount rate, to 3 percent, and a similar cut in the target for the Federal funds rate, to 3.25 percent -- will almost certainly keep investment bankers active this week. Some $10 billion to $15 billion worth of new corporate debt issues could be priced this week, bankers said, and the tax-exempt calendar is heavy.
But specialists in corporate and municipal finance said the pace of new issues, at least through the summer, would almost certainly slow from the torrid clip of the first six months of the year.
In the first half, corporations issued $132.8 billion worth of nonconvertible debt securities, according to the Securities Data Company, up more than 38 percent from the comparable period a year ago.
In addition, figures from The Bond Buyer, a publication that tracks developments in municipal finance, show that $109 billion worth of new municipal bonds were sold in the first half, a 46 percent increase from the similar 1991 period.
Analysts are convinced that such a pace cannot be sustained because a disproportionate amount of the volume in both markets were securities issued to refinance debt issued in the mid- to late 1980's. Net new credit demand, however, was quite weak and is likely to remain so.
 
'Not Stimulative for Borrowing'
 "The interest rates move by the Fed is not enough to stimulate large borrowing above and beyond refinancings," said Thomas J. Sowanick, senior fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company.
"We have learned," he added, "that lower interest rates are not stimulative for borrowing because the level of debt outstanding owed by corporations and individuals is still extraordinarily high."
George Friedlander, a managing director at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said that unless rates continued to plunge, the volume of new issues in the tax-exempt market should be down substantially from the first half.
Of the $109 billion in new municipal issues priced in the first half, more than 42 percent were refunding issues, he said, a 143 percent increase from the first six months of 1991.
"Refunding capability gets used up," he said, "and there are very few new-money financings that are that rate-sensitive."
Moreover, while the need to finance new projects is manifest, "the number of states that can afford to do them is much less great," Mr. Friedlander added.
In addition, while the supply of new Treasury securities to be sold in the third quarter will be enormous, the Government's financing needs are well below the estimates bandied about at the beginning of the year.
Borrowing by the Treasury in the current quarter will amount to less than $70 billion, according to analysts at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm, about half as large as the most dire forecasts presented in January.
Louis v. B. Crandall, Wrightson's chief economist, said yields on short-term Treasury securities were now at much more realistic levels than in the winter.
"Part of the rise in yields during the first quarter was due to the fact that they had fallen too far," he said.
In January, for example, two-year Treasury notes were yielding 4.60 percent when the Fed's target for the funds rate was 4 percent.
At the close of trading on Thursday, by contrast, two-year notes were yielding 4.55 percent. But through two easing moves the Fed had dropped its funds rate target by three-quarters of a percent, to 3.25 percent.
 
More Sputtering
 Aside from easing supply pressures, Mr. Crandall and other analysts say there is little chance that economic data will show the marked improvement this summer that was seen in the first two months of the year. And inflationary pressures remain in check.
For most analysts, the June employment report was a sobering reminder of how wobbly the underpinnings of the current recovery really are, and it virtually insures that most of the important economic statistics to be released this month will be weak.
"I had thought the recovery would be slow, sluggish and sustainable," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "But this report is making me question if it is sustainable."

For the Unemployed, Some Tips and Empathy

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
With unemployment still rising, it is not for a television reviewer to discourage anyone in need of a job from finding consolation wherever it is offered, in a bar, a beauty parlor, a bowling alley or in the bromides of "Out of Work." But beware. This program on PBS tonight (in New York on Channel 13 at 9) is a bin of banalities from introductory psychology and sociology texts.
One section of the hour, which concentrates on white-collar workers, is called "Termination." Losing your job, it reveals, is a blow to self-esteem, which can result in shock, denial and anger, so it is recommended that you "make peace with your anger." Also: "While it seems simplistic to say so, it helps not to take your employer's treatment of you personally." No more simplistic than the rest of the lecture. 
 The language of the narrator and counselors gives the spirit of the thing: "He has personally experienced termination." "The bank was downsizing the staff." "One lesson in all of this is to face your financial reality immediately." In one regard, "Out of Work" is good news for job seekers; it proves that you don't have to have a facility for English to qualify for making television programs.
The segment on looking for work begins with a visit to a job counseling company, where, the narrator says, "You'll undergo constructive review of your resume writing, interviewing and marketing skills." This viewer had undergone enough; the program experienced termination.
 
P.O.V.
Last Images of War
The Longest Shadow
PBS, tonight.
(Channel 13, New York, at 10.)
"Last Images of War," is a tribute to the talent, daring and commitment of four photojournalists who were killed covering the civil war in Afghanistan. The pictures taken by Jim Lindelof, an American; Andy Skrzypkowiak of England; Naoko Nanjo of Japan, and Sasha Sekretaryov of the Soviet Union capture the grittiness of the war and the pain of the people caught in it. Their explanations as they went into the battle zones of why they were taking such risks serve as eulogies.
Tonight's two-hour offering from "P.O.V.," public television's series of independent productions, concludes with "The Longest Shadow," the documentary maker Kalina Ivanov's reflections on Bulgaria's Stalinist past and her disturbing report on the forces now blocking moves toward democracy.

HEADLINE: Soviet Collapse Lessens Cuba's Threat

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Making Poor Cubans Suffer More" (editorial, June 15) faults the proposed Cuban Democracy Act. The bill raises problems even for those like myself who consider that the United States embargo has been effective against Fidel Castro. 
 The goal of the embargo was to make more costly to the Soviets and to Cuba President Castro's relentless hostility to the United States and his role as a surrogate in the cold war. That goal has been accomplished.
However, to set as a goal the overthrow of Mr. Castro, which is implicit in the bill, exceeds what it can attain and plays into his hands. A totalitarian regime survives on its repressive capacity, no matter its popularity. By pushing the Cubans into a survival economy, we increase Mr. Castro's control over them. The power to allocate the increasingly scarce food and medicines provides another tool for his repressive apparatus. And he can blame us for the hardships.
Cuba is less of a threat to us with the Soviet collapse. Tightening the rules on humanitarian aid is the opposite of what we should do. Rules on remittances by Cubans to their families should be liberalized, not made more restrictive. And we should make it easier for church and other groups to provide food and medicine to Cubans without relatives overseas.
The bill fails to address those dissatisfied Cubans around Mr. Castro who can really start the end of his regime. It does not provide explicit assurance that we respect Cuba's sovereignty and the right of Cubans to choose their leaders. These omissions yield to Mr. Castro the emotional forces of nationalism and personal survival to rally his followers around him.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Digging Deeper in Iraqgate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In angrily insisting to have had no guilty knowledge of Saddam Hussein's abuse of our grain credits to buy destructive technology, George Bush last week showed no understanding of the First Law of Holes: when in one, stop digging.
The President, entertaining tourists in the Rose Garden for "CBS This Morning," was upset by an irreverent question. It had to do with sworn testimony by Frank Lemay, a Foreign Service officer, that he informed higher-ups on Oct. 13, 1989 -- in a memo kept "out of the system" -- about a rash of investigations into Iraq's ripoff. 
 "We didn't know that," Mr. Bush snapped. "The State Department didn't know it. You can talk about what one State Department employee" -- he decided against attacking the F.S.O. "And if we had known it," he said about the corrupt diversion, "it wouldn't have happened."
The Bush Iraqgate defense is apparently to claim ignorance of the spreading Lavoro scandal before James Baker directed Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to push through a half-billion-dollar payment to Saddam.
The President dug himself in deeper: "We did not go to enhance his nuclear, biological or chemical capability." Then he inadvertently pushed open a door: "I have an executive order out on specifically that."
I called his press secretary to note that the President had just declassified National Security Directive 26 by describing its contents on the air, and asked for the text. Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that N.S.D. 26 was the document referred to, and suggested I get a copy from Congress.
A portion of which I did. That Oct. 2, 1989 policy directive making Saddam our central gulf ally contains this sentence: "We should pursue, and seek to facilitate, opportunities for U.S. firms to participate in the reconstruction of the Iraqi economy, particularly in the energy area, where they do not conflict with our non-proliferation and other significant objectives." (Italics mine.)
What does Mr. Bush's use of the word "nonproliferation" tell us? The "energy area" could mean oil and gas energy, or it could mean nuclear energy. Nobody worries about oil and gas proliferation -- but we do oppose nuclear proliferation.
This strongly suggests Mr. Bush wanted to encourage U.S. firms to supply Saddam's nascent atomic program with our nuclear and computer technology, which the Defense Department had resisted. In the preceding paragraph of N.S.D. 26, he warns of economic and political sanctions for "Any breach by Iraq of I.A.E.A. safeguards in its nuclear program."
George Bush signed that infamous directive to help arm Iraq 58 days after the F.B.I. raided the Lavoro Bank's Atlanta office to discover Iraqi skimming and abuse of U.S. loan guarantees. James Baker, well aware by briefing and in writing of Saddam's fraud, went ahead under N.S.D. 26 to arm-twist Agriculture to disregard creditworthiness and hand over $500 million more to Iraq.
Now about Mr. Bush's "the State Department didn't know it."
On Oct. 17, 1989, three days after Frank Lemay delivered his memo detailing the Iraq-Lavoro investigations to Undersecretary Richard McCormack, the Treasury Department's Rachel Bailey made contemporaneous notes of the reaction of its recipients in State: "McCormack is particularly seized. Baker is putting pressure. Bob [Downes] spending a lot of time: Sofaer, McCormack, Kimmitt. Baker is insisting on being kept informed."
Mr. Bush should stop pretending he and Baker were out of the loop, come clean on the real motive and ask the court to appoint independent counsel before Congress demands it.
Then he should try to redeem his failures before and after Desert Storm. That means recognizing the legitimacy of Kurdish leaders Talabani and Barzani, victors in democratic elections in the zone of Iraq we protect with Britain and Turkey.
It means publicly approving the recent meeting in Vienna of leaders of all anti-Saddam elements, and extending our aerial protection to a provisional government of all factions inside Iraqi Kurdistan. And it means inviting these anti-Saddam leaders to the White House to dramatize America's endorsement of their aim to establish democracy in Baghdad.
That would be a start. Some good may yet come out of prosecuting the crimes of Iraqgate.

HEADLINE: Moldovan Conflict Worries Romania

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, July 5

 BODY:
The willingness of Romanians in Romania to befriend and support ethnic Romanians in Moldova in the face of attacks from Russian and Ukrainian separatists grows with each news account of sniper fire.
But Government officials are taking pains to insist that they do want speedy reunification of the two countries, which together formed a single Romanian state before World War II. 
 "What we want is the German model," said Foreign Minister Adrian Nastase, referring to the era before unification. "We have recognized Moldova as a fully independent state, and so have more than a hundred other countries. It is like the old East Germany and West Germany: one people but separate states."
The 45-year-old official, working in shirtsleeves on Saturday in an otherwise empty ministry, added, "If at some point in the future the people of both countries voted in a referendum to merge, as they did to reunite Germany, then why not?" But he said that at the moment, any such development loomed only as a distant possibility.
 
Pieces Don't Fit, Yet
 A country of 23 million people, Romania has a more highly developed economy than Moldova and its 4.5 million people. And, Mr. Nastase noted, any effort to integrate a Moldova far more Sovietized than Romania had been, even under Nicolae Ceausescu, would delay or derail plans to reform Romania's economic and political life. Moreover, he said, the leaders of Moldova were unwilling to merge into a larger state where their influence could only shrink or disappear.
But politicians from several parties and diplomats from several countries agreed with Mr. Nastase's contention that the longer the conflict in Moldova rages without resolution, the greater the risk that issues of Romanian nationalism could embroil the campaign for presidential and parliamentary elections here. The elections, scheduled for Sept. 27, are viewed as a critical test for Romania's transition toward democracy.
Mr. Nastase said he had met with the leaders of all major political parties, seeking assurances that they would not exploit the situation by demagogic appeals for more belligerence in defense of Moldova. "Our approach has to be nonviolent," he said.
 
Russians Cause Nervousness
 A Western diplomat said that while in principle the politicians may have agreed to play down the issue, they were finding it difficult to keep from accusing the Government and one another of not doing enough for their kinfolk.
Such talk would be provocative, the diplomat said, particularly since the situation across the eastern border was extremely dangerous, with a large Russian Army in Moldova, outside Russia, with undefined aims and lines of command that did not necessarily lead to civilian authority in Moscow.
Prime Minister Theodor D. Stolojan, in a conversation during a Fourth of July party at the United States Embassy, said that for the moment, he did not think the risk of inflamed nationalism of the sort raging in Yugoslavia was great.
Nonetheless, it is obvious that no foreign policy issue since the fall of Ceausescu has so deeply touched the passions of Romanians as have the nightly reports of shooting of Moldovan policemen and shelling of Moldovan villages by Russian and Ukrainian irregulars in the secessionist sliver east of the Dniester river. Romanians remember that almost all of what is now Moldova was torn from Romania by Soviet armies in 1940 under the terms of Stalin's pact with Hitler.
 
Honk if You Hate Russians
 For the last two weeks, several hundred Romanians have maintained a vigil outside the Russian Embassy, protesting the attacks and what the demonstrators contend has been the role of Moscow in arming the paramilitary forces with tanks and artillery.
"Yeltsin is a criminal," said one sign. Another asked, "Where is America when Moldovans are being killed?" The demonstrators also hold signs asking motorists to blow their horns to show their disgust with the Russians; almost every car that passes the busy street honks, night and day.
Mr. Nastase, the Foreign Minister, spoke about Romania's policy toward Moldova only hours after he had returned from Moscow, where he joined the Foreign Ministers of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine in talks on ending the fighting. He said he thought the talks and a meeting between President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and President Mircea Snegur of Moldova had cleared up some suspicions and antagonisms.
Mr. Nastase said two major issues had been identified: the legal status of Russia's 14th Army, and the legal status of the separatist Trans-Dneister region, which was added on to the Romanian lands seized by Stalin to form what had been the Moldavian Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union.
"The question of the army is critical," Mr. Nastase said. "Right now what we have is a Russian army, a foreign force, in an independent country that has virtually no army of its own. Moldova does not even have a border with Russia. What has to be established is to whom is this army responsible and under what conditions is it there."

HEADLINE: President Bush Impedes Democracy

 BODY:
With his veto last week of common-sense legislation designed to make it simple and convenient for all Americans to register to vote, President Bush has demonstrated his opposition to expanded participation in government.
The measure, nicknamed "motor-voter," would have required states to allow citizens to register when they obtain or renew a driver's license. It also would have required states to offer registration by mail and at welfare, unemployment and other government offices. These steps, experts say, would boost registration to about 90 percent of all eligible voters -- a big leap from the dismal 60 percent now signed up. 
 Why would anyone oppose making it easier to register and vote? To justify his veto, Mr. Bush offers a host of flimsy reasons. Most galling is his assertion that there's "no justification" for imposing new standards on the states. Surely the estimated 70 million eligible Americans left unregistered by the present system provide ample justification.
Mr. Bush also repeats the tired Republican argument that "motor-voter" would increase fraud, even though there has been no recorded increase in cheating in the 29 states that already sign up voters at motor-vehicle offices, or in the 27 states that permit registration by mail.
No matter how he tries to cloak it, it seems plain that Mr. Bush's veto decision was a bow to G.O.P. fears that easier registration might hurt Republicans by enrolling large numbers of low-income Democrats at accessible public offices. Yet the bill's provisions wouldn't become effective until after the 1992 election. This was an opportunity for Mr. Bush to show statesmanship, and he blew it.
There's only a slim chance that the bill's sponsors can muster the votes needed to override the veto. But with fully 40 percent of eligible Americans still unregistered, it's worth a real fight when Congress returns from the July 4th recess.

HEADLINE: Say Goodbye, for Now, to Lower Air Fares

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
With summer vacations in full swing, travelers who have waited until now to buy airline tickets are in for a surprise: beginning tomorrow, air fares are expected to rise to their highest level in months. And if the carriers have their way, fares will continue to climb.
The exact amount of tomorrow's climb remains a mystery, because at least three different formulas have been loaded into the reservations computers. But on average, fares are likely to rise at least 10 percent. 
 It is hardly surprising. Airline executives contend that higher fares are necessary for the future health of the ailing industry, which has lost $6 billion in the last two years and has seen Pan American, Eastern and Midway go out of business. And just Thursday, the shrunken Braniff International called it quits.
Analysts and industry experts generally agree with the airline executives' assessment.
"The only way the industry will return to profitability is by increasing revenues," said Paul P. Karos, an airline analyst with First Boston.
Joseph Murphy, the publisher of Airline Financial News and several other airline newsletters, said, "Airline costs have gone up consistently, but fares haven't kept pace."
Even Christopher Witkowski, the director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Ralph Nader organization, agreed that the industry was experiencing hard times. He also said that most passengers did not believe that fare increases were automatically bad. "But carriers," he added, "often try to use rising costs, including fuel increases, as an excuse to hike fares higher than justified."
In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington last week, Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines, said: "By every measure of profitibility, airlines consistently rank dead last among major U.S. industries. Only once during the last 10 years -- in 1988 -- did the airline industry earn a net profit margin of as much as 3 percent. The average margin was actually negative."
Similarly, Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, told a meeting of travel and tourism officials in San Francisco last month that the industry's heavy losses had forced it to re-evaluate a number of airport improvement projects, to reconsider the feasibility of some recently developed hubs and to defer and cancel billions of dollars in orders for new aircraft.
United alone deferred $6.7 billion worth of orders, delaying 122 of 278 planes originally scheduled for delivery through 1995. And American is considering closing its recent hubs at Raleigh-Durham, N.C., Nashville and San Jose, Calif.
But there are limits to such economies, analysts say. Among the principal airlines of 51 nations and two international consortia, the United States fleet ranks 45th in age (more than 14 years compared with less than 11 for the world industry average), according to the publication World Airline Fleet Review.
Moreover, "the airlines face capital expenditures of some $180 billion by the year 2000," according to Robert J. Aaronson, the president of the Air Transport Association.
"Most of that is for the Government-mandated conversion of the airlines' fleet to quieter jets by the end of the decade." Meeting the new guidelines, he said, will require the industry to replace or modify 2,600 aircraft, at a cost of $130 billion.
 
Customers Expect Discounts
 In recent years, published fares actually rose steeply, especially those aimed at business travelers. But only 6 percent of the travelers paid the published fares; most flew at discounts averaging almost 40 percent off published prices. Some analysts wonder whether passengers are now so accustomed to discounts that they will resist any price rise, simply waiting until the next flurry of markdowns.
"Airlines have never been able to sell more than two-thirds of their seats," said Mr. Murphy, the aviation publisher. "So no matter what the fare levels, there'll always be bargain fares to fill the remaining one-third."
What helped keep air fares low in recent years were the death throes of Eastern and Pan Am, which offered big discounts as they struggled to survive. These days the big discounters are T.W.A. and America West, which are similarly struggling to survive. But both carriers would like to see higher industrywide fares, even though their own fares presumably would remain lower than those of the major carriers.
The weak economy also put pressure on fares, grounding many corporate and leisure travelers. Last year, total airline passengers fell for the first time in recent history -- to 452.2 million from 465.6 million in 1990, a 2.9 percent drop.
 
Claims of Predatory Pricing
 Last month's half-price sale on advance-purchase domestic tickets is likely to add millions to the industry's debt load -- possibly $500 million, according to Robert Ferguson, chairman of Continental. He said that while a carrier's costs are typically between 8 to 10 cents per seat mile, during the half-price sale carriers were selling seats at an average of 5 cents a seat mile. (A recent First Boston study reported that the industry's average seat-mile cost last year was 9.7 cents, the highest level in the 12 years covered by the study.)
Soon after the sale ended last month, Continental, Northwest and shareholders of America West filed suits against American, claiming its half-price sale amounted to predatory pricing intended to put them out of business.
Last week, when Braniff quit flying, it also blamed the fare war, saying the flurry of price cuts had undercut its own low fares, and warning that it was considering litigation.
Mr. Witkowski, the consumer advocate, also thinks the fare structure of the major carriers was intended "to hasten the downfall of low-cost competitors." If that happens, he said, "it will be harmful to all of us."
American denied the charge of predatory pricing, saying it merely responded to Northwest's earlier 2-for-1 family promotion.
But Northwest said its promotion had been targeted to only a small segment of the leisure travel market, adding that its previously projected $20 million profit from the family promotion would be transformed into a $40 million loss, since Northwest, like other carriers, felt compelled to match American.
Many travelers may not immediately notice tomorrow's scheduled fare increases, especially if they are traveling on recently purchased half-price tickets, which are valid through Sept. 13.
The new fares are intended to do more than simply return to the levels adopted by most of the industry in April, when American introduced its mileage-based, four-tier structure; American also wants to tack on an additional 4.4 percent increase in most markets, and United wants a 4.4 rise across the board.
Northwest said it would match its competitors, but would raise fares a full 10 percent in markets where it does not compete head-on with America and United.
Because airlines are continuing to adjust a limited number of fares to reflect the actual distance flown, some fare increases will go far beyond the proposed 4.4 percent rise. Thus, a first-class ticket on American between Hartford and Los Angeles, for example, will increase by 63 percent, according to USTravel, a large travel agency with headquarters in Rockville, Md.
In a sampling of 750 markets across the nation, USTravel found that American Airlines' proposed new coach fares will rise an average of 12 percent, first class 8 percent, 7-day excursion fares 13 percent and 14-day fares 12 percent. Between New York and Los Angeles, the increases will range from 29 percent (seven-day excursion fare) to 14 percent (first class).
If oil prices continue to rise, USTravel warned, and if recent labor agreements cost more than expected, "the fare structure could be in for a long, tough summer."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Trained Conservative Is Elected Ecuador President

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, July 5

 BODY:
An American-trained advocate of free market economic change was elected President of this oil-producing nation today, projections from two unofficial counts of the vote indicated. With 97 percent of the ballots counted unofficially, Sixto Duran Bellen had a 13 percentage-point margin, according to tallies by local news organizations.
"It's a harvest of a whole life, of 40 years of public service," the winning candidate, a courtly 70-year-old architect, said minutes after learning that exit polls earlier indicated that he had swept 19 of Ecuador's 21 provinces in his quest to become the new leader of Ecuador, South America's largest oil exporter after Venezuela. 
 The unofficial methods of gauging the results proved accurate in the first round of the voting, on May 17, which narrowed the field of candidates to the top two vote-getters. The official count of today's voting is expected to take several weeks.
Two hours after polling stations closed, Mr. Duran Bellen's opponent, Jaime Nebot Saadi, a 45-year-old lawyer, conceded defeat in his home in Guayaquil, Ecuador's main port. Mr. Nebot also advocated free-market policies.
From the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific to Spanish colonial cities in the Andes to Indian villages on the Amazon, an estimated five million Ecuadoreans cast ballots in the voting, which took place peacefully, a reflection of Ecuador's reputation as an island of tranquillity between two violence-wracked neighbors, Colombia to the North and Peru to the South. Long known as the world's largest producer of bananas, this nation in recent years has become a favored destination for American visitors -- tourists, Peace Corps volunteers, and Spanish-language students. In a reverse flow, as many as 500,000 Ecuadoreans, or 5 percent of the population, now live in the United States.
 
Long Ties to U.S.
 Close ties to the United States will undoubtedly tighten on Aug. 10 with the expected inauguration of what one American here called the "Ivy League Ticket."
Mr. Duran Bellen was born in Boston, where his father was an Ecuadorean businessman. He attended American schools, and then graduated from Columbia University with a degree in architecture. His vice-presidential running mate, Alberto Dahik, did postgraduate studies at Princeton University after receiving a degree in economics from Ontario University in Canada. If its victory is confirmed, the new team is expected to push Ecuador toward a free market, now the mainstream of economic policy in Latin America.
To reduce inflation, which has averaged 50 percent a year since 1989, Mr. Duran Bellen proposed reducing taxes on imports and cutting the Government deficit by selling money-losing state companies.
With Ecuador's proven oil reserves slipping, he has called for cutting bureaucratic red tape that hampers exploration and production work by foreign oil companies. This small nation depends on oil exports for about half of its foreign exchange and tax income.
To restore foreign credit flows, he advocates speedy negotiations over repaying Ecuador's $5.7 billion debt to foreign commercial banks. For the last three years, talks have dragged on inconclusively in New York.
In the first round of voting, voters soundly rejected the candidate of the Democratic Left Party of Ecuador's current President, Rodrigo Borja, who was constitutionally prohibited from a second term. Although Ecuador last year experienced one of the region's highest economic growth rates, 4.4 percent, the governing party candidate won only 8 percent of votes cast for 12 candidates. Voting is obligatory in Ecuador, but absenteeism may hit 32 percent, the highest level since the military gave up power here in 1979.
Mr. Nebot's candidacy suffers from Ecuador's strong regional splits. In the May voting, he won only one province outside his Pacific Coast stronghold. Following tradition, voters in the Andes and the Amazon voted overwhelmingly for the most prominent Indian candidate, Mr. Duran Bellen.
Wearing a silver-black business suit, the male uniform of the Indian elite, Mr. Duran Bellen has been a fixture on Ecuador's political scene since he became Public Works Minister in 1951.
During most of the 1960's, he worked in Washington for the Inter-American Development Bank. In oil boom years of the 1970's, he gained popularity by undertaking public works projects as Mayor of Quito, the capital. In 1979 and 1989, he made unsuccessful bids for the presidency. Last year, when his party, the Social Christian Party, chose the younger Mr. Nebot as candidate, the political veteran broke ranks and began his third presidential bid under a new electoral coalition, the United Republican Party.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transmission error, an article on July 6 about Ecuador's presidential election referred incorrectly to the winner, Sixto Duran Be llen. The writer called him an Andean leader, not Indian.

HEADLINE: INDUSTRIAL NATIONS FIGHTING DEADLOCK ON FARM SUBSIDIES

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 6

 BODY:
Leaders of the world's seven major industrial democracies today made what they said was a last-ditch attempt to break a six-year-old deadlock and reach a world trade agreement that could reverse the global economic slowdown.
European officials said the leaders were nearer to resolving what has become an essentially French-American dispute over extensive European farm subsidies, which the United States wants to see cut back. But United States officials cautioned against expectations of a breakthrough. 
 The issue has been the main stumbling block to concluding the so-called Uruguay Round of trade talks, which began in 1986.
 
Better Than Nothing
 Confronted by what President Francois Mitterrand called "the morose state of the world economy," the world leaders appeared to recognize that there was little they could do right now to affect interest rates, high unemployment and budget deficits. A trade accord thus emerged as the leaders' best hope to save face before their increasingly disenchanted constituents.
The summit leaders also discussed the Balkans, and the United States said tonight that it would support the use of air and naval power to get humanitarian aid into Bosnia and Herzegovina by land or by sea if Serbian forces block the United Nations-supported airlift through Sarajevo airport. [Page A6.]
Progress was reported to have been made on the trade issue at a dinner Sunday evening, before the summit, between President Bush and President Mitterrand. Jean Musitelli, the French Presidential spokesman, said a "better understanding has now emerged."
 
Degrees of Optimism
 After further talks today between officials of the European Community and the United States, a senior British official said, "The differences are narrowing and they should be bridgeable." But other officials expressed a less hopeful view.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the chances of an agreement remained "modest" and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said he did not foresee an accord "in the next three days." A European Community spokesman, Nico Wegter, stressed that no breakthrough had emerged.
The most contentious single point is a demand by Washington that the European Community cut the volume of its subsidized grain exports by 24 percent. France, by far the largest grain exporter of the 12 nations, has balked, and the European Community is offering a smaller cut over an extended period.
The United States argues that lower trade barriers would ease several economic problems at once. It would, for example, provide Eastern European countries with greater access to Western European markets for their own farm products, strengthening their fledgling capitalist economies.
Washington also sees more competitive farm trade as an incentive to other countries, especially in the developing world, to open up their own markets to goods and services sold by the United States, like financial services and telecommunications. A trade agreement could add at least $195 billion to world output and bolster faltering business confidence.
With the unemployment rate in the United States now at 7.8 percent and the rate in the European Community at 9.4 percent, many business executives in the United States, Japan and Europe have become impatient with the impasse over agriculture, which accounts for just 11 percent of the world's $4.3 trillion in annual trade. They argue that a breakthrough on trade offers the best hope for spurring economic growth and creating jobs.
 
U.S. Call to Action
 Echoing this view, President Bush, his popularity at home at a low ebb, promised that the three days of talks here would produce jobs for Americans. "Absolutely, it's a yes," he said, when asked about the prospect of more jobs, adding that economic expansion "means free trade."
Treasury Secretary Brady captured the sense of urgency by summing up a growing feeling here this way: "With all the talk, how come we don't get some action?"
A second, previously unscheduled meeting between Secretary of State James Baker and the European Community's chief trade negotiator, Frans Andriessen, was set for Tuesday.
While the trade talks continued, the leaders seemed ready to approve $1 billion in loans and credits to Russia through the International Monetary Fund and to consider postponing Russia's debt payments, after an agreement Sunday between the I.M.F. and the Russian Government. The $1 billion would represent the start of a proposed $24 billion Western aid program.
 
Yes -- and No -- to Yeltsin
 In a further show of goodwill toward Russia, the leaders agreed to allow President Boris N. Yeltsin to attend their dinner Tuesday evening after he announced that he was arriving a day earlier than expected. But French, German and Japanese officials insisted that a proposal by President Bush to admit Russia permanently to the summit participants' group, known as the Group of Seven, was premature.
Statements by participants reflected their unhappiness with the projected growth this year of a modest 1.8 percent, following a paltry eight-tenths of 1 percent last year. All of them deplored the slowdown and the accompanying surge in unemployment.
"The emphasis on growth is now unanimous," said Mr. Brady.
But in another indication of the difficulties of doing something about the problem, Germany showed no sign of lowering its high interest rates, which Bonn says are aimed at curbing the inflationary pressure stemming from the cost of unification. In addition, Japanese officials said they were already doing all they could to stimulate their sagging economy through proposed fiscal measures.
 
The Rising Yen
 In one concession, however, Yuichi Ezawa, the director general of the International Finance Bureau at the Ministry of Finance, said Tokyo was pleased by the recent surge in the value of the yen and would not be displeased if the trend continued. The yen has been hovering at about 125 to the dollar, about 4 percent stronger than three months ago.
Economists say that a stronger yen, which makes foreign products less expensive to Japanese consumers, should attract imports, helping to alleviate the country's rapidly rising trade surplus, which could reach $135 billion this year.
Mr. Ezawa added that Tokyo did not expect the trade surplus to increase after this year.
He expressed Japan's continuing reservations on expanding its assistance to Russia while a territorial dispute continues over a group of islands in the Kurile chain north of Japan, which were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. But in general, the summit leaders appeared intent on helping Russia as much as possible.
On the question of setting up an emergency $700 million aid fund to overhaul or close down 57 Soviet-built nuclear reactors in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, French officials said there was unanimity on the urgency of taking rapid action. But it remained unclear how this would be organized.
France argued that the seven countries should set up a joint fund administered by the Bank for Reconstruction and Development. But the United States and Japan argued in favor of bilateral programs, and it appeared this approach would be preferred.

HEADLINE: Lives of Unexpected Poverty In Center of a Land of Plenty

SERIES: Rethinking Welfare -- Third of six articles.

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa

 BODY:
This city of 25,000 sits amid cornfields and factories in the center of a state that has been riding out the recession with one of the lowest unemployment levels in the country. Yet around 2,000 poor people here are getting help of some kind from the welfare system, from vouchers to heat a house to a regular welfare check.
This is not the South Bronx or Appalachia, where poverty often is attributed to culture or behavior, to racism or reckless childbearing. 
 But Marshalltown shows with unusual clarity other powerful forces that make welfare and poverty hard to escape anywhere: the nation's proliferation of low-wage jobs and two decades of falling wages, especially for the least skilled, in terms of what they can buy.
 
Working, but Still Needy
 Diana Kuchenreuther, 34 years old, single, the mother of three children, has been working for two years and trying to get off the dole, but she is still desperately poor. Her home is an apartment in a big rundown house in a working-class neighborhood. Her entrance is on the side, over a concrete slab cluttered with two wobbly kitchen chairs and the jetsam of children.
Inside, the drain of the sink in the one bathroom hasn't worked for a couple of years, and the toilet leaked until a friend patched a crack in the bowl. The old carpet on the staircase is foul and torn. The upstairs ceiling leaks in the rain. The place has two bedrooms, one for Ms. Kuchenreuther, Phillip, 9, and Aimmee, 7, the other for Lucinda, 13. The rent is $260 a month.
 
Most Outside Cities
 Although dependence on welfare is concentrated in inner cities, a majority of recipients live in suburbs, small towns like this one and rural areas around the country. And although black and Hispanic people receive welfare out of proportion to their numbers, more white people, including Ms. Kuchenreuther, spend time on it than members of any other group.
Some common patterns of welfare are evident here. Ninety-one percent of the Marshall County households that receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children are headed by women, many of them victims of abusive or runaway men. Forty percent of the women on welfare in Iowa had their first children as teenagers, and 16 percent dropped out of high school.
But no one can blame racism for poverty here. Ninety-eight percent of the 38,000 people of Marshall County, of which Marshalltown is the seat, are white, as are nearly all the families on welfare.
In big cities and the rural South, welfare and poverty might feed on themselves in spreading through neighborhoods. Here, poverty stays indoors. Marshalltown is not rich, but it is barren of slums, and the poor live next to the middle class. The crime and drug problems of the inner cities are, by comparison, insignificant here.
Being on welfare in Marshalltown seems less the hassle it can be in big cities. From the center of downtown, people can walk to the various welfare offices and complete their business in an hour or two. A sign at the reception desk of the human services office tells clients to complain if they wait more than 15 minutes.
 
Feeling the Stigma of Welfare
 But there is also less room to hide. Case workers keep close tabs on their clients, and with more jobs available than in big urban centers, they go to some length to prod them to work. People on welfare here say they also contend with the stigma of dependence in the asides of their neighbors and in the glances of shoppers in the supermarket checkout line when they pay with food stamps.
Ms. Kuchenreuther and other people interviewed are at various stages of the struggle with poverty, welfare and the low-wage economy. She is paid $4.80 an hour as a nurse's aide. She often works up to four hours of overtime a day and earns as much as $350 a week. She no longer receives a cash welfare grant, but she remains eligible for $177 a month in food stamps, and she is in line for a Government-subsidized house that should cost her no more than she pays now.
Ms. Kuchenreuther said she loves working and caring for the elderly. But she is trapped by her wages. "People say, 'Why don't you move out of this house?' " she said. "I can't afford to."
She said she wants to become a registered nurse, which would pay $12 an hour. But that means a couple of years of full-time schooling, giving up her work and going back to living almost entirely on welfare.
The attitudes of Ms. Kuchenreuther and other welfare recipients interviewed here run from defiant and confident to defeated and lost. Two are aiming for well-paid jobs that would free them from welfare. The prospects for the others are less certain.
 
Christine Anderson
A Temporary Tool To Earn a Degree
 For Christine Anderson, 25, the welfare system is not a permanent crutch, but a tool to escape the quicksand of a life of low-wage jobs. She wants to be a social worker.
With the aid of welfare and a Federal grant for college students from families with low incomes, Ms. Anderson has spent a year at Marshalltown Community College working toward a two-year associate's degree. With high grades so far, she hopes to keep getting grants and subsidies and eventually earn a master's degree in social work, which could lead to a job paying enough to support herself and her daughter, Burgundy.
Ms. Anderson, who was born in Wisconsin, moved in with her father in Des Moines at 11 after her parents divorced. At 13 she was sent to her father's parents in South Dakota, who sent her to a Seventh-day Adventist boarding school near Bismarck, S.D. She was valedictorian of a class of 17.
 
'An Irresponsible Thing'
 Lacking money for college, she became a hostess in a restaurant and took up with a waiter. "I did an irresponsible thing," she said. "I got pregnant." She said the waiter fled to Colorado. She took a job at another restaurant in Lincoln, Neb., had her baby, enrolled at the University of Nebraska and lasted a month. "I didn't know about welfare," she said. "I was trying to work, go to college, pay a baby sitter and breast-feed my baby."
She went to Topeka, Kan., and found a job as a receptionist with an engineering firm. In three years, she was making $7.50 an hour. But fighting bulimia, a severe eating disorder, she moved to Marshalltown to be closer to her mother and in 1989 enrolled in the welfare system.
The system has helped her take control of her life, she said. Her apartment is bright and clean. In her living room, she has 12 potted plants, her 6-year-old daughter's toys tucked in corners and school drawings on the wall. "I do not present myself as poor white trash," she said.
 
No Telephone, No Sofa
 But there are many things Ms. Anderson does not have, from a corkscrew to a sofa. She does without a telephone. She changes the oil in her car herself. If short of cash for gas, she gets it with food stamps: if the change due on a food stamp purchase is less than $1, merchants pay in money, so Ms. Anderson goes from store to store buying 5-cent mints, accumulating enough coins to buy gas.
She feels the stigma of being on welfare -- she receives $361 in A.F.D.C. payments a month, $118 in food stamps, a subsidy of $199 on her monthly rent of $303, and Medicaid. When she prepares to pay in the supermarket, she keeps the food stamp book in her purse as she tears out the coupons.
"Someone on my softball team was bitching because I was too tan," she said. " 'Oh, I forgot, Christine, you don't have a real life,' she said. That was someone who got a free car when she got married and gets free rent from living with her in-laws."
She is irked that she lets it get to her. She worked for more than four years and paid taxes. "I don't feel guilty about taking your money," she said. "I'm not taking your money. I'm taking my own."
 
JoAnn Earnest
A Refuge In Bad Times
 JoAnn Earnest, 37, and Roger Bunting, 31, together for two and a half years, say they want to be self-sufficient. He has just started a business, and she would like to start one. But they find the economy blowing against them and the welfare system a refuge.
"I'm tired of all this," Mr. Bunting said. As an able-bodied male without children, he is ineligible for welfare, but he benefits from the help Ms. Earnest gets.
"Nobody should get nothing for nothing," he said. "Russia was a welfare state since 1917, and look what it got them." But it is hard to get along without it, too. "In the winter," he said, "we don't make nothing. She's the one that makes everything happen then."
 
$50 for Child Care
 Most mornings, Ms. Earnest gets up at 5 o'clock. A woman who works in a meat-packing plant brings in her mildly retarded 6-year-old son. Ms. Earnest watches the boy for $50 a week, income she reports to the authorities. The boy curls up with his blanket on the living room rug, and Ms. Earnest goes back to bed for an hour or so. Then she gets up and puts on one of her three pairs of pants.
"I could use some more pants," she says. Her shoes are one of two pairs she wears. She has another pair she doesn't use, high heels that she bought on sale for $5.
She awakens Brandy, her 3-year-old daughter by another man, and then gets up Mr. Bunting if he has any work to do. Since quitting a job making pallets that paid the state's minimum wage of $4.65 an hour, Mr. Bunting has invested in three dump trucks for less than $2,000 to start a business.
He runs advertisements in a local paper. One says, "Hauling and Odd Jobs." The other says, "Black Dirt." The black dirt, good for gardens, comes from the 35-acre back yard. "Want to see a rural ghetto?" he said, gesturing out a back window. Mounds of metallic debris and vehicles parts obscure the view of the property, which is owned by Mr. Bunting's father.
Mr. Bunting said that one month recently he earned four times what he could earn from the minimum wage. But in June, he said, he made nothing at all. In times like that, Ms. Earnest is the sole source of income. Besides her pay from watching the boy, she and Brandy are allotted $200 a month in food stamps and $357 a month in A.F.D.C.
The Mid-Iowa Community Action Program, a service for the poor that is financed in part by the Federal Government, provides about $40 a month in food coupons for Brandy under the Federal Women's, Infants and Children program and vouchers for part of the heating bill. It also insulated the house.
 
Not Afraid to Work
 Brandy turned three on June 18, a threshold age for the youngest child of parents on welfare in Iowa. At that point, parents are beckoned to the state's job service for counseling and possible placement. If they do not show up, they can lose all but the food stamps and A.D.F.C. that their children need.
Ms. Earnest said she is not afraid to work. Earlier, while rearing three other children -- daughters 18 and 19, and a son, 21 -- she worked in nursing home as a housekeeper, in a garment factory and in a woodworking shop. All the jobs paid less than $5 an hour, but living was easier then.
She had a husband who was a machine operator in a factory. But he went to jail in 1983 for burglary, and she went on welfare for three years. They are separated now and he is somewhere in in South Dakota. She said she went back on welfare a few months before Brandy was born because her doctor told her the varnish and paint fumes in the wood shop could endanger her pregnancy.
She wants a better job than before, running a day care business or another skilled job. But she could face a long haul. She stopped school in the ninth grade, and before training for a well-paid job, she would have to get the equivalent of a high school diploma.
 
Yvette Anderson
Fleeing a Spouse, Finding Welfare

After three years on welfare, Yvette Anderson, 33, is a year from vaulting out of the system to a much improved standard of living. A nurse's aide for 10 years before she had children -- daughters aged 3 and 2 by her former husband and a 2-month-old son by the man she sees now -- she set out to become a registered nurse. Next May she expects to complete her training.
Ms. Anderson, who is not related to Christine Anderson, can then expect to earn the $12 an hour that nursing here pays to start. She would also collect the $329 a month that her former husband is paying in child support. For now, the state keeps all but $50 to offset the $272 a month she receives in food stamps and $426 in A.F.D.C. In all, she would receive about $29,400 a year, about $1,000 above the median income for a family of four in Iowa and well above the poverty line.
Ms. Anderson said leaving her heavy-drinking husband put her on welfare. "I was five months pregnant. I was scared to death of him. He'd say, 'If you don't shut your mouth, you're going to find yourself picking yourself up off the floor.' " She said she felt worthless then.
She is the eldest of seven children. She said her mother, now married to her fifth husband, was on welfare more often than not. She said she would not repeat the pattern. "I had no choice. I could live with an alcoholic or get out."
She puts the stigma of welfare out of her mind. "I don't care what people think. And if I have a temporary setback and I have to use the system, that's my right, as a previous taxpayer and a future taxpayer."
 
Glenda Schmidt
Shaky Prospects, Uncertain Pay

Glenda Schmidt, 39, did the right things to get off welfare, getting trained for a job and taking a one as a nurse's aide. But hers is not only a low-wage job. Like many of the economy's newer jobs, it is part time and irregular. She never really knows when she will she will be beckoned to work.
Mrs. Schmidt fits one stereotype of women on welfare but not another. She has five children, ages 9 to 23, which has qualified her for A.F.D.C. and food stamps on and off, depending on her husband's success with his work. Under a special program in Iowa, parents, married or not, can get A.F.D.C. if both are at home, one or both are unemployed, and at least one has been working.
On the other hand, she has had a long and stable marriage, after one that lasted seven months and produced her first child. Every day she carries a lunch to her her husband, Robert, who is 43, at the garage where he is trying to start a machinery repair business.
Mrs. Schmidt seems weary and worn sitting in front of a large television console in the living room of her small, rented brick house. She said Mr. Schmidt bought the television in better times. Because she works, her benefits were cut, and now her big concern is how she will pay for the family's medicine when the Medicaid coverage that came with welfare ends this fall.
She now pays only $1 for each prescription. She takes medicine for an inflamed stomach, for anxiety, for hypertension and migraine headaches. Until a couple of months ago, she was taking an antidepressant. The Schmidts' 9-year-old daughter needs medicine for a urinary problem that alone costs $180 a month. Mr. Schmidt, who has had three heart attacks, takes nitroglycerin. But he is a Vietnam War veteran, so he gets free medical care.
 
Anxiety of Uncertainty
 Mrs. Schmidt's anxiety arises in part from trying to wean herself from welfare. Several years ago she went to school to learn to be a nurse's aide. Last October, she landed a job at a local hospital that pays $5.77 an hour and about 50 cents more for night work. The work, however, is unpredictable, and she does not take the hospital's health benefits because they would cost her $53 a week, or half her pay many weeks.
In April, she earned $700 because she worked overtime filling in for a co-worker. One week in June, she earned $114. The next, she earned $108. The third she earned nothing. "They called me and said I didn't have to come in," she said. When that happens the welfare system helps out, but only after some paper-processing delays.
At the end of June the Schmidts had $300 in bills, for rent, light, garbage collection and telephone service, and nothing to pay them with. She still receives food stamps, $209 in June, but her $495 in A.F.D.C. was cut off the month after she started work.
She scrimps. "I don't buy lipstick," she said. "I don't buy fingernail polish. Now shampoo, that's a necessity. I get that for 89 cents." She drives a 1979 Plymouth Horizon to work, but it has problems with its gears, and the emergency brake is unreliable. The car is not insured.
Mr. Schmidt has been a truck driver for years, but needs less stressful work because of his health. But business for his new repair business is slow, and he may have to give it up.
"I guess I worry if I'm doing things right," Mrs. Schmidt said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Cuomo Turnabout: Now He Will Nominate Clinton

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 6

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who had insisted that he did not want and would not accept a speaking role at the Democratic National Convention, agreed today to place Gov. Bill Clinton's name in nomination next week at Madison Square Garden.
The New York Governor's decision to give the high-profile speech signified a mutually beneficial rapprochement between two men who have had more than their share of personal and political conflict in recent years. Coming one week before the opening of the convention, the announcement defused any possibility that the Cuomo-Clinton contretemps would become an unwelcome sideshow to Mr. Clinton's coronation.
 
Brown Mentions No. 2 Role
 
 Mr. Cuomo's change of heart -- he preferred to say he had simply deferred to the judgment of Mr. Clinton and the Democratic party chairman, Ronald H. Brown -- symbolized a marked improvement in relations between two men who are considered leading spokesmen for the Northern liberal and Southern moderate wings of their party. But it also raised the question of whether Mr. Cuomo might also relax his vow of uninterest in the Vice Presidency.
Mr. Cuomo made a point of saying at a news conference today that Mr. Brown had discussed the Vice Presidency with him by telephone over the weekend. Mr. Cuomo said the party chairman had not asked him to reconsider his position, but he declined to provide details about their conversation. He said Mr. Clinton did not mention the Vice Presidency in a telephone call on Sunday night.
Ginny Terzano, a spokeswoman for Mr. Brown, said "99.9 percent" of the conversation between Mr. Brown and Mr. Cuomo on Saturday concerned Mr. Cuomo's speaking at the convention. She said Mr. Brown mentioned as an aside that he would have liked Mr. Cuomo to serve as Mr. Clinton's running mate.
 
Clinton Says He Is 'Gratified'
 "He was not speaking for Mr. Clinton," she said.
There was no sign today from Little Rock, Ark., where Mr. Clinton spent most of the day, that the Arkansas Governor was considering Mr. Cuomo as a running mate. Aides to Mr. Clinton said he had not yet decided whom he would select. But Mr. Clinton is expected to announce his choice later this week or just before the start of the convention next Monday.
Mr. Clinton said as he left Little Rock for Washington late today that he was "gratified" that Mr. Cuomo would give the speech, adding that the New York Governor "would be very, very compassionate and forceful in making the case."
"I think he'll make a compelling case, not just for me, but for why we have to change," Mr. Clinton said.
Asked on his arrival tonight in Washington whether Mr. Cuomo's role as nominating speaker would rule out his being selected as a running mate, Mr. Clinton said he had not ruled out anyone.
Mr. Cuomo, by volunteering that Mr. Brown had spoken to him about the Vice Presidency and then declining to discuss the context, managed to insert himself back into the Vice-Presidential search from which he had withdrawn weeks ago.
What seemed certain today was that no formal offer of the Vice-Presidential spot had been made to Mr. Cuomo. But what was less clear was whether he would actually be interested in the job. The Governor has conceded in the past that speculation linking him to a Presidential campaign is good for his political stature at home and as a national party leader.
He said he considered the Vice Presidency a critical job. "I hope nobody thinks that a person who knows as much about government as I do and who feels the way that I do about government could say the Vice Presidency is not important enough, that you've got to be No. 1," Mr. Cuomo said. "It is a very important position. So please, it's not a disparagement of the office when I say it wouldn't work for me."
But he declined to predict whether he would accept the job, saying any discussion of the issue was "academic" because he did not expect to be asked. Mr. Cuomo told Clinton campaign aides several weeks ago that he did not wish to be considered.
 
Signals Are Mixed
 "I'm told the process is concluded in the sense that they have all the candidates they can handle," Mr. Cuomo said.
Mr. Cuomo has sent mixed signals about the Vice Presidency in the past. Last week, he said in an interview with The Associated Press that it would be "very, very inviting" to defend the New York record in a campaign against the Bush-Quayle ticket. "But, of course," he added, "it's no justification for running for Vice President."
A top adviser to Mr. Cuomo said he doubted that Mr. Cuomo, who harbors few warm memories of his four years as Lieutenant Governor to Gov. Hugh L. Carey, would be interested in the Vice Presidency.
"Why should he come along for the ride with someone else driving?" asked the adviser, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. "I don't know how he would feel about playing second to this man."
As recently as Friday evening, Mr. Cuomo said in an interview, "I'm not going to be speaking at the convention."
He asserted then that he had had no discussions with Mr. Clinton or Mr. Brown about a speech and he denied reports that there had been talks between his staff, the Clinton staff and the Democratic National Committee staff.
Members of the Clinton and Cuomo staffs said today that such discussions had indeed taken place, with one Clinton aide saying there had been "a flurry of calls between lieutenants and lieutenants."
Officials in the Clinton campaign said they had also considered offering the speech to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who ran against Mr. Clinton for the Democratic nomination. They said Mr. Harkin had been approached about taking another speaking role, possibly to second Mr. Clinton's nomination.
Mr. Cuomo said today that he was persuaded over the weekend by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown, who was a student of Mr. Cuomo's at St. John's Law School.
The Governor said Mr. Brown argued that it would seem awkward for him to not speak at a hometown convention.
Mr. Cuomo said Mr. Brown suggested that not speaking might reinforce the perception of hostility between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Clinton.
The Governor said he argued that important convention roles should be reserved for the party's rising stars.
"Ron Brown said in particular, 'That's very logical as usual, professor,' because he calls me professor, 'but I still think it would be good for the party if you spoke,' " Mr. Cuomo said. "Having heard his reasons, having given him mine, I still think mine were better, but not so overwhelmingly superior that I would not be able to defer to his desire that I speak."
Mr. Cuomo's decision creates the historical paradox that the man who enthralled the 1984 Democratic convention with his keynote address will now nominate the man who anesthetized the 1988 convention with his 33-minute nominating speech of Michael S. Dukakis.
Mr. Cuomo skyrocketed to political fame at the convention in San Francisco by contending that President Ronald Reagan's depiction of America as "a shining city on a hill" was actually a tale of two cities, including one "where the glitter doesn't show."
Mr. Clinton, by contrast, droned on in Atlanta for long past his allotted time and earned his greatest applause with a line that began, "In closing . . . "
 
Showcase for Cuomo
 For Mr. Cuomo, the scheduled 20-minute nominating speech will provide a new opportunity to showcase his oratorical skills and to cement his image as a national party leader. Network officials said today they did not know whether Mr. Cuomo's speech would be shown live as part of their reduced broadcasts of the convention. But several said they planned to at least show excerpts.
For Mr. Clinton, the New York Governor's willingness to nominate him represents an important bit of peacemaking. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Clinton have long been at odds over the direction of the Democratic Party, with Mr. Clinton saying the party must veer from the liberal tradition represented by Mr. Cuomo.
Earlier this year, the conflict became personal when Gennifer Flowers, a singer, said she had had an affair with Mr. Clinton, and made public a tape recorded telephone conversation in which Mr. Clinton said Mr. Cuomo "acts like" a member of the Mafia.
Mr. Cuomo appeared on a nationally televised talk show to question whether Mr. Clinton might harbor prejudice against all minorities.
In recent weeks, however, both sides have tried to mend fences. Mr. Cuomo complimented Mr. Clinton's economic plan enthusiastically and praised his acceptance of a Cuomo idea to form a united front with Democratic leaders in Congress. Mr. Clinton, when asked on an MTV talk show whom he would like to appoint to the Supreme Court, mentioned only Mr. Cuomo.

HEADLINE: CUNY's Crossroads -- A special report.;
Leader Presses Changes at CUNY, But Some See Threat to Its Mission

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD with SAMUEL WEISS

 BODY:
Two years into her tenure as chancellor of the City University of New York, Dr. W. Ann Reynolds has set off on an ambitious remaking of the nation's largest urban university, raising questions that go to the heart of CUNY's mission to make a high-quality education accessible even to poor and minority students.
Grappling with budgetary problems and an anemic graduation rate, Dr. Reynolds has said she intends to tighten CUNY's academic standards, restructure the system by eliminating and consolidating departments and programs, build up its science and research areas and develop a broad partnership with the public school system to improve teacher training and student preparation. She described the plans in interviews, though many details have not yet been shared with the university at large.
 
'More Scholarly'
 
 "The challenge over the next few years is to make sure this university becomes even more effective, more scholarly, more supportive of its faculty, more supportive of its students," said Dr. Reynolds, who has developed a reputation as an active and sometimes abrasive administrator. "One of the saddest things that can happen in college is to repeat learning things that should have been absorbed at an earlier time."
She and her supporters -- including the trustees and many seasoned faculty members -- are convinced that this overhaul will fortify the quality of the university and ease its fiscal woes, without detracting from its avowed mission of providing seats in its classrooms for all who want to learn. But a number of faculty members and students fear that the effect of Dr. Reynolds's changes will be to exclude many poor and minority applicants.
 
Questions of Access
 "It's just going to be a closed door for anyone except those with money," said June Nash, distinguished professor of anthropology at City College and a faculty member for 20 years. "I think the chancellor's vision is a smaller, middle-class university."
On the other hand, James P. Murphy, chairman of CUNY's trustees, called her "a persistent and very effective crisis manager" who, he said, has presented "a vision for the university over the next decade."
Tensions between Dr. Reynolds and some staff members have been building since her arrival. In May, more than 100 faculty and staff members at City College who were disturbed about tougher academic standards sent a blunt open letter to Dr. Reynolds denouncing what they termed her failure to preserve access to the university for minorities and the poor.
At the recent commencement exercises at Brooklyn College, some 150 students and faculty stood up and turned their backs on Dr. Reynolds when she rose to speak.
The rift over Dr. Reynolds's blueprint comes at a time when CUNY finds itself shadowed by a string of controversies and personnel changes. Just two weeks ago, Dr. Bernard W. Harleston announced his resignation as president of City College, the founding pillar of the 21-branch university. Last March, the storm over Dr. Leonard Jeffries Jr. finally abated when he was removed as chairman of the black studies department at City College because of his racially charged remarks.
In December, nine young people were trampled to death at a celebrity basketball game at City College, an incident that raised questions about administrative oversight of campus functions. Last year, swarms of outraged students seized college buildings in a protest over the latest tuition increases.
 
Setting Standards
 But foremost among the issues polarizing the university now is the sweeping question of what sort of place CUNY is likely to become, a question as traumatic as any it has faced since 1976. In that year, New York City's fiscal crisis forced the system to shut down for two weeks and led it to charge tuition for the first time.
Since the founding of City College in 1847, the institution has been viewed as the surest path to a career for New York's immigrants and disadvantaged, and out of CUNY's huge pool of graduates have come 11 Nobel Prize winners and more corporate executives than have emerged from any other university in the country.
Arguments over standards are not new. By the late 1960's, competition for admission had turned CUNY into one of the most selective universities in the country. After minority groups complained that the university's purposes were being subverted, CUNY adopted an open admissions policy in 1970 and embarked on a vast construction program. The new policy, which guaranteed entrance to any city high school graduate, led to the admission of thousands of under-prepared students and set off a bitter debate.
Tension over the university's character has intensified since April, when the trustees approved Dr. Reynolds's plan for stiffer educational requirements over the next decade. Known as the College Preparatory Initiative, the plan will require incoming students to have 16 college preparatory courses, or else take additional classes at CUNY.
 
'Academic Mission'
 Many faculty members and trustees, who have been distressed by what they see as an erosion in standards caused by open admissions, are staunch advocates of Dr. Reynolds, and speak of her in almost rapturous tones. "I think Chancellor Reynolds's great contribution has been to refocus attention on the academic mission of the university," said Dr. Robert Picken, chairman of the University Faculty Senate. "Right now the university is already a revolving door, and the retention rate for poorly prepared students is just catastrophic."
But there is widespread grumbling from many other faculty members and students convinced that CUNY's time-honored role is being perverted.
"I don't think she's shown a tremendous amount of sensitivity to the issue of access, and I think she's motivated by a desire to reduce the size of the colleges," said Dr. Robert Cherry, an economics professor who participated in the commencement protest.
Leith Mullings, a professor of anthropology in the City University Graduate Center, said she fears that CUNY will no longer "serve the population that it has the mission to serve: those who cannot afford an elite education."
 
Finances
Increasing Tuition And Cutting Jobs
 Professor Mullings's disillusionment, like that of many others, is grounded in personal history. She attended CUNY when it was free, as did her parents and four siblings. Her father, she said, held two jobs and went to Baruch College at night while raising five children. "He would not have had an extra $1,000 for tuition," she said.
Now three rounds of increases in the last two years have nearly doubled tuition, after it had remained stable for eight years. Incoming freshmen will pay $2,450 (compared with $16,500 at Columbia, $10,240 at Long Island University and $3,114 at Rutgers).
The increases are hardly surprising; since the 1989 academic year, state and city financing for CUNY has been cut by more than $200 million a year, trimming its budget to $1.2 billion. As a result, as many as 600 CUNY faculty and staff members, out of 13,700, are expected to be laid off in the fiscal year that began last week.
The system has already been deeply scarred by budget cuts. Students complain that they have been delayed in graduating because classes have been eliminated and they have to wait to fulfill their requirements. Certain courses are so crowded that some students have to sit on the floor.
 
Reputation for Toughness
 Professors say that when their department copying machines run out of toner, they may have to wait several months before there is money for fresh supplies. For lack of janitors, some faculty members are swabbing the floors of their own laboratories. Chalk can be hard to come by. Sports programs, counseling and libraries have all suffered.
Even in rosier circumstances, being chancellor of CUNY is probably one of the toughest jobs in higher education. It is a sprawling hodgepodge of 21 branches with some 200,000 students, the bulk of them poor and working-class people of every imaginable minority group. And it largely serves graduates of a public school system that has inadequately groomed many of them for college.
The 54-year-old Dr. Reynolds, however, has a reputation for brittle, unbridled toughness, in contrast to Dr. Joseph S. Murphy, her less active and more genial predecessor.
She came to CUNY two years ago from California State University, where she attracted her share of criticism. In fact, she was forced to resign as chancellor in a dispute over hefty pay increases that she engineered for herself and top university officials. Those who have worked under her say she does not favor a light touch.
 
Confidence in Plans
 In 1987, she was accused by some associates of verbally brutalizing a president of one of the Cal State colleges; the president died of a heart attack two weeks after she told him to resign. Chancellor Reynolds has denied those accusations. In her two years at CUNY, she has gone through six secretaries. Many faculty members say she has not been effective in communicating her plans or vision for the university.
A self-described insomniac who works at a fiendish pace, Dr. Reynolds speaks of her initiatives with sweeping confidence. In an interview, she dismissed the notion that in imposing tougher admissions standards she wanted to shrink the university and cut off minority students. "National studies have shown a strengthening of college preparation in high school will aid our minority students the most, and ultimately our retention and graduation rates," she said. "I'm not looking to reduce enrollment, I'm looking to increase it."
What bothers her, she said, is the fact that more than half of CUNY students fail to graduate within nine years. A mere 15 percent achieve a bachelor's degree in four years. She wants CUNY to stop spending so much of its resources on remedial education for ill-prepared high school graduates.
 
Programs
Strengthening And Streamlining
 CUNY's budget problems, Dr. Reynolds said, mean substantial changes will be necessary. In March, she appointed an advisory committee to explore ways to restructure CUNY by identifying the most important programs and activities to preserve and nurture. It is due to report in November.
Dr. Reynolds said she opposed closing any of the CUNY colleges, but she expects programs and departments will be eliminated. Officials familiar with the committee's work said a central issue being debated is whether to try to rid the system of duplication.
Until now, the various CUNY colleges have often offered identical programs, even when the schools are situated near each other. For instance, Baruch College and Hunter College, both in Manhattan, have large modern-language departments. Why not, the committee is wondering, shut down a program at one college and have students in that course travel to the other institution?
The task force is also looking at shifting programs from one college to another where there is a better educational fit. As a glimpse of what might happen, CUNY recently moved a technology program from City College to New York City Technical College.
Such steps, CUNY officials argue, will not only save money, but will make CUNY a more unified system and will sharpen the focus of the individual CUNY branches.
 
Science Programs
 On another front, Dr. Reynolds said she expected to outline plans soon to strengthen CUNY in its generally weak fields of science, engineering and technology. She is also planning new programs in areas like health sciences, though she acknowledges that all such plans could be delayed by a lack of money.
At the same time, she has laid the groundwork for a broad new partnership with the city's Board of Education.
CUNY and the city's public school system operate in a curious symbiosis. The university trains roughly 80 percent of the city's public school teachers; those teachers go on to educate the bulk of the students who replenish the CUNY student body. Each year, half of the graduates of the city's high schools enroll at CUNY.
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez said that Dr. Reynolds's plans to raise standards mesh perfectly with his own to improve the high schools. "In our first meeting, Chancellor Reynolds told me she wanted to get the university out of the remediation business, and I agree," he said. "We are the ones in the remediation business, and I have to improve what it is we do."
 
Broad Collaboration
 Dr. Reynolds and Mr. Fernandez intend to collaborate on an even broader scale. In March, CUNY and the Board of Education opened a pilot Family College at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn. It enrolled 18 parents eligible for public assistance in college courses while their prekindergarten children attended a nearby public school. Two more similar schools are scheduled to open in the coming academic year, and two more next year.
One of the biggest questions is whether Mr. Fernandez can uphold his end of the bargain and improve the public schools at a time when resources are so scarce. CUNY is counting on it. Last week, it began a promotional blitz intended to acquaint prospective students and parents with the college preparatory plan. Brochures prodding them to take the necessary courses were distributed to 87,000 students finishing eighth grade and mailed to their parents.
"New York is changing," Dr. Reynolds said, "and the university has to stay ahead of where the city is going if we're to be a critical factor in its future and the future of our students."
 
Access
Will Everyone Still Have a Place?
 The trustees have pledged a continued commitment to open admissions, and have called for Dr. Reynolds to issue a report each year on the impact of the new standards.
What many CUNY faculty members fear, however, is that students will not be able to find the required courses in high school and thus the college preparatory plan, coupled with rising tuition, will effectively bar entrance for many poor and minority students.
"It makes me very sad," said Carol Laderman, chairman of the anthropology department at City College. "I have many students living on the edge of poverty, who have to work, have to raise children, but are quite brilliant. I feel bad that the university is shutting out the students who need it the most."
Ronald Quartimon, the student president at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that while Dr. Reynolds had been admirably active, students were deeply suspicious that she was working to make CUNY an "institution for white, middle-class students."
 
'Close to the Bone'
 Almost every faculty member can recount a story about a student who must live from dollar to dollar. "I had one student who needed an anthropology course and we weren't offering it uptown," said Dr. Laderman. "So I said, 'Why don't you take it downtown at our Center for Worker Education?' And he said he couldn't do it, because he couldn't afford the extra subway fare to go there several times a week. I don't think people realize how close to the bone so many of our students are."
On the other hand, the Rev. Calvin O. Pressley, a CUNY trustee who avidly supports Dr. Reynolds, contends that CUNY will always have sizable minority representation, because of the makeup of the graduates of the public schools. "Given the nature of the city, we would have to become a very small university to exclude large numbers of minority students," he said.
Nevertheless, Dr. Reynolds acknowledged that money lies at the heart of the matter. She agreed that if financing does not improve over the next couple of years, then CUNY will have to consider curtailing enrollment.
Dr. Sheldon Weinbaum, distinguished professor of mechanical engineering at City College and a supporter of Dr. Reynolds, said: "If the Governor and the Legislature fund it the way a first-rate university should be, then CUNY will be a first-rate institution. If they don't, there is not anything that a Reynolds or anyone else can do about it."

HEADLINE: Chicago Mayor Threatening to Drop Airport Plan

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 6

 BODY:
Plans to build a third Chicago airport, on the city's southeast side, have been jeopardized by Mayor Richard M. Daley's angry reaction to the State Legislature's failure to approve key legislation for the project.
Mayor Daley said he would now drop his two-year crusade for the airport, but his announcement is widely viewed as a political maneuver to put pressure on the Legislature to approve the airport at Lake Calumet, the Mayor's favored site, on the southeast side. 
 "Most people don't believe him," said Gary Mack, a spokesman for Gov. Jim Edgar, who supports building the airport at Lake Calumet. "We simply can't believe that a project as big and important as that could be thrown away that cavalierly by the Mayor."
The Mayor has said construction and operation of the airport would create at least 200,000 jobs and generate $12 billion to $15 billion for the regional economy.
 
An Emotional Response
 The announcement by Mr. Daley, a Democrat, came during an emotional news conference last week after Mr. Edgar, a Republican, was unable to marshal enough votes in the State Senate for a regional airport authority to oversee airport construction..
The bill, which had passed the State House, stalled in the Senate when legislators from the northwestern Chicago suburbs, most of them Republican, refused to vote for it without assurances that no new runways would be built at O'Hare International Airport, the nation's busiest airport.
Residents in the northwestern suburbs near O'Hare have long complained about the noise caused by the 800,000 yearly flights there. While those residents support the idea of a third airport, they want to forestall any expansion at O'Hare during the 20 years it is expected to take to get a Lake Calumet airport ready for operation.
The Governor, enmeshed in state budget negotiations, told Mr. Daley that the vote on the airport authority would have to wait until after the November general election.
Mr. Daley, saying he did not believe that the bill would garner the necessary votes this fall, then told reporters he would not have Chicago's delegation reintroduce the measure and would no longer push for a new airport.
 
Seeking Regional Consensus
 The airport's estimated cost of $10.8 billion was to be partly financed by user fees at O'Hare and Chicago's other airport, Midway, which is near downtown. But a spokesman for Mr. Daley said that Chicago would also need substantial Federal money and that Federal support would depend on a regional agreement on the site.
"Chicago can't go it on its own," the spokesman, Billy Davis, said today. "It would be difficult to get that kind of Federal funding without a regional consensus."
Mr. Daley has not decided whether he will support the construction of an airport outside Chicago. He told reporters last week that he would use the estimated $90 million raised by airport user fees annually at O'Hare and Midway Airports to improve those sites.
After Mr. Daley's announcement, Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana said he would consider pushing for Federal funding to expand the airport at Gary, just across the state line from Chicago. But William Moreau, a special counsel for Mr. Bayh and a member of the airport site-selection committee, said the Governor was waiting to see "if Mayor Daley follows through on his threat."

HEADLINE: As New Orleans Plans Huge Casino, Some See Promise, Others a Threat

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 1

 BODY:
Arms flailing, expletives flying, Andy Antippas and Francois Lucet are shouting out their views on the issue obsessing New Orleans: will the world's largest gambling casino save this city or will it destroy it?
"You idiot," growled Mr. Lucet, a French architect who often does business here and who supports the proposal to build a giant casino near the Mississippi River. "This is the same unbelievable, negative nonsense you always have here where the clan in control opposes anything new." 
 "You stupid alien, this is the World's Fair only worse," Mr. Antippas, owner of the French Quarter art gallery where the exchange took place, hollered back, referring to the 1984 New Orleans World's Fair, which lost $120 million. "That was a disease that lasted six months. This is a plague that won't go away."
The emotions are commensurate with the stakes in a debate that cuts to the heart of the combination of vaporous, sensual charm and persistent, crushing poverty that makes New Orleans one of the nation's most alluring cities and perhaps one of its most imperiled.
In a city where the promise of easy money is as much a part of the fabric of life as the steamy summer heat, nothing in years has seemed so tantalizing and so horrific as the plan rammed through the Louisiana Legislature last month to make New Orleans the nation's latest city to offer casino gambling.
 
Savior or Satan?
 To supporters, the casino offers the promise of 14,000 jobs and at least $500 million in investment in a city that has never recovered from the collapse of the oil industry in the 1980's. To critics, it is a pact with the devil that will debase the adjacent French Quarter and bring increased crime and corruption for the promise of low-paying jobs that may not last if the casino fails.
What unites both sides is a fear that New Orleans, which was the South's most culturally sophisticated economically important city when Dallas and Atlanta were prairie and forest, may be running out of options to save itself.
"We're like a 60-year-old Southern dowager that's fallen on evil times," said Patrick Taylor, a New Orleans oilman and casino opponent. "It's difficult to keep up appearances, so she sells herself without realizing what her blessings are."
Last month the Legislature and Gov. Edwin W. Edwards pushed through a bill that would allow the construction of a casino on the site of the little-used, city-owned Rivergate convention center downtown.
Long a goal of Mr. Edwards, the casino would be built by a private operator, leased by the city and overseen by a commission appointed by the Governor. The state will get 18.5 percent of casino revenues, or $100 million, whichever is greater, from the casino operator. The city will get the rent for the Rivergate property. Eight companies have submitted proposals costing $187 million to $458 million for casinos ranging from 120,000 square feet to 250,000 square feet. The biggest casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, Nev., are about 120,000 square feet.
A winner will be selected in November, a temporary casino could open as early as March and the permanent casino may open by the end of 1993.
 
Banking in Tourism
 To supporters like Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, the casino is a natural, a huge infusion of tourist-oriented investment . He predicts that the casino will increase tourism to 13 million or 14 million visitors from 8 million now, provide a surge of related downtown development that could mean a billion dollars of investment in the city and bring an immediate payoff of as much as $100 million in leasing fees.
"Nothing else comes close to what this could do for New Orleans," Mr. Barthelemy said. "For a city that has been struggling, that basically had an industry, oil, as its major industry that was collapsing, we had to do something to create jobs."
In fact, the stakes are so high for New Orleans because the city has sunk so low. From 1980 to 1990 the percentage of the city's population living in poverty grew to 31.6 percent from 26.4 percent, making it the nation's third-poorest city, behind Laredo, Tex., and Detroit. More than 10 percent of the population lives in bleak public housing units, and one in six of all housing units, 37,000 units, are now vacant.
"This city has the potential of becoming the Newark of the South," said James C. Brandt, executive director of the Bureau of Governmental Research, a business-oriented research organization based in New Orleans.
But Mr. Brandt is quick to add that the city also has extraordinary potential to prosper, and that gambling is not the way to do it. Mr. Brandt said that the image of a casino town would scare off corporate investment and that the casinos would suck resources from the rest of the city, killing off small businesses and getting a disproportionate share of public investment.
Critics are quick to point to Atlantic City, where few of the rosy projections for gambling came true and where the city has continued to deteriorate despite gamblers flocking to the casinos.
 
Reasons for Skepticism
 "The city is an economic basket case," said Arnold Hirsch, a historian at the University of New Orleans. "The casino is an attempt to bounce back all in one great leap. Whether it's a great leap forward or a leap into the abyss remains to be seen."
Most New Orleans legislators voted against the casino bill, which failed to provide the city with most of the provisions, including a statutory limit of one casino, a share of tax revenues and a seat on the commission board, that the city had sought.
"Edwin Edwards picked up New Orleans by its ankles and dangled it upside down until all the change fell out of its pockets," Mr. Hirsch said.
The casino process began with the prospect of one small European-style casino and ended with the promise of the biggest casino ever built. For good measure, there will soon be riverboat gambling and video poker to go with the state's lottery and horse racing, putting New Orleans on the verge of becoming the gambling capital of the South.
If Atlanta is the plucky and calculating Scarlett O'Hara, to many here the casino process showed New Orleans as Blanche DuBois, the faded belle in "A Streetcar Named Desire," dependent on the kindness of strangers unlikely to deliver.
"There's nothing wrong with a one-horse economy if the horse is big enough," said Tim Ryan, a University of New Orleans economist. "We had a one-horse economy with oil that was big enough. With gambling, I think we're going to have a pony trying to pull a real big wagon."
On the streets of the French Quarter, everyone has an opinion.
To Paul Gros, preaching in the middle of Bourbon Street next to his five-foot-tall wooden cross equipped with an electric moving message sign, the casino is more decadence for a city drowning in sin.
"The Bible says Roman soldiers cast lots for Jesus' garments," he said, as passers-by headed toward Le Paree Orgy, a topless bar. "Lots are nothing but dice. There's nothing new under the sun."
To John Wooters, who moved to New Orleans from Denver three weeks ago when he heard the casino bill had passed, the casino plan is just what the city needs.
"I've worked in a lot of tourist cities, and this is something that's going to make a lot of money," said Mr. Wooters, as he sold hot dogs at the corner of Bourbon and Bienville.
The biggest reservations can be found behind the shuttered windows of French Quarter homes and in the sedate galleries of Royal Street, where people fear that a wave of real estate speculation will kill what is left of the authentic quarter.
Even in the low-income areas most in need of jobs there is little agreement. At the edge of the Iberville housing project downtown, Patrice Miles thinks the casino will detract from what makes New Orleans special, while Nolan Coleman supports the casino.
"It will mean jobs, man," he said, spearing candy wrappers on his job with the city's housing authority. "Life is a gamble. Why not give it a try?"
Carlos Marcello, the city's famous crime boss who has been linked in various theories to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, is old and infirm, and law-enforcement figures say there is little big-time organized crime in New Orleans these days. But many fear gambling would bring organized crime back in a big way.
"We're not equipped to handle major league crime," said Oliver Hauck, a Tulane University Law School professor.
On the other hand, homegrown corruption has a long history here, as does gambling, which dates back to the 18th century and flourished until the 1940's and 50's. Thus, even Mr. Antippas finally concludes that in the coming battle between the gumbo Mammon of New Orleans and the neon Mammon of Las Vegas, the home team will somehow win.
"In my heart of hearts, I know the city will overcome the casino," he said softly, his friendly shouting match with Mr. Lucet finally at an end. "I think they'll learn they can't be corrupt their way, they'll have to be corrupt our way -- a genial, go-with-the-flow New Orleans kind of corruption.
"We'll win. But I'm not sure at what cost."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sales Of Vehicles Jump 23.9%

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT July 6

 BODY:
The nation's auto industry yesterday reported strong sales for late June, propelled by what executives said was rising consumer confidence and a stronger economy.
The news seemed to run counter to the gloomy economic picture painted by last week's report that the nation's unemployment rate had risen sharply in June. But auto executives said the cut in interest rates that followed the release of the jobless data would help the industry. 
 "With the recent reduction in short-term interest rates, we expect to see even stronger vehicle sales in the second half of the year," said James B. Fitzpatrick, vice president of marketing at General Motors.
 
More Are Buying American
 Analysts said a "Buy America" preference among consumers had helped Detroit's Big Three gain ground against Japanese competitors. G.M.'s Saturn division had a particularly strong month, and in June, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for North American-built cars was the best in 11 months.
Sales of vehicles built in North America -- which are considered domestically built -- rose a sharp 23.9 percent in the last 10 days of the month compared with the period a year earlier. Car sales rose 15 percent, to 244,473, and light-truck sales gained 40.7 percent, to 157,284.
The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of North American-built cars for the period of June 21-30 was 7.5 million. For the month, the rate was 6.7 million, up from 6.3 million in May and the same as in June 1991. The monthly selling rate was the highest since July 1991.
For the entire month of June, sales of all cars and light trucks, which include mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles, surged 6.2 percent, to 1,268,954, from 1,149,021 last year. June car sales were up 2.5 percent, to 826,942, and light-truck sales rose 14 percent, to 442,012.
 
'Very Good News'
 "The latest 10 days are very good news, because it means that dealer inventories will be in good shape, and that bodes well for production schedules," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. "We haven't been able to say that in a while."
Sales of G.M.'s domestically produced cars rose 18.4 percent in late June, to 106,857, led by strong increases at all divisions except Chevrolet, which suffered a 3.5 percent decline. Sales of G.M.'s domestic light trucks rose 34.3 percent, to 57,527.
The Saturn division sold more than 20,000 cars in one month for the first time. At that rate, Saturn could be approaching capacity at its two-year-old plant in Spring Hill, Tenn.
"We had a tremendous Fourth of July weekend, and we don't have many Saturns in stock," said John B. T. Campbell 3d, who owns several dealerships in Southern California.
 
Ford's Taurus Excels
 The Ford Motor Company's car sales rose 30.7 percent in late June, to 61,952, and the company's light-truck sales rose 39.3 percent, to 51,834. Robert L. Rewey, vice president of sales operations, noted that the midsized Taurus, which was redesigned for 1992, had its best sales month since May 1989.
Ford injected a note of caution by saying unusually strong orders for cars from rental companies had inflated its results. Some rental companies were caught short of cars when airlines lowered fares and caused a surge of travelers, Ford said.
But Stephen Girsky, automotive analyst for Paine Webber in New York, said Ford's sales to rental fleets would help the company's profits because they reflected genuine demand caused by a greater volume of travelers rather than steep discounting.
General Motors said it had not experienced a similar phenomenon in its rental sales.
The Chrysler Corporation, which announces sales on a monthly basis only, said car sales for all of June declined 12.2 percent, to 54,255, while light-truck sales, led by its popular mini-van, rose 23.1 percent, to 101,438.
"Our total vehicle sales have climbed back almost to where they were two years ago, before the economic slump really set in," said Tom Pappert, vice president of sales.
 
Japanese Feel a Pinch
 Japanese auto makers were clearly feeling the effects of their recent price increases and the Big Three's gains in quality. The Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales for the month, including vehicles built in the United States and Japan, fell 5.6 percent, to 61,621. The Honda Motor Company posted an 8.7 percent drop in car sales for the month, to 77,287.
But the Nissan Motor Company's car sales rose 13.4 percent, to 45,479. Earl J. Hesterberg, vice president of the Nissan brand division, said car sales had been rising steadily since January. The division is about to introduce a midsized car, the Altima; a new mini-van, the Quest, has begun arriving at dealer showrooms.
Because light-truck sales have gained so much more than car sales -- and the Big Three are much stronger than the Japanese in light trucks -- Detroit has been able to score a significant gain in overall market share.
 
Big Three's Share: 71.8%
 Taking into account cars and light trucks, imported and domestic, the Big Three captured 71.8 percent of all sales in June, up from 69.7 percent of all sales in the month a year earlier. That left the Japanese auto makers with 22.7 percent of sales, including output from North American-based transplants, down from 24.5 percent a year earlier. Other importers, principally from Britain and Germany, sold 5.5 percent of all vehicles, down from 5.9 percent from last year.
Mr. Campbell, the California dealer, said: "People are buying American, especially here in Orange County, where the import penetration is usually 60 percent. What that means is, people are giving American cars a look."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Plans Peacekeepers for Moldova

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 6

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that Russia and Ukraine might join Romania and Bulgaria in a peacekeeping force to end the civil war in Moldova.
Mr. Yeltsin made the announcement at the end of a meeting of the leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States. He also said the other Commonwealth countries had agreed that he would speak for them all when he asks the Group of Seven summit meeting of major industrialized nations in Munich to postpone repayment of old Soviet foreign debts for at least two years. 
 The Commonwealth meeting also reached several administrative decisions, but failed to resolve differences over the future of former Soviet strategic nuclear weapons.
Speaking at a news conference attended by the heads of 10 Commonwealth countries, Mr. Yeltsin portrayed the decision to form a peacekeeping force as one taken by the entire Commonwealth. He said future decisions might be taken to use the force in other ethnic wars.
Mr. Yeltsin later clarified that the force for Moldova would be formed of Russian and Ukrainian troops from the Commonwealth, and of Romanian and possibly Bulgarian troops. He said the force would be deployed only if the Moldovan Parliament requested it.
Mr. Yeltsin said he had been assured by the Moldovan President, Mircea Snegur, that the Moldovan Parliament would do so. But there was no immediate indication how either side in the conflict would react to the introduction of outside forces, or whether Romania or Bulgaria would agree to participate.
Moldova has been torn by civil war between the ethnic Romanians who form the majority in the small republic, and the Russians and Ukrainians who live for the most part in a wedge along the east bank of the Dniester River. The Russians and Ukrainians have proclaimed a Trans-Dniester Republic, arguing that the Moldovans intend to merge with Romania.
Mr. Snegur, who has previously accused the Russian Army of backing the Slav separatists, appeared today to welcome the prospect of a peacekeeping force. "I think that with joint efforts and through Parliament we will find a way out of this situation," he said, "a way to maintain a cease-fire, introduce buffer forces and work calmly in Parliament to find a compromise."
But President Levon Ter-Petrosyan of Armenia, whose country has been ravaged by a four-year struggle with neighboring Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, reacted bitterly when asked his reaction.
"To my regret, I must state that the Commonwealth has no mechanisms to resolve inter-ethnic conflicts, and all these statements remain mere words," he said.
The Commonwealth meeting was held on the eve of Mr. Yeltsin's departure for Munich, where leaders of the seven major industrialized nations -- the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- are holding their annual economic summit conference.
Mr. Yeltsin has said he will ask the leaders on behalf of all Commonwealth members to defer all interest and principal payment of the $74 billion in foreign debt inherited from the Soviet Union. "Some participants to the meeting thought that such debt should be forgiven altogether because we had little to do with that debt," he added with a smile.
 
Big Aid Package Still Tied Up
 On Sunday, the International Monetary Fund agreed to grant Russia a $1 billion loan after securing new commitments from the Russian Government to further cut spending. The agreement was concluded during a trip to Moscow by the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, to insure that Mr. Yeltsin would not leave the Munich conference empty-handed.
The agreement, however, was only a stopgap arrangement while the I.M.F. and Russia continued working on the major $24 billion aid program that is pegged to extensive economic reforms. Agreement on the terms of the larger aid package is considered critical because it would effectively provide a Western endorsement of Russia's economic direction and so could stimulate private investment.
Even the more moderate conditions to which Russia agreed for the $1 billion loan, however, seemed excessively ambitious at a time the country is facing a precipitous drop in production and an increase in its budget deficit.
According to Aleksei Mozhin, an aide to Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar who is involved in the I.M.F. talks, the Russian Government agreed to bring the budget deficit down from 10 percent to 5 percent by year's end and to reduce the inflation rate from 15 to 10 percent.
Other commitments include higher tariffs to reduce imports; introduction of a system under which expenditures would automatically cease if Government revenues dropped; a ceiling on credit, which was not immediately disclosed; higher interest rates at Government savings banks to attract capital, and the abolition of export quotas, except for energy.
The agreement, however, did not call for the freeing of oil prices, which Mr. Yeltsin has rejected, arguing that in its current condition the nation simply could not survive the consequences.
The Commonwealth summit meeting, which has become a regular exercise since the Soviet Union was dismantled seven months ago, followed the usual pattern of signing a series of organizational agreements but failing to reach agreement on the major issues that have so far prevented the Commonwealth from progressing beyond a loose and powerless umbrella for most of the former Soviet republics.
Among the latter was failure to reach agreement among the four nuclear republics -- Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- on the disposition of strategic nuclear rockets stationed on their soil. The current roadblock reportedly is Ukraine's insistence that it needs seven years to dismantle its nuclear weapons, and its rejection of interim solutions like defusing or removing the nuclear warheads from the missiles.
The major achievement cited by the presidents was an agreement to set up an economic court to settle financial disputes among Commonwealth members. The idea was proposed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who has been one of the strongest advocates in the Commonwealth of a strong economic union.
There was no indication, however, how the court would enforce its decisions on the republics.
Nonetheless, the leaders seemed pleased with the meeting and the attendance. President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan, who was chairman of the session, said, "This shows the Commonwealth is not only still alive but has started to act effectively to solve the most vital questions facing us."
Present at the meeting were the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia. Azerbaijan, whose Parliament never ratified its membership and is not likely to, sent observers, as did Georgia. The three Baltic nations, which were once part of the Soviet Union, have never taken part in the Commonwealth.

HEADLINE: Bush Watches BMW Sign Accord

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 6

 BODY:
Despite his busy schedule here, President Bush took the time today for a photo opportunity to observe the signing of an agreement to build a BMW automobile plant in South Carolina.
The Governor of South Carolina, Carroll A. Campbell Jr., and the BMW chairman, Eberhard von Kuenheim, shared the podium afterward to discuss the deal to build a plant in the Greenville-Spartanburg area and eventually employ 2,000 workers. 
 Asked if BMW was attracted to South Carolina by the promise of cheap labor, Mr. Campbell spoke out against "an effete snobbism from some people in certain parts of the country against the South." But he also noted that "South Carolina is a right-to-work state," meaning workers cannot be compelled to join a union as a condition of employment. BMW has said "they will work with the prevailing wage and that they will obviously be in the upper end of it," the Governor said.
"This particular area is not, as has been depicted, another Mexico," he added. "It is a very, very upscale area. The wages would be competitive there."
Mr. von Kuenheim said the company would save about 25 percent on the cars' manufacturing costs. Preparation of the site for the 1.9-million-square-foot plant is to begin this month, and it is expected to begin producing cars by 1995 for sale in the United States, Asia, Australia and Germany.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Bond Rating Holds Firm

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 6

 BODY:
As indigent kidney dialysis patients worry about where they will get their medicine and state employees wonder which of them are going to lose their jobs, one thing in New Jersey was more certain than it had been: The state's credit rating was affirmed today by Standard & Poor's.
But the bond-rating agency also said the state's long-term financial outlook was poor. 
 Like so much in the politically charged atmosphere in Trenton, how the news was interpreted depended on who was asked.
Republicans say retaining the credit rating shows that the budget they passed last week was fiscally sound; Democrats say the long-term negative outlook shows the spending plan is flawed.
Last year, as a result of budget maneuvering that included the sale of a stretch of highway Interstate 95 from one arm of the state government to another to cover $400 million of a $550 million shortfall, the bond rating from Standard & Poor's slipped a notch, from Aaa to Aa+. It is still among the highest in the nation, which means the state gets the best possible interest rates on the money it borrows.
 
More Immediate Concerns
 But one reason the long term outlook is less favorable is that while the $14.6 billion budget that went into effect last week is technically in balance, it has a relatively minuscule $29 million unappropriated surplus.
About $300 million would be more to the liking of Wall Street.
Some in state government have more immediate concerns about the state's financial picture.
Today, 19 department heads began filing layoff plans with the Department of Personnel. The Republicans say only about one in 30 state employees, some 2,000 out of the 66,000 workforce, mostly well-paid middle managers, need be laid off. The layoffs would be for at least a year and for many employees, permanent. The administration says as many as one in 10 will lose jobs, somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000, in all pay grades.
Just how deep the cuts will be will not be known until Friday, when the layoff plans are compiled, added up and set in motion. "We're trying to keep a threshhold on the anxiety by not speculating" on exactly how many will be laid off, and where the layoffs will come, said Tom Vincz, a spokesman for the Department of Personnel.
All this, according to the Florio administration, means that state parks will have to close earlier in the season than usual and that pollution monitoring and control at the state's beaches will have to be cut back, as will road plowing next winter.
The Republicans describe such scenarios as "scare talk."
 
Court Battle Possible
 Meanwhile, New Jersey budget-makers continue to hope that the Federal Government will bail everybody out with $450 million in Medicaid reimbursements.
When Gov. Jim Florio proposed his budget last January, he included the money, maintaining that it was a sure thing that the Federal Government would honor the state's claim for care provided for indigent patients in its psychiatric hospitals going back to 1989.
He also put into the proposed budget $608 million in expected revenue from the one cent increase in the sales tax the Democrats approved in 1990. The Republicans, who had warned him not to do that, made good on their threat to repeal the tax increase, overriding the Governor's veto.
On June 2, with the sales tax money already repealed and the deadline for a new budget just four weeks away, the hole in the budget opened wider -- to $1 billion. State Treasurer Samuel F. Crane announced that the Federal Government had issued a "preliminary rejection" not only of $380 million in Medicaid reimbursements for the new budget, but also of most of the $70 million that was due for the last half of the fiscal year 1991.
The Republicans made good on their promise to cut a billion dollars out of the Governor's proposed $15.7 spending plan, but to do it they had to cut all sorts of programs.
They slashed the popular $685 million Homestead Rebate program by almost 60 percent, back to $300 million. They also, some say unintentionally, made sharp cuts in medical assistance that, among other things, helps pay for medicine for 1,100 people who get kidney dialysis, 950 others being treated for tuberculosis and 1,600 people with AIDS.
Florio administration officials insist that the state's claim to all, or at least most, of the contested Medicaid money will -- eventually -- be paid, although they may have to go to court to get it.
They turned down a quick settlement that would have provided $126 million right away, since it would have meant giving up any claim to the rest of the $450 million. A court battle could take up to two years.

HEADLINE: A Blip or a Dip?;
The Candidates and the Unemployed Both Have a Big Stake in the Answer

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
For millions of Americans looking for work -- and for this year's Presidential candidates -- the surge in unemployment in June poses a big question: Is the economy's new weakness a blip or a dip?
Last Thursday's jobless report, which showed the unemployment rate jumping to 7.8 percent, led many economists to adopt more pessimistic forecasts. And while most economists still doubt that the economy will slow to near zero for the third time in two years, some economists are now saying there is a 50-50 chance of a triple dip, even with the Federal Reserve's decision to lower short-term interest rates. 
 "With the drop in employment in June, it's hard to see how we can sustain an economic recovery," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist for C. J. Lawrence & Company, a New York investment firm. "I'd say it could go either way in the third quarter -- there could be modest growth or the economy could be flat."
If Mr. Yardeni and his more pessimistic colleagues are right, President Bush, already perilously low in opinion polls, could lose several crucial percentage points in the November balloting.
"The Bush campaign should be very nervous about the economy," said Ray C. Fair, a Yale University economist, whose studies show that incumbent Presidents run into trouble if they do not enjoy strong growth in the six months before Election Day.
Even the more optimistic economy watchers are not predicting much strength.
Kurt Karl, an economist at the WEFA Group, a forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., says the economy may narrowly skirt a triple dip thanks to new-found strength in the auto industry. With the recent weakening in consumer spending and home building, "overall industrial production will be pushed up by production of auto and light trucks," he said. "But if the auto industry gets nervous and starts winding down, then there will be a triple dip."
He puts the probability of a triple dip at 30 percent, up from his forecast of 20 percent before last Thursday's jobless report.
"I think the economy will manage to avoid a triple dip, but it is still going to be a struggle," said Robert G. Dederick, a former Reagan Administration economist who is chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "At best, the economy will be at the edge of what might be called satisfactory."
In recent months, the Bush Administration has boasted about the respectable 2.7 percent growth in the first quarter, but the recovery appears to have slowed since then. It is weighed down by a myriad of factors that have not held back the nation after other recessions: large household debt burdens that dampen consumer spending, cuts in the military budget that are causing large-scale layoffs, and the failure of many companies to add workers as they increase output.
Administration officials insist that the economy is continuing to grow despite June's bad unemployment numbers. In a news conference today in Munich, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady noted that growth was 2.7 percent in the first quarter. "I am not going to speculate on what it's going to be in the second quarter," he said. "Let's assume it's less than that. I think during the rest of the year it will pick up to such an extent so that it will be around the 2.5 to 3 percent that we forecast."
The main reason the recovery seems unable to gather steam, many analysts say, is that employment has remained flat for a year, which denies households the added income needed to push the economy forward, and wage gains have been very sluggish as well. In June, nonfarm payroll employment, seasonally adjusted, fell an unexpected 117,000 to 89,769,000. That was down 65,000 from June 1991.
The economy is like a jet plane that seems unable to get up enough speed to take off, Mr. Yardeni says. Every time it begins lumbering down the runway and starts to take off, it seems to go up a few feet before unexpectedly bouncing down again because of a lack of acceleration.
Mr. Yardeni said the nation would be lucky if "we get 1 to 1.5 percent growth in the second quarter." He is predicting 2 percent growth in the second half. But, he said, "I have my finger on the trigger" to lower that forecast if there are a few more negative economic reports. On Thursday, he raised his forecast of the probability of a triple dip to 50 percent, up from 25 percent previously.
Late last year the economy experienced what is generally called a double dip, because growth slowed markedly after the recession -- the first dip -- that occurred in the second half of 1990. The economic pickup in the first half of 1991 was aborted later that year when consumer confidence mysteriously evaporated and consumer spending slid badly, pulling industrial production down with it.
 
'Stupid Stop-Go Stuff'
 "The reason we have this stupid stop-go, stop-go stuff is we have cyclical forces that are starting to turn around, but they are running into a long-term adjustment, and that's tough" said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University.
He said a full-fledged recovery was also being held back by past overbuilding in commercial construction and by demographic changes that mean there are fewer young people buying cars, furniture and houses. But he said that households were reducing their debt burdens and the construction overhang was declining, paving the way to a stronger upturn eventually.
Some economists questioned the accuracy of June's jump in unemployment because it was so much more negative than other recent reports. Some of them say that the employment report was done a few days earlier in June than many other June jobless reports and that as a result it may have overcounted the number of unemployed students and undercounted the number of payroll jobs because the survey was done slightly before employers added their normal contingent of students.
"Given the fact that June could be either a statistical distortion or the beginning of a triple dip, it's a 50-50 call whether it's the beginning of a new dip," Mr. Ratajczak said. His best forecast, he said, is that the economy will grow by a modest 2 percent in the second half of this year, rising to 3 percent early next year.
There are predictions that the jobless rate could fall substantially in July because students who entered the work force to find jobs might quickly give up their searches and thus will no longer be counted as unemployed. But some others predict that joblessness could continue to rise, because June's dismal job report could push down consumer confidence, which could in turn cause companies to scale back on their production and employment plans.
The hope was that the first quarter's momentum would insure a strong second quarter, but that failed to happen. One reason was that the first quarter apparently borrowed a lot of construction and consumption that would have taken place in the second quarter. Another reason was that the first quarter's job gains were too modest to generate significant gains in personal income. All this meant that the 5 percent jump in personal consumption in the first quarter could not be sustained.
"When you get ahead of yourself, then you're going to run into a period of stagnation and in June things came home to roost," said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist for DRI/McGraw Hill, a consulting firm.

Graph: "If This Is a Recovery, Where Are the Jobs?"
 In past cycles, total employment grew sharply after the deepest point of the recession. If the current cycle hit bottom in March 1991, as some economists think, then to follow the pattern, jobs ought to be rebounding now. The fact that they are not suggests another trough is still to come.

HEADLINE: Benefits of an Unwelcome Trend;
Growing Prison Population Lifts Economy for Some Towns

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
The business of imprisonment is so recession-proof that the New York State Corrections Commissioner, Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, has a dozen upstate communities eagerly requesting some instant economy from a man who, after 13 years of tenure, expects to see the state prison population triple.
Applicant townships wanting in on one of the state's more redoubtable growth industries say one of Mr. Coughlin's trademark 750-bed medium-security prisons will do, its construction now perfected into a 10-month state-of-the-art package, or perhaps his 500-cell maximum security prototype, easily adapted to the cow pastures of upstate New York. "It's a type of industry offering 400 to 500 new jobs, no pollution, and not here today, gone tomorrow," said the Portland Town Supervisor, Harold H. Smith, one of Mr. Coughlin's prison suitors. 
 In such a keeper's market, the 54-year-old commissioner retains his sense of irony and counts his caged and barracks-secured inmates -- this week more than 60,000, a new high -- as society's mixed curse and cure.
It is a population that continues to rise 5 percent annually yet need not, said Mr. Coughlin, who suggests that up to a third of the inmates, mostly small-scale drug addicts and dealers, might be better served on the outside in work and drug rehabilitation programs, at considerable savings to the taxpayers.
"A large portion would," he said, estimating that number at easily 5,000 inmates. "These are not your kingpins," he added, barely masking his bemusement at the anomalies of the criminal justice system, an overworked catch basin.
"Many of these guys are in and out real quick," said the commissioner, speaking of the fact that while the inmate population has boomed here and across the nation in a decade of law-and-order crackdowns, record prison construction and tough new mandated sentences, the average prison term has dropped 25 percent in New York, to 21 months.
While the state system now has more violent-crime convicts doing long terms, it also has something of a commuter-like subgroup, with a turnover of 22,000 a year, most of them nonviolent criminals busily cycling through the drug culture and facing a recidivism rate of 40 percent.
"They come in to get healthy, get their teeth done, get some good meals and they're out the door," said Mr. Coughlin, rated one of the nation's more able commissioners.
As master of a mushrooming system that includes 14 maximum-security prisons, Mr. Coughlin's credentials are rooted in a mix of crime and compassion. He quit the state police 20 years ago to pursue an avocation in community organizing in Jefferson County for mentally retarded children, a cause brought home to him by the dearth of available services and by one of his three daughters who is retarded. Eventually Gov. Hugh L. Carey chose him commissioner of a new Office of Mental Retardation, then moved him to the prison system in recognition of his knack for trouble-shooting within bureaucracies.
 
Younger, Better-Trained Staff
 The system seems less dangerously crowded than in the prison-scandal days of the 1970's and is run by a younger, better-paid and -trained staff that has grown from 7,000 prison guards to 18,000 in his tenure. Inmates are kept less idle than in the past, with thousands of convicts allowed out each day to clean up cemeteries and churches upstate. Soon, inmate crews will be working along the state Thruway for the first time. The system has trained inmates in asbestos removal in the prisons, providing them with a well-paid, if risky speciality once they are released.
But these are minor aspects of a population secured across 68 prisons at an occupancy rate that still reflects overcrowding -- 124 percent of capacity -- after a binge of construction, a doubling of prison buildings in the past 10 years. The state has built $5 billion worth of prisons in this time, often resorting to Urban Development Corporation financing that, critics note, was originally envisioned for housing poor people in new city apartments, not in new prisons.
But the convicts keep coming and the prisons wind up with seven more inmates in each day's turnover. Commissioner Coughlin concedes he will soon need fresh space after a two-year building moratorium because of tight budgets. This will come either in new prisons or the remodeled mental hospitals he lately prefers. As the system keeps growing, it continues to be criticized as a gross waste of money by such critics as Robert Gangi, the executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, the chief private watchdog agency.
"State policy makers have not gotten control of the situation," Mr. Gangi said. He is calling for an overhaul of the criminal justice system's heavy reliance on mandated drug sentences, which results in filled the prisons. This change, with its restoration of greater leeway to sentencing judges, is one with which Mr. Coughlin does not quarrel but which he estimates is as politically explosive as the unending debate over restoring the state's death penalty.
"It's simply wrong to have to spend so much money on prisons," Mr. Gangi said of the state's $1.2 billion correction budget, which has grown five-fold since 1980 with money Mr. Gangi thinks would largely be better invested in alternative correction methods like work release and home detention and in drug treatment and other social programs.
"My criticism is not of Tom Coughlin; he's the gatekeeper and has to find room for these guys," said Mr. Gangi, who thinks well of the commissioner under the circumstances, especially in enlisting Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in the effort to repeal mandated sentences for low-level second-felony offenders.
 
Better Off on Outside?
 Critics, including the commissioner, say this has been an easy conviction device for anti-narcotic police who sweep the urban drug culture and imprison thousands at a cost of $25,000 a year per inmate. Commissioner Coughlin, sensing opportunity in the state fiscal hardships of the past few years, has pursued some of the alternatives to incarceration that reformers have advocated. Work release and other part-time prison programs are to double in size this year to 6,000 convict participants.
Chief among Mr. Coughlin's own hopes in this area is his plan to release low-level inmates up to 18 months early as reward for completing an intensive, six-month drug rehabilitation program in prison. If it succeeds the way he wants, Mr. Coughlin says he would see 1,200 inmates rewarded this year with early freedom and he would have a track record to show balky state legislators in lobbying for greater alternatives to costly prison time -- in this case, $80 million worth of prison cells plus $30 million in annual overhead.
"When you run short of money somebody's philosophy has to be compromised somewhat," said the commissioner, who argues that hard fiscal times provide the best opportunity for reformers to turn back the huge growth in the warehousing approaches of the 1980's. In that decade, the national prison population increased by 130 percent and is expected to fully triple by 1994 when it tops the one million inmate mark, the highest incarceration rate of any industrialized nation.
As he wonders whether up to a third of his inmates -- the drug culture convicts -- might be better off outside prison, Mr. Coughlin still estimates that society is better served with most of the other 40,000 behind bars. Critics differ sharply, but these convicts, by Mr. Coughlin's accounting, constitute a full doubling of violent-crime offenders in the time since he took office, on Aug. 1, 1979.
"Perception of safety is a difficult thing on the streets, but there are probably fewer armed robbers around today than a few years ago," he contended.
Mr. Coughlin, a long-term survivor in a national incarceration industry that spends $20 billion annually, counts as his greatest failure his inability to get a new prison built in or near New York City. Pressures from neighborhood communities overwhelm the visitation needs of inmate families, he said. "This is why we build upstate," he said.
His greatest motivation seems to be the notorious, bloody Attica prison uprising of 1971 and the long shadow it continues to cast.
"It's always there, unspoken of a lot of times, but all prison policy from '71 till today flows from that and I think that's good," he said. Mr. Coughlin keeps Attica as his reminder that in running the teeming, imperfect prison network as it grows across the state, he basically is in "the business of calculated risks."

HEADLINE: Watchdog Group Assails Pace of Reorganization

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
An independent group that monitors New York City's finances contends that Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council have failed to make good on promises to fundamentally reorganize the city government and reduce its size.
In letters to the Mayor and the Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, the watchdog group, the Citizens Budget Commission, said the city budget for the fiscal year that began last week did not deliver on many of the pledges made earlier by the Mayor and Council to overhaul municipal government. 
 Raymond D. Horton, the president of the budget commission, a nonprofit organization financed by businesses, said in the letters that both city officials had promised to streamline local government, in light of the impact of the severe recession on city tax revenue.
"But your actions belie your words," Mr. Horton wrote. "The 1993 budget turns its back on these sound principles. It seeks to maintain an unsustainable status quo to the detriment of the public. New Yorkers will continue to pay dearly -- in reduced services and higher taxes -- to sustain the current system."
 
Missed Opportunities
 Mr. Horton argued in the letters, which were sent last week, that the city had missed many significant opportunities. Among them, he said, were reducing further the number of city workers, consolidating city agencies, changing a property-tax system that he contended favored single-family homeowners over apartment dwellers, revising rent regulations that sometimes enable wealthy New Yorkers to pay below-market rents, changing cumbersome and unproductive work rules, and creating a smaller, better-paid municipal work force.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said in an interview yesterday that the Dinkins administration remained committed to pledges made in budget proposals to reshape the government. He cited several examples of goals already achieved, including a consolidation of agencies involved in economic development, an increase in the number of city-owned apartment buildings sold to private and nonprofit owners and a proposal to sell the Offtrack Betting Corporation.
"I would disagree that we aren't pursuing reorganization," Mr. Steisel said. "We have a series of reforms that we are pursuing."
He also said that the administration was currently negotiating new contracts with unions representing municipal workers, and that it would grant wage increases only if they were tied to productivity gains.
Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone, said the outcome of the labor talks will have a large role in determining how much the government is reshaped. "We're still hopeful that many of the structural reforms that we and others have called for will go forward," Mr. Clendenin said.
 
Seeking 'Structural Balance'
 Mr. Horton said in his letters that the Mayor and the Council had not yet done enough to achieve what fiscal experts call "structural balance," a concept that promotes a more stable long-term relationship between the size of the city government and the size of the local economy on which it depends.
Mr. Horton said he was disappointed with the budget for the new fiscal year because it included few changes that would alter the structure of city government.
He noted, for example, that the city planned to increase slightly the size of its work force over the next 12 months, despite a pledge last year to eliminate 16,500 jobs over four years. Mr. Steisel acknowledged that there would be an increase, but he said it was primarily to add more teachers, in response to a surge in the number of students, more civilians in the Police Department and more sanitation workers for recycling.
But the city eliminated 11,000 workers during the last year, city budget officials said. And Mr. Steisel maintained that the administration was still determined to reach the long-term job goals.

HEADLINE: Five-Alarm Fire Destroys Half-Block of Bronx Businesses

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
A raging five-alarm fire of suspicious origin destroyed half a block of small businesses on a busy thoroughfare in the Bronx yesterday afternoon, and while no one was killed or seriously injured, the loss was a heavy blow to a struggling, working-class community.
Eighteen firefighters suffered cuts, bruises, heat exhaustion and other minor injuries in the blaze, which broke out in a loft and spread rapidly. It burned out of control for nearly three hours and gutted much of the south side of East Tremont Avenue between Webster and Park Avenues in the Tremont section. 
 The major casualties were seven small stores, most of them family-owned and decades old, of a kind found in any local neighborhood in New York: a furniture store, an electronics shop, a restaurant, a hardware store, a discount liquor outlet, a fast-food shop and a less common establishment that makes blueprints.
 
Community Stability
 "Those stores are the lifeblood of a community," said Clint Roswell, a spokesman for the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer. "They keep people working. They pay the rent. They make a community stable and determine its character. When you lose seven stores, certainly it has a tremendous impact on the community, culturally as well as economically."
Frank McCabe, a Fire Department spokesman, agreed. "I've lived in the city all my life, and I know what a fire like this can do to a community," he said. "The Bronx is coming back, but something like this can be devastating."
He said the fire broke out at 12:40 P.M. in a "taxpayer," a one-and-one-half-story structure of a kind commonly erected a half-century ago, with stores on the ground floor and a common loft for storage above them.
When the first of 200 firefighters arrived, they found flames engulfing the Tremont and Webster Hardware store at 412 East Tremont, and the fire spread rapidly on either side to stores at Nos. 400, 406, 414, 418, 420 and 422.
Fire marshals said the extent and speed of the fire made it suspicious, and they said they would investigate for possible arson. All the stores were open, and owners, employees and customers ran out, escaping injury. Hundreds of people watched firefighters battle the stubborn blaze, which was brought under control at 3:30 P.M.
 
Series of Setbacks
 As firefighters gathered up hoses later, a group of store owners on the block gathered outside and somberly surveyed the wreckage of collapsed roofs, blackened timbers, shattered glass and smoking ashes that had been furnishings, electronic equipment, liquor stocks and other products.
Some said yesterday's fire was only the latest blow in a neighborhood that had suffered recent reverses. Last year another fire destroyed a row of four stores across the street, leaving a garbage-strewn lot. And, they said, a bank at the corner of East Tremont and Park Avenues failed and is still shuttered.
But they also said that the Tremont area -- whose residents include blacks, whites and Hispanic people, many of them working-class immigrants from Latin America -- was a relatively stable community in a borough with many troubled neighborhoods. Most of the stores that burned yesterday were part of that stability: at least three had been in business for more than 30 years.
 
'I Hope to Rebuild'
 Stanley Bell, the owner of Belco Electronics, which sold two-way radio equipment for taxicabs among other items at No. 418, said his family had been in business at the same location for 40 years, and he said he did not know if insurance would cover his losses.
"I've worked in the Bronx all my life and I hope to rebuild," he said. He said, however, that it would be useless to rebuild if other businesses on the block did not do so as well. "If they don't, I don't think I want to," he said. "It would be bad to be in business with eyesores next to me."
Joseph Armato, speaking for Benny Berkowitz, who owns four of the burned storefronts, said his client's properties were insured and would be rebuilt. And Moses Stein, the owner of Frank's, a clothing store at the corner that was untouched by the flames and that he said had been in his family for 70 years, spoke of hope for the gutted block.
"This is the most stable retail block in the Bronx," he said. "I'm sure I will be here as long as I'm alive."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher again yesterday in the first trading session following the latest round of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
Even though yields on short-term bills and notes have fallen to exceptionally low levels, dealers said demand was especially strong for short- to-intermediate-term issues. Bond prices also moved higher yesterday, but by more modest amounts. 
 "There is buying going on for maturities of seven years or less," one government securities trader said. "At the moment the whole trade is in the front end."
Traders and analysts said the impulse to purchase shorter-term issues reflected confusion among investors about the current state of the economy as well as a reluctance to conclude that interest rates might be in the midst of a secular downward cycle.
"In the 1950's and 1960's, when you did a back-of-the-envelope calculation on rates, it started at 5 percent," said Neil M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation.
"In the late 1970's and 1980's, the rate was 10 percent, because that was representative. A lot of people are still caught in that world, even though the place to start that calculation is once again much closer to 5 percent."
Extremely weak June employment data released last week have compounded the problem, analysts said.
The numbers were uniformly bad, but may have overstated just how poor conditions are.
"It is probably a little early to start focusing on the next set of employment numbers, but I think we will probably see a nice rebound when the July figures are reported in early August," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
 
Weakness in Employment Data
 The weakness in the employment data stood in stark contrast to very strong auto sales reported yesterday for the final 10 days of June.
According to car makers, a seasonally adjusted 7.5 million units were sold during that period, up from 6.5 million in the middle of the month.
Traders chose to view the report in the context of the weak June employment data released last Thursday. The big jump in the unemployment rate and the decline in nonfarm payroll employment make it unlikely that car sales will remain brisk, analysts said.
After the employment report, "the car sales numbers make you wonder if you are in the same country," said Jay Goldinger, a principal at Capital Insight, a bond brokerage firm in Beverly Hills, Calif. "Debt market participants are confused. And when that is the case you stay in short-term securities."
The lowest yields in two to nearly three decades did have an impact at yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills, as non-competitive tenders for the securities fell fairly sharply.
Such bids are usually seen as a good proxy of small investor demand for securities.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.23 percent, down sharply from the average rate of 3.59 percent at last week's auction.
It is the lowest rate on a three-month bill since the auction of February 18, 1972, when the rate was 3.14 percent.
Bids for the new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 3.32 percent, down from an average of 3.66 percent at the auction a week ago.
It is the lowest rate on a new six-month bill since those securities were sold on July 8, 1963, at an average rate of 3.27 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 15/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.61 percent, compared with 7.62 percent late Thursday.
 
Outstanding Treasury Issues
 Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 11/32, up 1/4 point, to yield 6.88 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 2/32, up 7/32, to yield 4.43 percent.
As expected, the latest drop in interest rates prompted a number of corporations to price new debt securities.
Among the issuers was the Shell Oil Company, which offered $250 million worth of seven-year noncallable notes through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The 6 5/8 percent notes were priced at $99.859, to yield 6.65 percent, a scant 18 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Bell Telephone Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bell Atlantic Corporation, offered $150 million of 15-year securities through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 7 3/8 percent noncallable notes were priced at $99.338, to yield 7.449 percent, 55 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AA-1 by Moody's and AA by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, demand for outstanding issues remained firm, traders said. Prices of widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: This Road to New Rochelle Begins in the Hills of Mexico

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y., July 6

 BODY:
It is 2,800 miles from the peasant mountain communities of Cotija, Quitupan and Jiquilpan in Mexico to the cracked sidewalks of Union Avenue here, but hundreds of Mexicans have found a direct route.
Their way is paved by Antonio Valencia, a housekeeper known affectionately as el padrino, the godfather, for his role in finding jobs, housing and a new life for immigrants who have followed him from Mexico. 
 "The reason they come is because Antonio came," said Juan Sandoval, a 41-year-old merchant whose food market and liquor store on Union Avenue bustles mostly with Mexican customers. "All they need is somebody to know. You need somebody to support you. We are all following the leader."
 
Coming to America
 Every community in America has its own tale of ethnic populations taking root and flourishing. In New Rochelle, the story begins with the 69-year-old Mr. Valencia, who arrived in 1954, alone and speaking not a word of English, to serve as live-in housekeeper for George Vergara, a former mayor, and his wife, Allys.
This city of 67,000 people has seen a surge of growth in its Hispanic population, largely Mexican, which nearly doubled to 7,200 in the last decade. Unlike other parts of the New York region where Mexicans come mainly from the Puebla region east of Mexico City, in New Rochelle most Mexicans are from the tight cluster of towns in the central-western region where Mr. Valencia grew up.
While it is hard to say just how many people Mr. Valencia has shepherded out of hardscrabble existences in rural Mexico, he is credited with improving the lives of thousands of Mexicans.
 
'More Than an Ambassador'
 "He's more than an ambassador," said Manuel Alonso, Mexico's consul general for the New York region. "He's a patriarch of Mexico."
On the streets of New Rochelle, Mr. Valencia is called el padrino not in the strong-arm sense of movie fiction but because he is indeed related to many Mexicans and because of his open-ended generosity, said George Castellanos, the Hispanic liaison for the New Rochelle schools. "He's here taking care of us, that's really what he is doing," Mr. Castellanos said.
The city's Mayor, Timothy C. Idoni, said that Mr. Valencia lets city officials know about the concerns and grievances of Mexicans as well as other Hispanic residents. "He's not shy about calling," Mr. Idoni said.
At a recent meeting, Mr. Valencia talked with the Mayor about the need for the appointment of more Hispanic residents to local civic committees and for expanded police protection for the west side of New Rochelle, a lower-income area where many Hispanic residents live.
"He's very concerned for his people," said the Mayor. "He exemplifies what the city of New Rochelle needs in leadership."
Mr. Valencia also serves as a link between the police and Mexicans, some of whom complain bitterly on the streets that the police harass them.
"He's an excellent liaison between the police and Mexican people," said one detective, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Mr. Valencia, when the Mexicans get in trouble, helps with the language barrier. The police in Mexico have a bad reputation and they fear working with police. He tries to overcome that."
 
A Chance Encounter
 Such tributes seem to bewilder Mr. Valencia, whose journey to New Rochelle began in Mexico City 38 years ago while he was eavesdropping in the rectory of a Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Valencia, who was then a delivery man, overheard a glamorous American couple tell a priest that they were looking for a "houseman" to bring back to America.
Mr. Valencia stepped up to offer his services. He has lived ever since in the stately Vergara home where he serves cold drinks to guests on a silver platter and occasionally chauffeurs Mrs. Vergara, now an elderly widow, in her white Ford.
"It was always my dream to help people," said Mr. Valencia, who had studied for the priesthood in Mexico before abandoning it to care for an ailing father.
His early days here, as one of the city's first Mexican residents, were the hardest. "I was tempted to go back to Mexico many times because I was so lonesome here," he said. "But there was something that made me stay here, the opportunity to help my people."
One legacy of his efforts began to unfold in 1956 when Mr. Valencia summoned two brothers, Jose and Salvador Sandoval, from the corn and beanfields they farmed by a lake in Quitupan. Mr. Valencia arranged for their permanent residency through a nursing home proprietor who was a friend of his employers. The nursing home owner acted as the Sandovals' immigration sponsor and took them in as cleaning help.
 
A Tradition of Helping
 Since then, the Sandoval family has in turn brought hundreds of other Mexicans, including relatives and friends, to New Rochelle. "Mr. Valencia is the beginner of everybody," said Arnoldo Sandoval, a 29-year-old construction worker whose father, Jose, died two years ago.
Leonides Sandoval, Arnoldo's 34-year-old brother, was too young to know Mr. Valencia in Mexico but he knew of his accomplishments. He learned to read and write at a primary school in Quitupan that Mr. Valencia helped build with money raised from bridge card parties and dances in New Rochelle.
Ten years ago, he brought his wife, his three school-age children and several relatives from Mexico. He now owns a house and has a successful dental practice that serves a large Spanish-speaking clientele, including Mr. Valencia.
"I think most everybody either directly or indirectly has been influenced by him being here," said Mr. Sandoval. "It's just unbelievable. You name it, he helps these people. He brings them to doctors. He gets them out of court."
The dentist said he was eager to follow in Mr. Valencia's footsteps.
"There's a tremendous amount of roots being established," Mr. Sandoval said. "We're buying property like anybody else who wants to stay. Now if Mr. Valencia is not around, he has somehow helped somebody to be in a position to help someone else."
 
Harder to Find Work
 Through Mr. Valencia's efforts, Mexicans in New Rochelle have found work primarily as laborers in construction, gardening and country clubs throughout Westchester County. But tougher immigration laws and the recession have made it difficult for Mr. Valencia and most anyone else to arrange permanent residency and employment for new arrivals.
"Years ago, the managers used to call me from all over the place to see if I knew anybody who needs a job," Mr. Valencia said. "Now it's the opposite. I'm the one who has to call to see if they have any jobs available. It is very difficult for jobs now."
Every year, Mexican immigrants come to New Rochelle. City officials said they had no figures on how many arrive legally versus illegally. Regardless of their legal status, many of these new immigrants find their way to New Rochelle with only hope and a slip of paper bearing Mr. Valencia's name.
"They come here and call him every day," said Juan Sandoval, the owner of La Morelenses grocery on Union Avenue. On a recent afternoon, the store's backroom bar was filled with Mexicans nursing longneck beers and listening to nostalgic Spanish music.
"They have no place to go," said Mr. Sandoval. "Many can't get jobs. We treat them for free when they don't have the money to buy. It's sad. We all come from the same region. We're connected somehow."
These days, Mr. Valencia said his main obligation was caring for Mrs. Vergara, cooking meals for her and sometimes driving her to daily Mass. "There's no one like him in the world," Mrs. Vergara said.
Mr. Valencia would like to be remembered as an ordinary man trying to do good. "That's my only dream in life," he said. But on a recent Saturday afternoon, the guest list of a luncheon that he had organized was testimony to his influence.
There was Jorge Montano, the Mexican Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Alonso, the Consul General for the New York area, Mayor Idoni, local civic leaders and several guests from the villages where Mr. Valencia was raised.
"We have a great deal of respect for what he does," said Mr. Montano. "You don't find that many people nowadays who are so generous but not looking for any benefit."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Light Trading; Summit Results Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved lower in light dealings yesterday, with traders awaiting concrete announcements from the economic summit meeting in Germany. Gold prices rose.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery was unchanged from Thursday's levels at $346.50 a troy ounce. A late bid from the Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $346.40, up 15 cents. Metals markets were closed Friday in observance of the Independence Day holiday. 
 Currency traders said trading in the dollar was lackluster throughout the day. Traders were still digesting the June unemployment report, released last week, and awaited announcements from the Group of Seven meeting in Munich, said David Ogg, vice president at Credit Suisse.
On Thursday, the Labor Department reported the nation's unemployment rate jumped to 7.8 percent, an unexpectedly sharp increase. The Federal Reserve later responded by cutting interest rates, a move that tends to weaken the dollar overseas.
There was little in the way of substantial economic news for currency traders coming from the annual economic summit meeting of seven industrial countries.
One currency trader said most dealers are waiting for tomorrow, when the countries issue a communique that outlines their agreements, and perhaps makes some statement on foreign currency levels.
In other developments, United States auto makers showed improved sales for late June, but the reports did not have much of an effect on the market, Mr. Ogg said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.98 yen, up 0.73 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 124.55 yen. At closing in New York, the dollar was trading at 124.35 yen, down from 124.75 late Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9105, from $1.9080 late Friday. At closing in New York, the pound was trading at $1.9105, more expensive than $1.9080 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.51325 marks, down from 1.5180; 1.3545 Swiss francs, down from 1.3590; 5.0980 French francs, down from 5.1060; 1,145.25 Italian lire, down from 1,150.25, and 1.20055 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20265.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $346.65 a troy ounce, from $345.70 bid late Friday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $346.65, from $345.70 bid late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold rose 44 cents to close at a bid $346.29.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Helping Retirees Sort Out Drugs

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
IN an effort to contain costs while also looking out for their retired employees' health, many companies are trying to dissuade their retirees from buying assortments of prescription drugs that can interact in harmful ways. Prescription drugs are among the fastest-growing health costs for many employers, especially companies with many retirees, who often consume pills at an alarming rate.
Americans over age 65 spent about $11 billion on prescriptions and $5 billion more on over-the-counter drugs last year, according to Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Minnesota. 
 Retirees probably take twice as many medications as active employees, said Jack Dunn, a Ford Motor Company benefits superviser. Ford spent $130 million last year on prescriptions, just for employees and retirees in traditional health plans. The total did not include the 60 percent of Ford's salaried employees and the 37 percent of the company's hourly workers in health maintenance organizations and other medical networks.
Dr. Loren Lipson, an associate professor of medicine, gerontology and clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California, said that 20 percent of his patients "have some problem with medication."
These include bad reactions to combinations that include drugs prescribed by separate doctors who have not compared notes, low-priced generic versions of drugs that do not always match the brand-name prototype and heavily advertised drugstore remedies. Another big problem is patients who disregard or forget to take their medicines.
Southern California Edison, which spent $33 million for health care for 9,000 retirees and spouses in 1991, is experimenting with a special counseling program. "We send participants a bag and say, 'Bring in all your prescription and over-the-counter medication,' " said Lourdes Birba, the program superviser.
The 230 participants receive a free annual checkup and immunizations against influenza, tetanus and pneumonia. A geriatrics specialist asks about ailments and side effects and discards outdated prescriptions. A pharmacist rechecks for inappropriate combinations.
Ms. Birba said the program had already resulted in a noticeable improvement in patients' taking medications as prescribed.
Dr. Jonathan T. Edelson, a senior vice president of ValueRx, a unit of the managed-care services company Value Health Inc., says many drugs are used improperly. He cites studies showing that 30 percent of ulcer medications -- a major drug expense for many employers -- are "inappropriately prescribed and used."
Prices often vary widely for similar products. People with arthritis pain who take ibuprofen have a choice of 16 varieties, Dr. Edelson said, "but no one product has been documented to be more effective than any other as first-line therapy."
The USX Corportion recently changed a drug program covering 22,000 employees and their families and 75,000 retirees and spouses. Jim Carney, vice president of the United States Steel and Carnegie Pension Fund, said retirees were encouraged to mail-order "maintenance drugs" for chronic diseases, purchasing them in 30-to-90-day quantities. He said that the program provided "computerized screening that looks at the patient's entire drug history."
The Central and South West Corporation, a utility holding company in Dallas, is also starting a combination mail-order and retail pharmacy network that will generate computerized medical profiles, particularly for the elderly. Tom Hare, director of human resources at the company's Central and Southwest Services unit, said drugs had been "about 37 percent of our total medical plan costs," which were $39 million for 12,000 employees, retirees and dependents.
A number of large companies are considering similar programs. Gary Simko, a benefits planning manager at the Bell Atlantic Corporation, said, "We're trying to come up with a mechanism that will manage those costs and provide a value added: quality."
Bell Atlantic spent $179.5 million on retiree health benefits in 1990. After changing its accounting to reflect the cost of medical coverage promised to retirees in the future, the company reported $252.9 million in retiree health costs for 1991.
Not all retiree drug programs are effective, some experts caution.
"For all the money we pay, the elderly don't get very good health care," said Patricia Wilson, a principal with the A. Foster Higgins benefits consulting firm. Managed-care firms are beginning to "collect patient profiles" showing what drugs have been purchased, she said, "but some are just marketing hype."
Employers need more information on the effects that drugs have on the elderly, she added. "Geriatrics is in its infancy. Geriatric pharmacology is embryonic."

HEADLINE: Physicists Struggle To Save Supercollider From Budgetary Ax

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
A STUNNING vote by the House of Representatives to scuttle construction of the $8.25-billion Superconducting Supercollider poses the biggest threat the huge particle accelerator has faced in its 10-year gestation, and has sparked a desperate struggle by supporters to keep the project alive.
If the supercollider should now die, supporters believe, the chance to discover the cosmic origin of whatever it is that endows objects with mass could be lost for at least a generation. A team of some 2,000 scientists assembled and carefully tuned for their roles in the supercollider venture would be scattered at enormous cost, and to the regret of many scientists. 
 But the regret would be by no means universal. To the supercollider's opponents like Representative Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, the death of "one of the hungriest hogs at the Federal trough" would be no loss.
A vote by the Senate late this month or in August to deprive the project of financing would be a fatal blow. American taxpayers would incur more than $1 billion to wind down the work, with little to show for it but the dozen enormous superconducting magnets completed so far and some cavernous excavations at the supercollider's site in Waxahachie, Tex.
Senator Dale Bumpers, Democrat of Arkansas, one of the project's main political foes, said he believed his side had picked up votes -- perhaps enough to win. In this election year, politicians say voters may object to big Federal programs that do not directly benefit the economy.
High-energy physicists were dismayed by the House vote on June 17, and many have sent or signed letters to United States officials urging continued support of the supercollider. Some of America's preeminent scientists, including 17 winners of Nobel prizes, wrote to President Bush, warning that cancellation would have a "destructive effect" on the entire United States scientific enterprise and raise questions about America's "ability to carry out long-term scientific projects."
Even a potential rival of the supercollider team, the European high-energy physics consortium, known as CERN, expressed the hope that "this vote will be reversed lest it create an alarming vacuum in an important field of scientific research." Rebutting critics who say the supercollider's hoped for discoveries will substantially overlap those of a new machine planned by CERN called the Large Hadron Collider, the CERN statement said the two machines would be complementary.
Supporters of the supercollider were also taken aback by the House's 231-182 vote against their machine, because it showed a sharp shift from the support it received last year. Perhaps too hopefully, they interpret the change as a vote not against big science projects but rather as reflecting a desire of other members of Congress to punish the Texas delegation for reasons having nothing to do with the supercollider.
 
Threat to Japanese Share
 Whatever the reasons for the House vote, the supercollider supporters fear that it may undermine Japan's willingness to share a major part of the project's expenses, as Congress has required it to do within the next year. Without Japanese support, the project will simply die, according to Dr. Roy F. Schwitters, director of the supercollider project. "We have to proceed as if Japan's participation were assured," he said. "We can't wait around worrying about something over which we have no control."
Opponents argue the Supercollider has already doubled in cost and may exceed the $8.25 billion now estimated. But Dr. Schwitters asserts that the technical uncertainties behind the increased cost have been overcome. "We expect to stay within budget from now on," he said.
Many physicists who work in fields other than high-energy research oppose the supercollider, chiefly from fear it will eventually rob funds from their research, whether directly or indirectly.
This fear became so intense that in 1988 the American Physical Society, whose membership includes most American physicists, was nearly split apart. Dr. James A. Krumhansl, president of the society at the time, succeeded in averting fission but said later: "In physics today there are 18 identifiable subfields, and in the American Physical Society there are 40,000 members. Particle physics cannot make an impact on most other areas of physics, chemistry, biology, electronics or other sciences, except astrophysics and cosmology.
 
Fears of Exaggeration
 "In the view of many A.P.S. members," he said, "the extravagant representation of the potential fruits from the supercollider was fictitious and ethically irresponsible."
But to particle physicists interested in pure science rather than potential technological spinoffs or economic and political benefits, the supercollider has a special quality. It is seen as a kind of Philosopher's Stone, a key to at least partial understanding of the ultimate basis of existence.
The machine would create bunches of proton particles and spin them in opposite directions around an oval underground ring 54 miles in circumference. Protons accelerated close to light speed would collide at combined energies of up to 40 trillion electronvolts, 20 times as high as the energies achieved at the Fermilab Tevatron in Illinois, the most powerful existing proton accelerator.
When two protons collide at supercollider energies, a tiny fireball of pure energy results, as intense as that after the Big Bang when the universe was only one-trillionth of a second old.
 
Energy Into Mass
 Some of the energy in this microscopic fireball is transformed into matter according to Einstein's famous equation E=mc<2>, and a zoo of different particles emerges in sprays and jets. Detectors the size and weight of battleships are installed at points around the ring where protons collide, and sophisticated filters and sensors in the detectors gather up the particle debris and analyze it.
If the energy in a supercollider fireball is great enough, physicists hope to detect ripples in a hypothetical all-pervading medium they call the "Higgs Field," a field they compare with the familiar electromagnetic field. Just as photons cause ripples in the electromagnetic field, the passage of predicted supermassive particles called Higgs bosons would cause ripples in the Higgs Field, which may be detectable by the supercollider.
The Higgs Field, theorists speculate, interacts with material objects in such a way as to give them mass and the stronger the interaction is, the more massive the object. Why anything has mass, and why fundamental atomic particles like protons and electrons have the specific masses they do, is one of the great unsolved riddles of science.
 
Differentiating Forces
 In the Big Bang, theorists believe, all the separate forces that govern the physical world today, electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces and probably gravity as well, were indistinguishable. But as the universe cooled, the different forces "froze out" of their primeval matrix. By reproducing conditions as they were at the instant of the great "symmetry-breaking" between the forces of nature, physicists hope to replay their separation and to understand the nature of their parent matrix, the universal giver of mass.
But aside from their confidence that profoundly important discoveries will be possible with the supercollider, Dr. Schwitters and other high-energy physicists have no clear idea what will turn up.
The miniature fireballs produced by the machine might spawn a fairly simple Higgs boson, the discovery of which would confirm the validity of the Standard Model. This is the generally accepted theory explaining matter in terms of six types of quarks found in such composite particles as protons, six types of leptons like electrons and neutrinos and four types of force carriers: the photons of electromagnetism, the W and Z particles of the weak force, the gluons of the strong force and the hypothetical Higgs bosons.
On the other hand, it might turn out that there are several or many different types of Higgs particles.
 
Possibly a 'Fifth Force'
 Or it may be that the only one of the six quark types that has never been discovered, the "top" quark, is itself responsible for the masses of the particles making up ordinary matter.
Some physicists believe that the supercollider may disclose the existence of a "Fifth Force," a force that underlies all the others but is undetectable except under conditions like those of the infant universe or a supercollider proton collision.
Another set of discoveries might reveal the existence of internal structure in particles that are now considered fundamental and therefore monolithic.
When protons are smashed together at combined energies of 40 trillion electronvolts, the collisions of their constituent quarks occur at energies reaching 2 trillion electronvolts. This might be high enough to reveal if the quark itself has some kind of internal structure. The long history of physics has opened up successive layers of matter within matter like nested Russian dolls, and although no structure has ever been detected in quarks or leptons, the reason may be only that they have not been smashed together hard enough.
 
Aid to Astrophysics
 Experiments using the supercollider can also enrich theoretical astrophysics in several ways, its supporters say. By reproducing conditions just after the birth of the universe, it might be possible, for example, to determine the amount and type of "dark matter" that was created. The hunt for dark matter, which is undetectable directly but which can sometimes be inferred from the gravitational distortions it causes in the passage of light beams, is a major preoccupation of astrophysicists. Depending on how much matter of all kinds the universe contains, both visible and dark matter, it might go on expanding forever, or it might slow to a halt or begin contracting.
But all this may have to await another generation or another century. Accelerator experts agree that the supercollider, if it is built, will certainly be the largest such instrument built by a single nation, and that any more ambitious scientific enterprise could be supported only by an international consortium. If the supercollider is stillborn, organizing an international effort to replace it would be difficult if not impossible in the near future.
"We're now going through the most dangerous period the S.S.C. project has ever faced," Dr. Schwitters said. "We hope our Government will bear in mind that the S.S.C. will cost no more than two nuclear submarines, but it will give the human race knowledge of enduring value."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Discoveries the Supercollider Could Make"
 
1. Higgs Bosons
Physicists do not know why matter has mass, but according to the Standard Model theory, super-heavy particles called Higgs bosons may confer mass. If such particles exist, the Supercolliding Supercollider may be able to find them.
 
 2. The Top Quark
The Standard Model theory holds that there are six families of quarks--the entities of which nuclear particles as protons and neutrons are composed. Of the six quark types only one, known as the top quark, remains to be discovered. If existing accelerators fail to find it, the supercollider may succeed.
 
 3. Particle Structure
Physicists assume that the quarks and leptons that constitute all matter are not thesmelves composed of still smaller particles. This assumption may be wrong. If so, the supercollider may detect these smaller particles.
 
 4. A Fifth Force
The four forces of nature known to physicists are electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. But if quarks and leptons have internal structure, a fifth force must exist to hold their components together. The supercollider may bring it to light.
 
 5. Symmetry Breaking
The Big Bang produced nearly equal amounts of matter and antimatter which annihilated each other, leaving a small residue of matter from which today's universe was built. The production of this excess of matter may be explained if the supercollider can recreate the primordial soup in which the symmetry of matter and antimatter was broken.
 
 6. New Physics
Best of all, the supercollider may discover entirely new particles or principles that no one has predicted. (pg. C8)

HEADLINE: Case for Other Pre-Columbian Voyagers

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, it sometimes seems, was the LAST of the discoverers to find his way to America.
At a conference here three weeks ago on "America Before Columbus," archeologists and an assortment of inspired amateurs recently paraded intriguing fragments of evidence, clues from linguistics and art, and botany and pottery, suggesting Old World influences on the New World centuries before 1492. 
 If there is anything to these alternative-discovery theories, the Atlantic was crossed before Leif Eriksson or Columbus by the Irish, Libyans, Trojans and possibly even some second-century Jews escaping Roman persecution. Also, the Chinese, Japanese and perhaps other Asians supposedly traveled the Pacific to reach pre-Columbian America.
Dr. Nancy Yaw Davis, an anthropologist from Alaska, described the conference as "a playground of ideas" stemming from new research and discoveries showing that "creative mixing of people and cultures occurred earlier in America and more often than originally thought."
 
Contact With Japanese?
 Indeed, scholars say the support for some trans-Pacific encounters seems to be growing stronger. In 1956, pieces of 5,000-year-old pottery were found on the Pacific coast of Ecuador. Their designs bore an uncanny resemblance to pottery produced in southern Japan at about the same period.
Though other experts have raised objections, Dr. Betty J. Meggers, an anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, said they had failed to give a plausible explanation for the detailed similarities . She said trans-Pacific contact remains the simplest and most persuasive explanation.
Partisans imagine that 5,000 years ago, some Japanese fishermen were blown east in a storm and rode the prevailing current off the Aleutian Islands, down the coast of North America and all the way to Ecuador. Japanese adventurers re-created such a 9,000-mile voyage in 1980.
Likewise, Dr. Stephen C. Jett, a geography professor at the University of California at Davis, reported "striking similarities" of textile designs, dyestuffs and coloring techniques to suggest pre-Columbian connections between southern Asia and coastal Peru.
 
Ears of Corn in India?
 The contacts may even have gone both ways. Showing detailed pictures of 700-year-old temple art from India, Dr. Carl L. Johannessen, a geography professor at the University of Oregon, pointed out many examples of what appeared to be ears of corn. Corn, or maize, was supposedly unknown outside America until after Columbus.
Dr. Davis advanced the hypothesis that the Zuni Indians of New Mexico were distinctive in language, culture and biology, compared with other Indians, partly because they may have come in contact with Japanese in the 13th century. She noted similarities between the Zuni and the Japanese in blood chemistry and some basic words. Even the Zuni migration stories, she said, were suggestive in their description of the trek of a distinctive people from the "ocean of the sunset world" in search of the true middle of the world.
"I'm not saying the Zuni are Japanese," Dr. Davis said, "but they may include influences from Japan at a particular time."
From the audience arose Joseph Dishta, head councilman of the Zuni tribe in New Mexico.
"We do not endorse this theory," Mr. Dishta said. "We have our own interpretation. We always feel we've been in that part of the country since time immemorial. We feel we emerged from the mother earth."
If the Japanese found their way to the Zuni, could Jewish refugees from the Roman Empire have made it to the eastern mountains of Tennessee in the second century? At least that is the meaning a few researchers read in an inscribed stone found a century ago with nine skeletons in a burial mound at Bat Creek in Tennessee.
For years, the inscription was interpreted as a message in Cherokee. When Dr. Cyrus H. Gordon, retired professor of Mediterranean studies at Brandeis University, had a look, he decided the engraving was actually in Hebrew and similar to writings found on Hebrew coins of the first and second centuries. Carbon dating shows the burial took place between the years 32 and 769.
At the conference, Dr. J. Huston McCulloch, an economist at Ohio State University who has become a leading exponent of the Jewish connection to Bat Creek, defended the stone's antiquity and the Jewish interpretation against recent attacks by professional anthropologists. He discounted the possibility of a hoax.
The three-day conference, held on the campus of Brown University, was organized by the New England Antiquities Research Association, a group started in 1964 by amateur archeologists to study the origins of enigmatic stone structures found throughout New England.
"We are open-minded about all points of view," said Donald Gilmore, a retired Foreign Service officer and director of the association. "We shouldn't ignore evidence that there were pre-Columbian contacts and these could have influenced pre-Columbian cultures."

HEADLINE: Norsemen In America Flourished Then Faded

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
FIVE centuries before Columbus, the Norse sailed west across the North Atlantic in search of new lands that were, in the words of their sagas, "habitable and trespassable." They established a colony in Greenland, then moved on to the coast of North America, where they became a long disputed footnote to the history of discovery.
By now, five centuries after the first Columbus voyage of 1492, scholars agree that the Norse got to the New World much earlier and achieved a substantial foothold. Archeologists believe they have firm evidence for at least one settlement in Newfoundland around the time of Leif Eriksson, in the early 11th century. The mystery now is why the Norse failed to sustain their American enterprise. 
 Widening their search, archeologists have also found iron nails, pieces of armor, figurines and other artifacts suggesting a Norse presence in Ellesmere and Baffin Islands to the north and perhaps as far south as Maine. Their visits may have been brief, to hunt and trade or to plunder, but they apparently continued them for several hundred years, almost up to the time of Columbus.
So it raises again the question, who did "discover" America?
Of course, ancestors of the Indians and Eskimos were the first inhabitants, having crossed from Asia thousands of years before. Circumstantial evidence, tenuous at best, is advanced from time to time in support of pre-Columbian contacts by the Chinese and Japanese across the Pacific and the Irish, Welsh, Phoenicians, Jews and Africans across the Atlantic.
Even if the Norse almost certainly preceded Columbus, historians argue, their influence on subsequent American history was inconsequential. Scholars generally credit Columbus with the true discovery, even if he seems never to have been sure where he was, for the reason that his exploits had the immediate and lasting effect of incorporating the Americas into world history.
"Yes, the Norse were here first, but apart from some ethnic pride, so what?" said Dr. Thomas H. McGovern, an archeologist at Hunter College of the City University of New York who is an authority on the cultural and economic aspects of the Norse explorations. "Historically, it didn't make any big difference."
Still, the Norse experience fascinates historians and archeologists, in part because it was so widespread but ephemeral, and it is being examined more systematically by a broader range of experts. New efforts to confirm Norse activities in America are being financed by a Danish businessman, Jorgen D. Siemonsen, who directs an international committee of scientists.
Under the guidance of Dr. McGovern, scholars from 10 countries met in January to establish the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization to promote and coordinate more rigorous investigations of the social and economic dynamics of the Norse ventures.
 
Looking for Cause of Failure
 As the new findings lend credence to the folk tales of adventure in the Icelandic Sagas, scholars are moving beyond simply verifying a Norse presence and are increasingly interested in identifying the likely causes of the ultimate Norse failure to plant permanent roots in America.
According to the sagas, the Norse first glimpsed the American coast when their ships were blown off course while sailing to their colony in Greenland. Leif Eriksson, son of Erik the Red, the outlaw from Norway and Iceland who founded the Greenland settlement, scouted out the coast, probably crossing the Davis Strait from Greenland, a distance of no more than 200 miles, and catching the south-flowing Labrador Current. The explorers came first to a rocky shore they called Helluland, which is probably present-day Baffin Island, and then to the wooded coast of a placed they named Markland, probably Labrador. Finally, Eriksson reached the land he would call Vinland, a place now assumed to be Newfoundland.
There, in about the year 1000, Eriksson built a settlement of large houses to serve as a base for commerce and exploration deeper into this new land. Other settlers arrived, including Leif's brother Thorvald. In what may have been the first skirmish between Europeans and the American natives, Thorvald was killed by an arrow.
In the sagas, when Thorvald drew out the fatal arrow, he had these last words: "There is fat round my belly! We have won a fine and fruitful country, but will hardly be allowed to enjoy it."
The case for a Norse presence in North America gained respectability in the 1960's with the discovery of the remains of an 11th century settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, on a northern finger of the island of Newfoundland. A Norwegian explorer, Helge Ingstad, came upon the building remains, and he and his wife, the archeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, led an team of archeologists that excavated the collapsed sod walls of eight buildings, a forge, hearths and other ruins of the settlement.
"We know it is a Norse site," said Dr. William W. Fitzhugh, an anthropologist with the Smithsonian Institution. "The question is, whose site is it? Leif Eriksson's, perhaps?"
Dr. Birgitta L. Wallace, an archeologist with the Canadian Parks Service in Halifax, Nova Scotia, completed a comprehensive study of the site last year. The settlement, she concluded, was probably occupied for no more than five or 10 years, with a population of about 100. A soapstone spindle whorl, used in spinning, suggests that not all the Norse settlers were men.
 
Only One Settlement Found
 Also found in the excavations were whole butternuts, which have never grown as far north as Newfoundland. Dr. Wallace cited this as evidence that L'Anse aux Meadows was a gateway settlement, the staging area or winter camp for explorations to the south, especially in the St. Lawrence region that may have been Vinland proper. The settlers presumably shipped lumber back to Greenland, where there was virtually no timber and the forests of Europe were too far away.
L'Anse aux Meadows is still the only Norse settlement ever found on the North American coast, and the prospect of discovering others seems bleak. From archeological evidence the Greenland colony's population in the 11th century may have been no more than 600. Dr. Wallace said it was doubtful that the small colony could have supported another American outpost the size of the one in Newfoundland.
Although archeologists might find remains of later settlements, perhaps from the 14th century when the Greenland colony had grown to about 7,000 people, their searches so far have turned up only isolated bits and pieces of Norse material buried at the sites of early Indian or Eskimo camps. While Eskimos lived in northern Greenland, there is no evidence of trading by them or by Indians in the southern part of the island until after the Norse had settled there. Anthropologists cannot be sure if the artifacts indicate the extent of Norse travels in North America, or if many of them reached the native populations through trade networks many times removed from the original Norse sources.
Archeologists suspect this is how a Norse penny minted in about 1065 came to be in the remains of an Indian camp at Blue Hill Bay near Brooklin , Me. Dr. Bruce J. Bourque, archeologist at the Maine State Museum in Augusta, said that since no other Norse artifacts were found at the site, the assumption was made that the penny reached the site through trade with other Indians from the north. There is no telling how many Indian hands it had passed through or how many hundreds of miles it had traveled after it had left a Norse pocket. The coin is perforated as if it had been used as a pendant.
 
Penny Called Authentic
 As a specialist in Norse archeology, Dr. Bourque has examined many faked artifacts, including inscribed stones being passed off as ancient Norse runes where the symbols were so freshly scratched that dust remained in the lines. But he and other experts who examined the penny proclaimed its authenticity. Further excavations at the site are being proposed to look for more clues to the penny's provenance.
Even if the coin is only indirect evidence of Norse activity, archeologists said it showed that they were still traveling to North America in the late 11th century, or even later. The scattering of other artifacts, Dr. Wallace said, is important evidence that the Norse in Greenland maintained trade and other contact with North America for almost 500 years.
They apparently had their longest and most active contact with aboriginal people known as the Thule Eskimos. In the Thule village sites on Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic, Dr. Peter Schledermann, an archeologist at the University of Calgary, has picked up fragments of chain mail armor, pieces of woolen cloth, knife blades of smelted iron, iron boat rivets and other iron and copper pieces.
On Baffin Island, explorers have found iron and bronze objects thought to be Norse and a figurine carved in the Eskimo style. It depicts someone dressed in a long robe slit up the front and with a cross incised on the chest. The costume resembles no known Eskimo clothing and is more like a cloaked bishop of the Norse period.
 
Travels to Eastern Arctic
 "It's definitely a native carving by someone who had seen a Norseman or had one described," Dr. Fitzhugh said. "From these artifacts it does seem the Norse were more heavily involved in the eastern Arctic than indicated in the sagas, which mention only a few voyages."
Dr. Fitzhugh is studying the 16th-century camps of the English navigator Martin Frobisher, who made a vain search for a possible Northwest Passage across the Arctic to Asia. Among the strangest remains at the site, on Frobisher Bay, are some loaf-shaped iron ingots. They are a mystery because carbon dating indicates that they were smelted hundreds of years before one of Frobisher's expeditions. The Indians and Eskimos presumably lacked the skill to make them. Perhaps the Norse made the ingots and Frobisher found them. No one knows.
Though claims have been made for Norse expeditions as far south as the Chesapeake Bay or even Florida, most experts doubt that they ever ranged south of the Canadian Maritime Provinces or had anything to do with an enigmatic stone tower in Newport, R.I. The tower has some similarities to Norse buildings, prompting local legends, but scholars believe it goes back no further than the 17th century.
Investigation of the Newport Tower is one of seven research projects being supported by Mr. Siemonsen, the Danish businessman, who has sailed some of the Norse routes and says he wants to sort out fact from fantasy in the legends. New tests developed in Finland, he said, may make it possible to establish the age of the mortar and plaster in the tower.
Other new research includes an examination of well-preserved timbers from a Norse farmstead excavated in Greenland two years ago. Determining the type and age of the timber could yield its source, which could possibly be the forests of Labrador.
Scientists at the University of Copenhagen and the Danish Geological Survey are analyzing coal found at another Greenland site. It is a type of anthracite coal unknown in Greenland, Iceland or Norway. Comparisons are being made to see if it might have come from Wales or even Rhode Island or Pennsylvania.
In more than two decades of study, Dr. McGovern has identified several factors contributing to the decline of the Norse in Greenland and to the west. The Greenland colony never developed the economic strength to support itself or the American outposts, and Norway's interest diminished as it developed more ties with Europe.
"Norse who wanted a new life could try Normandy, Sicily, Northumberland, Ireland or Vinland," Dr. McGovern noted. "Which would you choose?"
The coming of the Little Ice Age in the late 14th century brought a sharp climate change that was probably devastating to the Norse farms and livestock on Greenland, as well as Vinland if they were still in operation. While the Eskimos spread and prospered as hunters, Dr. McGovern said, the Norse failed to adapt to the chill. They were "nailed down with their investment in domestic animals and a more sedentary medieval European society," he said. They also suffered because they never developed a harpoon for seal hunting, as had the Eskimos. This limited them to hunting only certain species in certain seasons.
"It's not impossible to imagine," Dr. McGovern remarked, "that the Norse presence was ending at the very time Columbus was setting sail in 1492."

Map/Drawings: "Traces of an Ephemeral Discovery"
 Archeologists are now confident that the Norse had a firm but temporary foothold in North America, one that they kept for centuries, almost to the time of Columbus. The question now, the researchers say, is why they did not build on it. Based on the artifacts that have been found, their presence seems to have been small but widespread. In Newfoundland, the remains of a substantial village at L'Anse aux Meadows suggest it was a center for further explorations to the south. But it is still the only Norse settlement ever found on the North American coast.
 
Intriguing fragments
On Ellesmere Island, pieces of chain mail armor are among the artifacts that hint of a Norse presence. On Baffin Island, a figurine carved in Eskimo style resembles a cloaked bishop of the Norse period. The long robe, slit in front, and the cross are unlike Eskimo clothing.
 
Hints and doubts
A Norse penny could have reached a site in Maine through Indian trade. The "Norse" Newport Tower in Rhode Island is probably no earlier than
 the 1600's.
 
Routes of the Sagas
The poets say Leif Eriksson's ships came first to rocky Helluland, probably present-day Baffin Island, then to the wooded coast of Markland, probably Labrador, and finally Vinland, now assumed to be Newfoundland. From there, forays may have reached as far south as Maine.

BYLINE: By C. CLAIBORNE RAY

 BODY:

Skyscrapers
Q. How long will skyscrapers last?
A. "If they are properly maintained, they will last forever," said C. R. (Chuck) Pennoni, president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. 
 After proper design, the key is the integrity of the materials, said Mr. Pennoni, who was trained as a structural engineer. Steel or concrete can be damaged by things like acid rain, he said, but if damaged material is replaced, the building will survive.
If a structure like the World Trade Center were abandoned and not maintained at all, the first thing to go would probably be the curtain wall, the skin of the building, Mr. Pennoni said. As it was weathered by rain, pieces would probably start to fall off, he said. However, Mr. Pennoni estimated that it would probably take 25 to 50 years for the core to be affected.
Massive buildings of masonry may have a longer lease on life than those with a glass skin, he suggested, but advances in sealants and other materials and techniques mean modern buildings may have more staying power.
Mr. Pennoni said that except for disaster damage from things like earthquakes and fires, the reason buildings come down is often economic, because there is no money for maintenance or because the real estate is too valuable for the structure that is on it. "In a throw-away economy, we throw away buildings, too," he said.
 
Eating Like a Bird
 Q. How do pigeons feed their young?
A. Rock doves, which are common city pigeons, and the rest of the pigeon family produce a substance called pigeon's milk, said Todd Culver, an ornithologist at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y.
It is actually a secretion of the stomach lining, he explained. "The living cells of the crop lining slough off, and adults regurgitate a white milk-like substance that is extremely high in fat and protein, the perfect thing to feed young squabs," he said.
It is similar in content to mammalian milk, he said.

HEADLINE: Russia Has Earned Its Reward

 BODY:
What a difference a year makes: Just that long ago, President Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union went to the economic summit meeting of the seven industrial democracies asking for aid, vaguely promising to launch market reforms. Now President Boris Yeltsin of Russia will go before the same group, meeting in Munich, also to ask for aid. But he comes with more than promises. Russia has adopted astonishingly radical reforms.
Until the past few days the West had reacted more with promises of its own than with cash. Last spring it promised $24 billion as soon as Russia and the International Monetary Fund could work out a feasible reform package. But the fund dithered, unwilling to take a prudent chance on the Yeltsin Government. 
 Finally, on Friday, under pressure from the Bush Administration, Michel Camdessus, director of the I.M.F., flew to Russia and then announced an agreement -- over the seeming objections of his staff and just in time for Mr. Yeltsin's trip to Munich.
President Bush deserves credit for turning the I.M.F. around. He understands that the West's self-interest lies in supporting Mr. Yeltsin's heroic efforts. The important task is to provide some instant relief, to get Russia through current turmoil and use the next several months to negotiate the unresolved differences over the details. This weekend, Mr. Camdessus got the message.
Just since January Mr. Yeltsin has decontrolled most prices, cut the deficit by an astonishing 75 percent and pushed through a bill that will eventually privatize most state-owned enterprises. The fund has applauded these measures but still fears, justifiably, that Russia is printing rubles freely, at a rate that will trigger ruinous inflation.
One reason for all the new rubles is the Government's continuing subsidies of oil at below-market prices.
A second reason is to pay for credits that state-owned enterprises have extended one another when they ran out of cash. Finally, the I.M.F. fears that Russia can't by itself rein in the supply of rubles because central banks in the other republics can, in effect, print their own.
These threats are grave. But the answer -- as the Bush Administration understands -- isn't to sit idly by as the Russian economy collapses. The answer is engagement, which the I.M.F. announcement now finally accepts.
Russia will get $1 billion immediately, which may lead some of the Western powers meeting in Munich to release more of the promised $24 billion in aid. The remainder will await the outcome of further negotiations over oil prices and other inducements to print money.
For all this to work, the Western governments will have to keep the heat on the I.M.F. The fund's staff seems more committed to protecting itself from criticism than to helping Russia complete its radical reforms.
The goal, as Secretary of State James Baker says, is to strike a workable, not a perfect, deal. It's still far from clear whether the I.M.F. knows the difference.

HEADLINE: Mr. Marino's Petulant Walkout

 BODY:
No sooner had New York's Legislature performed the unusual feat of passing this year's state budget almost on schedule than it slid right back into its bad habit of shirking responsibility. The lawmakers actually packed up and left Albany last week without voting on several pieces of critical legislation.
Unless they return, the public won't have a chance to vote in November on an $800 million bond act designed to create jobs and spur economic development; Nassau and Suffolk counties won't get a chance to bail themselves out of fiscal trouble, and other bills that merit attention won't get any. Lawmakers cannot allow the impasse to continue. They have an obligation to go back to work. 
 The chief cause of Albany's gridlock is a Republican, Ralph Marino of Long Island, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Marino, furious that Gov. Mario Cuomo was playing politics with Nassau's and Suffolk's requests for permission to borrow money, got into a shouting match with a Cuomo ally, Saul Weprin, the Assembly Speaker and a voice of legislative reason, then stalked out of Albany. The session's sputtering close left several pieces of legislation unresolved.
Mr. Cuomo was indeed trying to horse-trade. But why would traditional political jockeying surprise and infuriate an Albany veteran like Mr. Marino? If he continues to let bitterness get in his way, Mr. Marino will wind up hurting the very people he wants to protect -- Long Islanders.
The counties say they need to borrow about $190 million combined or will have to raise taxes, lay off workers and cut services. The Governor questions the need for borrowing, and certainly it should only be a last resort. But both counties insist it is necessary, and he will likely go along if Mr. Marino agrees to independent fiscal oversight and supports the bond act and other worthy measures.
The Legislature left town without acting on such important bills as a trust fund for environmental protection and the Governor's sensible plan for state takeover of Medicaid's soaring local costs. Those and other pieces of legislation left in limbo deserve support, once Mr. Marino cools off and returns to his job.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
China's Black Book

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Long before the extermination camps, the world knew that Hitler's basic instruments of power were torture and murder.
Only shortly after the Germans elevated him to office, "black books" were published in the West -- detailed reports of the flogging, genital tortures, deaths by suffocation carried out routinely in Gestapo prisons. 
 From then on, the nations knew their ambassadors were accredited to a regime from hell and their businessmen were buying its products.
Most people did little or nothing until the war. But some did. They too acknowledged the truth and fought it -- with their voices, however lonely, with whatever economic and political strength they had, however small.
After World War II the underground writings of the Soviet freedom fighters told the world about the Soviet gulag. Most people did little or nothing. But some did. They acknowledged the truth and fought with whatever energy and power they had.
Now, black books are published again. They are about another national system of torture and murder -- the Chinese Communist gulag, where every day of every year 16 to 20 million men and women labor and suffer in slavery.
They live -- they exist -- in a world of torture, starvation and humiliation meticulously planned to create greater profit through greater production for the Communist Government. We are the customers.
Recently I wrote about a report on China's slave laborers -- "Laogai: The Chinese Gulag," by Hongda Harry Wu. He spent 19 years in the slave camps. I could not escape that book and cannot escape another on my table. It is about the hundreds of prisons in the huge province of Hunan. "Anthems of Defeat" is reported with documentation, statistical tables, notes and names by Tang Bogiao, a Chinese dissident.
Mr. Tang was moved from prison to prison and has compiled this annotated encyclopedia of evil. It is published by Asia Watch (212-972-8400).
All prisoners received trials -- without confrontation of witnesses or pleas of innocence permitted.
Prof. Peng Yuzhang, in his 70's, was sent to Changsa No. 1 jail for backing student sit-ins. He was placed on the "shackle board," a door-sized plank with shackles for hands and feet and a hole for defecation. Chained to the board, he would sing encouragement to student prisoners he could not see. Sometimes he would cry out, "I need a bath."
Professor Peng remained on the board for three months. Then he was sent to a psychiatric asylum. Is he alive?
The shackle board was just one form of punishment. Other commonplaces:
Torture with electric prods. Public whippings to the blood. Forced boot-licking. Chaining, face on cell floor, arms around toilet buckets in use through the night by other prisoners.
A dozen kinds of hand and ankle cuffs, sometimes with iron rods between them to make movement almost impossible. Multiple fetters to shackle prisoners tightly together. "Martial arts" -- guards kicking prisoners into unconsciousness.
Solitary confinement in metal boxes so small prisoners can neither lie down properly nor stand up straight. "Electric shackle treatment" -- shock applied through hand and ankle cuffs, often while the victim is chained to the shackle board.
Prisoners who do not fill work quotas are punished by all these tortures, by starvation diets, and by extended sentences. By official Communist policy their work is considered an essential part of Chinese export.
So we know -- no escape. What can we do? American laws against forced labor imports are sieves. But stockholders can raise the issue at company meetings. Are we selling slave labor goods, or using our pension funds, to help the torturers? Please investigate and report back fully .
Before we buy, we can ask shopkeepers to find out from their vendors what "made in China" means -- made where, by whom?
President Bush has vetoed every Congressional attempt to apply mild economic sanctions to the Chinese Communists. This battle will not end, whoever is elected President.
Meantime will all the delegates at the Republican and Democratic Conventions remain mute about slavery and torture in China? Will Ross Perot? Or will they cleanse themselves of silence -- at least some of them?

HEADLINE: Conservatives: Beware Perot

BYLINE: By Pete du Pont; Pete du Pont, Governor of Delaware from 1977 to 1985, is chairman of the Committee for Republican Leadership.

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del.

 BODY:
As a conservative who has watched low taxes and restrained Government spending and interference create the world's strongest economy, and who sought the Presidency on these principles in 1988, I urge fellow conservatives to be wary of Ross Perot's candidacy.
I understand why Mr. Perot is receiving such attention. The Bush Administration has given most voters, those who helped the Republicans to three landslide victories in the 1980's, the impression that the principles that fueled those triumphs are open to negotiation and easy dismissal. 
 While conservatives may not see President Bush as the most diligent protector of Ronald Reagan's legacy, I support him for re-election because he understands the policies that made the 1980's prosperous and his goal is to re-create that prosperity. Conversely, Mr. Perot has joined the noisy anti-Reagan minority that sees the 1980's as a problem to be overcome rather than a model to be studied.
Let's take four examples of Mr. Perot's economic thinking: industrial policy, taxation, trade and his analysis of the dairy industry.
First, Mr. Perot favors an industrial policy. He wants the Government to be able to tell the private sector how to plan its future. He denies that he holds this position, but his denial is implausible given his expressions of admiration for Japan's industrial-policy power base, the Ministry of Trade and Industry -- a Government cartel that runs the country's economy. America does not need government cartels telling us what to do.
Second, he is a protectionist. USA Today reported that Mr. Perot "wants to tighten quotas and restrictions on imported goods to match those placed on American goods by other countries." He opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement, suggesting that the agreement with Mexico would virtually destroy every employer in America. But we know that trade increases the wealth of both the importer and exporter; we know that free trade increases, not decreases, our prosperity. We need more free trade agreements, not fewer.
Third, Mr. Perot will raise taxes. "You bet we've got to raise taxes," he said in 1987. Last week on ABC's "Town Meeting" he added: "Let's assume that we're just unable to pay our bills, unable to meet our obligations, we have to raise our taxes." But then again he says he wants the voters to be able to pass a tax increase by plebiscite, never mind that the Constitution gives that power to Congress. Surely, national tax referendums would be the chaotic prelude to annual debates on "deficit-reducing" taxes -- all to be imposed on someone else, of course.
Finally, there is Mr. Perot's curious yet significant answer to a caller on NBC's "Today" last month who inquired about his plans to help dairy farmers. Mr. Perot began by restating the proposition that dairy farmers are a beleaguered lot. The fact is that the average net cash income of a commercial dairy farm in 1990 was $83,000. He then went on to claim that the farmers have no clout in Washington. That must have stunned even the dairy farmers, who in the 1991-1992 election cycle have contributed more than $1.5 million to their political-action committees -- among the richest and most influential of them all, and who have seen beneficial farm bills routinely enacted.
But it is the philosophy behind the words that should scare conservatives. Regardless of the dearth of factual understanding in his answers, Mr. Perot betrayed the way he thinks. When asked to comment on the economic status of one sector of the U.S. economy, his assumption was that it was flat on its back and, worse, that the way to get it on its feet was to tell it to get some clout and go to Washington. That is a Big Government formula that should give pause to every American. But it should terrify any self-respecting conservative.

The Misery's Fine

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Sometimes I infuriate myself. Just the other day, for instance. On television selling a book I was, but too much the gentleman, too much the eleventh-rate salesman, alas, to look the camera dead in the eye and say:
"My book will not only make you smell better, relieve your headache, transform dingy yellow teeth to gleaming white and add five miles per gallon to your gas mileage, it will also make you live twice as long while enjoying twice as much happiness and getting twice as young every year." 
 Instead, with mouth rattling along completely free of brain control -- television cameras always do this to me -- I started talking about America's anger. Why was the country so filled with anger? What in the world did Americans have to be furious about?
It had just prevailed in the 45-year cold war. The threat of nuclear holocaust was suspended. Stores were overflowing. The choice of entertainments was infinite. There were millions of cars to carry Americans wherever whim or necessity dictated. There was easy access to deadly weapons for every temperament, be it sporting, criminal, political, entrepreneurial, suicidal, self-pitying, paranoidal or just plain fun-loving.
Moreover, Americans could worship such gods as they chose, or none if they chose. And what about other people from all over the world risking everything to get here? If the place was really such a hate-filled sinkhole, why were foreigners dying to get here?
I hate to hear people talking like this, and afterward I hated myself for having done it. It is un-American. Misery is the new American condition, and making a loud noise about your misery is now the most American thing you can do, having replaced washing your car on Saturday afternoon.
Remember when you could sing that old spiritual, "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen," and mean it? Not anymore. Nowadays everybody knows the trouble you've seen. That's because you've told them.
You probably told them at the top of your lungs, too, maybe out in the streets screaming it to television cameras or even inside a TV studio shouting it on a misery panel to some competitive boaster who claims his troubles have been worse than yours. There is so much competition for the misery championship these days that you have to scream to remain a contender.
Thoreau wrote 150 years ago that most people lead "lives of quiet desperation." What an antique idea. Nowadays most people lead lives of noisy desperation, and if you're not shrieking your laments you will be dismissed as a mere flyweight in the misery department.
What we're seeing is a competition to be Number One in Pain and Suffering, to win a statuette for Most Victimized, or Most Oppressed, or Most Forgotten, or Most Abused, or Most Unfairly Treated, or Most Tax-Ridden, or Most Bureaucracy-Persecuted, or Most Medically Ill Treated, or Most Telephonically Violated, or Most Supreme-Court-Deprived . . .
The fact, of course, is that contrary to the whine that everything was better in the old days, almost everything was actually much worse in the old days. True, the old days weren't afflicted with the telephone, much less the fax, but they didn't have air-conditioning either, or the electric car crank, or television, or unemployment compensation, or Social Security, or overnight dry-cleaning, or movies right there in the parlor alongside the cast-iron woodstove with the isinglass windows.
Easy now with those poisonous pens, ye angry millions: I am not saying we ought to count our blessings instead of whining, moaning and wailing it up. It's natural for each new generation of modern times to think it is born into the worst of times. This may even promote happiness. In a century that has lost its certainty about the purpose of life, it can be comforting to believe you are needed to do hero's work.
Deprived so abruptly of the cold war's "long twilight struggle" between heroes and monsters, we haven't found much in the way of a new heroic task to pick us up. Perhaps this fascination with our own troubles is a healthy omen, portending a real effort to use this quiet time to neaten up the American act. Omen or not, it beats washing the car on Saturday afternoon.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MUNICH;
LEADERS IN MUNICH WARN RIVAL FORCES IN BOSNIAN STRIFE

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 7

 BODY:
The leaders of seven major industrial democracies warned the belligerents in Bosnia and Herzegovina today that they would support United Nations-backed military action if it became necessary to get aid through to civilians in Sarajevo and other parts of the war-torn country.
The leaders issued a strong warning to the leaders of Serbia and of the armies it controls that further fighting was unacceptable. Resurgent nationalism and ethnic tensions there and in parts of the former Soviet Union, they said, were causing "death, destruction, and widespread dislocation of innocent people." 
 Joined by the head of the European Community, the leaders also raised the possibility of convening a United Nations peace conference to address the underlying ethnic and national causes of the worst fighting in Europe since World War II.
Shelling continued there today, and the Bosnian President renewed an appeal to President Bush to attack the Serbian forces and supply the Bosnians with arms and ammunition. [Page A8.]
 
A Palace in Munich
 As they met in the elegant surroundings of the Wittelsbach dynasty's royal palace in the Bavarian capital, the seven leaders, from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada, were also trying to find ways, and money, to prevent social and economic problems in the newly independent Russia from breaking out into similar violence.
Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, joined them for dinner tonight and will make a pitch for more aid and a debt moratorium on Wednesday afternoon, after they end the formal summit meeting and issue a communique on economic issues.
On talks on a new global trade agreement, stalled for more than two years, the seven continued to seek a breakthrough after years of squabbling about agricultural subsidies.
 
'Much, Much Closer'
 "I'm of the view that we're much, much closer to a conclusion than we were five weeks ago," Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said this afternoon, adding that he thought the leaders would probably agree on Wednesday to stronger language than at the last two of this group's annual gatherings. In each of the past two years, they said an agreement was essential to the health of the world economy and pledged every effort to achieve it by the end of the year.
Before Mr. Yeltsin's arrival, the leaders welcomed the "new partnership" that the collapse of Communism and the Soviet Union had made possible between East and West.
"Partnership will flourish as common values take root, based on the principles of political and economic freedom, human rights, democracy, justice and the rule of law," they said in the political declaration issued today. "Good governance and respect for human rights are important criteria in providing economic assistance."
 
Strife in the East
 But they were clearly preoccupied with the darker side of change, not only in the western Balkans but also in Nagorno-Karabakh, Moldova, and Ossetia, former Soviet territories where nationalities have clashed violently over conflicting territorial claims.
There was concern over their failure so far to prevent war in what was Yugoslavia, and talk in the corridors and by members of national delegations of using air and sea forces to blockade it and send in ground forces if necessary to break the Serbian siege of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mr. Baker repeated today that he did not believe that American troops should go into Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
'A Quagmire Potential'
 "There is a quagmire potential," he said, "but there is a real problem that must be addressed."
Asked what the United States thought of a French suggestion that troops of the nine-nation Western European Union, instead of NATO, might be used, Mr. Baker said it would probably be up to the United Nations to decide, but added, "It will be a case of making the most efficient and best use of the assets of these organizations."
Barbara McDougall, the Canadian Foreign Minister, said there had been "serious discussion" among the seven of how to block oil supplies from coming into Serbia from Romania by pipeline, which is happening despite the United Nations economic embargo imposed on the rump Yugoslavia.
But the language the seven agreed to today was cautious, reflecting continuing disagreements about whether and how it would make sense to use outside force to make peace in the region.
 
Access for Relief Effort
 "The airlift to Sarajevo can only be the beginning of a larger humanitarian effort," the summit leaders said. "Safe access by road to Sarajevo as well as to other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina in need must be guaranteed."
But if United Nations aid is blocked by the belligerents, the summit leaders said, "we believe the Security Council will have to consider other measures, not excluding military means, to achieve its humanitarian objectives."
Serbia and Croatia, they said, should respect the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbian leaders should respect minority rights in full and negotiate with representatives of the mainly Albanian province of Kosovo on granting autonomous status for the territory.
The leaders also called for the suspension of Serbia and Montenegro, the only remaining members of what was a six-member Yugoslav federation, from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in Helsinki, where the six European and North American national leaders in Munich will be joining 46 others on Thursday for the most comprehensive East-West summit gathering of the post-Soviet era.
 
Use of NATO Forces
 Officials in Helsinki said today that all C.S.C.E. members except Russia had already agreed to suspend Yugoslavia, and that agreement had been reached on a way to allow the security conference to approach the NATO alliance as well as individual C.S.C.E. members for forces to use in peacekeeping missions if the 52-nation group decided on it.
The security conference plans to agree on a 12-section charter emphasizing cooperation among former adversaries in building a new European security order.
Hours before Mr. Yeltsin's arrival at dinner tonight, half a day earlier than originally scheduled, Mr. Baker was asked about a suggestion -- resisted by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Prime Minister John Major of Britain -- that the Russians should be included in the annual economic summit meetings.
"If Russia stays on a democratic and free-market course, it might be very likely that the next summit would see the President of Russia in attendance," Mr. Baker said.
But the Japanese remain skeptical about providing money to help him. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed hesitation about setting up a multinational fund to pay for repairs to make Soviet-designed nuclear reactors in Eastern Europe safe against the threat of catastrophic breakdown, diplomats said. Japan has made aid to Russia, and normalization of relations, conditional on a return of the four southernmost Kurile islands, seized from Japan at the end of World War II.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MUNICH -- Bush on a Tightrope;
Behind the Facade of Good Intentions Summit Crystallizes Some Problems

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 7

 BODY:
Behind their expressions of good intentions on world trade, the Russian evolution and Yugoslavia, President Bush and President Francois Mitterrand of France danced a tense minuet today, with one eye on their own political problems and the other on an increasingly difficult trans-Atlantic relationship.
Carried out in dinners, formal meetings and ad hoc negotiations in the corridors of Munich's Residenz palace, the relationship between Mr. Bush and Mr. Mitterrand at the seven-nation economic summit meeting seemed to crystallize the problems of the Atlantic alliance as the United States and its European partners try to fit themselves into a post-cold-war order that none seems able to define clearly. 
 In public, the United States sought to give some credit to Mr. Mitterrand, saying he had spurred the statement on Yugoslavia that was issued by the seven leaders here today and that Washington would continue to let him lead the European Community's response to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Mitterrand seems to be doing better abroad than at home. He arrived here in the midst of a truckers' strike in France that has paralyzed roads and stranded travelers throughout the country.
Officials from Washington played down the notion that French-American disputes were the major reason for the industrialized democracies' failure to reach an agreement on world trade that they have been promising for years.
 
Private Complaints
 But in private, United States officials complained about French intransigence in the trade talks. The Americans' public deference to Mr. Mitterrand on Yugoslavia was tempered by a political need to present Mr. Bush as a strong leader and Washington officials said privately that Mr. Mitterrand was actually following Mr. Bush's lead on the Balkan fighting.
Indeed, they said the communique was crafted in such a way as to take the issue out of the hands of the European Community, where the United States is largely a bystander, and put it back in the United Nations Security Council, which Mr. Bush feels confident of dominating, if any large-scale military action is needed.
For their part, the French signed a joint communique that spoke of "an era where confrontation has given way to cooperation." But they grumbled to reporters about Washington's reluctance to agree to a new international conference on the Balkans. They said the Americans were blocking -- for no good reason, as far as France was concerned -- a joint nuclear safety fund that would be administered by the French-controlled European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Aides to Mr. Bush and Mr. Mitterrand said the two men get along well on a personal level, although Mr. Bush's exuberant style clashes with Mr. Mitterrand's more impassive demeanor. Both Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d are said to have a prickly relationship with the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas.
 
Future U.S. Role Questioned
 The two leaders' evident tensions spring in part from significant differences on global security issues, including the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and more broadly the future American role in Europe.
The United States is trying to maintain the dominance of NATO as the main European security force. But France, which is not a member of the NATO military structure, argues that the alliance is a cold-war institution and should evolve into something new. They say the United States' influence in European affairs, which French officials resent, should be diminished.
France has been pressing for a new international conference on Yugoslavia, and has been resisting American proposals that NATO form a peacekeeping arm, on which the European countries could call in times of crisis through the 52-member Council on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Paris wants the European security council to turn to individual countries for peacekeeping missions. The United States can more easily control NATO than the security council.
 
Geopolitics and Elections
 Beyond these geopolitical considerations, the relationship between Mr. Bush and Mr. Mitterrand also reflects the extent to which the actions and statements of the two Presidents and the five other leaders meeting here are colored by their political problems at home.
Both Presidents are facing crucial votes later this year. On Sept. 20, the French will vote in a referendum whether to approve the treaty on European union that Mr. Mitterrand has staked his political standing on.
Mr. Bush is facing his own political troubles in his battle to win a second term in November. His political advisers want him to return from Munich having demonstrated leadership in international affairs and a concern for American economic problems.
 
Reaching a Home Audience
 When a reporter suggested this evening that Mr. Bush had not put his stamp on the proceedings here, Mr. Baker responded, "I think you're missing something.
"I think that we -- as I said in the formal statement -- can and have served as a catalyst for action with respect to Yugoslavia," Mr. Baker said. "But leadership doesn't mean doing it all by yourself. It means doing it jointly with your partners where everyone can agree on what ought to be done. And now we are in the happy circumstance of everyone agreeing on what ought to be done."
Asked how much the 1992 election colored Mr. Bush's actions here, Mr. Baker, a seasoned political strategist who ran the President's 1988 campaign, said: "I don't think to any extent at all. I say with a very, very straight face: The President is not here for domestic political reasons."
But Mr. Baker hastened to connect the visit to the primary issue of the campaign -- the economy. "In terms of how it will impact economic growth at home, clearly we would love to see that enhanced, and the work that's done here by an American President can help in accomplishing that," he said.

HEADLINE: Boy's Effort to Leave Parents May Rewrite Law

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEESBURG, Fla.

 BODY:
For most of his life, the 11-year-old child known as Gregory K. has bounced from parent to parent, house to house and state to state, hoping to find what he described to state investigators as "a place to be."
Now, in a case that children's advocates hope will give children the right to sue their parents, the boy is seeking to sever all legal ties to his mother and father so that he can be adopted by the foster family he lives with in this small central Florida town. 
 But the suit that has been brought on the boy's behalf is being contested by his 30-year-old mother, who argues that a minor has neither the legal right nor the intellectual capacity to ask a court to strip her of her parental rights.
If the boy cannot legally drink until he is 21 or vote until he is 18, his mother, Rachel K., said in an interview, "What makes him able, at barely half that age, to make a decision like this?" The mother, whose last name is not disclosed in court papers, said she had placed the boy and her two other children in the state's care for financial reasons and only temporarily.
The first formal hearing on whether Gregory K. has such rights is not scheduled until later this month in Orlando, an hour's drive from this quiet town of 15,000 people.
But the case has already set off an intense debate among legal experts and children's advocates around the nation. Many of these experts fear that a ruling that gives a minor legal standing to sue would allow thousands of other children to seek what the press has been calling a "divorce" from their parents.
 
Suits for 'Malparenting'?
 It's a term that makes one legal expert, Howard Davidson, executive director of the American Bar Association's Center on Children and the Law, uneasy.
"Although I think it is important that kids be recognized under the law and treated with the same dignity accorded adults," Mr. Davidson said, "I'm not sure that drawing parallels with divorce is not a way to alienate most Americans and frighten most parents to death. Where do you draw the line? Could we then see civil actions for malparenting? How do you define what negligent parenting is? It's very, very difficult."
Across the United States each year, courts agree that thousands of children should be separated from their parents and that their custody should be awarded to other people. In Florida and many other states, this is usually accomplished in proceedings in which a state-appointed guardian or a state agency petitions for a change of custody on a child's behalf.
The case of Gregory K. is unique because the boy and his lawyer claim he has a constitutional right to have his own views presented in court instead of being forced to accept what parents, legal guardians or other adults see as a child's best interests.
 
Seeing Children as People
 "Gregory's position on this matter is different than that of the state or his parents, and the system has not satisfied his needs in this case," said Jerri A. Blair, the boy's lawyer. "I'm not contending that children's rights are absolute across the board. But they have to be recognized as people, with rights in court that are of the same stature as the parents'."
Jane E. Carey and Harry H. Morall, a pair of Orlando lawyers appointed by the State of Florida to represent Rachel K., say that granting Gregory legal standing to sue, could lead to cases in which children are themselves sued.
"This could be a very dangerous precedent," Ms. Carey said. "You know, I'm a child advocate, too, but you can go too far with anything. America is in the shape it is because we don't have a strong family unit. So are we going to allow ourselves to buy into this, which is only going to destroy the family even more?"
Gregory's foster father, a lawyer who has handled many family law cases, said the boy is merely seeking "the rights to which any person is entitled under the United States and Florida constitutions," beginning with the right to a lawyer. He and the children's advocates who have endorsed Gregory's suit argue that the rights to due process, equal protection, privacy and exemption from cruel and unusual punishment apply to minors just as they do to adults.
 
A Right to Be Heard
 "If Gregory is old enough to say what he wants and doesn't want, why aren't people willing to accept that?" asked Karen Adams, national coordinator of the National Child Rights Alliance, a group that consists mainly of adults who suffered abuse as children and that has filed a brief in support of the boy. She said the group believes that children should have the right to be heard in court just as soon as they learn to talk.
"We have had experience with children as young as 3 years old saying, 'I don't want to live here anymore,' " Ms. Adams said. "We feel that all children should have the right to know what their civil rights are and have access to the people who can help them assert those rights."
While acknowledging that the action is "akin" or "tantamount" to a divorce in that it severs the relationship between members of a family, Gregory's lawyer also argues that there are important differences.
"The standard of proof is different," Ms. Blair said. "Irreconcilable differences are not grounds enough" for a termination of the relationship between parent and child, though they are often sufficient to dissolve a marriage. "The child has to show clear and convincing evidence of abandonment, abuse or neglect."
 
Father Relinquished Custody
 Apart from the legal wrangling, the suit involves circumstances common to many custody actions.
Gregory's natural father signed a form in May relinquishing all rights to his son, who has not lived with him for four years.
Gregory's foster father of the last nine months says that he and his wife have become Gregory's "psychological parents" and that the boy has formed emotional ties with them that should not be broken.
In his suit, Gregory asks for "termination of the parent-child relationship" with his mother on the ground that he has been the victim of neglect and "mental and emotional abuse" on her part. His mother, a waitress, is described as "a victim of alcohol and drug abuse" who "developed an intimate relationship with her female roommate" and "chose to continue the relationship rather than keep" Gregory and two younger brothers.
Rachel K. said she had left Florida and was now living in her home state near relatives who help her care for the two younger boys. She said she was also engaged to be married. Gregory's complaint describes Rachel K.'s fiance as a "live-in paramour." It says he has been convicted of armed robbery and drug possession, has "a possible past history of alcohol abuse" and is unemployed.
Rachel K. called the descriptions of her personal and sexual habits "a lie."
As for her fiance, she said, it is true that "he was a young man, and he did a couple of wrong things," but "it's been eight years since the last thing happened" and "he's never been in trouble since."
"He's a grown man with a job now, and he has been a wonderful father," she said.
Rachel K. acknowledged that she had seen little of Gregory but contended that that was because Gregory's father had run away with Gregory when the boy was 4 years old.
In general, the State of Florida will allow adoption of foster children after a finding of abuse, abandonment or neglect against the parents. Rachel K. says she was guilty of none of these things.
"I was trying to care for the children alone, on a waitress's pay, and I failed," she said. "I've had no financial support. I never received any child support from the father. I didn't qualify for welfare. And there was a year's waiting list to get on public housing. I was between a rock and a hard place. There was no money to pay for the bills, and we were living hand to mouth every day."
As Rachel K. sees it, the dispute over Gregory is about class and privilege. After a life of hardship, she said, her son is dazzled by the material goods that have been bestowed on him since he moved into his foster father's house, the home of a lawyer with the money to provide comfortably for eight children of his own.
"His brothers go swimming at the public pool, and Gregory goes swimming at the country club," she said. "Which would you rather do if you were 11 years old? You'd want the same things if you were a little kid and had gone from being poor to having Nintendo and a little water bed of your own. I wasn't even able to buy my kids a bike, and in a child's world those are big things."
Gregory's lawyer and foster father have declined to make the boy available for comment, saying that to do so could give the State of Florida ground to remove him from his foster home. But in an interview at his law offices here, Gregory's foster father rejected the notion that the boy's love or allegiance had been bought.
"This whole thing is riddled with false premises," he said. "It's a fallacy to say that children will sue their parents because they want new Reeboks and can't get them. Children want to get away from abusive parents for the same reasons that abused spouses do, and to presume the reason is material things is ridiculous and shallow minded."
He said that the suit was Gregory's idea and that "he has chosen to do it this way" because "he hopes other children can be spared from what has happened to him."
But Rachel K. said that she, too, is "a victim of the system," and that society should be willing to make amends to her.
"I'm a good mother who's been dealt a crummy hand in life so far and is trying to turn that around," she said. "I've had to fight my whole life to make it, and I won't give up now. A woman making it on her own with three children, it's not easy. If they want a fight, then they've got one. That's my son, my firstborn child, and I'm never giving him up."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MUNICH: Reporter's Notebook;
Yeltsin Quickens Tempo of a Diplomatic Lullaby

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 7

 BODY:
The economic summit meetings of the seven industrial democracies, begun 17 years ago in France, are facing a crisis of credibility. With all the talk, pomp and expense, accompanied this year by scant action, people are asking: Where's the beef?
The nearest thing, it seemed, was President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. In an unusual twist, the head of an economy in virtually complete chaos, with an "inflation rate" of 640 percent in the past four months, was welcomed today by the Group of Seven as a potential savior. 
 Unable to agree on anything to revive the sagging world economy, the leaders were at least hoping to save face by offering President Yeltsin an initial $1 billion in aid, promises of imminent debt rescheduling and a place at their dinner table. They did not, however, offer to pay Mr. Yeltsin's estimated $400-a-night hotel bill -- nearly three times his 18,900-ruble monthly salary.
Although the welcome was warm, some questions were being quietly posed about Mr. Yeltsin's presence. "How do you coordinate economic policy with a country that does not even have a market economy?" asked the Italian Prime Minister, Giuliano Amato.
Other officials promised that Mr. Yeltsin would face some tough questions along with the food, the Bavarian beer and the blandishments. The Japanese want to know when Russia will hand back four Pacific islands seized at the end of World War II. And the United States wants to know when 130,000 Russian troops still in the Baltic states will be withdrawn.
Nobody is quite ready to expand the Group of Seven to a Group of Eight. But everybody, it seems, needs President Yeltsin to distract them from routine. Even the black-tie requirement for the gala dinner was waived in the case of the Russian President, who did not bring one.
 
Communique as Band-Aid
 President Bush tried hard to achieve something beyond the support of Russia's reforms: He vowed that the three days of discussions, originally intended as "fireside chats" but now transformed into lavish extravaganzas, would produce jobs for Americans.
Others sought to resolve issues ranging from the menace of the former Soviet Union's nuclear reactors to the world refugee problem. But difficulties abounded.
The disarray was summed up by the French text of the summit's statement on Yugoslavia, which stated: "The humanitarian solution in Bosnia and Herzegovina is tragic and unacceptable." Only hours later was a correction circulated: "The humanitarian situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is tragic and unacceptable."
 
Shall We Play It Again?
 Nowhere were the difficulties more apparent than on the question of the deadlocked talks on world trade.
Everyone agreed that differences between France and the United States on farm subsidies had narrowed and all that was needed was a "political push."
But President Francois Mitterrand faces a referendum on European union in September and President Bush an election in November, and both want the support of farmers. So the push was pushed back.
This left a delicate problem for the drafters of the final communique, which is due on Wednesday: How to encapsulate the progress and the new determination in a way that would distinguish these talks from the last four summits?
In Toronto in 1988, the leaders said of the so-called Uruguay Round of talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: "It is of decisive importance to safeguard the dynamism of these ambitious negotiations."
A year later, in Paris: "We commit ourselves unreservedly to further substantial progress in the Uruguay Round so that it can be successfully concluded by the end of 1990."
In 1990, in Houston: "The successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round has top priority on the world political agenda."
And last year, in London: "No question has more far-reaching implications for the future prospects of the global economy than the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round."
What now? Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said, enigmatically, that the language would be "more forward-leaning."
 
Big Bad Bush
 President Bush tried to lift the mood with a sociable jog in a Munich sports club. Even there, he was not a complete hit.
Joined on lap 2 by a girl named Nicole Lechl, the President had to watch as the 4-year-old burst into tears and ran to her father after about 10 yards.
Asked after eight laps what he was taking home from the summit, the President replied laconically: "About what we thought when we came."

HEADLINE: Car Buyers Drift Back, Raising Detroit's Hopes;
One City's Dealers See Modest Gains But Meager Profits

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALLENTOWN, Pa., July 7

 BODY:
Policy makers groping to understand how auto sales could be rising even as more Americans are losing their jobs could do at least as well consulting Steven M. Parr as their statistician or economist.
"We had a great June," he said today at the Haldeman Ford dealership here, tapping a well-polished loafer on the floor for emphasis. "Our sales staff is charged up. The buyers are there." 
 But ask Mr. Parr, the general manager, about the dealership's income, and the tapping stops. "Maybe once you made $400 or $500 on a car," he said. "Now you'll take $100," he added with the wounded tone of an accomplished salesman laid low by hard times.
No wonder that if the nation is, indeed, in a recovery, few car dealers or other business people are celebrating. Consumers may be buying, but so grudgingly that neither they nor the dealers are enjoying it much.
"Customers are less emotional these days," said Andrew M. Scott, the general manager of Scott Chevrolet, Chrysler-Plymouth and Saab, stretching along Lehigh Street, also known as Auto Mile. "People shop so much they get tired out. It's not fun."
 
Buyers Stick to Demands
 At age 38, Mr. Scott already has a deeply lined brow (though having six children may have something to do with it). As he talked, salespeople trooped in with worksheets from customers who had priced the same cars at as many as four other dealers. Having nearly met one couple's demand for a break on a five-year lease, he fidgeted as Joseph Albino, a salesman, told him the customers were sticking to their demands.
"That's only $1.65 a month difference," Mr. Scott said.
"The wife says that's $1.65 a month, for 60 months," Mr. Albino responded.
Because the half-million residents of the industrial belt that straddles the Lehigh River here tend to be serious about their cars, auto dealers and shoppers are especially sensitive gauges of the economy's broader health. "They are more likely to spend that raise on a new car than vacations in Europe," Mr. Scott said.
Tight economic times pinch hard here, a feeling that inspired Billy Joel's song "Allentown" a decade ago. The most recent available unemployment rate for Allentown was 9.1 percent in April, compared with 7.1 percent nationally.
But for those who still have jobs at Bethlehem Steel, Mack Trucks, Air Products and Chemicals and other manufacturers, average hourly wages of $11.41 are 9 cents better than the national average.
As John Powell's hourly salary in a print shop has gone from $7 to $17.80 over seven years, he has traded cars every few years. Now, with print shop orders improving, he has enough confidence to ask the Scott dealership about trading in his 1989 Camaro for a new Beretta GTZ.
"Someday I'm going to get one of those black beauties," he said, pointing to a Corvette glistening in the sun.
 
Iacocca's Kind of Town
 The presence of major manufacturers threatened by imports makes Allentown the sort of market Detroit used to enjoy everywhere. Auto Mile has one dealer for Honda and none for Toyota, while Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick, Ford and Chrysler signs are more plentiful than stoplights.
Dealers say that the Allentown area -- where Lee A. Iacocca was born and grew up -- gives Chrysler its highest market share in the nation.
The salesmen at Valley Honda say they are doing well. But as they chatted idly in their lot, in voices loud enough to be heard above the din of traffic, they watched most of the customers stream into the Ford dealership nearby. The Honda salespeople constantly remind reluctant customers that many of their cars are made in Ohio, in part from materials furnished by Bethlehem Steel.
 
Far Below the Sticker
 Mr. Parr's Ford dealership can boast of selling 160 cars in June, up from 120 or so during several of the previous months. But to get customers like Elna Brooks to buy a new Mercury Sable or Ford Taurus, he has to run newspaper advertisements offering to sell a car with a $20,000 sticker price for $15,999, before the negotiating even starts. "That's pretty much a rock-bottom price," acknowledged Mrs. Brooks, as a salesman led her out to a Caribbean-green Taurus LX for a test drive.
Mr. Parr had drilled his salesmen just that morning to talk up the practical safety features of the Taurus and Sable, and Mrs. Brooks was receptive. "I am thrilled to get a car with two air bags," she said.
Mr. Parr said that attracting customers requires more training for salesmen, who in turn have to spend more time with each customer.
The dealers do say they have gotten some help from Washington in the form of lower interest rates. With payments more affordable, the dealers say, more buyers are looking for new cars, rather than used models.
Ralph Paiz was rushing out of the Scott Chevrolet dealership to see if he could qualify for his bank's 9 percent financing on a new Astro van. A moving company had just promoted him, and he wanted to be done with his dented Chevrolet Blazer.
An hour later, Mr. Albino, the salesman, walked into Mr. Scott's office and said, "You know the deal I thought I'd throw up against the wall and see if it stuck," Mr. Albino said. "Well, it's stuck."

Parr, left, the dealership's general manager, shown at the morning sales meeting, said, "The dealer's profit is down because of the economy." (Photographs by William E. Sauro/The New York Times)

Carter Hawley Gives Debt Plan

 BODY:
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. outlined a plan of reorganization yesterday that would help it emerge from bankruptcy protection sometime in September.
The plan will eliminate almost $600 million in debt from the department store company's balance sheet by distributing 35 million shares, worth $350 million, in the reorganized company to creditors and stockholders. 
 The Zell/Chilmark Fund, the investment fund that last year spent $280 million to buy 80 percent of the bankrupt company's debt, will own 75 percent of the shares if the plan is approved.
The plan is likely to face little or no opposition since Zell/Chilmark is by far the company's largest unsecured creditor and since its two largest secured creditors, Prudential and the Bank of America, have already signed off on it.
"This reorganization plan is designed to enable Carter Hawley Hale to move forward on a financially sound basis so that it can compete vigorously in its markets," said Philip M. Hawley, chairman and chief executive.
The plan also includes a $325 million, five-year store renovation and modernization program, financed in part by a $50 million cash investment from Zell-Chilmark, which is part of the $350 million in equity. If the plan is approved, the fund will kick in the money in exchange for five million shares, which will bring its stake to 75 percent. Carter Hawley ran into problems when it took on large amounts of long-term debt to evade a hostile takeover bid by The Limited Inc. in 1987.
Then its stores -- the Broadway in Southern California and Arizona, the Emporium chain in the San Francisco area and Weinstocks in the Sacramento region -- were hurt during the recession.
In bankruptcy, the company closed a handful of unprofitable stores and consolidated the operations of three divisions into a single unit.

HEADLINE: Carrots for Castro

BYLINE: By Wayne S. Smith; Wayne S. Smith, chief of the U.S. interests section in Havana from 1979-1982, is director of Cuban studies at The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Even in the case of Cuba, the cold war should be over. The island is no longer a problem to us or others. Cuban troops are out of Africa. Cuban support for revolutionary groups in Latin America is finished. Cuban-Russian military ties are no longer a matter of concern.
None of this, however, has resulted in any change in U.S. policy. The Administration has moved the goal posts and now says that only after Cuba has a market economy and has held fully democratic elections can there be any change in our approach. 
 Congress hasn't seemed to notice the change in Cuba's situation either. It is considering a bill that would allow the President to impose sanctions against Canada, Britain and other major friends and allies unless they reduce their economic relations with Havana. Elizardo Sanchez and Gustavo Arcos, Cuba's leading human rights advocates, oppose the legislation, which is sponsored by Representative Robert Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, and endorsed by the Administration and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. The two Cubans argue that the measure would stir up Cuban nationalism and help President Fidel Castro rally support.
And to no gain, since the legislation would not work. Why would we want to complicate relations with vital friends and trading partners over an island of little importance?
Does this make sense? Of course not. But it's an election year, and the bill is the brainchild of the ultra-conservative -- and ultra-rich -- Cuban-American National Foundation. It doesn't matter that the organization, which speaks for a minority of Cubans in the U.S., has misjudged the island for a long time. In February, Jorge Mas Canosa, the head of the foundation, assured an audience at the Heritage Foundation that the Cuban economy would collapse by summer. It hasn't.
What matters is that Mr. Mas Canosa's foundation has lots of money to put in campaign coffers. Federal Elections Commission records indicate that foundation members have contributed substantially to Mr. Torricelli. Increasingly, the organization defines our policy toward Cuba.
Ronald Reagan said the best way to bring about reform in South Africa was through constructive engagement. He was right. George Bush says the same of China, which has a worse human rights record than Cuba. It is only when the subject is Cuba that Mr. Bush insists isolation is the best course.
In fact, our policy toward China and Cuba is flawed. Constructive engagement means using carrots and sticks to encourage foreign governments to move in the desired direction. We have a full relationship with China: trade, credits -- the works. Those are the carrots. We should not try to isolate China, but if its leaders do not begin to halt repression, we should limit certain aspects of our relations. Removal of carrots amounts to applying sticks. Unless we apply them, our policy is one-sided and encourages wrongdoing.
Our policy toward Cuba is equally one-sided. But here the problem is an absence of carrots: no diplomatic ties, trade -- anything. We need not rush to put all that in place. But we should at least indicate that we are willing to begin a dialogue and gradually expand relations if Cuba improves its human rights record. That is what Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Arcos, who have spent years in Cuban prisons, have urged. The U.S. could help most, they say, by reducing tensions and offering some carrots. That is the key to the creation of a climate for peaceful change.
Unfortunately, the Administration seems determined to avoid anything so subtle as carrots and sticks. It prefers the blunderbuss -- even one, as in the case of the Torricelli bill, aimed squarely at our own foot.

HEADLINE: Car Buyers Drift Back, Raising Detroit's Hopes;
Buoyed by Figures, Big Three Expand Production Plans

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 7

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation, buoyed by recent strength in the American automotive market, has placed a $100 million bet that vehicle sales will continue to rise. The company announced today that it would expand its light-truck production.
Chrysler's action came a day after late-June retail sales of domestically produced vehicles surged more than 20 percent, compared with the period a year earlier, and auto makers reported a rise in sales for the entire month. Although one 10-day selling period is hardly a harbinger of recovery, several 10-day periods of improving retail sales have fueled demand for vehicles from dealers, whose inventories have dwindled. 
 As it responds to the dealers' demand, Detroit is putting a lot of faith in the sales trend by scheduling the most robust third-quarter production plan in six years. While the goal is to keep inventories one step ahead of demand, the last thing Detroit needs now is to be caught without enough cars to sell to buyers who would be likely to buy elsewhere. But after a year of stunning losses, betting on a recovery by ordering more cars is a dicey -- and expensive -- gamble.
 
Expecting a 17.7% Gain
 Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry trade publication, estimated production scheduled at North American plants for the third quarter, which began a week ago, at 2.99 million cars and trucks, including output at plants in Mexico and Canada.
If that schedule holds, it would result in a 17.7 percent increase from the third quarter of 1991 in the number of vehicles built.
Ward's estimated that the number of weeks that assembly plants will be idled by the Big Three in the third quarter is down 20 percent. The number of weeks of down time in the second quarter was off more than 50 percent from a year earlier, sharply reducing the unemployment benefits paid to hourly workers.
Even if third-quarter projections are met, Ward's said, the vehicle production total for the year to date remains relatively weak, because the first half was so sluggish. That means that auto makers' earnings, which depend on production volume, are not likely to be strong this year.
"No question, things are better," said Jerry Paul, an automotive analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York. "It's just a question of how much and how quickly sales will accelerate."
Sales began to improve last year, but then dropped steeply and unexpectedly in July. Analysts are nervously waiting to see if a decline comes again this year, Mr. Paul said.
 
Saturn Stocks Are Falling
 Several dealers for the General Motors Corporation's Saturn models reported this week that they might soon run out of cars if the rapid pace of sales continued. Saturn has continued to increase its rate of production, aiming at a goal of 1,100 cars a day by the end of the summer. In the latest month, sales peaked at 21,038, which was exceeded only slightly by the monthly production of 21,357 cars at the Saturn division's single assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn.
In its announcement, Chrysler explained that increased optimism about a new full-size pickup truck, known by the code name T300, had resulted in its decision to invest an additional $100 million in an assembly plant in Warren, Mich., at a time when the No. 3 auto maker has little financial cushion. Chrysler had already decided to invest $125 million to prepare the plant for T300 production, which is to begin next year.
Chrysler said it would transfer production tooling from the Warren plant -- now used to build the midsized Dodge Dakota pickup -- to an aging plant in Toledo, Ohio. That will give Chrysler enough capacity at its Warren plant to build as many as 200,000 T300's, up from a planned 160,000.
 
Plant's Future Was Murky
 When Chrysler decided three years ago that it would close its Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit and open one across the street to build a new Jeep utility vehicle, the fate of the Toledo plant, the nation's oldest auto assembly plant, was in doubt. But Chrysler has been able to continue selling an older utility vehicle, the Jeep Cherokee, even after the introduction of its new Grand Cherokee.
Now, with the transfer of the Jeep Wrangler from a Canadian plant to Toledo, and the transfer of most Dakota production there, the future of the Toledo plant appears much brighter. In return, Toledo and the State of Ohio have pledged tax abatements and financial aid.

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges 44.03, to 3,295.17, on Worries Over Earnings

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday as investors appeared shaken by inklings that some second-quarter earnings reports due out next week would be worse than expected.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 44.03 points, or 1.32 percent, to 3,295.17. After having moved upward in the morning, the Dow began slipping shortly after noon, and then dived steeply just before 3 P.M., ending below the 3,300 level. 
 Trading was heavy. On the New York Stock Exchange, 226 million shares changed hands, compared with 186.9 million shares on Monday. Losing issues outnumbered gaining ones by 1,059 to 720.
Among the biggest losers were two companies with depressed earnings estimates for the second quarter: Dillard Department Stores, which fell 3 5/8, to 32 1/2, and Georgia-Pacific, down 4 3/8, to 55. Dillard was down as much as 6 1/8 at one point after analysts cut their earnings projections.
Lower earnings, coming after last week's higher unemployment figures, would be yet another indication of the wobbly nature of the recovery.
"It looks like a lot of companies are going to have depressed earnings reports," said Ricky Harrington, director of equity investments at Marion Bass Securities. "This is the second quarter, the time when most companies were supposed to turn it around."
Some technical analysts are now pointing out dangerous similarities between the current market and the beginning of the deep bear market in 1973. [Market Place, page D6.]
Mr. Harrington said he and some other analysts had interpreted the Federal Reserve's decision last week to lower interest rates as an indication of how weak the economy remained, rather than how inevitable a recovery had become.
"You reach a point where earnings become the driving force, and not interest rates," he said. Low interest rates are widely believed to have driven the market upward earlier this year.
Yesterday's market retreat was broad and was spread evenly among leading stocks. In an unusually uniform trend, 27 of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average fell in price, and only two registered gains, which were minor. United Technologies rose 1/8, to 51, and Union Carbide rose 1/8, to 11 3/8. General Motors was unchanged at 40 3/4.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 4.68 points, or 1.13 percent, to 409.16; the American Stock Exchange index dropped 2.32 points, to 380.26, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.76 points, or 1.02 percent, to 557.41.
Marion Merrell Dow dropped 6 1/8, to 27 3/8, after the Food and Drug Administration instructed the drug company that it needed to warn doctors about potential side-effects caused by its drug Seldane, a popular antihistamine.
Philip Smyth, a market analyst at Birinyi Associates, said he monitored six different computer-generated sell programs yesterday. The largest sell program, he said, began at about 3:30 and involved 140 different stocks, with an average size of about 10,000 shares per trade.
"That took the market down about 17 1/2 points," said Mr. Smyth, noting that the selling involved a total of about 1.4 million shares.
 
Effects of Arbitrage
 Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Mutual Funds in Boston, said that the selling was accelerated by arbitrage -- or trading on a discrepancy in price between two similar financical instruments -- once the price of the S.& P. September futures contracts dropped faster than the S.& P. cash index of leading stocks.
Mr. Freedman said many traders programmed computers to order selling once the discrepancy between the two prices got as high as 40 cents. Yesterday, it grew to $1.26.
Among the Dow 30, the biggest loser was International Paper, which fell 2 1/4, to 65 3/4, after Georgia-Pacific, another paper company, reported that second-quarter net income would be only "slightly better than break even" and well below the 38 cents a share earned a year earlier.
Circuit City Stores fell 3, to 28 1/8, after the electronics retailer reported that same-store sales in June rose only 2 percent, less than expected.
Among over-the-counter stocks, Micrografx lost 60 percent of its value by falling 5 3/4, to 7 3/4, after the company said on Monday that earnings would be below expectations.
Mr. Harrington predicted that if the Dow fell below 3,250, it could fall even more precipitously.
"There are pluses and minuses to lowering interest rates," he said. "After all, our main problem is debt. Why do we want people to borrow more?"
Mr. Freedman sounded a similar tone of pessimism.
"There's been a lack of confidence since those unemployment numbers came out," he said. "The recovery just doesn't seem to be happening."

HEADLINE: Making Work More Attractive: Many Suggestions, Little Money

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Most people agree that there is something wrong with a welfare system that penalizes women like Linda Baldwin for trying to support themselves. But the laws of politics and economics alike have made the problem surprisingly difficult to fix.
There are really only two options for bolstering work incentives: the country can either make welfare less rewarding, or it can make work more so. Both choices pose difficulties. 
 "Either you have to cut welfare benefits incredibly low, and then you risk hurting the people you're trying to help," said Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Northwestern University. "Or the Government has to get in the business of permanently subsidizing the wages of low-income mothers, and that's very expensive."
In fact, policymakers have at different times tried bits of both strategies. For several decades, inflation has quietly eroded the value of welfare and food stamps, and budget cuts in some states are now accelerating that process. In 1991, a mother with two children qualified for an average of $7,471 a year in combined welfare and food stamp benefits. That is 27 percent less, accounting for inflation, than the amount two decades earlier.
 
Wages Are Lower, Too
 On the face of it, the erosion of benefits should raise the incentive to work. But wages for low-skilled workers have also eroded. That leaves welfare mothers with less attractive options both on welfare and off it.
Both Democratic and Republican Governors now advocate plans that would allow working welfare mothers to keep larger portions of their grants. But some of this strategy has already been tried. From 1967 to 1981, Congress allowed welfare mothers to keep the first $30 they earned, and a third of the rest, without having it counted toward their welfare benefits.
Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, and Jimmy Carter all backed proposals that would strengthened this incentive by allowing welfare mothers to keep half of their earnings without penalty. But in each case, the proposals were tied to doomed plans for a guaranteed national income.
In 1981, President Reagan led a successful drive for the repeal of the incentive, arguing that women who were able to work should do so and not receive welfare at all. Studies of the repeal's effect have suggested that the incentive, in any case, did not play a major role in decisions about working.
More recently, efforts to bolster work incentives have focused not on the welfare rules but on strategies that support all low-income workers. One Congressional strategy has been to raise the minimum wage, to $4.25 an hour. But this level is still 23 percent lower than the average minimum wage during the 1970's.
Another strategy has been to expand the earned income tax credit, which provides an annual payment to workers with low earnings. By 1994 a family with two children will be able to receive as much as $2,008 a year from the credit.
 
Expanded Medicaid
 While there is substantial bipartisan support for expansions of the credits, economists warn of inherent limits. Some, for instance, argue that a large credit can create its own work disincentives, since it could cause workers who receive the credit to cut back on their hours.
Recognizing that the fear of losing their health insurance keeps many welfare recipients from working, Congress has also expanded the Medicaid program. It now covers all children in poverty born after September 30, 1983, whether their mothers are on welfare or not. That is why Ms. Baldwin's youngest son, born in 1987, qualifies for Medicaid, while her older children do not.
But the mothers can keep their Medicaid only for a year after leaving welfare, and most low-skilled jobs do not provide insurance. While more recipients would work if they could get subsidized health care, there is little agreement about how to do this, or where to find the money.
There are many other proposals to bolster work incentives. Some would expand subsidized day care for working mothers. Others would try to bolster the collection of child support payments from absent fathers, which, unlike welfare, are not cut when mothers take jobs.
But motivated by budget problems, many states are now altering work incentives through a different approach: plain cuts. In California, where a $663 monthly payment for a family of three is among the nation's highest, Governor Pete Wilson, a Republican, is advocating cuts of as much as 25 percent.

Cemex Acquiring Spain's Top Cement Producer

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORELIA, Mexico, July 7

 BODY:
Cementos Mexicanos S.A., the giant Mexican cement company, announced today that it would spend as much as $1.25 billion to take over the leading cement producer in Spain.
After intense negotiations with Spanish shareholders over the weekend, Cemex, as the Mexican company is known, acquired 24.9 percent of Compania Valenciana de Cementos Portland S.A. on Monday for 14,850 pesetas, or about $157, a share. It did not disclose the total price, but said it had received commitments for an additional 29.1 percent. 
 Cemex said it would make a tender offer with Citibank for all the publicly held shares of Valenciana at 15,075 pesetas a share. If all are sold, Cemex officials said, the entire purchase would be worth about $1.25 billion. (Valenciana's stock closed on Monday in Madrid at 14,950 pesetas a share.)
The acquisition gives Cemex a foothold in Europe, home to some of its leading competitors, including the Swiss giant Holderbank. But the move apparently perturbed Mexican and foreign investors, who have snapped up Cemex shares primarily because of its 63 percent dominance of the booming Mexican market.
The company's B-series shares, held by foreign investors, fell 10.4 percent today on the Mexican stock exchange; the A series, restricted to Mexican owners, fell 9.9 percent.
The drop in Cemex's shares helped pull Mexican stock prices down across the board. The Bolsa index of 40 issues fell 58.72 points, or 3.51 percent, to close at 1,614.19.
"Cemex is a very sophisticated company, but investors think they got a little too aggressive with this one," said Jorge Suarez Velez, director of the Latin America department at Nomura Research in New York.
Valenciana holds 14 percent of the Spanish cement market, a fraction more than its nearest rival. Speculation that Cemex was after that rival, Sanson, S.A., paused last Wednesday when Apax, the cement division of Unifund, a Swiss consortium, placed a public offer to buy Sanson for a reported $623 million.
A spokesman for Cemex, Luis Martinez, said he did not know whether the company was interested in Sanson.
 
$1.7 Billion in Sales
 For several years, Cemex has followed a strategy of expanding through acquisitions, building itself into the fourth-largest cement producer in the world, with $1.7 billion in annual sales. Until today, the biggest of its buys was Empresas Tolteca, its main competitor in Mexico, for which it paid $663 million in 1989.
Cemex has also bought smaller concrete and ready-mix plants in the Southwestern United States. But its exports, held back by anti-dumping duties levied against it by the United States International Trade Commission in October 1990, accounted for only 2.9 percent of its sales last year.
The company's profits jumped 164 percent last year, to about $450 million, and its ambitions have risen apace. Before this week, it had planned to spend $2 billion on new investments and expansion in the next five years.
Some stock analysts in Mexico City and New York argued that while the acquisition might have diluted Cemex's status as an especially pure investment in Mexican economic growth, it was expanding into a Spanish-speaking country with considerable potential of its own.
"They have shown that they can acquire companies, make them more efficient, reduce their operating costs and also know how to time the financing," said one Mexico City broker who has been bullish on Cemex.
Nomura's Mr. Suarez Velez, however, wondered about that.
"It's a little risky," he said of the deal. "The cement industry in Spain has been very weak. Valenciana is a company that's way behind in technology, so Cemex will have to make a considerable investment to bring it up to international standards."

HEADLINE: TENSION IN WASHINGTON HEIGHTS;
Events Don't Surprise Dominican Residents

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
"The glass is full and it has started to spill," said Manuel Viera, citing a Dominican saying as he reflected on the anger and violence that have erupted in his community since Jose Garcia was shot to death by a plainclothes police officer on Friday night.
"All this was coming, with all the problems we've been having," said Mr. Viera, who owns a travel agency in Washington Heights. "The death of that man filled the glass." 
 The violence that erupted may have jolted the rest of the city like a splash of ice-cold water, but the residents of Washington Heights say they have long seen it accumulating. Residents and community advocates said that police harassment was common, sometimes provoked only by walking down the street or standing on a stoop. They added that despite the law-enforcement focus on drug dealing, the deeper-seated problems with affordable housing, day care, overcrowded schools and high unemployment remain unaddressed, heightening the needs and frustrations of a rapidly growing community.
 
Struggle Without Respect
 Mr. Viera's travel agency sits on Amsterdam Avenue, near 156th Street, a bustling area crowded with bodegas, car services, clothing shops, restaurants and auto-parts stores that represent the labors of a people eager to claim their stake in American society. His partner, Jesus Rodriguez, fretted that despite these signs of legitimate economic struggle, too many people deny his community the respect it deserves, focusing only on the steely-faced youths who cluster on street corners with beepers and a swift, surreptitious sales pitch.
"We're in the United States, but we still lack a lot," said Mr. Rodriguez. "We are marginalized."
Outside the building, at 505 West 162d Street, where Mr. Garcia was shot, scores of people swirled about the street, sometimes breaking into Spanish chants of "no justice, no peace" and "united in combat." Facing the building was a mural in memory of Kiko, Mr. Garcia's nickname.
Radames Marte and Rafael Geminian leaned against the freshly painted mural, casually scanning the crowd. Neither condoned the violence that broke out after the killing, but they said they understood its source.
"There's no other way for the government to listen to us," Mr. Marte said. "There have been too many abuses."
Mr. Geminian said that last month he walked six blocks to his sister's apartment to take a bath when the hot water failed in his apartment on 157th Street. As he left her buillding, he said, a police officer stopped him and asked him where he lived.
"So what are you doing here?" he said the officer replied.
Although he said he was only there to take a bath, the police officer remained suspicious.
"He said if he ever saw me again he'd break my face," Mr. Geminian said.
Altagracia Sanchez, who has lived in the neighborhood for 10 years, stood nearby, shaking her head as she watched the growing crowd of protesters. "This is it," she said of the abuses that she says her community has endured over the years. "Things can't stay like this."
Ms. Sanchez said that last September she was double-parked on 181st Street when a police officer started to write her a ticket. She talked him out of it, but he took a parting verbal shot before she drove away.
"You have money; you have a nice car," she said he told her. "You earn that easy."
The implication that she was dealing drugs was too much for Ms. Sanchez, who pays her bills working two jobs and is going to school at night to study accounting. She recounted how she took out her Social Security card and challenged the officer to run her name through the computer.
Dennis DeLeon, the city's Human Rights Commisioner, said there had long been reports of police mistreatment of residents of the area, but in some cases, people held in their anger rather than report it to authorities.
 
An Insulting CharacterizationImplication
 Most frustrating, he said, was the characterization of the neighborhood as populated only by drug users and sellers. "It's an accumulation of years of seeing the words 'drug dealer' with the word 'Dominican' right after it," said Mr. DeLeon.
At a meeting of community advocates and politicians yesterday morning at Public School 28, there was animated debate on how best to address the situation. Most wanted to channel their efforts into public forums and prayer services. But some wanted a demonstration through the neighborhood and up to the 34th Precinct station house.
Yolanda Pineda, a member of the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans, worried that it would be difficult to control the anger. She added that some residents had told her they were scared of outbursts by youths.
Some community advocates said they hoped that the events of the last few days would prod elected officials and other city residents to understand their concerns better.
As he walked down Amsterdam Avenue, he reeled off a list of the area's concerns: inadequate day care, high unemployment, scant affordable housing, overcrowded schools, the city's largest concentration of teen-agers, and the neighborhood's dubious honor of leading the city in homicides.

With Smile on Face, and Foot in Door

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
IN two decades, Amal Martelli has sold 2,800 sets of World Book Encyclopedias and seems to be just hitting her stride. She sat on a couch in an apartment in Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan, surrounded by sales paraphernalia, making a soft, not unsubtle pitch.
"I'm here because of you, not because of your daddy," she assured 5-year-old Michael Hood. "You are the important person here for me." 
 She complimented him on his grasp of letters and numbers, gave him a poster and introduced him to Zak, a hand puppet. She unveiled what she called a magic pencil. "I have one of those," Michael said dismissively.
"It's not exactly the same," Ms. Martelli insisted. "It's the same principle."
She changed the subject. "Do you like animals, Michael?" she purred. "No," he answered.
The saleswoman, revealing no exasperation, turned her attention to the man with the checkbook, Dan Hood. She displayed such an array of educational aids it seemed impossible they wouldn't automatically spawn Einsteins.
The message rang like a bell. "A lot of families are interested in raising their children's intelligence," she said sweetly.
There was no immediate sale. She left them Volume A of the encyclopedia, as well as a quiz on its contents. She would return soon for them. Her foot was still decidedly in the door.
Ms. Martelli says one in three calls result in sales, compared with an average of one in five for World Book sales people. The key is persistence, to plant a seed and keep calling back.
Her doggedness had been manifest earlier when the Hoods were late because of a broken bus. She made a beeline to the playground of the apartment complex, spotted a mother with twins and struck up a conversation. "What a unique experience twins must be!" she chirped.
She left brochures. "A little dent has been made," she said.
Ms. Martelli is part of an economic sector surprisingly insulated from downturns. Even as times get worse, overall sales hold up because more people are willing to go door to door, and push that much harder to sell everything from vacuum cleaners to toothbrushes.
"A slow economy is to our benefit," said Steve Wilson, zone manager for World Book Educational Products. "There is no such thing as a layoff."
And door-to-door sales are certainly no drop in the bucket. They exceeded $12 billion last year, up 13 percent from 1988, according to the Direct Selling Association.
In New York City, people are even willing to swallow hard and summon the unimaginable courage to knock on the door of a stranger. "That's how you sharpen your wits," Ms. Martelli said of randomly ringing bells.
Not that she doesn't take precautions as she makes her rounds of the entire East Side. When she feels an area or building might be dangerous, she never travels alone.
But is she afraid? "No, it's exciting," Ms. Martelli insisted.
If some people are born to sell, this cheerful 57-year-old resident of Flushing, Queens, is not one of them. She was born in Argentina, the daughter of an engineer. She studied in Florida, and became a microbiology researcher at New York University.
In addition to English, she speaks Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian and German. She drew the intricate illustrations that accompanied her scientific team's articles.
But the university hired outsiders to do more of the drawing, and her income declined. A friend told her about the World Book opportunity, and Ms. Martelli sold her first set of encyclopedias in 1972. She continued part time until 1986.
She then started full time, and her responsibilities came to include supervising a sales staff of 25. She received medical insurance, a pension and other benefits in a position that World Book says pays some more than $100,000 annually, including commissions. Part-timers working 10 to 15 hours a week average $10,000 to $15,000 in commissions.
One of them is Mary Ann Latorre, whom Ms. Martelli was training the day they visited the Hoods. The student was learning her lessons well.
"We don't want to make it seem like we're selling anything," she said.
This is only one of the tricks Ms. Martelli has collected from the school of soft knocks. She has learned to quickly bail out if a deal seems unlikely, that boyfriends seldom want to spend money on the education of a woman's children, that it never pays to argue with a potential customer.
And to play down the fact that World Books cost $599 to $899, depending on binding. "I'm not talking money now," she assured Mr. Hood. "But how do you feel about Michael growing up with these?"

Interest Rates Continue to Slide

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Interest rates slipped again yesterday, as investors continued to buy dollar-denominated fixed-income securities despite a drop in the dollar to its lowest level in more than a year.
Aside from Treasury issues, demand was said to be strong for nearly $4 billion worth of new corporate bonds priced yesterday and around $1 billion of new tax-exempt municipal bonds. 
 While the dollar's decline has not deterred domestic investors from continuing to pour money into the Treasury, corporate and tax-exempt bond markets, traders said weakness in the currency pursuaded foreign investors to look elsewhere.
"This is a domestic-led bond rally," said Nick Sargen, a managing director at Global Fixed Income Advisors, a unit of Prudential Insurance with more than $5 billion under management. "I see no evidence of foreign investors flocking in. But for globally oriented companies like ours, who are based here, we have been shifting our allocations into the United States and other dollar-bloc bond markets, because the recovery here is proving to be even more muted than expected."
Comments by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in Munich yesterday seemed to suggest that the dollar might become even weaker in order to stimulate the economy.
"We have had 6.5 percentage points worth of monetary policy over the last three years, with little result, and fiscal policy is still on the back burner because of the deficit," said Joseph A. Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg & Company.
"So now it seems we are going to try some dollar devaluation to get things going here," he said. "And the Treasury is doing about as much as it can to talk the dollar down."
Under different circumstances, a drop in the value of the dollar might stir inflation fears among fixed-income investors. But expectations are high that a Government report Friday will show that prices at the wholesale level remained quite tame in June. And yesterday oil prices fell sharply.
 
Positive Inflation Outlook
 Despite the positive inflation outlook, investors in the Treasury securities market continue to favor parking money in short-to-intermediate- term securities rather than in more speculative long-term bonds, even though the interest rate spread between those maturities has widened to record widths.
Late yesterday, the yield spread between outstanding two-year notes and 30-year bonds stood at a staggering 3.27 percentage points.
"We aren't calling it a yield curve any more," Mr. Liro said. "Now it's a yield pole, because it's just too steep to be a curve. "
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 21/32 , up 6/32 , to yield 7.60 percent, compared with 7.61 percent late Monday.
Among outstanding note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 21/32 , up 10/32 , to yield 6.84 percent. The 6 3/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 102 5/32 , up 12/32 , to yield 5.86 percent, breaking through lows set in January. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 1/4, up 6/32 , to yield 4.33 percent.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the $9.75 billion worth of new seven-year Treasury notes to be auctioned today were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.40 percent.
Yields on seven-year notes were at comparable levels at a seven-year note auction in January, but then shot up by a full percentage point over the next few months.
Mindful of recent history, traders said yields on the new Treasury securities may well move higher before the auction.
Elsewhere, predictions late last week that the Federal Reserve's move to cut short-term interest rates would energize companies to price new debt issues are being borne out.
Yesterday, just under $4 billion of new issues were priced, following the more than $1 billion that were sold on Monday.
By far the biggest issuer yesterday was the Province of Quebec, which offered $750 million worth of 10-year notes through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company. The 7 1/2 percent notes were priced at $99.765, to yield 7.534 percent, 68 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The issue is rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Lehman Brothers acted as lead manager for a $250 million 10-year subordinated note offering by the Republic New York Corporation. The 7 1/4 percent noncallable securities were priced at $99.002, to yield 7.393 percent, 55 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's and AA- by Standard & Poor's.
 
Bonds of Georgia
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the State of Georgia conducted the day's largest competitive bid debt sale, offering a total of $291.91 million worth of bonds. A bid from a group led by Lehman Brothers won the securities.
The Georgia bonds were reoffered to investors with yields from 3.60 percent in 1994 to 5.95 percent on bonds maturing from 2009 to 2012. Bonds maturing in 1993, 2002 and 2003 were not reoffered. The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Despite the torrent of new corporate deals, traders said that prices of most outstanding investment-grade debt securities rose by about 1/8 point.
Demand for secondary issues in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was also firm, traders said. They said prices of most widely quoted municipal securities rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.

HEADLINE: Children in Poverty: 1 Million More in 80's

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
The number of American children living in poverty grew by more than 1 million during the 1980's, with rates rising in 33 states, according to an advocacy group's analysis of Census Bureau data.
The group, the Children's Defense Fund, found that the rate of children up to age 18 living in poor families rose by 11.2 percent nationwide from 1979 through 1989. 
 About 18 percent of children in the United States lived in families with incomes below the Federal poverty line in 1989. That included 39.8 percent of all black children, 38.8 percent of American Indian children, 32.2 percent of Hispanic children, 17.1 percent of Asian-American children and 12.5 percent of white children.
The states with the highest child-poverty rates in 1989 were Mississippi, with 33.5 percent; Louisiana, 32.8 percent; New Mexico, 27.5 percent; West Virginia, 25.9 percent, and Arkansas, 25.0 percent.
The lowest rates were in New Hampshire, 7.0 percent; Connecticut, 10.4 percent; Alaska, 10.9 percent; Maryland, 10.9 percent, and New Jersey, 11.0 percent. The rate in New York was 18.8 percent.
The study said the rise in poverty rates was caused by the failure of wages to keep up with inflation and by government cuts in income-support programs.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Worldwide In a Hectic Day of Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar plunged across the board yesterday in hectic trading on world currency markets.
Gold prices also declined. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $346.20 an ounce, off 30 cents an ounce from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold had slipped 20 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $346.20. 
 Traders began selling dollars overnight in Asian markets, and the selling pressure was increased by the Bank of Malaysia's sale of dollars for German marks, analysts said.
"That was just a speculative play," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. But he said it "got the ball rolling" for further dollar selling when trading shifted to European and American markets.
The dollar fell through the important psychological and technical support level of 1.50 German marks, which set off even more selling.
Traders were disappointed by developments at the Group of Seven meeting in Munich, Germany, where finance ministers for leading industrial democracies have gathered. Participants at the summit meeting were largely reticent on issues involving foreign exchange.
"The dollar is in seriously bad shape," Mr. Donney said.
In Tokyo the dollar closed at 124.17 yen, down 0.81 yen from Monday's close. Later in London the dollar was quoted at 124.45 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 124.10 yen, down from 124.35 yen on Monday.
In London the pound rose to $1.9255, from $1.9105 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.9340 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's price of $1.9105.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.4900 German marks, down from 1.5133; 1.3400 Swiss francs, down from 1.3545; 5.0160 French francs, down from 5.0980; 1,126.25 Italian lire, down from 1,145.25, and 1.1948 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2006.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Silver Prices Pushed Lower In Selling Linked to B.C.C.I.

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The spreading stain of the scandal at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International appeared to hurt the international silver market yesterday, pushing prices significantly lower.
Traders said a chain reaction apparently set off by an indictment in the case led to a huge selloff of silver by a Middle Eastern holder of millions of ounces. 
 The sale, which was estimated by traders to have been between five million and seven million ounces, pushed the market to a new low for the year. But it eventually regained some ground before the close of trading in the United States yesterday.
"The market basically just fell apart," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New York.
 
An 18-Month Low
 On New York's Commodity Exchange yesterday, July silver closed at $3.873 an ounce, down 15.5 cents, to the lowest levels since December 1991. During the trading day, the contract hit a low of $3.82 an ounce.
Traders and analysts attributed the dumping in the Middle East to a forced sale of silver brought about by the resignation of the chief operating officer of Saudi Arabia's biggest bank, the National Commercial Bank.
The executive, Sheik Khalid bin Mahfouz and an associate, Haroon Kahlon of London, were indicted last week in New York on charges of defrauding customers at B.C.C.I. of $300 million. Sheik Khalid resigned his position at the Saudi bank yesterday to devote his time to fighting the charges.
Traders and analysts said that Sheik Khalid, like many Arab sheiks, was a speculator in the precious metals markets. After his resignation yesterday, the word among traders was that the National Commercial Bank liquidated Sheik Khalid's entire silver holding.
Sheik Khalid could not be reached at the bank by telephone yesterday. A man answering the phone at the bank's offices in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, said that no one was available to discuss any actions taken by the bank or its customers in the silver market.
The heavy selling from the Middle East was just the latest in the woes of the silver market, which has been struggling unsuccesfully for months to gain upward momentum as the economy has grown stronger.
Traders said that yesterday's selloff will likely hurt the troubled market for the near future. "People are a bit nervous and are going to wait and see if there is any follow-through selling before they get bold and step in and get long," said Jeffrey Klein, the chief dealer for Union Bank of Switzerland.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Safeway Net Down by 6%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., July 7

 BODY:
Safeway Inc. said today that net income fell 6 percent in its fiscal second quarter. The company cited a weak economy, low food prices and increased competition both in the United States and Canada for the drop.
Net income for the quarter, which ended June 13, fell to $33.3 million, or 28 cents a share, from $35.6 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 2 percent, to $3.45 billion, the retail grocery store operator said in a statement. 
 Operating profit fell 14 percent, to $120.5 million, reflecting "continued sluggishness in the economy and low overall food price inflation," Peter A. Magowan, Safeway's chairman, president and chief executive, said. He did not elaborate.
Interest expense fell 20 percent, to $67.5 million, reflecting the company's refinancing last July of $1.6 billion of leveraged-buyout-related debt.
As a result of the lower interest expense, Safeway's ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense improved to 2.96, from 2.56 a year earlier, reflecting increased liquidity.
Shares of Safeway stock fell 12.5 cents each today, to $12.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: In 90's Cuisine, the Farmer Is the Star

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
A BRIEF history of food heroes:
In the 1970's, it was the restaurateur, the man who owned the joint and could give you the best table at the best time. 
 In the 1980's, it was the chef, the man -- or woman -- who looked at cooking as an art, and dinner as a canvas.
In the 1990's, it's the farmer, a perfect walking symbol of something Americans now crave: connection to the earth, labor that produces something genuine and, not incidentally, great food, in season, picked at its peak of flavor.
In culinary circles, knowing the farmer has become more important than knowing how to make a beurre blanc.
Chefs who were once judged by technique, by their ability to deftly mix flour and butter and cream into sauces that would glorify and embellish, are now judged by their ability to enhance, not disguise. A great chef now provides the freshest and best ingredients -- berries off the bushes for only hours, mesclun ripped from the earth when the flavors of the greens combine in the most felicitous way.
Ever more conscious of the importance of ingredients, chefs meet with farmers early in the season to discuss what seeds to plant. During harvest, they make pilgrimages to visit the farmers who supply their restaurants. David Bouley, the New York chef, sometimes visits Blooming Hill Organic Farm, a purveyor 60 miles north of New York. It is run by Guy Jones and his sister, Cindy Jones, who once a week drives vegetables directly to Mr. Bouley's four-star restaurant, Bouley.
Less famous consumers get to know farmers at the local markets that are multiplying in many American cities. Although economically crucial, farmers' markets are also social networks with layers of complex interactions between the urban and the rural, the seekers and the sought. Customers at the markets linger at the stands, asking about food, but also about what time the farmers wake up, how long it takes them to get to the city and how their children are doing.
"This is a very loving relationship," said Barry Benepe, founder of the New York Greenmarket. "A lot of conversation is going on, not just selling." That contact is so important that most markets require the owner of the farm to sell at the stand in person.
Hilary Baum, a founder of Public Market Partners, a Bronx organization that provides technical assistance to farmers' markets, said this kind of personal interaction is "part of the product, of what's being sold at the market." Americans have always expressed a longing to return to the land, but they rarely do it. Every year, there are fewer and fewer farmers, struggling to hold on to a way of life that is now shared by only 4.6 million people in this country, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.
Although the new respect for the farmer may help those who sell directly to consumers and chefs, many other, decidedly unchic farmers are having a lot of trouble surviving. Indeed, farmers take on more symbolic value and become the object of greater nostalgia as they become scarcer. The same thing happened with cooking: chefs became celebrities and cooking became an art as fewer people cooked complicated meals on a daily basis.
People cut off from the earth tend to be intrigued by its most mundane manifestations. Last year, the Hudson River Club, a restaurant at the World Financial Center that features Hudson Valley foods, had a farmer bring in 50 corn plants, still rooted in dirt, and plant them in the restaurant. "I had people pick their own," said Waldy Malouf, the restaurant's chef. "They loved it. I guess they had never picked corn before." At another special event, fishermen brought huge, whole salmon, and diners crowded around so they could touch them.
In Philadelphia, the White Dog Cafe has a Farmer's Sunday Supper in the fall, where farmers mingle with the restaurant's customers. Keith Stewart, who has a farm in Greenville, N.Y., sends a newsletter to his regular customers about life on the farm. "To talk to a real farmer is meaningful to them," he said.
Hall Gibson, resident manager of Ryder Farm in Brewster, N.Y., said at least a dozen customers visit the organic farm each year. Breezy Hill Orchard in Clinton Corners, N.Y., holds a harvest celebration each fall; so does Blooming Hill Farm, where hundreds of customers sit around a huge bonfire and roast potatoes.
"We don't want to be some abstract source of food," said Mr. Jones of Blooming Hill, whose 15-acre farm in Blooming Grove, N.Y., is known for its mesclun. "We wish more people would come to visit. We want people to think this is a viable occupation, for some kid to think, 'I want to be a farmer when I grow up.' "
The city dwellers want more than just good food or an outing in the country. They want the contact; they want the farmer. In Petoskey, Mich., Bill McMaster's farm stand draws a constant stream of visitors. "When you buy this food from Bill, you get the sense that life is still good, that life makes sense," said Justin Rashid, president of American Spoon Foods, a maker of specialty foods that is situated in the same town. "What you're buying into is this sense of well-being."
The small specialty farmers who have gained star status generally began tailoring their crops to please chefs, who were rebelling against the tasteless tomatoes and mass-produced lettuces they were forced to buy. "Fifteen years ago, the farmers were really out of the loop," said Larry Forgione, chef of An American Place in New York and a pioneer in the effort to use locally grown food.
Now, chefs routinely nurture relationships with farmers. "The more you can be involved with the people producing the food, the better it is," said Mr. Malouf. When he wanted venison with more fat around the meat, for instance, he met with the producer, Eberhard Deer Farm in Millbrook, N.Y., to discuss changes in the feed.
Finding good ingredients has become a major part of the job for chefs. No longer can they call a few big dealers and order everything; to track down the best, they have to deal with many vendors. Joseph Pace, the chef at Petrossian, spends Wednesday and Friday at the Union Square Greenmarket in New York. "I scout out things I want, and then a van picks them up," he said. Other days, he calls farmers to find out when certain items are expected to ripen. "Like anything else, it's part of my day," he added. "It's got to be a quarter of my time."
As the natural qualities in food become more important, chefs prefer to keep their favorite farmers to themselves. "Every chef doesn't want to think their special ingredients are being bought by someone else," said Lora Zarubin, chef and owner of Lora, a restaurant on 13th Street in Manhattan. She admits to being obsessed with a special variety of arugula and hopes to find a local farmer who will grow it for her.
The fetish for freshness, too, is transforming the way cooking and shopping are approached. In her new cookbook coming out this fall, Alice Waters, the owner of the Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley, Calif., emphasizes the importance of going to the market before deciding what to make, not after. Peter's, a restaurant in Indianapolis, sometimes has striped bass that has been raised in purified water and delivered live to the restaurant in a portable tank. Freshness carries such status now that some farmers, with understandable bitterness, say some chefs brag that they get all their food at farmers' markets -- even when they don't.
Could farms replace museums as the place to party? Peggy Hirschberg, president of Parties to Perfection, a party-planning concern in Mamaroneck, N.Y., is trying to persuade one of her clients to hold a party on a farm. "Most of my clients have been everyplace and seen everything," she said. Everyplace and everything, that is, except a farm.
"We're like folk heroes," said Elizabeth Ryan Zimmerman, who with her husband, Peter Zimmerman, owns Breezy Hill Orchard. The admiration helps compensate for the stress, she said.
Not that many urbanites know about that part, or want to. "Remember 'The Waltons'? How they're all eating together? That's what they think farm life is like," said Vincent D'Attolico, who owns an organic farm with his wife, Joan, in Pine Island, N.Y.
Daisy Miller, an art student from Boston, is working on a farm this summer and has discovered what farm life is really like: rise at 6 A.M., and work until 7 P.M., dinner, then bed. "This teaches you about work."
New Yorkers who want a briefer look can sign up for farm trips with Farmhands-Cityhands, a nonprofit organization that takes people to farms for a day or even a week. The trips are often transformative. "They fall in love with themselves, with each other and with the farmer," said Wendy Dubin, founder of the organization, which is administered by Food Work, in Manhattan.
Most alluring are the small organic farms, where food is being carefully planted and harvested, absorbing the touch of human hands rather than a blast of chemicals. "Everything these people are doing is politically correct, and being politically correct is sexy," said Karen Schloss Saad, whose public relations work involves many food clients and who is on the board of Farmhands-Cityhands.
Those with a knack for turning sentiment into money are probably already at work on the inevitable: with parties on farms in the not-too-distant future, will we not need farm fashions, farm travel guides, farm furniture -- and farm perfume?

Owners' Salaries Focus of N.F.L. Trial

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
National Football League owners paid themselves between $50 million and $60 million in salaries from 1987 through 1990 but listed the salaries as part of general expenses instead of profits, according to testimony yesterday in the Freeman McNeil vs. the N.F.L. antitrust suit over free agency in United States District Court in Minneapolis.
A Stanford economics professor, Roger Noll, a witness for the players, said owners' salaries have ranged from nothing to $7.5 million. The owners could choose to take money from their teams in profits or salaries, Noll told the jury. 
 "This is a matter of discretion on the part of the owners how to take returns from their ownership," Noll said.
The players want to show that the N.F.L. is more profitable than its financial statements suggest.
The N.F.L. disagreed with Noll's assessment. Greg Aiello, the league's director of communications, said that during the same period (1987-90) $2.4 billion was paid to players in salaries, bonuses and benefits and that the N.F.L. is second to no sport in the amount of its total revenue that it spends for player costs.
For the N.F.L., total revenue is 56 percent, Aiello said, compared with 50 percent for the National Basketball Association and 46 percent for major league baseball.
"Even if we granted that the numbers of $50 to $60 million from Roger Noll were true, that would mean that owners during that period averaged $412,000 a year per owner," Aiello said. "That does not seem exorbitant and it is less than the average player salary in the N.F.L. The issue in this case is if the players are being treated fairly, not N.F.L. owners salaries."
Player representatives insist, however, that the owners' salaries are not a team expense.
 
Giants Report Losses
 The Giants lost almost $6.7 million between 1986 and 1989, according to the financial statements introduced at the trial.
The biggest loss reported by the team during that period was $4.2 million following the 1988 season. The team said it lost $1.09 million in 1989, $1.4 million in the strike-marred 1987 season and just $7,000 in 1986, when the Giants capped the year with a victory over Denver in Super Bowl XXI. The club's financial statements for the 1990 and 1991 seasons were not included in the documents.
The Giants' Bill Parcells was among the highest paid coaches in the league in the 1990 season, earning $725,000. General Manager George Young earned $441,250 in 1990. The team capped that season with a 20-19 Super Bowl victory over Buffalo.
General Manager Dick Steinberg was the highest-paid employee of the Jets with a $500,000 salary in 1990-91. Steinberg, who also is listed as a vice president of the Jets, earned $100,600 for working less than three months after being hired Dec. 18, 1989. He then earned $500,000 for the period from March 1, 1990 through Feb. 28, 1991.
The documents did not show how much Coach Bruce Coslet was paid for the period, which included his first season as Jets coach. He was hired by Steinberg in February 1990 at a reported salary of $350,000.
The highest-paid coach in 1990 was Jimmy Johnson of Dallas, who was paid $1.433 million. That was Johnson's second year as an N.F.L. coach and followed a 1-15 year as a rookie.
Miami's Don Shula was second, at just under $1.1 million, about $100,000 less than what San Francisco's Bill Walsh was paid in his final season, 1988, when he won his third Super Bowl.

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Marian Burros

 BODY:
TWELVE million Americans consider themselves vegetarians, according to Vegetarian Times magazine. That's about two million more than a decade ago. While part of that growth may come from a looser definition of the term, the practice of vegetarianism, in all its many permutations, has moved beyond a cult and into the mainstream.
Some sort of meeting of the minds is at work here. Those who have been vegetarians because they believe that not consuming animal products is morally or environmentally correct now have the support of a large body of scientific evidence suggesting that increasing the consumption of fruits, vegetables, grains and low-fat dairy products, and decreasing or eliminating the consumption of meat, poultry and fish, may forestall the chronic ailments of aging like cancer and heart disease and can reverse the effects of atherosclerosis. 
 This confluence of forces is what made Faith Popcorn, a corporate trend-spotter, predict that during this decade "people all over America will have very little choice but to become more vegetarian initially and then totally vegetarian finally."
Ms. Popcorn doesn't always get it right, but that she would even raise such a possibility in an interview with Vegetarian Times at least suggests that vegetarianism is no longer just for aging hippies or followers of George Bernard Shaw.
"It's less uncool to be a vegetarian," said Dr. Patricia Johnson, associate dean of the School of Public Health at Loma Linda University,"because Madonna is a vegetarian." Loma Linda, in Southern California, is a Seventh Day Adventist school. At one time its undergraduate dietetic program was not accredited because it was based on a vegetarian diet. Now, people like Dr. Johnson are advising the airline industry about meatless menus because so many passengers request them. And organizations for nutrition professionals, like the American Dietetic Association, offer advice on meatless eating instead of scorning it as they once did.
Madonna is just one of many celebrities -- including Lindsay Wagner, Meredith Baxter, Candice Bergen and Phylicia Rashad -- who prefer to go meatless. All for different reasons.
Candice Bergen told Parade magazine, "You teach children about animals -- piggies and lambs and cows and chickens -- and then feed them these animals for lunch and for supper." Meredith Baxter is a vegetarian because she wants to stay thin, and Phylicia Rashad believes abstinence from meat gives her greater stamina and sense of spiritual well-being.
Dr. Johnson thinks the current interest in vegetarianism is connected with ecological issues -- the waste of natural resources caused by the way livestock is raised. "It's a cause," she said, "to save the earth."
There certainly has been a surge in organizations for teen-agers who have joined together to save the earth. "How on Earth" is a new magazine that says it is for "teens supporting compassionate, ecologically sound living." It is underwritten by a nonprofit organization called Vegetarian Education Network in West Chester, Pa.
Earthsave, a group founded in 1988 by John Robbins, a radical environmentalist, has created a young-people's branch called YES (Youth for Environmental Sanity) that tours the country, bringing its message to high-school students.
And books like Mr. Robbins's "Diet for a New America" (Stillpoint, 1987), and Jeremy Rifkin's "Beyond Beef" (Dutton, 1992), which preach against the "crime" of raising livestock, have captured the imagination of many Americans. Enough so that the beef industry has been issuing news releases and position papers to undermine the theories set forth in these books and others like them.
Being a vegetarian means different things to different people. The Institute of Food Technologists listed six types of vegetarians in its journal, Food Technology, in 1991, but not all of the current forms of vegetarianism are recognized by the traditional vegetarians like the lacto-ovo vegetarians, who include eggs and dairy products in their diets; lacto-vegetarians, who eat dairy; ovo-vegetarians, who eat eggs, and vegans, who eat nothing of animal origin.
The newer variations include semivegetarians, who eat eggs, dairy, chicken and fish, and pesco-vegetarians, who eat dairy, eggs and fish. Many of those who include chicken or fish in their diets are vegetarian not for ethical or environmental reasons. Their form of niche nutrition has more to do with health.
Whether or not the group that has become interested in a vegetarian diet for health reasons is larger than the others, it certainly has gained enormous support from recent studies on diet and health.
This much is known: On average, vegetarians have lower levels of cholesterol and triglycerides than meat eaters of similar age and socio-economic level; the incidence of high blood pressure is generally greater among meat eaters than among vegetarians; cancers of the breast, colon and prostate are more common among people on a high-meat, high-fat, low-fiber diet; on average, vegetarians are leaner than meat eaters; breast milk from vegetarian women contains fewer hazardous chemicals than breast milk from meat eaters.
Two years ago, Dr. Dean Ornish of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., was able to show a reduction in coronary artery blockage in people who had followed a strict vegetarian diet, along with a mild exercise and stress-reduction program. The patients, 35 to 75 years old, ate no animal products except egg whites and up to a cup of nonfat milk or yogurt a day. The diet, which was no more than 10 percent fat, consisted of fruits, vegetables, grains, dried peas, beans and lentils. The greatest reduction in blockage was seen in those who made the greatest changes in their regimens.
There is also much tantalizing evidence that fruits and vegetables are filled with substances that reduce the risk of cancer, so much so that the National Cancer Institute and the Produce for Better Health Foundation, an organization established by the produce industry, have instituted a program to encourage the consumption of these foods. The goal is to get Americans to eat a minimum of five half-cup servings of fruits and vegetables a day as part of a low-fat, high-fiber diet. A majority of studies correlating the intake of fruits and vegetables with the incidence of cancer shows that people who eat fewer fruits and vegetables are at significantly more risk for most cancers than those who consumed more.
Based on recent surveys of eating patterns in this country, there is a wide gap between the 10 million or more vegetarians and everyone else. Few Americans come close to eating the minimum recommended amount of fruits and vegetables. In a nationwide Government survey of food consumption patterns, released in 1991, only 9 percent of American adults had eaten five servings of fruits and vegetables on the day of the survey and 11 percent had not eaten any at all on that day.
There's a long way to go in this country before Faith Popcorn's prediction about a vegetarian society is more than just a wild guess.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 7

 BODY:
Three years ago, somber spokesmen for the Champagne industry declared that the good times were over. For too long, the public had been enjoying their wine at artificially low prices, and the time had come to return to (harsh) reality.
Grape prices were about to skyrocket, they warned, because of a breakdown in relations between growers and the Champagne companies, most of whom own very few of the vineyards whose fruit they crush. Prices had to climb -- steeply. 
 The retail trade was quick to join the chorus. Buy now, the shopkeepers advised; who knew what would happen in the months ahead?
What happened is that prices increased, right on schedule. "It's just as we planned," the industry said, in effect. "Stocks were too low, and mediocre wine was making its way into the market to meet the high demand. As prices increase, demand will fall, just long enough for us to build up stocks a bit and catch our breath."
Demand went down, just as planned. But unlike the heroes of 1930's aviation films, it didn't pull out of its dive. The Comite Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne, the industry's professional and promotional organization, said exports fell more than 7 percent in 1990 and just under 10 percent last year. In two years, shipments were down 3.25 million cases, to 17.5 million from 20.75 million. As for stocks on hand, some five years' worth of wine is now in the cellars of Rheims and Epernay, about two years more than the industry wants or needs.
In the United States, the market dropped 15.5 percent in 1989 and 12 percent more last year. In Britain, historically Champagne's best market, shipments were down 34 percent in 1991 after a 6 percent drop in 1989. And nothing suggests that any improvement will occur in 1992.
The domestic market in France has fared no better: it was off about 10 percent last year, to about 11 million cases, from 12.3 million in 1990.
The industry's reaction has been swift. In the Paris market, one of the world's highest priced, little-known brands of Champagne can be found for about $12. Trade publications here have reported prices as low as $9 a bottle. In New York, where not long ago it was being said that any Champagne under $20 would soon be no more than a fond memory, discount wine shops are offering lesser-known brands for $15. And the price is expected to drop further for the end-of-the-year holiday season.
What happened? Impact International, a trade newsletter, cited a confluence of factors, all set off by the precipitous rise of grape prices in 1990. The impact of the Persian Gulf war, the global recession -- Champagne is after all a luxury product -- the falloff in conspicuous consumption (that metaphor of the 1980's) and increased competition from non-Champagne sparkling wines, particularly from Spain, were all suggested as reasons for the decline.
For some 30 years, the price of grapes purchased by the Champagne houses was set by the Comite Interprofessionnel after talks with the growers. Convinced they were not sharing in the prosperity of the 1970's and 80's, the growers began bypassing the big concerns and making their own wine, usually through cooperatives like Marne & Champagne.
With the big houses Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, Seagram and Laurent-Perrier demanding a larger and larger share of the grape crop and the growers in a position to make more money on their own, the old arrangement collapsed and the beginnings of a free market appeared.
Now the Champagne concerns get an allotment based on sales volume the previous year and the size of the current crop. In principle the allotment is 5 or 10 percent higher than the previous year. Initially, the price under the new system shot up. From 1989 to 1990, a kilogram of grapes, about 2.2 pounds, went up more than $1, to about $5.75, despite the fact that the 1990 harvest was enormous; Champagne houses wanted grapes to build up their dwindling stocks.
Now, the stocks are up -- too high -- and the price of grapes, which dropped slightly in 1991, is expected to go down further this year, assuming the harvest is normal or better.
Does the current crisis signify long-term problems in Champagne? "The problem," said Jean-Claude Rouzaud, chairman of Louis Roederer and president of the Syndicat des Grandes Marques, the organization of the big Champagne concerns, "is to determine whether the current slowdown reflects the economic crisis or a change in consumer attitudes."
If the problem is economic, it should resolve itself. A gradual end to the recession could spark interest in some luxury products. And, too, a couple of poor harvests could shrink stocks again. In any case, the industry plans to seek lower grape prices this fall and to set aside part of the 1992 harvest for a less abundant year. And, of course, to lower prices.
From the consumer's point of view, it can be argued that even in the over-$20 and over-$30 categories, Champagne is not expensive when compared with the most prestigious still wines. Even in the current tough market, a top Burgundy can sell for $60. The first growths of Bordeaux are priced well above that, and most second growths command as much. So do top California cabernets.
Somehow, Champagne has managed to preserve its luxury image even though its prices, comparatively speaking, are not all that high. But with many more cheap brands entering the market each year, the industry will have to make a greater effort to insure that Champagne continues to be seen as a drink apart.
One approach has been suggested by Christian Bizot, the president of Champagne Bollinger. Mr. Bizot would create a classification system like those in Bordeaux and Burgundy. The finest Champagnes would be called grande marque Champagne, and back labels would disclose production methods, length of aging, grape varieties used and their origin.
Only Champagne concerns that met the high grande marque requirements could sell their wines under that rubric, Mr. Bizot said. He first made his proposal in March, and all factions say they are considering it.
 
TASTINGS
Chateau Chamirey, Mercurey, Antonin Rodet, 1988; about $20.
 Along with Faiveley and Bouchard Aine, Antonin Rodet is one of the most important producers in Mercurey, the popular wine commune in Burgundy. Actually, it's just south of the famous Cote d'Or in a region called the Cote Chalonnaise. This location doesn't prevent its wines from being as good as, and sometimes better than, some far more famous -- and expensive -- wines from better-known towns to the north. This is a rich, velvety pinot noir, dark red like most good 1988's, and with plenty of that earthy component that makes fine Burgundy unique. This is a wine for drinking now and over the next three or four years. Not that $20 is inexpensive; it's just that in this case it represents good value for the money. What's more, as Mercurey becomes better known, its prices will rise. Buy now and have something to remember.

HARKIN TO GET HIS REWARD AT CONVENTION

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the loyal soldier who ran for President, fell on his political sword and then turned into an energetic campaigner on behalf of the foe who vanquished him, will get his reward next Tuesday.
At 10 P.M. that night, aides to Mr. Harkin said, the Senator will deliver a speech on jobs and the economy, giving him a valuable convention platform from which to deliver one of his trademark speeches. Mr. Harkin has been the most supportive of Gov. Bill Clinton's original competitors for the Democratic Presidential nomination, but was never seriously considered for the Vice Presidency. 
 Clinton campaign officials have been grateful for Mr. Harkin's help, especially in the Pennsylvania and New York primaries, where the Iowa Senator played a major role in recruiting recalcitrant labor leaders to Mr. Clinton's side.

HEADLINE: Bank Yields Down Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision last week to lower the discount rate and the subsequent cut in the prime lending rate by most big banks set the table for a steep decline in yields for bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit in the week ended today.
Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor said the declines in yields were among the biggest weekly drops in many years. "This clearly refutes what many banks were talking up last week -- that the decline in yields was near the bottom," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor. 
 "This could cause a further erosion of depositors at banks. But there will always remain that hard core who remember the Depression and keep put rather than risk their cash elsewhere," Mr. Heady said.
 
Bill Rates Drop
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, rates fell sharply because of the cuts initiated by the Fed. The auction is seen as an indicator of what many banks will pay to their depositors in coming weeks.
The average rate on a three-month bill was 3.23 percent, down 36 basis points from the previous auction, while the six-month bill fell 34 basis points, to 3.32 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
New York area banks, including commercial and savings banks, took a head start in this latest round of cuts and reduced the average money market account 14 basis points, to 3.20 percent, while cutting the yield on a three-month certificate of deposit 19 basis points, to 3.30 percent, and a six-month C.D. 16 basis points, to 3.48 percent.
Commercial banks were aggressive in lowering yields. The average money market account fell 13 basis points, to 2.96 percent; the average three-month C.D., 23 basis points, to 3.1 percent, and the average six- month C.D., 19 basis points, to 3.22 percent.
Savings banks were just as aggressive, lowering the average money market account 15 basis points, to 3.44 percent; the three-month C.D., 14 basis points, to 3.52 percent, and the six-month C.D., 13 basis points, to 3.73 percent.
Among the largest changes in the New York area, Astoria Federal Savings dropped its money market account 62 basis points, to 2.94 percent, and its six-month C.D. 42 basis points, to 3.40 percent. Fleet Bank in Connecticut, cut more than 50 basis points from its three-month C.D., to 3.04 percent.
For 20 large banks outside the New York market, the average bank money market account was down 12 basis points, to 3.11 percent, and the six-month certificate was down 16 basis points, to 3.42 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, July 8, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MUNICH;
7 NATIONS UNABLE TO AGREE ON TRADE BUT SEE PROGRESS

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 8

 BODY:
Leaders of the world's richest industrial democracies narrowed their differences on world trade today. While they failed to reach an accord, they left the economic summit meeting here with many confident that an agreement was possible by the end of the year.
As they have at the last two summit meetings, the leaders vowed to conclude the so-called Uruguay Round of trade negotiations within a few months. 
 In the past, similar promises have proved empty. But this time, both European and American officials said, there had been progress in resolving the differences on farm subsidies that have paralyzed the talks.
 
French Concessions Expected
 Many officials said that after a referendum on European union in France on Sept. 20, in which the Government of President Francois Mitterrand needs the support of farmers, France would be prepared to make concessions so that the contentious talks on agriculture to be concluded.
"I am not only optimistic, but I truly expect that we will finally reach an agreement by the end of the year," said Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had not been sanguine on the possibility of completing the negotiations.
Economists say that a successful conclusion of the talks would add about half a percentage point to the world's economic growth rate, which in turn would bolster business confidence. The sagging world economy grew just eight-tenths of 1 percent last year.
 
Help for Russia, With a Warning
 The seven nations also agreed to channel $1 billion in aid to Russia as part of a "comprehensive partnership" with Moscow, but warned that additional help for the former Communist countries depended on evidence that they were working hard to reform their economies. [Page A12.]
Bush Administration officials cautioned that even if the farm issues were resolved this fall, other critical issues needed to be settled and an agreement might not be possible before the United States election in November.
Aides to President Bush are also concerned that any long-term economic benefits of a trade accord would be hard to sell to voters, especially if workers in the steel, textile and citrus industries see themselves as suffering from a new flood of imports.
Mr. Bush has been a strong advocate of a trade agreement because investment banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers, computer makers and other businesses would benefit from greater access to foreign markets.
In their final declaration of the three-day talks, the leaders could do little to disguise the fact that they had failed to stimulate the world economy.
Among other promises, they vowed to "create the scope for lower interest rates through the reduction of excessive public deficits." But the United States has already lowered interest rates about as far as it can, Germany is not prepared to do so until it has controlled a budget deficit swollen by reunification, and Japan is grappling with an economic downturn and the psychological shock of seeing its stock prices plunge.
The bluntest assessment of the talks was provided by Prime Minister John Major, who declared, "There are no specific agreements on anything in the final declaration."
Mr. Major had hoped for more. Aides said he came to Munich with an elaborate plan to coax the participants into agreement. He came close.
 
Details Seemed to Be Settled
 A dinner on Sunday night attended by Mr. Bush and Mr. Mitterrand had narrowed differences between the two countries most at odds here, and a meeting on Monday morning between Mr. Major, senior European Community officials and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d suggested that a trade accord was technically feasible.
In essence, several United States and European officials said, the elements of a deal were in place: the European participants, principally France, would agree to cut their subsidized grain exports, and the United States would accept some limit on its exports of cereal substitutes -- mainly corn-gluten feed -- to Europe.
France has been particularly angered by Washington's insistence that it reduce its subsidized grain exports by 24 percent. But the officials said the British proposals for a somewhat lesser cut spread over a longer period, combined with Washington's willingness to cap exports of corn-gluten feed, seemed to have brought the sides within range of an accord.
On another European sticking point -- an agreement by the United States not to take legal action against alleged European trade malpractices for a certain period -- the two sides were also moving closer, the officials said.
 
Yes? No. C'mon, Yes!? No.
 Then, on Monday night, Mr. Baker and the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, attended the same dinner. A senior European official who overheard their conversation said an extraordinary exchange ensued.
"Are you prepared to make a deal?" Mr. Baker asked, referring to the trade talks.
Mr. Dumas replied that he was not.
"But suppose all the conditions you are seeking were fulfilled," Mr. Baker said. "Would you then be prepared to make a deal?"
"No," said Mr. Dumas.
So before the talks had even reached the second day, it was clear that not even an outline trade agreement could be reached and that the final communique would be no more than a list of good intentions.
Paris disputes that account.
Several officials close to President Mitterrand said he was prepared to make a trade deal. But, they argued, the United States refused to budge as much as the European Community already had in agreeing to reforms intended to reduce agricultural subsidies.
Despite the confidence of future progress expressed by many of the summit leaders today, concluding a GATT agreement is likely to be intricate.
Even if the dispute over farm subsidies is quickly resolved, no overall agreement would be ready until after the November elections.
Critical issues like international patent protection and tariff reductions remain unresolved, and even the most optimistic negotiators say these matters will require four to six months to settle after the farm subsidies issue is finally set aside.
Pessimists inside and outside the Administration say that these questions could prove almost as tough as farm subsidies, and predict that the talks will quickly become deadlocked again, even with an agreement on agriculture.
Few Republican strategists, particularly those working on President Bush's re-election campaign, have been enthusiastic about completing a trade agreement in an election year. They fear that a global free-trade pact will please few voters because its benefits are hard to understand while workers in the steel and textile industries and in citrus-fruit growing are likely to suffer -- and will vote accordingly.
 
But Would It Change Votes?
 Investment banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers and computer makers would benefit from extra access to foreign markets and better legal protections abroad for their trade secrets. But Republican strategists have been skeptical that employees in these industries would vote any differently if an agreement were concluded.
The Administration and the campaign have not systematically analyzed the political implications of a GATT deal because of a consensus that no agreement is likely in the immediate future. Mr. Mitterrand must win next September's referendum on the European monetary union, and cannot afford to have French farmers picketing Euro-Disney for the next three months, a top Administration official said last Friday.
Yet the Bush Administration is unwilling to settle for any agreement that will not "drive French farmers crazy," the official said, making a prolonged standoff highly likely.

A NARROWING OF DIFFERENCES
The heads of seven leading industrial democracies narrowed their differences on world trade and, while they failed to reach an accord, left the economic summit meeting in Munich with many of them confident that an agreement was possible by the end of the year. A1
 
A PARTNERSHIP WITH RUSSIA
The summit leaders promised a "comprehensive partnership" with Russia and $1 billion in aid. But in a meeting with President Yeltsin, they signaled that the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the old Soviet Union should expect no further injections of aid until they restructure their economies. A12
 
YELTSIN'S FAMILIAR JOURNEY
Yeltsin's journey to Munich was familiar: the preliminary vow that he would not "get on his knees" before the West, an encouraging pat on the back from leaders of the rich nations, a handful of change, and promises of far more once he really gets moving on reforms. A12
 
Six Russian aides denied they are trying to undermine Yeltsin. A5
 
EUROPEANS DROP YUGOSLAVIA
The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe suspended Yugoslavia for three months, accusing it of aggression against its neighbors. World leaders, in the meantime, gathered in Helsinki to seek ways of preventing similar conflicts. The leaders -- from North America, Europe and the former republics of the Soviet Union -- planned to set the seal on disarmament. They are expected to review Yugoslavia's suspension in October. A13
 
CHILD LABORERS IN INDIA
For 12, 14, 16 hours a day, every day of the week, every week of the year, thousands of children, some as young as 8 are forced to sit on rough planks and help make the carpets that India sells around the world. The United States is the biggest customer for Indian carpets. A8
 
SETBACK FOR JAPANESE ROCKET
In another serious setback for Japan's budding space program, the Government announced that it would delay the launching of its next-generation rocket by a year because of a recent accident. The H-II is the first rocket to be built solely by Japan and is a source of national pride. It will be the first rocket powerful enough to let Japan launch communications and weather satellites. A9
 
MORE ON FAILED IRAQI COUP
The reported coup attempt against Saddam Hussein appears to have mainly consisted of an effort to assassinate the Iraqi leader as his motorcade was to move through the Baghdad area last week, an American intelligence report said. A3

A TOUGHER STANCE ON TRADE
The House of Representatives passed a broad trade bill that would require the Federal Government to adopt a more confrontational approach to reducing foreign trade barriers. The White House lobbied against the bill, and President Bush now faces the prospect of a politically unpopular veto. A1
 
EDUCATION BILL GOES TO BUSH
Trumpeting its allegiance to middle-class Americans, the House gave final Congressional approval to a bill helping them get more college loans. The legislation has the President's support. A1
 
COURT CURBS PESTICIDES IN FOOD
A Federal appeals court ruled that the E.P.A. must remove from the market any pesticides that leave residues in processed food if they have the potential to cause cancer. The ruling was a defeat for the environmental agency, which in regulating pesticides had relied on a law that allowed small amounts of cancer-causing chemicals in food if the chemicals' benefits to farmers and consumers could be shown to outweigh the risk to health and the environment. A1
 
AIR-QUALITY STANDARDS VOIDED
Air-quality standards for the workplace were thrown out by a Federal appeals court, which said the Government had not given sufficient supporting evidence for them. The standards had been challenged by unions as too weak and also criticized by industrial groups, which said regulators had not shown that the rules were economically and technologically feasible.

HEADLINE: HOUSE VOTES BILL TOUGHER ON TRADE

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Turning aside a last-minute surge of White House lobbying, the House of Representatives today passed a broad trade bill that would require the Federal Government to adopt a more confrontational approach to reducing foreign trade barriers.
The vote, 280 to 145, reflected election-year considerations as much as foreign trade factors, with Democrats hoping to present the President with a measure that would force him into a politically unpopular veto and Republicans hoping to be able to label the Democrats as crassly protectionist.
 
Prospects Remain Uncertain
 
 If the Administration had defeated the bill today, it would almost certainly have prevented a trade bill from reaching the President's desk this year. Even now,prospects for final passage remain uncertain. The House vote is fully 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to overcome a Presidential veto. And before that stage is reached, the measure would have to pass the Senate, where no comparable bill has even been introduced and the autumn legislative calendar is already crowded.
But in an election year a bill could suddenly move fast, Republicans could start voting for it, and the President might not necessarily follow through on this veto threat. In a last-ditch effort to prevent the measure from becoming a campaign issue, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, spent nearly two hours this morning urging House Republicans to vote against the measure, while Administration lobbyists patrolled the halls in search of wavering representatives.
Yet 34 Republicans joined 245 Democrats and an independent in support of the bill, while 15 Democrats and 130 Republicans opposed it. The large number of members crossing party lines in both directions -- unusual on highly partisan issues -- reflected members' ideological positions on free trade and varying regional interests.
Representative Sam Gibbons, the Florida Democrat and avowed free-trader who heads the subcommittee on trade, voted against the bill after repeatedly using the Republicans' time during the debate to criticize the American auto industry's export efforts. Representative Richard T. Schulze, Republican of Pennsylvania, a steelmaking state ravaged by imports, voted in favor of the measure after pointing out that it would help domestic industries that file trade cases against imports from formerly Communist countries.
 
More Dumping Seen
 These countries' shortage of internationally traded currencies "will lead them to dump as many products as they can, as quickly as possible, into the hospitable U.S. market," Mr. Schulze said during debate this morning before the vote.
Today's bill would also revive Super 301, a section of American trade law, much reviled by foreign governments, that would force the Administration to challenge foreign trade barriers on a faster and more rigid schedule. The bill would oblige the Administration to file trade cases against Japan, Korea and Taiwan because of their restrictions on American rice exports and another trade case seeking to open the Japanese market for auto parts.
Under an amendment added this afternoon on the floor, the bill would also order the Administration to replace Japanese auto makers' self-imposed limit of 1.65 million cars exported this year to the United States with a lasting limit at the same level imposed by both Governments. The bill would also require the Administration to monitor the compliance of Japanese auto makers with the Japanese Government's informal offer to President Bush in Tokyo last January to double Japanese purchases of American auto parts by 1994.
Both the White House and Congressional Democrats claimed victory after today's vote. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the majority leader from Missouri, said the bill had lured more Republican votes than he expected. "At bottom, I think, the Congress is desirous of more aggressive trade policies," he said after the vote.
 
Gephardt Sees a Bill
 Mr. Gephardt said that he would be talking soon to Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, and that he believed a trade bill could be delivered to the President "as soon as possible" this autumn.
But Kathleen A. Lydon, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Hills, also described the vote as a success. "We're delighted because it's not veto-proof and it was not bipartisan, and it clearly was election-year politics," she said. "There's no point in the Senate picking it up except as a political tool."
The Administration's strategy has been full of risk. It made little effort to water down the trade bill, and discouraged House Republicans from introducing a more limited alternative.
Yet House Democrats from car-making states ended up watering down the bill on their own to win support from other Democrats, withdrawing a measure that would have tightly restricted imports from Japan and sales by Japanese-owned assembly plants in the United States.
Mr. Bentsen has been reluctant to move on a comparable Senate measure until the House acted. He said in an interview on July 1 that he had not yet decided whether to sponsor a trade bill. The Senator was traveling today and not available for comment, but his aides said that they did not believe the Senator had made up his mind yet.
A bigger stumbling block, from Mr. Bentsen's point of view, may be his disagreement with Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr, Democrat of Michigan. Mr. Riegle has said repeatedly that he would try to amend it with his plan to allow Congress to change a free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada after it has been negotiated.
 
Texas Big Beneficiary
 Economists say that border states like Texas would be the biggest beneficiaries from a free-trade pact, and Senator Bentsen has been a strong backer of negotiating an agreement. Trade negotiators from all three countries are in the final stages of drafting such an agreement. Amending the agreement in Congress could scuttle it, if Mexico and Canada do not agree to the changes.
A general framework could be ready when President Bush meets President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at baseball's All-Star Game next week, although Administration officials say this is unlikely.
Some representatives also warned that passage of restrictive trade legislation this year could hurt negotiations in Geneva for an agreement reducing international trade barriers, and that such an agreement would require revamping American trade legislation next year anyway.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
For Perot, a Time of Need

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 8

 BODY:
Now is the testing time for Ross Perot. The last few weeks have battered the Texas independent's still-undeclared Presidential campaign and have stalled its momentum, causing slippage in the polls and worry here in the offices of the Perot Petition Committee, a suite of rooms with a clean, shiny just-unwrapped look.
Mr. Perot, who conceived of, and sold, his extraordinary run for the Presidency as a rebellion against the ways and wiles of party politics, has discovered he is not, after all, above the problems that bedevil mortal politicians: organizational weaknesses, turf battles in the ranks, criticism in the press and from opponents, the threats and persistence of pressure groups, the endless, complex demands of a national campaign.
 
On-the-Job Training
 
 He is learning the immutable needs and frustrations of the job he has set for himself. He needs good press, and he has found political reporters far more fickle and reflexively critical than the business writers to whom he is accustomed.
He needs a pleasant, positive image, and he has found that opponents are determined to paint him in darker hues.
He needs to attract a running mate and policy advisers of the sort that advertise his credibility, and he has found that few members of the establishment he so colorfully disdains wish to have much to do with him.
Above all, it appears he needs the very thing he most mocked a month ago: clear, detailed positions on the issues.
But now he finds himself modifying some early stands. Today he said he would not rule out naming someone to a Cabinet position on the basis of sexual orientation, reversing a stance that had earned him the wrath of gay groups [Page A18].
From the outset of his undeclared campaign, Mr. Perot presented himself not as a thinker, but as a doer, someone who should be made President not so much for any specific ideas on how to fix the nation's ills, but simply because he was, in general, good at fixing things. A President Perot would be a sort of Mechanic in Chief -- as he often put it, "under the hood of the car, working on the engine."
It now appears that many voters did not accept the analogy. At Perot rallies, on television and radio programs, and even in Mr. Perot's own campaign headquarters, reporters hear the same thing over and over.
"I like Mr. Perot a lot, but I'm still undecided about voting for him," said Ken M. Hiltz, a retired Air Force fighter pilot who was serving as grand marshal of an Independence Day rally on behalf of Mr. Perot. "I just don't know enough about where he stands. I guess I'm like the old boy from Missouri: Show me."
The event seemed nearly an advertisement for the varied ills of the Perot campaign. It was the sort of thing that sounded great on paper: a red, white and blue, Fourth of July Perot-for-President rally at Southfork Ranch, the opulent Dallas-area spread that served as the television home of the mythical Ewing clan. There would be a parade, music, fireworks, perhaps Mr. Perot.
The reality was a good deal less. The rally was put together on a week's notice by local volunteers who did not coordinate their activities with campaign headquarters a few miles away. Scheduled in the middle of a day devoted to long-planned activities with family and friends, it drew only a few hundred people. Mr. Perot never made an appearance, and no member of the Perot family or high command showed up to serve as surrogate.
The parade consisted of three Scout troops, a bagpipe band, one woman on horseback, one man with a 'Make U.S. History with Ross Perot' sign, two small fire trucks and an honor guard consisting of a lone Gulf War veteran and six men from the Plano, Texas, Veterans of Foreign Wars post. It lasted 5 minutes. After another 10 or 15 minutes, the amateur speechmakers ran out of things to say. The band struck up a country and western tune, but only one couple was brave enough to even think of dancing on the shadeless grass under the baking sky. An hour after it began, long before it was dark enough for fireworks, all but 20 or 30 people had succumbed to heat and ennui, and departed.
Perot campaign officials acknowledge they must get beyond this sort of thing, must begin to shape what they are about, rather than simply following Mr. Perot as he goes ahead on a path of his own spontaneous making.
"We recognize that we have to have people in key spots who are political professionals," said the Perot Petition Committee chairman, Tom Luce, in an interview today. "People who have been there, who can say, 'Hey, Perot, here are the things -- X, Y, and Z -- that are going to happen to you in the next 30 days, and here are our recommendations for dealing with those things."
 
Surprise Attack
 To this end, the campaign has hired, in the last month or so, a full range of political pros. The considerable task facing these men is to refurbish the Perot public image, greatly tarnished by Republican attacks and news coverage that caught the campaign off guard last month.
"I personally was surprised by the timing of the attack, by the degree of the efforts the opposition parties were willing to go to," said Mr. Luce. "And, while I think Ross handled it very well, to the extent that they succeeded in making the agenda a debate on the personality of Ross Perot and not on the economy and the budget, it was good for them.
"We are going to have to move beyond that now. We have got to get Ross rolling out there with his policies, saying every day: 'Folks, here are the core issues facing this country -- the economy, jobs, the deficit, health care -- and, folks, you need 'to know what I am going to do about those issues, so let me tell you what I am going to do."
Until that happens, Mr. Luce suggested, it will be very difficult for Mr. Perot to move up in the polls. "There is a large number of people out there who want to vote for Mr. Perot, who want to choose him," he said. "But they want some answers: Where are you headed, and how are you going to get there."
Mr. Luce would not say when the campaign would be ready take this step -- originally promised by July 4 -- other than that it would be before the end of the summer.
Former Reagan advertising producer Hal Riney was busy shooting film here on Tuesday, but the advertisements he was making won't be ready for some time either, Mr. Luce said.
In the meantime, those who are, for one professional reason or another, critical of Mr. Perot, will continue to define him in the public eye. This kind of thing has happened before, most famously to a man named Michael Dukakis.

7 Pats on the Back -- And Some Token Aid

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 8

 BODY:
Boris N. Yeltsin's journey to Munich was familiar: the preliminary vow that he would not "get on his knees" before the West, an encouraging pat from leaders of the rich world, a handful of change and promises of far more once he really got moving on reforms.
Mikhail S. Gorbachev had made the same pilgrimage a year earlier, when the Group of Seven met in London, and Mr. Yeltsin had recently returned from much the same sort of thing in Washington at a meeting with President Bush. 
 True, there was talk of a new relationship with a new, democratic Russia, and hints that Mr. Yeltsin might have a rightful place at the exclusive table of the democratic, rich and strong.
But in fact there was little difference between Mr. Yeltsin's standing and that of Mr. Gorbachev before him. Neither was invited because he represented a big, powerful or worthy country, but more because the leader and his country were so weak as to pose a potential threat to global stability.
 
Dose of Shock Therapy
 There were differences, of course. A year ago Mr. Gorbachev was still clinging to the old elites and resisting real economic liberalization, while Mr. Yeltsin had at least given the first jolt of an economic "shock therapy" and seemed authentically dedicated to change.
But in a way, the Russian President's reach to the West was more difficult. Mr. Gorbachev at least represented a recognized system and indisputable power, while Mr. Yeltsin and his Russia were still groping for an identity and a place in the world.
It was obvious in Munich, at least, that Russia and its leader were still very much on probation. The rich nations were clearly not yet ready to throw open their coffers, and certainly not to clear a place for Russia in their exclusive club. If there was a debate in the posturing and posing of the summit, it was on how best to prop up Mr. Yeltsin's administration while reserving the bulk of proffered aid as a reward for real change.
The greater question, as evident in Munich as in Moscow, was not whether Russia was ruled by a Communist Party or not, but whether that huge and richly endowed country was really prepared to renounce the imperial ambitions, the authoritarian heritage, the military might and the anti-Western instincts that had estranged it for so long.
 
'East-West Divide' Persists
 Mr. Yeltsin arrived in Bavaria conscious of the West's reserve. "The cold war has ended," he said, "but so far our economic relations have not become a partnership. The East-West divide is still there."
The shape of that partnership, the leaders of the great powers effectively replied, ultimately depended not on them, but on a choice only Russia could make.
"I don't know that there's enough money in all the world to solve Russia's economy," Mr. Bush said at his news conference. Western assistance, he said, "has to be accompanied by a vigorous reform program."
Nobody really doubted Mr. Yeltsin's determination and courage, nor the free-market faith and Western orientation of his acting Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar. But the signals from Moscow were not always encouraging.
 
Unrest at Home
 The Communist far left and nationalist far right found common cause in their nostalgia for might and order. The orphaned military grew more assertive, claiming the right to help Russians trapped in foreign civil wars. Those wars continued to intensify on the periphery of the former empire, oblivious to mediation. Ukraine seemed to grow ever less inclined to surrender its nuclear weapons, while the Central Asian republics felt the heat of Islamic fundamentalism.
The economic landscape was hardly more encouraging. Despite vigorous debate and more than 500 decrees, privatization was barely moving, land ownership remained blocked, inflation threatened to run out of control and production declined. Miscalculations by the central Government led to monstrous debts among state concerns, and a shortage of cash prevented many from receiving pay for months.
It is a situation many have compared to Russia in 1917 or to Weimar Germany, a fertile chaos in which anything can happen. For now, Mr. Yeltsin remains secure in his popularity and lack of serious challengers. But hardly a week goes by without some senior official or commentator -- most recently Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev -- warning of a potential challenge from the frustrated political fringes.
 
Warning to I.M.F.
 Mr. Yeltsin dismissed such muttering at his news conference in Munich. But even he warned in talks with the International Monetary Fund that his people were reaching "the limits of their patience," when he declared that raising oil prices at this time was out of question.
There are limits, he doubtlessly also knows, to how fast Russia can change, to how fast it can find a new identity. It is a country that inherited a huge military machine and a desolate economy from the Communist state, along with attributes and habits of a great power -- a seat on the United Nations Security Council, a hot line to Washington, a critical role in European security.
These are not attributes that Mr. Yeltsin or Russia can easily shed, physically or economically or psychologically. Speaking of the difficulties of withdrawing from the Baltic states, Mr. Yeltsin said: "You have to understand us too. We can't take 100,000 soldiers and put them in an open field."
If it was only the troops, Russia might soon be home free. But it is also a mind set shaped through the past 70 years that he must change, a habit of viewing the West as a rival and of neighboring countries as fiefs, a pride born of might, a disdain of commerce and a respect for the strong leader. Mr. Yeltsin, a former Communist and a man enormously proud of his land, must wrestle with these habits as much as any of his countrymen, however genuine his faith in reform. He would not have become the Russian leader any other way.
And so in Munich, as in Washington, the world witnesses another Russian proudly insisting that respect is his natural due even while openly admitting his dependence on the former adversary. And it witnesses a clutch of powerful leaders conscious that their security depends on this man and anxious to encourage him, but just as clear that there is a long way to go before he can join them.

HEADLINE: Robert Calkins, 89; Headed Brookings Institution

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Robert D. Calkins, an economist and educator who was president emeritus of the Brookings Institution, died yesterday at the Carriage Hill Nursing Center in Silver Spring, Md. He was 89 years old.
He died of pneumonia, the nursing center said. 
 Dr. Calkins led Brookings from 1952-67 during an era of growth as an influential policy analysis organization. Brookings, a nonprofit institution, specializes in foreign policy, economic and government issues.
During his tenure, Brookings broadened its range of research projects, expanded its budget fivefold, enlarged its staff, built a major endowment and tripled its space by building its Center for Advanced Study in Washington.
The organization's influence was evident when President John F. Kennedy took office in 1961. His Administration relied heavily on the institute's briefing papers on many issues facing the nation. Theodore C. Sorensen, who was Kennedy's special counsel, wrote that Brookings "deserves a large share of the credit for history's smoothest transfer of power between opposing parties."
Before running Brookings, Dr. Calkins served from 1947-52 as the director of the General Education Board, a foundation financed by John D. Rockefeller Sr. that promoted education improvements in the South.
In his earlier academic career, Dr. Calkins was an administrator at the University of California at Berkeley from 1932-41, serving as chairman of the Economics Department for five years and dean of the College of Commerce for four years. From 1941-47 he was dean of the Business School at Columbia University.
After leaving Brookings in 1967, he returned to academia, becoming vice chancellor of the University of California at Santa Cruz until 1970.
 
Labor Mediator
 In labor relations, Dr. Calkins served as vice chairman of the Regional Labor Board of San Francisco, a member of the National Railway Labor Panel and a mediator for the War Labor Board during World War II.
His other Government service included serving as director of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and a member of the 1957 Gaither Committee, which conducted a top-secret review of the country's military and civil defense for the National Security Council.
Born in Lebanon, Conn., Dr. Calkins grew up in Florida and Virginia.
He worked his way through the College of William and Mary as a telephone operator and drug store soda jerk, graduating in 1925. He spent the next seven years at Stanford University, earning his master's and doctoral degrees in economics.
His wife of nearly 63 years, the former Mary Gilmer, died in March. He is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth C. Davis of Pullman, Wash.; a son, Robert G. of Ithaca, N.Y., and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Voids Rules On Work-Place Air Quality

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 8

 BODY:
National air-quality standards for the work place have been thrown out by a Federal appeals court, which said the Government agency that set the standards had not given sufficient supporting evidence for the rules.
The standards, issued in early 1989 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, were challenged by unions as too weak and criticized by industrial groups, which said the agency had not shown that the standards were economically and technologically feasible. 
 A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit here said in its ruling late Tuesday that the agency had issued its standards for 428 substances with "such inadequate explanation that it is virtually impossible for a reviewing court to determine if evidence supports the agency's conclusions."
The panel also said the agency had given insufficient explanation for its decision to wait nearly four years, until the end of 1992, before requiring that industries meet the standards.
 
'Devoid of Reasons'
 An OSHA spokesman said today that the lawyers for the agency, which is part of the Labor Department, had not had time to study the ruling and would have no immediate comment.
The standards lowered the permissible limits for exposure to 212 substances that can be found in the air in work places and set limits for 164 substances that were previously unregulated. For 52 others, limits were unchanged.
They were challenged by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., individual unions and numerous industrial associations, including the American Petroleum Institute, the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Corn Refiners Association.
"With rare exceptions, the individual substance discussions in the Air Contaminants Standard are virtually devoid of reasons for setting those individual standards," the judges said.
The unanimous decision was by Judge Peter T. Fay, appointed to the court by President Gerald R. Ford; Judge Emmett R. Cox, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and Senior Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter.
 
Reduced Risk Is Unproven
 The judges said the agency had shown that the substances on the list posed a significant risk when they were present in the air at some levels. But it said the agency had not proven that its new air-quality levels were low enough to significantly reduce that risk.
The court said that in most cases the agency had cited a few studies and then established an exposure limit without explaining why the studies mandated the limit.
The court said the only explanation the agency gave for setting such standards was that time and resource constraints prevented detailed analyses of the substances.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Economic Memo;
Clinton's Economic Plan Has a Roosevelt Tone

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Democrats hate to admit it, but Bill Clinton sometimes sounds like Ronald Reagan, especially when he says that the economy can grow its way out of the budget deficit.
Bush partisans who deride Governor Clinton's economic program often sound the way Democrats did when they questioned whether the tax cuts of President Reagan's first term would reduce the Federal deficit. 
 But appearances can be deceiving. When the Arkansas Governor and apparent Democratic Presidential nominee calls not for tax cuts but for more spending on public investment, he sounds far more like a Roosevelt Democrat than a Reagan Republican.
Mr. Clinton's advisers acknowledge that their plan relies heavily on economic growth. But they assert that their focus on increasing investment will serve as an engine for growth that will in turn increase tax revenue, reduce poverty and cut the demand for social programs like food stamps. All this, they say, will serve to lower the deficit.
 
$200 Billion Public Investment

The heart of the Clinton plan is spending $200 billion over four years on public investment: building high-speed railroads and a national computernetwork and improving education and job training. This, his advisers say, will increase productivity by three-tenths of a percent a year. They decline to estimate how much it will spur growth.
Indeed, what comes through strongest in speaking to Mr. Clinton and his advisers is their conviction that enhancing investment is a more urgent priority than cutting the deficit. And while insisting that he remains committed to eliminating the deficit, Mr. Clinton said the economic plan he unveiled on June 21, was influenced by 100 leading economists, including six Nobel laureates, who signed a letter urging the Government to spend $50 billion a year on investments to speed economic growth.
"In the absence of increasing investment in this country, including public investment, you can't get growth going again," Mr. Clinton said.
There is an undeniable adroitness to Mr. Clinton's economic plan, just as there was to President Reagan's. Mr. Reagan's arguments that tax cuts would increase growth and Government revenue dovetailed perfectly with conservative dogma. And Mr. Clinton's contention that beefed-up public investment will produce growth and a lower deficit dovetails neatly with Democratic beliefs.
The new Clinton plan has drawn plenty of Republican fire, with Vice President Dan Quayle lambasting it as just another "tax-and-spend" Democratic proposal that fails to discipline spending. He said the plan does not get serious about cutting the deficit. And conservative economists generally contend that it is too generous in estimating how fast growth will be and too stingy about specific proposals to trim the deficit.
"I don't think he has really addressed the budget deficit at all," said Edward Hudgins, an economist at the Heritage Foundation. "Unfortunately, he still hasn't focused on the major structural reasons for big spending and high taxes."
Mr. Hudgins is among those who fault the Governor's plan for failing to spell out how it would reduce spiraling Medicare and Medicaid costs.
Other conservative critics of Mr. Clinton say he exaggerates how much money can be collected by closing loopholes on foreign companies doing business in the United States. And some say that to obtain the gains in tax revenue that he envisions, Mr. Clinton's plan need annual economic growth at an unattainably high 5 percent.
"Seriously analyzed, it is transparently a phony," said Richard G. Darman, the Bush Administration's budget director.
The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the deficit will fall to $190 billion in the fiscal year 1996 from about $330 billion next year. Mr. Clinton says that under his plan, the deficit will fall to $141 billion in 1996.
According to the budget office, the main reason for the anticipated decline is that while the Government will pay out some $69 billion next year to bail out failed savings and loans, the Government expects to earn about $45 billion in the fiscal year 1996 when it sells off thrift institutions that are restored to health.
"The worst someone can say is we have a bold investment agenda," said Gene Sperling, director of economic policy for the Clinton campaign. "We detail how we are going to pay for every single cent of new spending, and we have billions left over for deficit reduction." Mr. Sperling conceded, however, that without an increase in growth, their plan would cut the deficit by only about $8 billion a year.
To pay for his ambitious investment plan, Mr. Clinton would cut spending by $140 billion from 1993 to 1996, suggesting, for instance, deeper cuts in the Pentagon budget. He would raise $58 billion by closing tax loopholes enjoyed by foreign corporations and would also raise taxes on the richest 2 percent of Americans by $92 billion over four years -- an increase that the Governor said would affect couples earning more than $200,000 a year.
 
Economists' Arguments
 The 100 economists promoting a $50-billion-a-year investment plan argue that such spending will lift the economy in the short term and create a more competitive economy in the long run. They say that by stimulating growth, and thus tax revenue, the plan will increase the deficit by considerably less than $50 billion a year.
The economists draw a sharp distinction between the effect of their plan and Mr. Reagan's tax cuts, which he said would stimulate the economy and eliminate the deficit. The economists say their plan will do more to hold down the deficit, because the deficit spending they envision will be go not for consumption but for investment.
The Clinton plan, like that of the the proposal of the 100 economists, embraces Keynesian deficit-spending techniques to accelerate growth. In that way, it resembles the modest tax cuts of President John F. Kennedy, which spurred a lackluster economy and, many economists say, helped cut the deficit.
Mr. Clinton said he plans many moves outside the Democratic mold, such as cutting Washington's bureaucracy by 100,000 workers and trimming Federal administrative costs by 3 percent a year.
As for criticism that closing loopholes on the foreign corporations would not bring in $15 billion a year, Mr. Sperling noted that the revenue projected in the Clinton program was only half that of Congressional studies.
 
Health Care Package to Come
 Mr. Clinton also said he did not include in his deficit-reduction plan any possible savings from reining in health-care costs because he is still working on a comprehensive health plan. He said the money saved "in reforming the Medicare and Medicaid system" will in large part go to helping finance "a basic health care package for uninsured Americans."
Six winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics have praised Mr. Clinton's plan. They are Kenneth Arrow of Stanford University, Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania, James Tobin of Yale and Franco Modigliani, Paul Samuelson and Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"Clinton's economic program makes prudent sense," said Professor Samuelson. "America most needs capital formation -- human and material capital, private and public capital."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Slide Has No Shock Wave

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Just a few years ago, lots of people worried that a financial collapse in Tokyo would devastate financial markets and economies everywhere, and nowhere more than in the United States.
But now that the wildly inflated Tokyo stock market has dropped a swooping 60 percent in two years, hitting a six-year low just last week, the plunge has created more ripples than waves in this country. 
 "So far financial distress in Japan has had astonishingly little impact on the U.S.," said David Wyss, chief financial economist for DRI/McGraw-Hill. "And that's probably going to continue."
In fact, the clearest evidence in the American economy that Japan has problems lies in what is not happening. Japanese investors are no longer snapping up luxury Hawaiian hotels, Impressionist paintings or Manhattan office towers. Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and other Japanese bankers have stopped undercutting their American competitors on loans and letters of credit.
Nor has there been any wholesale dumping of United States Treasury securities by Japanese investors -- the nightmare most often cited when financial experts tried to imagine what might happen if Japan disengaged from the United States financial markets. According to the doomsayers, the world's markets are so tightly intermeshed, and the wheels of America's financial markets so lubricated by Japanese money, that the machinery could not run without Japan's backing.
Why has there not been more impact?
Bankers, stockbrokers, real estate deal makers and economists have lots of answers. They range from the fact that Japan's stock market drop was stretched over two years -- rather than a couple of days -- to the fact that Japanese money continues to flow abroad (albeit in different forms), to the fact that the easygoing Japanese regulators are not putting pressure on banks to face up to their losses and liquidate their holdings.
Moreover, despite the increasingly international outlook of investors, stock ownership remains overwhelmingly national. Tokyo and Wall Street, as often as not, have gone their separate ways.
"If anything, this whole Japanese stock market deflation is helping the U.S. market," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns. "It's seen as a safe haven."
Indeed, Japanese investors have continued to send money abroad. Although the plunge in Tokyo stock values has cooled Japan's capital spending boom, it has not made Japanese citizens less thrifty. And as they continue to save, their money keeps flowing into world capital markets.
"The scare stories that Japanese institutions would be dumping securities simply ignore the more basic fact that capital outflows from Japan are at record levels," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. In the first quarter of 1992, he said, Japanese net outflows reached an annual rate of $108 billion.
That is not to say there has been no change. Japanese investors are buying a very different mix of foreign assets than a few years ago. They are shunning long-term investments (bonds, stocks, buildings), and concentrating on investments with shorter lives, such as three-month certificates of deposit and one-year bank loans.
 
Trend Toward Short-Term Assets
 Net purchases by Japanese of long-term foreign assets dropped to an annual rate of $36 billion in the first quarter, one-fifth of the $192 billion rate in 1989. At the same time, their net purchases of short-term assets zoomed to a $152 billion annual rate last winter. Those transactions were largely made by Japanese banks. The banks formerly financed purchases of long-term assets by borrowing short term in world capital markets; now that Japanese buyers are not as eager to buy such assets, the banks are paying down their short-term debt with foreign lenders.
"The form of capital going abroad has changed dramatically," Mr. Lipsky said. "The Japanese are implicitly supplying short-term liquidity to the world financial system and leaving it to others to transform these liquid funds into other investments."
What's more, some financial experts now say that even when the Japanese were throwing their yen at art, real estate and Treasury auctions, their role was often exaggerated. Japanese net bond purchases for example, reached only $15 billion at their peak.
"We were gnashing our teeth that the Japanese were taking over the U.S.," said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "Now we're sweating bullets wondering whether the collapse in Japan will end Western civilization."
By the time that the Nikkei collapse started to cause serious pain -- at the point, say, that it fell below 20,000 earlier this year -- the Japanese owned only a tiny fraction of United States long-term assets. The best estimate is that their cache amounts to a couple of percent of outstanding government securities and about double that percentage of American stocks.
 
Effect Is Not Large
 Economists agree that whenever the preferences of a large investor shift from one kind of asset to another, prices are affected. But the effect is not necessarily large. Speaking with a touch of hyperbole, Stanley Ginsberg, senior vice president of marketing at Daiwa Securities said: "Even if the Japanese sold everything all at once, it would be a blip. We're not talking a huge position."
Mr. Yardeni says of the Japanese: "They bought a lot and also sold a lot. They are very active traders." He points to the fact that even as Japanese investors have bought fewer bonds at Treasury auctions over the last couple of years, yields have declined. "Now, nobody even mentions the Japanese as a factor."
Would United States bond yields be even lower if Japan's financial woes had not kept Japanese investors from bidding up American bond prices by pumping more money into the market. Not enough to notice, Mr. Yardeni said. With a weak American economy, and soft demand for loans, American banks put more money into bonds, taking up some of the potential slack.
Last year, American banks poured $100 billion into United States government securities. Presumably, if Japanese banks were still feeling frisky and underwriting the worldwide commercial real estate boom, American banks would also be putting their cash into real estate loans instead of government securities.
In any case, the Japanese pullback from long-term assets came when the recession was stifling the demand for credit in this country. For the last year, consumers have been trimming debt and American businesses have been spending less on inventories and new plant and equipment.
 
'A Lot of Room' for the Treasury
 "That meant there was a lot of room for the Federal Government to borrow without pushing up rates," said Henry Kaufman, president of Henry Kaufman & Company, an economic consulting and money management firm.
And in a notable reversal, foreigners, including Americans, are pouring money into long-term Japanese assets. "The Japanese capital was going to keep us going," said Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "But the fact is that we are keeping their market up."
All this is not to say that Japan's troubles have not hurt some American individuals, businesses and local economies.
Japan's problems have been an added blow, for example, to battered commercial real estate. In the late 1980's, Japanese investors paid top dollar for choice properties, and Japanese banks were happy to lend them money. Jack Rodman, the Los Angeles managing partner at Kenneth Leventhal, an accounting firm, says that Japanese buyers own as much as 60 to 70 percent of prime office towers in downtown Los Angeles, space they paid $40 a square foot for that now rents for $15 a square foot. Needless to say, the buying has stopped.
At the same time, Japanese banks, which had offered cheaper real estate loans and at one point accounted for more than one-third of the commercial real estate loans in California, no longer are placing market share ahead of profitability. That has benefited competing American banks by easing the sharp price competition, but raised average prices of loans for borrowers. More important, feared liquidations have not materialized. "They are not under pressure to sell buildings, because the banks won't force them to," Mr. Rodman said.
 
Fewer U.S. Companies Acquired
 One area of major cutbacks by Japanese buyers, who held about $84 billion in so-called direct investments, is in acquisitions of United States companies. One reason, of course, is that on the average such investments have not been very profitable to date.
"With the exception of MCA and the Seattle Mariners, there have been almost no deals," said Jeffrey E. Garten, a managing director of the Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank. "The big companies all wanted to be here. But now that they are here, all the financial problems in Japan mean that they are not going to expand as fast as they might have."
American exporters are also being pinched a bit by Japan's problems. Japan is America's second-biggest export market, after Canada. If Japan's economic slowdown worsens as a result of spreading financial distress, American exports of everything from cotton to cigarettes to computers could suffer. United States exports to Japan have already flattened over the last year, after growing vigorously through the end of 1990.
"This thing can stay slow for a while," said David Rolley at DRI/ McGraw-Hill. "I don't think Japanese companies are coming clear about how much retrenching they're doing."
But not everyone has noticed. W. H. Clark is chairman and chief executive of the Nalco Chemical Company in Naperville, Ill., which for five years has been selling specialty chemicals in Japan, mostly to oil refiners, steel mills and chemical plants. Mr. Clark says his business there continues to do well. "To us, Japan is a great big hunk of cheese that we're nibbling at," he said.
"What difference does it make if 2 percent gets knocked off by a recession?" he asked rhetorically. "It's still a pretty big hunk."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Perot's Standard Campaign Speech: 'Plain Texas Talk' About 'People Power'

 BODY:
Ross Perot, whose flirtation with an independent Presidential candidacy has shaken the political establishment of both parties, likes to boast that he has no handlers, no "spin doctors" and, most important, no speech writers.
For some voters, such a do-it-yourself candidacy is a refreshing change from slick politics as usual. It also seems to mirror Mr. Perot's political philosophy. 
 Unlike that of most candidates, his basic campaign speeches are usually short, about 15 minutes, and are a recitation of the nation's ills. He often reads from notes, and his speeches tend to be woodenly delivered, often peppered with lyrics from Broadway show tunes, and devoid of detailed solutions for the problems he outlines.
Instead, Mr. Perot tells his audiences that they hold the key to righting the listing ship of state, and that citizen involvement in the political process is the way to break the Washington gridlock. He says the way for America to restore its competitive lead is for workers to make the words "made in the U.S.A." the standard for excellence. He says the way to end racial, religious and ethnic animus is for people to understand that the nation's diversity is "a strength, not a weakness." And he says poverty can be eased if "we help those who cannot help themselves."
For Mr. Perot, the revolution he seeks to lead -- he says he wants to be its servant -- is directed from the bottom up, not the top down. In "plain Texas talk," as Mr. Perot likes to say, his speeches are all about "people power."
What follows are excerpts from the speech that Mr. Perot delivered at a rally in Olympia, Wash., on July 2, as transcribed by The New York Times. The content is representative of the standard speeches that Mr. Perot gives to his supporters around the country in his still undeclared campaign for President.
Just a few months ago, all the people who were political professionals said that people like you couldn't organize yourselves in 50 states. In just five weeks, millions of you across the United States successfully organized yourselves and have produced a blizzard of petitions never seen before in the history of this country.
You literally have changed the political process. You have told the people in Washington, "Listen to us for a change." You have reminded the people in Washington that you own this country. Once again, we've gone back 200 years to a point where the people in Washington are your servants, thanks to what you've done. Now that's a lot of change in just three or four months, but my sense is you've just started.
This great country and all of you -- and many of you on a very personal basis -- on the battlefield for 45 years stood at the gate and kept the nuclear war from occurring. And I would like to pause for a minute and ask the crowd to let the military people who provided that service for us and kept the nuclear war from occurring until the cold war was over, let's let them know how we feel about them. In many cases we didn't do it when we should have, but now that the walls have come tumbling down and the Russian empire is broken into republics and the cold war is over -- thanks to all of you who did it -- I suggest that it's time to come and rebuild America.
Can we agree that we have work to do? Is there anybody here that's not willing to put his or her shoulder to the wheel and do it? Is there anybody here that can live with the fact that we are no longer the No. 1 economic superpower in the world? Is there any question in your minds that if we get off our seats and get in the ring. you and I can make the words "made in the U.S.A." once again the world standard for excellence?
Is there any reason, as someone in the audience says, we don't need any morning glories that wilt by noon. I agree with that. Is there any reason why we cannot outcrank, outcreate and outwork anybody anywhere in the world, and beat them in economic competition?
 
An Economic Super Bowl
 Let's look on it as an athletic event. If we were going to compete in sports, let's say football, we would want to go for the Super Bowl, right? Please, as we strive through this process, never forget this in your daily work. All day, every day, you are competing in an economic Super Bowl. Somebody wins, somebody loses, and the loser loses his job. There's no place to run, no place to hide, we just have to be better.
Now we've been the best in the world in a lot of things, and we can be the best in the world. Can we agree that we should not move all the manufacturing industries away, out of this country? Right. Why, we've just got to go to work, and I'm certain that you'd join me with that.
Now let's go back to sports for a minute. If we have an athletic team of geniuses that was all divided up, they'd lose, right? We've got a country all split up by race, religion, various beliefs. Can we agree that we are all in this together as a team? Can we agree that we cannot waste time fighting with one another? We've got to spend all of our energy working together. Now if we do that, the magic starts.
Can we agree that we will never be a great nation unless we have the finest public school system in the world? Does everybody here understand that you cannot elect someone and send that person to Washington and have that person do it for you? O.K. You are going to have to stay deeply involved at the local, county, state and national level as an owner for these revolutionary changes to occur. But if you, the taxpayers, want it, you can get it. Now that's our challenge.
 
Recalling the Pioneer's Creed
 Can you live with the fact that this great country is now the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world? Are you ready to get rid of the bars on the windows, the bars on the doors? Can you live with the fact that we've got 5 percent of the world's population and 50 percent of the world's cocaine use? Can we agree we will never win an economic competition, we will never have the best public schools and we will never have safe neighborhoods unless we get rid of drugs?
It took tough, hard people to create this country, and it's going to take tough, hard people to go from $4 trillion in debt to passing on the American dream to our children. When you think about this, think about the pioneer's creed. You're all the way out West, you hit the Pacific. The people who brought you here were tough people. Their creed was the cowards never started, the weak died on the way and only the strong survived.
We'll need the strong to do all this. But you have done a brilliant job. We can make this country anything we want it to be because of a very special, magic dream. It belongs to you and me. Everybody's worried about me getting sick and tired of all the stuff that gets thrown at you in a political campaign. As far as I'm concerned, those are little insignificant spitballs -- they have no impact at all. The only thing that matters to me is what the American people want.
All right. My position is very simple. I don't care whether you vote for me or vote for someone else. Now, what I do care about -- here's what I do care about. It's very important that everybody casts an informed vote in November as an owner of this country, right?
 
Putting America Back to Work
 As far as I'm concerned, if we don't rebuild our industrial base or, in plain Texas talk, we don't put America back to work, well, all these other things we want to work for are academic. We don't have the money to do it. We've got to put America back to work. I can't think of anything more exciting to do; as long as all of you stay linked together, anything is possible.
I urge you now -- get people to register to vote. I constantly look for good ideas. The story of my business success is that 99 percent of them were other people's. On the voters' registration, your state has one of the finest ideas in the country in that they're getting it done for less than 40 cents a voter, when people renew their driver's license.
Let's get everybody registered to vote. Let's get organized by precincts. Let's make sure that this is an election in November that comes from the people and not at the people from Washington.
And if you think about our great country, let's all do whatever it takes, whatever it takes to pass the American dream on to our children. Our parents worked and sacrificed for us, and most of our dreams far outstripped anything we thought we would accomplish as children. It's a special obligation we have to pass on to the next generation, and I know we can do it.
But when you kind of get tired and worn out, ask yourself aren't you as tough as your parents were? Look at your children and ask yourself, "Don't I love them enough to rebuild this country and have alabaster cities that gleam undimmed by human tears?" Certainly you do.
And to just close it all out, let me thank you again. And let's try to leave our country that has two characteristics. Where everyone of us -- not because there's a law that requires it, but because it comes from our hearts -- love and help one another. If you've got an elderly neighbor down the street who's an invalid, get the neighbors down there to pick up the house, cut the grass and look after that person. Don't just count on some government agency to do it. . . .
And then finally in closing, as you look at your children, let's leave them a memory. . . . Climb every mountain, ford every stream, follow every rainbow, until they find their dream. God bless you all. Thank you.

HEADLINE: Rabin's Call: What's a Housing Start?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 8

 BODY:
From a welter of numbers made public this week, it is beginning to appear that if Yitzhak Rabin is serious about scaling back settlement activity in the occupied territories, he may want to bring along statisticians and attorneys when he moves into the Prime Minister's office.
He may need them to define what a housing start really is, not to mention what it might take to keep his disparate coalition partners and the Bush Administration happy on this most sensitive issue. 
 Mr. Rabin, who continued today to put together his governing coalition by meeting with political parties representing left-wing, right-wing and religious interests, has been firm in his pledge to curtail settlement-building in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The construction has been denounced by the United States as a peace-busting activity and has been cited by Washington as the reason it has withheld $10 billion in requested loan guarantees for absorbing new emigres.
He is opposed to "political" settlements, Mr. Rabin says, adding that the only acceptable housing in the territories is that which enhances Israel's security. Most of that is music to Washington's ears, and there have been more than a few encouraging American nods in Mr. Rabin's direction since his Labor Party's election victory two weeks ago.
 
An Embarrassing Possibility
 But the definition of political vs. security has been left deliberately vague. If anything, the situation grew murkier this week when the Housing Ministry of the present Government and a major settlers' group announced that more than 16,000 houses and apartments were in assorted stages of construction across the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In addition, the ministry said it had plans for another 3,500 housing units, not including a variety of mobile homes that it would like to scatter around as well.
If all those houses are built and occupied, the settler population could in theory nearly double from the 110,000 Jews now estimated to be nestled in 140 communities in the territories. It would put Mr. Rabin in the obviously embarrassing situation of presiding over extensive settlements growth when he was expected to put on the brakes.
From his post-election statements, it seems likely that the new Prime Minister will not fully satisfy either his would-be partner on the left, Meretz, which prefers an absolute freeze of all planned construction, nor the Tsomet Party on the right, which wants the builders to keep on rolling.
 
Stages of Completion
 But then which numbers will Mr. Rabin use? That is where the lawyers and statisticians come in, and the ultimate answers are anybody's guess.
For example, the new ministry numbers, whose rough outlines are accepted by anti-settlements groups, show that 4,000 units are basically finished and will soon be occupied once they are connected to power and gas lines. Will the new Government accept those as unstoppable at this point?
If so, what about 9,000 other units said to be in varying stages of construction, from the laying of foundations to near-completion?
Or what about the 3,000 units where nothing more has been done than to get the ground ready, which some here argue is no small feat, given the rockiness of West Bank soil? Or the 3,000 or 4,000 others -- the numbers at this point become a bit elusive -- for which building contracts may have been signed but no actual work has begun?

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Rabin Urges Fairness to Arabs
 TEL AVIV, July 8 (Reuters) -- Mr. Rabin said today that Israel could best fight anti-Semitism worldwide through fair treatment of its Arab minority and of Palestinians in occupied lands.
Speaking via satellite to to a World Jewish Congress meeting in Brussels on anti-Semitism, Mr. Rabin said Israelis should set "certain moral standards of behavior" toward the Arab minority in Israel. He said Israelis should also uphold such standards of behavior toward Palestinians in the occupied territories insofar as possible.
Mr. Rabin said reasons for the rise of anti-Semitism in the world were ignorance and denial of its existence, political changes in Eastern Europe, economic recession and the Arab-Israeli conflict.

HEADLINE: Bound to Looms by Poverty and Fear, Boys in India Make a Few Men Rich

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEWAPURI, India

 BODY:
As the summer sun labored toward the desiccated plains of northern India, Amarnath Kumar, a straw-thin 10-year-old boy, and three friends crept away from the red adobe hut that had been their prison for 18 months. Across the blistered soil of fallow wheat fields, the boys hurried north, avoiding other people, hurrying into the descending darkness.
Behind them, in the adobe enclosure, they left other children -- children bought or stolen from their parents, taken to toil as virtual slaves on the carpet looms of eastern Uttar Pradesh. 
 For 12, 14, 16 hours a day, every day of the week, every week of the year, children as young as eight sit on rough planks knotting colored yarn around the stretched cords of the loom's warp, creating the carpets that India sells around the world.
What the four boys were escaping was the explosion of such slavery in this area, the use of children to fuel the rapid growth of the carpet industry. The United States is the biggest customer for Indian carpets.
 
Buying a Boy for $50
 There are no reliable data on the number of children working here; indeed, carpet brokers, professional associations and judicial officers all deny that any substantial number of children are working in bondage.
But estimates by others of the children's workforce in this area range from 300,000 to over a million. According to a report last month by the International Labor Organization, India has 44 million child laborers nationwide.
In most cases, the children who work in the carpet belt are purchased from their parents, or merely taken with promises of future payments. The vast majority come from the poorest parts of Bihar, the most impoverished state in India.
When parents are in fact paid, the going rate for an eight-year-old boy is 1,500 to 2,000 rupees ($50 to $66), a substantial sum for many families.
Once the deal is struck, the procurer will take 10 or 15 children at a time by bus and train to the carpet belt, usually to the town of Badhoi near here, where the loom owners will come to pick up their new workers.
Typically, says Raman Kant Rai, who campaigns to help the children, a boy may work three to five years before being returned to his family, having grown too large to work in the cramped dirt wells behind the looms. On occasion, however, some boys continue to work into their late teens and twenties, at which point they are given a minimal wage and become permanent workers in the industry.
Across India, in quarries, brass smelters, glass factories and match and explosives plants, children labor in dangerous, unhealthy and oppressive conditions, often against their will, sometimes with the consent of their parents. Child labor continues despite a 1976 law prohibiting all forms of bonded or slave labor and a 1986 act banning workers under the age of 14 from a broad range of industries.
Yet each year more and more children are forced into hazardous work places, sometimes with the connivance of the authorities, often with their tacit acceptance of child labor as an unpleasant fact of life. No one has ever gone to prison in India for using children as workers.
 
Locked in Dormitories
 "Nowadays, migrant child labor, bonded child labor, has increased," said Mr. Rai. "The people who are engaged in this have all kinds of money and influence. In this area, there has not been a single raid by the authorities."
Only rarely, it seems, do children escape their servitude: they are too young, too far from home, too terrified. At night, many loom owners keep the children locked in dormitories, adobe buildings with simple mats on dirt floors. And during the day, while not literally chained to their looms, the stare and the lash of loom owners bond the children to the planks on which they sit.
There are no roads into the nearby village of Bibris, just a rocky path that meanders in from a faint macadam strip that heads off toward a nearby town. Cows and coal-black water buffaloes are tethered to wooden stakes outside mud-walled houses.
Here and there, faint thumpings drift from earthen buildings. Around a corner, a row of village houses opens onto a courtyard bustling with the pat of bare feet and quiet words as dozens of boys, some just seven or eight, unwind huge skeins of undyed wool.
Inside the huts, huge wooden looms, strung with plain yarn like harps, reach from the bottom of the pits to the clay-tiled roofs. And behind them, on worn planks, sit more shirtless young boys, four to a loom, poking fingers through the warp, squeezing a snippet of yarn through and back and knotting it, all in a blur of movement. The tips of their fingers are strangely pink and shiny. After a time, the boys bash their knots together with mallets.
"In this village," explained Mr. Rai, "there are 4,000 looms. This village is the most problematic in the carpet belt, problematic in the sense it has the most loomage, the most notorious men." He pointed to a doe-eyed boy whose head barely reached above the seat of the bicycle on which he leaned.
"That boy," Mr. Rai said, "is eight. He was beaten for one year because he couldn't learn how to weave fast enough. The youngest boy I have seen is six and a half."
 
Industry Growing Rapidly
 India is expected sell about $170 million worth of carpets abroad this year, the vast majority hand-woven on looms here, virtually all of them by children. The United States, the largest customer, takes about 45 percent of the exports; Germany is the second-largest buyer.
India's carpet industry began to blossom in the last decade, after carpet exports from Iran and Afghanistan were reduced by international sanctions and war. While Indian carpets did not approach the quality of Persian or Afghan rugs, the finest is inexpensive enough and well enough made to sell well in the West.
"In 1970, there were not more than 20 or 30 exporters in this country," said Jalil Ansari, the secretary of the All India Carpet Manufacturers Association, in the town of Bhadohi. "Now there are more than 2,000."
Typically, an exporter will contract with dozens or hundreds of loom owners scattered through the carpet belt.
 
Bondage? What Bondage?
 Both the exporters and the carpet association are aware that widespread use of child labor violates Indian law and could create difficulties in selling carpets in the West if the extent of the practice became widely known. As a result, the association has suggested labeling carpets with tags declaring that they had been woven without the use of children.
Chandramani Mishra, a member of the manufacturers' association, said nothing had come of the suggestion. But, he added, "if you want a label, no problem."
Sometimes children are able to break out of their imprisonment. Amarnath Kumar is one of the few.
"We came to the railway crossing," he remembered. "The man who operated the crossing said, 'Where are you going?' We told him we escaped from Chhateri village. He let us sleep there. The next morning a man came and we told him our whole story. He said, 'Come with me.' He gave us food and then brought us to Dr. Rai."
For nearly 20 years, Mr. Rai, a chemist by training, has worked in this area to enhance village economies by encouraging new but simple farm technologies, home weaving of garments, improved sanitary conditions, education for village women -- consciously emulating Mahatma Gandhi's idea of small-scale, self-reliant rural communities. Only in the last year or so, however, has he begun to pay attention to the children laboring in the villages.
 
A Boy Escapes
 "For a long time, you look at something and don't see it," he said. "You don't know what you're seeing. We have a lot of blindness."
Amarnath, who was eight years old when he first began working on the looms, talked of his life in Chhateri a few days after he escaped with his three friends.
He said that a middleman, a man well-known in the area of north Bihar where his family lived, had told his father, "Your son will get good clothing, good food and 350 rupees a month" -- about $12.50. "My father said O.K. After all, I was just a cow boy."
"The first day we were brought there," he said, "we were told we had to weave carpets. I took two months to learn. No money was paid to me. All day we had to weave, even up until midnight. We were not allowed to rest during the day. If we became slow, we were 'murga banatha' " -- a phrase that means "made like a chicken." Amarnath squatted on the ground and bent over like a chicken. "We were beaten with sticks," he said. "We were beaten on our backs."
 
No Vegetables, No Milk
 "He used to lock us up at home, in a room," Amarnath continued. "There were nine of us in the room. For one and a half years we never had green vegetables, not to talk of milk. He did not even allow us to have a bath."
Among the more worldly exporters and business leaders, there is increasing sensitivity to the use of children on the looms, but little has deterred the practice.
Mr. Ansari, the secretary of the carpet makers' association, said his industry was the backbone of the region's economy. But he denied that children, particularly children in forced labor, were the main workforce in the industry.
 
'It Is Not True'
 "It is not true," he said. "Once or twice a week I go and I do not find it. They are getting the salary. They are getting food." Even downstairs from his office, though, children were hunched over carpets, clipping the outlines of flowers from the wool surface.
The senior civil official in the carpet belt, the district magistrate for Varanasi, Saurabh Chandra, said no children were being held in abusive labor in his domain. "Whenever any violation of any statute is pointed out," he said, "action is taken. We have released a large number of bonded laborers."
But in the interview Mr. Chandra could not say how many children had been released or when, or whether any penalties had been imposed on the loom owners who had pressed the children into bondage.
Then Mr. Chandra asked, "Why are you defaming our industry?"
Several hours after the interview, the reporter was approached at his hotel by two of Mr. Chandra's associates lugging a stack of files and seeking to expand on Mr. Chandra's comments.
One, Sudhir Kumar, the subdivisional magistrate, said no cases of bonded labor had ever appeared in his court.
The other, D. P. Singh, the deputy labor commissioner, said he was unsure how many children worked in the region's carpet industry. "When my inspectors come, the neighboring looms hide the children." But then, he admitted, "no inspector has been posted for this specific problem."

HEADLINE: A Saudi Bank and Ex-Chief Violated U.S. Law, Fed Says

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board has found that Saudi Arabia's largest bank and its former chief executive violated American banking laws in trying to acquire control of the Washington-based First American banks with help from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The board last week determined that Sheik Khalid bin Mahfouz and the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia had failed to properly report the 28.7 percent of First American's holding company they acquired in 1986, according to papers the Fed released today. 
 The Fed said it would also begin proceedings that could lead to the assessment of civil monetary penalties of as much as $170 million against Sheik Khalid and as much as $6 million against Haroon Kahlon, a former official of National Commercial also charged in the case. The two men can contest the board's findings.
In addition, the Fed has scheduled a hearing to determine whether a cease-and-desist order should be entered that could require the two men and their bank to make restitution and other payments in connection with the case.
The Fed's action adds considerable detail to the dealings between Sheik Khalid and B.C.C.I. that were the basis for criminal fraud charges against the sheik announced last week by the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.
On Tuesday, Sheik Khalid said he intended to fight those charges as he stepped down as chief operating officer of National Commercial Bank, the kingdom's largest bank, with more than $22 billion in assets.
National Commercial enjoyed close ties with B.C.C.I., the Luxembourg-based bank that regulators seized last year after evidence emerged that billions of dollars in deposits had been lost in what has become the biggest bank fraud in history. Today's announcement deepens the Saudi connection to the still- unfolding investigation of B.C.C.I.
 
Roles of Two Lobbyists
 The Fed's finding also presents new details about the role of Clark Clifford and Robert Altman, the two Washington lawyer-lobbyists who once were officers of First American. In 1986, as Sheik Khalid was completing his acquisition of First American stock with B.C.C.I.'s help, he toured First American operations in Washington and New York and "discussed First American business with Clark Clifford and Robert Altman," according to the Fed's statement of facts.
The document the Fed issued also indicates that Mr. Altman participated in discussions with a B.C.C.I. official and an official of National Commercial Bank in 1987 about helping Sheik Khalid file reports that might be required by the Fed in connection with his acquisition of First American stock.
Later in 1987, another partner in the Clifford and Altman law firm directed First American's transfer agent not to record on First American's books a pledge of First American stock in favor of National Commercial Bank, the statement also said. Not recording the statement could have made it more difficult to determine the extent of National Commercial Bank's control of First American.
 
Bank as International Bridge
 National Commercial Bank, controlled by the Mahfouz family, is not just another foreign bank. American officials, both past and current, and international businessmen consider it part of the Saudi royal family's inner circle, acting as the ruling family's principal bank and a vehicle for sensitive political transactions. And as an important foreign exchange dealer, the institution serves as a financial bridge between Western economies and the Middle East.
The diplomatic and financial ramifications of the case are many. Silver prices dropped on international markets Tuesday, stemming from the bank's large selloff, and representatives of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority have held discussions with the Fed, according to investigators.
No other private bank in Saudi Arabia enjoys the tolerance afforded National Commercial Bank, according to officials and businessmen. The bank has not published an annual financial statement, the best indicator of a bank's health, for two years. Such statements are required by regulators in the United States and elsewhere.
The Mahfouz family has ties to the United States, including properties and holdings in New York and Texas. A Federal judge signed an order today freezing Sheik Khalid's assets in the United States, including a luxury penthouse apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and bank stockholdings in Texas.

HEADLINE: Continental Cutting Some Vacation Fares

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Just days after the major airlines promised to raise fares after a bruising price war, Continental Airlines said yesterday that it would cut many summer vacation fares by an average of 25 percent on roughly half its routes.
If recent history repeats itself, Continental's competitors may feel compelled to outdo the fare cuts, touching off yet another round of discounting, said Lee Howard, executive vice president of Airline Economics, a consulting firm in Washington. 
 "There's a battle out there for fare leadership," he said.
In general, Continental's competitors said they would have to assess the details of the new discounts before announcing any specific actions.
Amy Spreeman, a spokeswoman for Northwest, said the airline was still planning to increase its fares by 4.4 percent across the board tomorrow. "But we tend to stay competitive," she said.
Joseph Crawley, a spokesman for American Airlines, added that American considered Continental's move odd in light of Continental's decision to sue American over predatory pricing.
The Continental sale runs from July 16 through Sept. 15. Tickets have to be purchased by Friday, July 17, and require a Saturday stay.
The seat sale includes a $350 round-trip flight between New York and Los Angeles, an 8 percent reduction from the existing fare of $380. Round trip to Baton Rouge, La., from Newark or La Guardia airports will cost $250, a 24 percent reduction.
The individual cuts range from 8 percent to 35 percent.
Continental said it intentionally limited the number of seats sold in the recent fare war because it could not justify selling those seats at such sharp discounts.
It hopes that the new discounts will still entice travelers who were shut out of the recent price sale, and give the airline better revenues on the tickets it does sell.
"We were keeping our powder dry," said David Messing, a spokesman for Continental.

HEADLINE: Japan, Citing Recent Accident, Delays Launching

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 8

 BODY:
In another serious setback for Japan's budding space program, the Government announced today that it would delay the initial launching of its next-generation rocket by one year because of a recent accident.
The rocket, known as the H-II, is the first to be built solely by Japan, without reliance on foreign technology. As such it is a source of national pride and will be the first rocket powerful enough to let Japan launch communications and weather satellites for other nations and private companies. 
 But much to the embarrassment of this usually technically proficient nation, development of the rocket has been dogged by a series of accidents and delays, including an explosion in August that killed an engineer.
The new delay of the first launching, from early 1993 to early 1994, puts the program fully two years behind its original schedule and could hurt Japan's chances of competing in the commercial launching business against American companies and Europe's Arianespace.
"This is a very big problem for us," said Hiroshi Imamura, a managing director of Rocket Systems Corporation, a two-year-old venture owned by 75 Japanese companies that was formed to offer launching services using the H-II. Already, Mr. Imamura said, potential customers have been reluctant to sign up to use the H-II until it has shown it works.
The latest setback occured during an engine test on June 18 at Japan's space center on Tanegashima Island. Within seconds after ignition, liquid hydrogen fuel leaked, setting off a fire and explosion that severed some parts of the engine and melted others.
The National Space Development Agency of Japan said today that it had determined that the leak started with a crack in a weld that joined a chamber in the liquid hydrogen fuel pump to an elbow-shaped pipe leading to the fuel injector. It appeared the weld had been subjected to greater temperature fluctuations than expected, officials said.
Moreover, subsequent inspections revealed other tiny cracks in other welds within that engine and in other test engines, necessitating a complete review and redesign of part of the engine.
"If it was only in this particular engine, the problem would have been minor," Dr. Tomifumi Godai, executive director of launch-vehicle development and operation at the space agency, said at a news conference today. "But we consider this a more comprehensive problem. That is why we decided we need a design change."
Dr. Godai said it was not surprising that there have been problems building that type of engine, which uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen under high pressures.
"Nobody in the world develops liquid engines easily," he said. "It's better not to have any trouble, but I think we are making steady progress."
An American aerospace executive stationed here agreed.
"They've tackled a very challenging engine," he said. "When they get it completed, it will be as advanced as anything we have in the U.S. or France."
Still, for all its expertise in cars and computer chips, Japan is not playing to its strength in the space business. For one thing, rocketry involves building a few very expensive items, rather than millions of inexpensive items, a task at which Japan excels.
Moreover, Japan is a latecomer to space, in part because of restrictions imposed by the American occupying forces after World War II on developing military technology. Japan did not launch its first satellite until 1970, a year after the United States had already landed on the moon.
In previous rocket generations, Japan has licensed technology from the United States, but with restrictions that prevented it from offering commercial launching services. Frustrated with that situation and eager to build its own industry, Japan has been trying to become more self-sufficient.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Slip as Dow Eases 1.89

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks closed slightly lower yesterday as investors struggled with worries over second-quarter earnings and the economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 1.89 points lower at 3,293.28, after skipping over a wide range of nearly 30 points. Declining issues led advancers, 897 to 834, on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 201 million shares. 
 The Nasdaq index closed 0.16 higher at 557.57.
The market's focus was on coming earnings results, particularly airlines and California banks, the newest sectors to weaken.
The market attracted late buying on talk that stocks may be oversold after the Dow index plunged nearly 45 points Tuesday. It was the steepest loss in three months.
"I think we could see the market back up to the 3,300 level," said Robert Walberg, an analyst at MMS International." I think the market is looking pretty good for the next few days."
But he conceded that earnings, the Presidential election and stagnant economy all were lingering impediments.
Jack Solomon, a technical analyst at Bear, Stearns, said: "We became a little bit oversold. Everyone turned bearish."
Bradley Turner, chairman of McDonald & Company's investment policy committee, said the weakness in airlines' stocks was an "indication of yet another sector in an ongoing series of corrections."
Mr. Solomon said the cut to 3 percent from 3 1/2 percent last week in the Federal Reserve's discount rate "is one of the goodies taken out of the cookie jar." Now, he said, investors have to wait for earnings to provide direction.
Mr. Walberg said cyclical stocks, having outperformed other sectors earlier this year, are now succumbing to profit taking. Cyclicals are companies that traditionally do well in an economic rebound.
Mr. Solomon said market conditions would stay skittish.
"There's enough fear of bad earnings reports to keep the market off balance," he said, adding that he suspected the worst of the selloff was over for now.
Among individual stocks, Marion Merrell Dow continued to slip, losing 3/8, to 27. The drug maker on Tuesday said it was forced to modify the labeling for its prescription anti-allergy product, Seldane, to include certain health risks. Dean Witter lowered its 1993 estimate on the company.
Durr-Fillauer Medical jumped 5 1/4, to 27 1/2, on news that the Bergen Brunswig Corporation had begun a $26-a-share bid for the company.
Among airline stocks, AMR lost 2 1/8, to 63 5/8; UAL fell 2 3/4, to 114 3/4, and Delta Air Lines was down 1 5/8, to 55 1/8.
The Exabyte Corporation, the cartridge tape maker, rose 2 3/4, to 29 3/8, after reporting a rise in second-quarter profits.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 1.12 points to end at 410.28.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite index rose 0.34, to 225.49, while the American Stock Exchange index ended 0.40 point lower at 379.86.

HEADLINE: Hospital Data Show Increase In Drug Abuse

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
After showing modest signs of improvement, the drug situation in New York City has taken a turn for the worse, state officials said yesterday. Hospital treatment of heroin and cocaine cases is up sharply, they said, and some dealers are expanding their operations and dropping prices.
In a midyear assessment, the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services reported that emergency-room treatment for adverse effects from heroin increased by more than half in the first nine months of 1991 over the previous year and that emergency treatment for cocaine was up almost a third. 
 The agency said that field workers have found new heroin dealers setting up shop throughout New York City, some of them having cut the price of the standard $10 or "dime" bag to $5. In some parts of the city, the agency said, crack is being sold at an all-time low of 75 cents a dose.
 
A Clear Picture
 The semiannual reports by the state office are considered the best snapshot of the drug culture in the city. Officials study hospital, medical examiner and drug-treatment-center statistics and dispatch field researchers to interview buyers and sellers on the street.
The emergency-room data form a primary barometer of trends in illegal drug use. Fluctuations in the number of patients treated are generally thought to reflect changes in the number of people using drugs. But heavy users sometimes make multiple visits to emergency rooms, making assessments on volume difficult.
Increases in cocaine casualties are being reported in other cities around the country, but only New York and Baltimore, which has the highest rate, have shown jumps in adverse reactions to heroin.
The state estimates there are at least 200,000 heroin addicts in New York City and at least twice as many heavy crack and cocaine users, the largest drug-taking groups in the country.
 
Abundance and Competition
 State officials and private drug experts said the lowering of prices seemed to reflect an abundance of heroin and cocaine in New York City, the largest drug import center and market in the country, as well as increasing competition as more young sellers, facing unemployment in the recession, enter the drug business
The advent of $2 or $3 vials of crack, readily smokable cocaine, in the mid-1980's played a major role in attracting new users.
Now, for 75 cents, a customer can get a single "hit," or puff, of crack, the agency said. Often working in abandoned buildings, sellers light a crack pipe and pass it through a slot in a locked door, the agency said, "so the smoker can get a fast hit."
 
Too Many Say Yes
 "This is troublesome data," said Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, the chairman of the Governor's Advisory Council on Substance Abuse and the president of Phoenix House, the largest residential drug treatment organization in the country.
"It tells us," he said, "that this chronic problem that we have been dealing with is in fact deepening, that new users are continuing to come into the system and that we have not halted drug abuse in the most vulnerable, most disadvantaged population."
Record amounts of heroin have been produced in Asia, and Colombia recently began producing the drug, along with its mainstay, cocaine. As a result, the purity of heroin being sold in New York has increased dramatically. As recently as five years ago, a $10 bag of heroin contained as little as 4 to 7 percent of the drug. Laboratory reports now show bags containing 55 percent heroin being widely marketed in New York City, the agency said.
The potency of the heroin makes it possible for people to inhale the drug like powdered cocaine instead of injecting it, making the drug attractive to more people, the experts say. In addition, some longtime users are shifting from injecting to snorting because of fear of contracting H.I.V., which causes AIDS, from shared hypodermic needles.
John Galea, the head of the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services' street research unit, said that while heroin dealers are expanding their markets and moving into areas that were once exclusively crack and cocaine markets, he saw no signs that crack and cocaine use were diminishing.
"Crack is not increasing at the level of a few years ago," he said, "but it's still increasing."
 
Little No Rise in Deaths
 In addition to the apparent increase in heroin use, the more potent blends, Dr. Rosenthal said, may at least partly explain the sharp rise in emergency-room cases. But, inexplicably, there has not been a concomitant rise in deaths from heroin overdoses. In the first half of 1991, the agency said, 278 people died after taking heroin, compared with 264 in the first half of the previous year. Cocaine deaths rose 11 percent in the first half of 1991, to 461, compared with 417 in the first half of 1990.
The agency reported a 20 percent increase in the number of cocaine users who entered drug-treatment programs, as opposed to those seeking emergency help at the hospitals. In 1991, up to 12,631 cocaine users entered treatment, surpassing the previous record level of 11,286 in 1989. The agency said 11,712 heroin users entered treatment in 1991, 207 fewer than the previous year.
 
A Long, Slow Desperation
 Heroin addictions are slower to develop and usually last longer than cocaine addictions, drug experts say. Either drug may create a health emergency, both for new users unfamiliar with the amounts they can tolerate and for practiced users whose systems begin to fail, but cocaine addicts tend to hit bottom or burn out and seek treatment sooner than heroin addicts.
Emergency-room incidents jumped after diminishing and then holding steady for about a year. Heroin cases rose to 4,510 in 1991 from 2,906 in 1990. Reflecting the much greater number of cocaine users in the city, emergency room cases rose from 9,347 in 1990 to 12,129 in 1991. The soaring figures in New York City have rippled out to the surrounding metropolitan area, with higher numbers of visits for cocaine and heroin users registered in hospitals in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties.
Arrests for both cocaine and heroin have been dropping in New York City. But Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, in a recent interview, said arrests were down because he had thinned the ranks of special drug units to make more officers available for neighborhood patrols. Instead of trying to arrest thousands of buyers and sellers, Mr. Brown said, his officers were focusing on middle- and upper-level traffickers.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Who Will Pay, If Not Japan?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THIS economic news just in from Munich: Leaders of the industrial powers have affirmed, in principle, their support for open trade, stable growth and aid for the former Soviet Union.
Wait; don't turn to the crossword puzzle. While the gathering in Munich, Germany, was a snooze -- economic summit meetings are convened to reassure, not entertain -- some of the subjects conspicuously not on the agenda are very interesting indeed. And surely nontopic A was Japan, or more precisely, the contradictions between what the world says it wants from Asia's economic colossus and what it really needs. 
President Bush's pre-election beef with Japan is the trade deficit. And no wonder: After a few years of narrowing, Japan's surplus of exports over imports is heading for a record $135 billion. The trade gap with the United States alone is creeping back toward $50 billion.
These numbers do not surprise Gary Saxonhouse, an economist the University of Michigan. "We're coming out of a recession," he noted, "while they're going in." As a result, foreign demand for Japanese goods is stronger than Japan's demand for imports.
Nor does the fiscal remedy prescribed by the White House and seconded by the European powers. A kick in government domestic spending by Japan would help suck in imports, as well as create demand at home for Japanese goods that might otherwise have been shipped to Pittsburgh or Paris. And by all accounts, Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's economics-savvy Prime Minister, is eager to oblige: the $50 billion public works package that he showed off at Munich should add a percentage point or two to Japan's growth rate.
So far, so good; idle productive capacity in Japan serves no one's interest. But the same is not necessarily true for the rest of the economic prescription being pressed on Japan.
Take that pesky bilateral trade deficit. While American politicians have grown accustomed to measuring the health of the economic relationship with Japan by the size of the deficit, John Taylor, a White House economist who recently returned to Stanford University, acknowledges that a bilateral balance in trade would be neither practical nor especially desirable. Energy-poor Japan is bound to run a deficit with oil exporters, he notes, and is thus prone to running surpluses with industrial trade partners.
Of course, some American exporters -- notably rice farmers -- would benefit from an opening of the Japanese market. But Mr. Saxonhouse argues that the rhetoric of trade injustice long ago outstripped the reality. If every Japanese barrier to trade were removed, he estimates, American sales to Japan would increase by only a few billion dollars a year.
Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School, wonders whether even these modest gains to some American exporters would lead to an overall reduction in Japan's monster trade surplus. An economy's balance on external accounts, he points out, is by definition the difference between domestic savings and domestic investment: if neither changes, the only way Japan can import more is to export more. Thus the only way to placate foreign critics, whose real concern is Japanese competition in their home markets, is to persuade the Japanese to save less or invest more at home.
That logic has not been lost on the Bush Administration. Indeed, Mr. Taylor was in charge of nagging the Japanese to act more like us, to invest more in public amenities and to give Japan's overworked, underhoused "salary men" a taste of the good life. And he can point to at least one important victory: the repeal of retailing laws that made price discounting and Western-style chain merchandising almost impossible.
But Mr. Lawrence does not "have a lot of faith" that outsiders can alter the Japanese inclination to delay gratification. More important, he and many other economists wonder whether it is really in the West's interest to transform Japan's thrifty ants into what-me-worry grasshoppers.
Europe and America save less than they invest at home. Even prudent Germany has become a net importer of capital, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government struggles to pay the trillion-dollar bill to transform eastern Germany into a capitalist paradise. That leaves Japan to fill the savings void -- to provide most of the imported capital to develop China, southern Asia, India and Latin America, not to mention Russia and its former chattels.
America could always pull up its socks, Mr. Taylor suggests, slashing the Federal deficit or squeezing an extra hundred billion dollars in savings from household budgets. But that would not help Mexico or Thailand if, as Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot are apparently proposing, the savings were plowed into better schools or faster railroads.
Prudence would suggest that Japan be lectured less on the virtues of life on the installment plan. For some day, they might listen.

HEADLINE: Lease Deal By Airbus And United

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
United Airlines, long the most loyal and biggest customer of the Boeing Company, yesterday said it had leased 50 planes from Airbus Industrie, the four-nation European consortium battling Boeing's world dominance in commercial aircraft.
It was the first Airbus order for United, which had used Boeing planes exclusively, and analysts said it was a breakthrough that could lead to more orders in the future. 
 "It's a move of big strategic significance," said George Shapiro, the aerospace analyst for Solomon Brothers. He added that Airbus might have offered terms that did not bring much of a return, but would get the consortium a foothold at one of the biggest airlines in the United States.
For Boeing, the loss of the order is not expected to have a big impact in the short term. The company still has a huge backlog of orders from the world's airlines.
 
Positive Side of Losing
 "I think losing the deal is going to be a minor positive for Boeing because of their unwillingness to make an uneconomical deal no matter how important a customer is," Mr. Shapiro said.
But the company has lost some of its appeal in recent years as the airline industry has consolidated and some carriers have stretched out orders for new airplanes and cut back on capital spending.
Boeing's stock dropped 87.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $40.375 in heavy trading. It had traded as low as $39.875. In the last year, the stock has traded as high as $54.625.
Exact terms of the order for the 50 Airbus A320 aircraft were not disclosed, but it does include options on 50 more A320's.
 
Similar to Other Leases
 John Leahy, vice president of marketing for Airbus in the United States, said the terms of the United Airlines lease were similar to other leases like one between Boeing and American Airlines for new Boeing 767's.
The twin-engine A320 jets normally sell for about $45 million each, but United will not buy the planes, it will lease them from Airbus.
It has become common practice for airlines to buy aircraft, sell them to outside investors and then lease them back. What is unusual in the United arrangement with Airbus is that the lease will be held by the manufacturer.
United was considering mainly the A320 and the Boeing 737 line of airplanes.
Mr. Leahy said the A320 offered better performance, greater range, better fuel economy and the ability to fly at higher altitudes.
The A320 generally carries about 150 passengers in a first- and coach-class configuration and has the range to fly transcontinental routes like New York to San Francisco.
The A320 aircraft will be powered by two engines made by a consortium of companies led by Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce. The first airplane is to be delivered in November 1993.
United has 109 Boeing 727's, which have three engines, in its fleet. The Airbus A320 requires only two pilots in the cockpit compared to three for the 727 and uses about 30 to 40 percent less fuel.
Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman and chief executive officer of United, said that the transaction "provides us the right-sized aircraft with the requisite performance capabilities."
He added that United still had a huge number of airplanes on order from Boeing and that the airline "will remain Boeing's largest customer."
 
An Eventual Profit?
 Airbus, which is made up of companies from France, Spain, Britain and Germany, has battled with Boeing for every large order and now controls about 30 percent of the world airplane market.
The company has many of its plants and its headquarters in France.
Other United States carriers that have ordered or operate Airbus airplanes are American, America West, Continental, Delta, Northwest and Trans World Airlines.
Mr. Leahy said that while United could turn back the planes under certain conditions, he believed that Airbus would eventually make a profit on the deal.
He said the A320 technology was shared by other planes made by Airbus, like the A321, A330 and A340, giving Airbus a base to sell United other lines of planes.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Amoco Is Cutting 8,500 Jobs

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The Amoco Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest oil company, said yesterday that it would eliminate 8,500 jobs, 15.7 percent of its 54,120 employees, by the end of the year.
Amoco's announcement was one of the largest staff reductions announced in recent months. Hughes Aircraft, Aetna Life Insurance and Digital Equipment have also announced plans to reduce thousands of jobs, and economists, stunned by the extent of job losses last month, have issued more pessimistic forecasts. 
 Amoco, which is based in Chicago, attributed the cutbacks to the weak global economy, low energy prices and the need to dispose of unneeded divisions. About 1,100 of the jobs lost will be in the Chicago area.
"This is a significant move," said Eugene L. Nowak, an oil analyst at Dean Witter. "They don't want to sit around and count on being bailed out by higher oil and gas prices."
The cutback reflects in part the company's belief that any recovery will be weak.
H. Laurance Fuller, Amoco's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview: "It's very clear that none of the major trading areas in the world are in a strong economic position at the moment. That's true in the Far East and true in the United States."
Amoco said it would take an $800 million after-tax charge against earnings in the second quarter to cover the costs of pruning its operations.
Among the changes are a reduction in Amoco's oil and gas exploration and production and the sale of several businesses, including petroleum additives and carpet-yarn operations.
"It's part of an industry process," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "It's not the first company to cut back, and it won't be the last."
Indeed, Unocal Corporation also announced plans yesterday to eliminate 1,000 jobs -- 6.4 percent of its work force, and the Mobil Corporation said Monday that it would drop 2,000 jobs.
Over all, Amoco is shedding 2,800 jobs by selling some operations. Of the other 5,700 jobs, some will be lost through attrition, some through voluntary retirement and severance incentives and some through layoffs. Mr. Fuller said he could provide no further figures.
Wall Street often cheers news of cutbacks, and Amoco found ready approval yesterday.
For several months, Mr. Fuller has been telling analysts and investors to expect some cutbacks. The extent of these economies still impressed those who follow the company. On a day when other oil stocks were mixed, Amoco popped up $1.25 before settling at $48.75, up 87.5 cents. The company said efficiencies resulting from the cutbacks would add more than $600 million a year to earnings before taxes by the end of 1993. Mr. Nowak of Dean Witter called this prediction credible, adding that it translated to an extra 80 cents a share above his estimated earnings of $2.45 a share this year.
The cutbacks and reorganization are the broadest evidence of where Mr. Fuller, who took over in February, 1991, wants to lead his company.
Of the $800 million in charges, the cuts in oil and gas exploration and production will result in losses of $250 million in the second quarter. And the sale of several businesses will mean a net loss of an additional $220 million.
The job reductions are costing the company $170 million, and other reorganization expenses $160 million.
What will be left, Mr. Fuller said, is a company better able to grow in its core businesses, especially energy refining and marketing and chemicals.
"My vision of the company is basically as follows," he said. "We need to be the most cost-efficient organization in our respective businesses, and we're setting forth to do that."
Mr. Fuller, who is 53 years old, said he expects the energy industry to rebound eventually. "But we have to recognize the realities of the economy today," he said.

Unocal Details Cuts
 LOS ANGELES, July 8 (AP) -- Unocal provided details today of its plan to cut debt by $1.5 billion over five years, saying 1,100 jobs would be eliminated.
The oil giant, which is based here, had said earlier that 800 to 1,100 jobs would be lost and had previously announced that it would combine its "downstream" refining, marketing and chemicals businesses into a single division.
It said today that it would do the same for its "upstream" exploration and production businesses. The new Energy Resources division combines three divisions: International Oil and Gas, North American Oil and Gas and Geothermal, eliminating or downsizing seven regional structures in North America.
Unocal said it anticipates the steps will increase after-tax cash flow by $200 million a year beginning in 1993.

Treasury Securities Dip in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of outstanding Treasury securities dipped in fairly active trading yesterday, as dealers pared positions in order to place bids at yesterday's auction of $9.5 billion of seven-year notes.
Traders said demand was good for the new securities, which were sold at an average yield of 6.44 percent, down from the 7.11 percent average yield at the last seven-year note auction on April 8. It is the lowest yield on a seven-year note since the auction on Jan. 8, when the yield was 6.40 percent. 
 Speculative accounts generally are the biggest buyers of seven-year notes, but dealers said that was not the case at yesterday's auction.
"We had a lot of high-quality buyers and not a lot of speculative accounts," the head government securities trader at a Wall Street house said. "And because of the steepness of the yield curve, for the first time we are seeing the banking community move for the first time into this issue."
Over the last few years, big banks have been heavy buyers of Treasury issues but have tended to concentrate their purchases in maturities of five years and less.
The Treasury auction was held during a session when issuance of corporate and municipal bonds remained heavy.
More than $1.6 billion of corporate debt securities were priced yesterday, according to analysts at MCM Inc., a New York investment advisory firm. Close to $1 billion in municipal bonds were offered, and nearly $1 billion in asset-backed securities were priced.
 
Dealers Lightening Positions
 Although some decline in Treasury prices reflected the auction, traders said some dealers were lightening their positions in Government securities to cover inventories of unsold corporate bonds issued so far this week.
Despite the price decline, analysts said the market's positive tone remained in place, and that interest rates could fall further.
"We don't think there is much risk that bond yields will rise, and we can't see short rates moving higher over the next three months," said Mike Niedermeyer, a senior vice president in the fixed-income department at the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "It would take a gross scare to get rates to move up the way they did over the winter, but we don't think there is enough steam in the economy to do that."
Most of the drop in prices yesterday was recorded among shorter-term notes and bills, issues that have been star performers over the last few weeks.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 5/8, down 1/32 , to yield 7.60 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 11/32 late yesterday, down 9/32 , to yield 6.88 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 6/32 , down 3/32 , to yield 4.36 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved a bit higher.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.20 percent, up 2 basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.27 percent.
In the corporate bond market, Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager on a $937.5 million offering of securities backed by auto loans for a financing arm of the Chrysler Corporation.
The two-part issue consisted of $900 million of senior 5.05 percent notes, and $37.5 million of subordinated notes.
The senior notes, which have an average life of two years, were priced at $99.89, to yield 5.143 percent, 77 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 5 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The subordinated notes were priced at $99.977, to yield 5.424 percent, 1.05 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 5 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The senior notes are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The subordinated securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's.
The Comcast Corporation offered $300 million of 20-year high-yield senior subordinated notes through Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 10 5/8 percent notes, which are noncallable for life, were priced at $100, or par, three percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 29 1/2-year bond at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated B-1 by Moody's and B by Standard & Poor's.
New issues in the tax-exempt municipal bond market were led by the sale of $517.4 million of revenue bonds for Arizona's Salt River Agricultural Improvement and Power District.
 
Yields on Serial Bonds
 Yields on serial bonds range from 2.40 percent in 1993 to 6.05 percent on bonds maturing in 2009.
Term bonds offered have a maximum yield of 6.219 percent on securities maturing in 2030.
Bear, Stearns & Company acted as lead manager for the negotiated sale.
Ratings of AA are expected from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds said that despite the heavy inflow of new securities demand for outstanding bonds remained good.
Prices of most corporate bonds were unchanged to up 1/8 point, traders said. Meanwhile, prices of widely quoted municipal bonds firmed by about1/8 point.

HEADLINE: Suffolk, Facing a Budget Cliff, Gets a Little Rope From Albany

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 8

 BODY:
The State Legislature failed to approve financial bailout plans for Nassau and Suffolk counties before adjourning last week, but it did enact a local hotel room tax for Suffolk, the first such tax on the island.
The tax, which Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is expected to sign into law, was adopted with little notice last Friday amid a dispute between Long Island Republicans and Governor Cuomo and other Democrats over the counties' proposals to balance their budgets by borrowing $190 million. 
 The revenue from the Suffolk room tax -- estimated at $900,000 a year -- will go to promote tourism on the island, maintain historic buildings and aid museums. Nassau County, encouraged by Suffolk's success in Albany, is now expected to pursue similar legislation.
The new tax will add 0.75 percent to the daily rate charged by hotels, motels, campgrounds and bed-and-breakfast establishments in Suffolk County, or 75 cents on a $100 room.
Hotel guests now pay state and county sales tax totaling 8 percent on rooms that cost more than $100 a day. The date for the new tax to go into effect has not been set.
 
Negotiations Continue
 Though the legislators adjourned for the summer last Friday after heated partisan wrangling, their staff members continued to try to negotiate an agreement so that Nassau and Suffolk could get their bailouts and Governor Cuomo could win approval of his $800-million bond proposal to create jobs, the centerpiece of his economic-development program.
Both the jobs proposal and the Long Island bailout bills were defeated around 4 A.M. Friday, after the State Assembly Speaker, Saul Weprin, a Democrat from Queens, and the Senate Majority Leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, exchanged angry words.
Governor Cuomo has urged both sides to seek a resolution. Leaders of the Senate and Assembly could call a special session, and some officials had hoped for one this Friday, before the Democratic National Convention occupied Democratic legislators. But there were indications today that the stalemate was continuing.
 
Oversight in Dispute
 Mr. Weprin said he still believed the counties needed financial review boards, which are strongly opposed by Republicans.
Mr. Marino said today that an agreement could have been reached last week. "It's not a question of when we'll meet," he said. "It's a question of when the Democrats stop trying to play politics with the fortunes and future of Long Island."
Nassau is seeking Albany's approval to borrow $100 million dollars, 70 percent of it in five-year general obligation bonds, and to raise $213 million by the end of 1997 by doubling its mortgage recording tax to 2 percent. Suffolk wants to borrow up to $91 million and to raise the county's 8 percent sales tax to 8.5 percent.
Without the funds, both counties will run out of money by October and will lay off thousands of employees, drastically cut services and raise property taxes between $200 and $300 for each homeowner. Nassau's $1.8 billion budget has a $153 million shortfall, and Suffolk's $1.3 billion budget has a $100 million gap.
The room tax was one of several measures supported by the Suffolk County Executive, Robert Gaffney, to close the gap.

G.M. Signs an Accord With Environmentalists

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
In an unusual expression of detente between industry and environmentalists, General Motors and the Environmental Defense Fund announced yesterday that they had signed an agreement to hold formal discussions on environmental issues.
"Over the last 20 years, it's been each side preaching to the heathen on the other side," said Joseph Goffman, a lawyer with the environmental group. "We've decided to skip the great conversion speeches and talk about what we can talk about." 
 G.M., the world's largest car maker, is at the center of a wide range of such environmental issues as urban smog, destruction of the ozone layer and the threat of global warming.
The Environmental Defense Fund, a New York-based nonprofit group with 200,000 members, often sues polluters. Last November, however, it negotiated an agreement with the McDonald's Corporation under which, among other things, the fast-food company replaced its plastic "clamshell" packaging with biodegradable cardboard. .
The dialogue required a formal agreement, said Samuel A. Leonard, G.M.'s director of automotive emissions control, so the environmentalists "could not be accused of selling out."
The agreement specifies that the environmental group will not accept funds from G.M. and that G.M. cannot publicize the dialogue in advertising, marketing or point-of-purchase materials, without the group's permission. The fund would be unlikely to give such permission, Mr. Goffman said.
Informal collaboration has been going on since January and has already produced a proposal presented to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency on running a program for scrapping old cars.
President Bush proposed such a program in November, in which a company that faced a requirement to cut air pollution at a factory it owned could instead buy old, high-pollution cars and scrap them, taking credit against other obligations to cut pollution.
 
2 Heads Better . . .
 Both G.M. and the Environmental Defense Fund have said the joint proposal is better than each could have come up with on its own. The Environmental Defense Fund proposed that pollution-reduction credit be limited to 90 percent of the actual reduction.
"It makes eminent sense when you think about it," Mr. Leonard of G.M. said in a telephone interview yesterday.
G.M., Mr. Leonard said, had added that the vehicles to be scrapped be selected by actual measurement of tailpipe emissions, rather than simply by their age.
"The process we've gone through on vehicle scrapping has increased our respect for what the other brings to the table," Mr. Leonard said.
The two sides plan to discuss ways to encourage the use of clean vehicles that run on other than gasoline, ways to measure automotive emissions, cost-effectiveness of new fuels and new standards on vehicle emissions, the role of vehicles in global warming and the impact of regulatory requirements on vehicle design.
But they will avoid some long-standing areas of dispute, including fuel economy standards and installing larger canisters on cars to filter the polluting gases that evaporate from fuel tanks.
"We will have to use more traditional methods to solve those," he said, alluding to lobbying in Congress and arguing before the administrative agencies and the courts.

Cocoa Prices Up Sharply; Gasoline at 4-Month Low

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Cocoa futures registered big gains yesterday in heavy trading on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amid concerns about dry weather in cocoa-producing regions of West Africa.
Energy futures were mixed. 
 Judith Ganes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company in New York, said the rally in cocoa futures came despite an oversupply of cocoa. She said there was a seven-month supply of cocoa in storage.
"It is still a bear market," she said.
Cocoa for delivery in September settled $55 higher at $1,036 a metric ton.
Ms. Ganes said the dryness in Africa was a major concern for the market, and she said producers were not selling cocoa because they were awaiting the outcome of the International Cocoa Organization talks in Geneva, scheduled to end July 24.
"There is a lot of differences between the producers, particularly between Brazil and the African countries," Ms. Ganes said, adding that past cocoa agreements have been failures.
Some producers would like to see talks aimed at curbing production, noting the 1.5-million-metric-ton surplus. However, the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is resisting that suggestion.
Brazilian representatives to the talks are suggesting that producers search for ways to increase consumption of cocoa. Brazil has suggested selling the International Cocoa Organization's buffer stock to the Commonwealth of Independent States at subsidized prices over a five-year period.
Ms. Ganes said that was a good idea because the commonwealth and Eastern European countries were heavy consumers of cocoa, although consumption has been lower in recent years because of economic problems.
Gasoline futures fell to a four-month low on the New York Mercantile Exchange as a result of high inventories and sluggish demand.
American Petroleum Institute figures showed gasoline stocks rose by 2.3 million barrels for the week ending June 26. Expectations were for a decline in stocks.
Crude stocks fell by 3.6 million barrels, while an increase was expected, which helped sweet crude futures.
Light sweet crude oil for August delivery was 1 cent higher at $21.41 a barrel; August heating oil was 0.33 cent higher at 59.06 cents a gallon; August unleaded gasoline was 1.38 cents lower at 58.53 cents a gallon; August natural gas was 3.5 cents higher at $1.630 for a thousand cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Down

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
The nation's consumer borrowing declined $2.4 billion in May for the fourth consecutive monthly decrease, suggesting spending needed to sustain a recovery was wavering.
The annual rate of borrowing fell by 4 percent and followed the sharpest decline in more than a decade in April, the Federal Reserve System said today in its monthly report. 
 Only credit card borrowing posted a small increase. Auto and other borrowing, which includes personal loans, declined further.
Instead of spending as they did in the 80's, consumers have been paying off loans, worried they could lose their jobs and homes during the recession.
"Consumers are working off debt," said Jean Sundrla, an economist at Evans Economics here. The gain in credit card borrowing showed only that that people are having trouble paying their bill, rather than that they are deliberately increasing their debt, she said.
The level of consumer debt declined to a seasonally adjusted $721.4 billion in May after declining $3.6 billion in April, or at a 5.9 percent pace, to $723.8 billion, the Fed said.
The April decline was the largest since a 6.1 percent drop in February 1982, a Fed spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Business Failures Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
United States business failures rose 15.9 percent for the first five months of 1992, Dun & Bradstreet said yesterday. Business failures for the period totaled 42,118, up from 36,355 in January through May 1991.
"While the economy has begun to show modest improvements, for many financially troubled firms this growth is too little too late," said Joseph W. Duncan, vice president and chief statistician for Dun & Bradstreet. 
 Every United States census region except the East South Central had an increase in business failures during the first five months of the year. The Middle Atlantic region, with 39.8 percent, and the Pacific region, with 36.4 percent, posted the sharpest rises. Failures in the Middle Atlantic were propelled by a 62 percent increase in New York.
Failures in the agriculture, forestry and fishing businesses posted the largest percentage increase, with a 36 percent jump to 1,320 from 969. Failures in the services sector were the most numerous: 11,597 compared with 9,400 in the first five months of 1991.
Wholesale trade failures for the first five months increased 21.3 percent, to 2,978 from 2,456. Retail trade failures rose 15.7 percent, to 8,312 from 7,186.
Finance, insurance and real estate industry failures rose 18 percent, to 2,665. Manufacturing failures climbed 16.2 percent, to 3,140, and construction industry failures rose 10.6 percent, to 5,499, Dun & Bradstreet said.

HEADLINE: Surpluses Up For Japanese

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 8

 BODY:
Japan's unadjusted worldwide current-account surplus reached $9.49 billion in May, more than double the $4.16 billion surplus in May 1991, the Finance Ministry said today.
Japan's politically sensitive current-account surplus with the United States also rose, by 6.3 percent, to $40.03 billion in the calendar year 1991 from $37.65 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said. 
 Its trade surplus with the United States in 1991, meanwhile, edged up 3.7 percent, to $43.44 billion from $41.87 billion in 1990, it said. The country's unadjusted trade surplus almost doubled to $10.09 billion in May from a $5.47 billion surplus in May 1991.
Economists' estimates for the surplus in current account, the broadest measure of goods and services, had ranged from $6.3 billion to $9.3 billion, a Reuters survey said. The economists attributed the big rise to steady growth in exports while imports remained weak, and they said the surplus was likely to continue to grow.
Japan's current-account surplus with nations in the European Community quadrupled to $25.22 billion in 1991 from $6.16 billion in 1990, while its trade surplus with the community doubled to $33.37 billion from $16.35 billion in the same period.

ROCKWELL'S CZECH VENTURE GETS INITIAL APPROVAL

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The Rockwell International Corporation said yesterday that it had received preliminary approval to form a joint venture in Czechoslovakia that would manufacture automotive parts and sell them to Czechoslovak auto makers. Czechoslovakia's Privatization Ministry approved the venture, which still requires approval by the country's Economic Council, said Richard Pacini, a Rockwell spokesman. 
 Rockwell's auto parts division, based in Troy, Mich., will purchase an existing factory complex in Liberec, about 75 miles northeast of Prague, Mr. Pacini said. Rockwell will assume majority ownership of the plant and will invest an undisclosed sum to improve it. The plant will produce window regulators and seat slides.

Obstructing Justice

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In 1958 Sherman Adams, Eisenhower's chief of staff, improperly called the S.E.C. from the White House to inquire about the status of an investigation into his friend Bernard Goldfine; that influential call led to scandal and prosecutions.
In 1989 Boyden Gray, President Bush's White House Counsel, told his aide Jay Bybee to call the U.S. Attorney in Atlanta to express White House interest in a criminal investigation that might embarrass Saddam Hussein. 
 That improper intervention -- phone calls now remembered by the local prosecutor as "a few at the most," urging delicate handling from the highest level -- fit into a pattern of obstruction of justice and lying to Congress we call Iraqgate.
Let's review the bidding in 1989, as George Bush and James Baker determined to abuse our grain export program to provide backdoor foreign aid to Iraq:
On Aug. 4, the F.B.I. raids the offices of an Atlanta bank channeling billions of dollars of taxpayer-guaranteed loans to Iraq. Despite evidence of skimming and diversion, on Oct. 2 President Bush signs N.S.D. 26 encouraging U.S. companies to sell Saddam nuclear technology.
On Nov. 6 the C.I.A. reports Iraq is using the Atlanta bank loans to purchase "military-related technology," though the politicized C.I.A. summary concentrates on the effect of publicity about this on U.S.-Iraqi ties.
During that first week of November, Gail McKenzie -- the Assistant U.S. Attorney in Atlanta preparing an indictment that would embarrass Saddam Hussein's family -- gets what she now tells associates were "a few at the most" calls from the White House reminding her of the "embarrassment level" of prosecution.
Ms. McKenzie tells Marilyn Muench of the Treasury Department, who also wants to know about the status of her case, of the White House calls; Ms. Muench tells Rachel Bailey, an economist monitoring the export credits to the uncreditworthy borrower, about the hard-to-forget calls; Ms. Bailey's notes were forced out of Treasury this week by Representative Henry Gonzalez.
On Nov. 8, Secretary Baker pressures the Bush interagency committee to ignore both nuclear warning and corruption evidence and O.K. $500 million more to Iraq.
The "few at the most" calls from Boyden Gray's White House office are now characterized as requests for "publicly available information" by the Bush Justice Department.
Let's be serious: When the President of the U.S. needs information about a criminal case, he asks his Attorney General, who knows how to inquire without influencing the prosecution. But when the President wants to influence the case, he has his Office of Legal Counsel call the local prosecutor from the White House.
That's how Ms. McKenzie knew not to indict a member of the dictator's family in Baghdad, and why she was willing to delay her indictment for a year. It suited the Bush-Baker benighted foreign policy for this case to be botched, and botched it was -- with the White House calls intended to be kept secret.
Can Justice investigate its own manipulation? Gerrilyn Brill, the Atlanta team player now being used as spokeswoman for Ms. McKenzie, who seems to have mislaid her phone logs, asserts proudly: "We are not investigating a possible obstruction of justice." Attorney General William Barr served with George Bush at the C.I.A.; his closest political pal is Boyden Gray, who initiated the corrupting phone calls.
This morning the Judiciary Committee chairman, Jack Brooks, will get the requisite 11 signatures on a letter pointing to "personal, political or financial conflict of interest" within Justice. Here is why it is urgent that he trigger the Independent Counsel Act this week:
Attorney General Barr could claim after 30 days that no evidence of wrongdoing existed, but such bald-faced cover-up would invite impeachment. After 60 more days -- Oct. 7 -- he could ask the courts for a 60-day extension, to Dec. 7.
On Dec. 15 the Independent Counsel Act expires, and George Bush wants it to stay dead. That means Judiciary must trigger the act now or it's back to the good old days of White House whitewashes. George Bush would investigate Iraqgate himself and -- surprise! -- find himself not guilty.

Cuddling Saddam

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Did President Bush's policy toward Iraq before its invasion of Kuwait involve law-breaking? Maybe. And maybe some official cover-up afterward. In any event, it would take far too long for an independent counsel to get to the bottom of the matter, and the results would be problematic.
Was the policy merely a "mistake," as Bush officials are wont to say? This remarkably generous description would be laughed off by Republicans if Democrats had committed even remotely similar sins. 
 Was it a blunder? Yes. And of such proportions that Bill Clinton and Ross Perot would be crazy not to drag the issue into the Presidential campaign.
This much is already clear from the previously secret documents put on display by Representatives Henry Gonzalez and Sam Gejdenson: The Bush Administration knew or had good reason to believe that Saddam Hussein was involved with nuclear weapons, terrorism, genocide with chemical weapons against the Kurds, illegal diversion of loans to buy arms -- and that he was a very bad guy with boundless ambition.
Yet in the face of all this, Bush & Co. consistently protected him from an increasingly suspicious Congress.
Protect Saddam to what end? To "moderate" his behavior, the officials say and said. To glimpse how zany this was, to see what they saw as acceptable behavior, look at what they knew or suspected about Saddam from 1988 on:
They had good reason to believe Saddam had a secret nuclear weapons program. True, international inspectors were giving Iraq a clean bill of health. But they knew of its longstanding effort to acquire weapons-grade uranium, and that in 1990 it tried to smuggle in U.S.-made nuclear capacitors. They also knew that from 1985 to 1990 the U.S. had approved 771 items of dual-use technology, of which 162 had possible nuclear applications.
On June 15, 1990, less than two months before the Kuwait invasion, a senior State Department official told Congress that Iraq was not a "near-term" nuclear threat. But he went on to note Saddam's "great lengths to develop non-conventional weapons," including nukes.
Bush aides also had definite information about an Iraqi missile program with capabilities well beyond Scuds. Many officials argued that these missiles, given their potential accuracy, made sense only as carriers of a nuclear payload. Some officials further maintained that Iraq had been diverting loans from the Banco Lavoro to finance this effort.
Administration officials knew that Saddam was still engaged in terrorism. In a secret memo in late 1988, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy wrote that the Iraqis had "curbed their support for Palestinian terrorism, while remaining willing to use international terrorism themselves against their opponents." Though officials had even harder information later, they continued to reaffirm their decision to remove Iraq from the list of terrorist countries.
Officials also knew that Saddam was trying to exterminate Kurds and had used chemical weapons to do so. A State Department memo of November 1988 referred to "reliable reports" of chemical weapons use and went on to say that "upward of 500 Kurdish villages have been depopulated. . . ."
Officials also believed Saddam was evil. A typical State Department memo from 1988 said, "His worldview is that of a conspirator who believes that power comes from the barrel of a gun." Another from that year called his state "totalitarian," and added: "The brutality visited on portions of Iraq's Kurdish population fits into the general framework of repression. . . ."
Knowing or at least worrying about all this, Mr. Bush nonetheless approved new farm credits and dual-use technology sales for Iraq and opposed Congressionally imposed economic sanctions. And in July 1990, as Saddam's forces were poised to attack Kuwait, he opposed a Senate move to bar further loans to Iraq. As bizarre, on Nov. 16, 1990, with 500,000 U.S. troops already in the Persian Gulf, he vetoed a bill that would have forced him to impose sanctions on states that use chemical weapons.
Just imagine what George Bush, Ronald Reagan and other hard-nosed Republicans would be saying today if "President Dukakis" or soft-headed Democrats had made any such simple "mistake." Just imagine.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MUNICH;
7 Leaders Promise $1 Billion for Moscow

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 8

 BODY:
The leaders of seven major industrial democracies promised a "comprehensive partnership" with Russia and $1 billion in new aid to Moscow today. But in a meeting with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, they signaled that the formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the old Soviet Union should expect no further injections of aid until they restructured their economies.
In a communique issued today at the end of their three-day economic summit meeting, the seven leaders said future aid to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe "will be tailored to their reform progress and internationally responsible behavior, including further reductions in military spending and fulfillment of obligations already undertaken." 
 The seven leaders -- from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada -- said they would refocus future aid efforts toward the developing world.
"We shall direct official development assistance more toward the poorest countries," the communique said. "Poverty, population policy, education, health, the role of women and the well-being of children merit special attention."
 
No Accords on Key Issues
 The seven lamented the continuing war in the Balkans, but offered no formula to stop the fighting there. They also pledged "rapid and concrete action" on environmental issues, but were accused by environmentalists of failing to address urgent global problems.
The participants were unable to reach important new accords on pressing economic and political issues. Germany resisted pressure to reduce its interest rates, France refused to cut farm subsidies and Japan made no move to lower its trade barriers.
The leaders agreed to help rebuild unsafe nuclear power plants in central and Eastern Europe, but the United States and Japan effectively vetoed creation of a new international fund for the purpose.
"You certainly cannot talk about any great achievements or successes here," said a senior European diplomat who took part in the talks.
Several of the heads of government who gathered here said their greatest regret was that no breakthrough had been made on a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. All agreed that a new GATT accord, opening markets to international trade, would be a major stimulus to the global economy.
 
Kohl Expresses Sorrow
 "In this summit, there were some achievements and also some disappointments," said Prime Minister John Major of Britain. "If we had been able to achieve a decisive breakthrough on a GATT agreement, it would have been a huge bonus for this summit."
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said he was "very sorry that there was no breakthrough" on trade issues. Like Mr. Major, he expressed optimism that a final agreement could be reached by the end of this year.
President Bush said he would "keep pushing" for an agreement, but added that he was not willing to accept a compromise that would be "a bad deal" for American farmers. He flew to Helsinki late today for a meeting of the European security conference.
 
Most Emotional Item
 In a pointed reply, Mr. Bush's chief antagonist on trade matters, President Francois Mitterrand, said he hoped "that our partners will make the same efforts that we have already made" to reach an agreement.
The most emotional item on the agenda was the violence wracking the former Yugoslavia. British delegates said they would not support any military action there unless it was sponsored by the United Nations, and the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said his country's Constitution forbade the use of its troops in any mission that might involve combat.
Mr. Bush said the United States would only become militarily involved in the former Yugoslavia as part of a NATO force.
"If NATO undertakes a role, of course the United States of America is going to be involved in it," Mr. Bush told reporters. "But in terms of Yugoslavia, our interest is in trying to get humanitarian support in there, and it is not -- I have no plans to inject ourselves into a combat situation there. We have naval power, we have air power, and we are a part of the security -- obviously a key and critical part of NATO."
He added: "But nothing in that should be read that I would commit United States forces into combat. I am just not saying what we are going to do on all that."
 
Russian Offers a Swap
 Today's meeting between the Group of Seven leaders and Mr. Yeltsin came after the summit meeting was officially ended. Mr. Yeltsin proclaimed himself "very satisfied" with the result.
"I didn't expect more," he said, "and I didn't want less."
Mr. Yeltsin said for the first time that Russia would consider equity-for-debt swaps with private Western creditors, allowing them to take over oilfields, mines, plots of land and buildings in exchange for forgiveness of debts. An American official later called this "a very appealing idea."
Mr. Kohl said industrial nations would offer Russia export credits, technical aid, training for public and private managers, help in creating private banks and other financial institutions and a "grace period" for the repayment of some debts.
According to an American official who monitored the meeting, Mr. Yeltsin vowed to press ahead with fundamental economic and political changes in Russia.
Mr. Yeltsin pledged to continue servicing the foreign debt his country inherited from the Soviet Union. He said he was not seeking a moratorium on repayments, but added that he would ask creditors for agreements to postpone some payments.
The Group of Seven communique endorsed an immediate $1 billion credit for Russia from the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Yeltsin said the credit agreement would be signed Sunday.
Part of the reason for the lack of major accomplishments at the Munich meeting, diplomats said, was the domestic trouble that faces each of the assembled leaders. All seven countries represented here are in varying degrees of economic difficulty and nearly all of their leaders are unpopular among voters.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis;
Behind Clinton's Choice

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas has set himself a mighty task: nothing less than the rejuvenation of the Democratic Party.
That was confirmed today by his choice of a running mate. For more than a decade, Mr. Clinton has been arguing that his party must change or die, because the country has changed. His selection of Senator Al Gore of Tennessee is designed to exemplify that change and to help banish the crippling image of the Democrats as a tired collection of squabbling special-interest groups. 
 Mr. Gore made the point when he spoke of "a new generation of leadership," a harking back, conscious or unconscious, to another moment of Democratic self-renewal, after eight years of Eisenhower ascendancy, when John F. Kennedy said "the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans."
 
Challenge in the South
 Both candidates are Southerners -- Carthage, Tenn., is less than 400 miles from Little Rock, Ark. -- and Mr. Clinton's decision clearly demonstrates a determination to challenge President Bush in the Deep South. The Governor hopes to threaten one of the main Republican redoubts of recent national elections.
But geography was not the main factor in Mr. Clinton's choice.
"Everyone's saying how unusual it is to pick two Southerners," said Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution, a Washington research organization. "But I think the profile of these New South politicians makes them attractive in other parts of the country as well. I see Gore's help in solidifying the moderate cast of the Democratic ticket and indicating that Clinton is very much in the fight for the center and swing voters in states like Ohio, Michigan, Illinois."
Both Democratic candidates are young, a whole generation younger than the two rival Presidential candidates; both come from their party's moderate wing, and both have emphasized issues like education that appeal to the suburbs, where nearly half of the
nation's population now lives. The Clinton-Gore ticket is designed not simply for the old Democratic base of working-class city-dwellers, but also to attract a new kind of following.
The overpowering historical fact that confronted Mr. Clinton as he made this, his first major decision of the campaign that will come to a climax in November, was the failure of the Democratic Presidential ticket in five of the last six elections. To him and to his allies, it was clear that the burst of liberal activism represented by the Johnson Administration in the 1960's marked the end of an era and constituted a formula for electoral stagnation in the future.
In 1976 Jimmy Carter felt that, as a Southern moderate in a party with a still-vibrant liberal tradition, he needed to reach out to Northern liberals, so he chose Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota. This year's primaries showed how feeble that old Democratic tradition has become; only Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa ran a full-throated liberal campaign, and he did not get very far.
 
A Shift to the Right
 Another sign of the decisive shift of the political spectrum to the right is the nature of the general-election contest, which will involve Mr. Bush, Ross Perot and Mr. Clinton, three moderate-to-conservative candidates.
So Mr. Clinton felt no need to make a move to the left. Rather than geographical or ideological balance, which were so important in holding the disparate elements of the old Democratic coalition together, he has used the Vice-Presidential selection to send a message of moderation, while at the same time trying to shore up some weakenesses in important constituencies.
For those who might be disturbed by charges that Mr. Clinton wiggled out of service in Vietnam, there is the fact that Mr. Gore served his time there. For those who might worry about Mr. Clinton's mixed record on the environment, especially those in the politically pivotal and environmentally sensitive state of California, there is Mr. Gore's passionate book on the subject and his attendance at the recent world environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro.
For those upset by the repeated accusations of marital infidelity leveled at Mr. Clinton, there is Mr. Gore's unblemished reputation as a family man (although unlike Mr. Clinton, the Senator and his wife, Tipper, both say they inhaled when they experimented briefly with marijuana in their youth).
The Democratic ticket also has weaknesses. Most obvious, in a year of voter disgust with political business as usual, is the conventional background of the two nominees. Both are career politicians who started young and stayed in politics.
Neither is by any stretch of the imagination an outsider, although both talk a lot about rural roots. Mr. Clinton worked for Senator J. William Fulbright while still in school and studied at Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship. Mr. Gore grew up not in Tennessee but in Washington; he is a second-generation denizen of Capitol Hill, having followed his father, Albert Gore Sr., to the House of Representatives and the Senate.
In addition, both are white male Baptists in an age of pluralism, and both are domestic-policy specialists, though Mr. Gore has substantial credentials on national security policy.
But Mr. Clinton's choice was consistent with his past strategies.
As a Democratic governor in a region where Democrats now win only when they can add younger, suburban whites to the remnants of their old strength among blacks and rural whites, and also in his work on the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, Mr. Clinton insisted that the old New Deal and Fair Deal formulas had run out of gas.
 
A Symbol of Concern
 He made the same arguments in the early primaries this year, emphasizing a middle-class tax cut as much for its symbolic value as for its economic import. To those white voters, variously known as Middle Americans, the Silent Majority and Reagan Democrats, who over the last two decades have fled their urban homes and their ancestral party, the Arkansas Governor has been trying to say, "The Democrats care about you and not just the clamorous minorities."
In case anyone missed his point, Mr. Clinton quite decidedly distanced himself a few weeks ago from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is probably the party's leading spokesman for the cities. Nor have there been public negotiations with other interest groups over what would or would not be included in the platform.
Not suprisingly, Mr. Jackson reacted negatively to today's news, praising Mr. Gore for his qualities as a campaigner but arguing that the Democrats could not fly on one wing, and predicting trouble in states like New York. Mr. Gore did poorly there in 1988, and Mr. Clinton took a lot of punishment this year before finally defeating former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California
The Republican reaction suggested concern among Mr. Bush's advisers about the moderate coloration of the Democratic opposition. Party and campaign officials promptly issued statements seeking to portray Mr. Gore as a devout liberal and a big spender, which has never been his reputation here.
Frederic V. Malek, one of the President's senior strategists, also said Mr. Clinton had wasted the chance to shore up his strength in the Northeast, the Midwest and the West, and would not be able to compete with Mr. Bush on "judgment and experience" -- the qualities the President has been emphasizing recently.
There were no suggestions that Mr. Clinton had hurt himself, as George McGovern did in 1972 when he picked Senator Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri at the last minute, only to discover later that Mr. Eagleton has undergone shock therapy for mental illness, and as some politicians still believe Mr. Bush did in picking Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana four years ago. Mr. Gore is known and respected in political circles, and his past was raked over when he ran for President in 1988.
It is as transmitters of political code that Vice-Presidential selections matter most -- they help voters decide what kind of person the selector, the man at the top of the ticket, really is. In only very few cases, such as John F. Kennedy's choice of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960, which helped him carry Texas, is there evidence that running mates exert direct, decisive influence on voting.

Hope Turned to Dust

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe

 BODY:
Even a world inured to television pictures of gaunt famine victims should care about the devastation menacing the southern third of Africa. Eleven countries, with a population of more than 120 million, are living under a drought previously unknown to the region in its sweep and severity.
The rains that should have started falling last October did not come at all in many places. The corn that is milled into the area's staple meal never grew. Lakes have dried up. 
 Outside South Africa, the region's industrial powerhouse, 17 million people are now under direct threat of starvation. And even South Africa has been severely hurt. Usually an exporter of cornmeal, it will have to import more than five million tons by next May.
"We'll be lucky if a lot of people don't suffer and die," David Morton, regional director of the U.N.'s World Food Program, said in an interview. "The grain is available in the world. We're talking money -- and time."
At a conference in Geneva six weeks ago, donors pledged $526 million in aid to southern African drought victims, most of it coming from the United States, the European Community, Japan and Scandinavia. The total was only 60 percent of the estimated need.
Mr. Morton said the countries worst hit by the drought are Mozambique, on the east coast, and neighboring Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia. He pointed out that they are the countries of the region with the most severe transportation problems.
Mozambique has been ravaged in the long war against the Government by Renamo, which kidnaps peasants and kills or mutilates those who resist. Moving anything is difficult and dangerous in most of the country. The other three nations are landlocked.
Renamo's war has produced one dramatic illustration of the drought. Zimbabwean troops protect a corridor from the port of Beira, in northern Mozambique, through which a highway and rail line run to Zimbabwe. Hundreds of thousands of starving refugees from Renamo-held areas to the north are now camped out along the Beira highway and are getting some relief food.
Efforts begun two years ago to reconstruct Beira's port have fortunately been carried out to a significant extent. Six ships were unloading grain there the other day, and the road to Zimbabwe was jammed with trucks.
The other ports being used are Maputo in Mozambique, Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town in South Africa, and the South African territory of Walvis Bay in Namibia, on the west coast. There is also Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, from which grain has to move to Zambia on a decrepit railroad and highway.
So far the largest part of emergency grain supplies have come through South Africa. There has been good cooperation between South Africa and its neighbors. Even Zimbabwe, which had refused to have any kind of high-level contacts with the white regime, sent its Transport Minister, Denis Norman, to work out plans.
"Food is moving," Mr. Morton said, "but time is running out." What makes this drought so devastating, he said, is that it covers the whole region. In the past this country or that has had trouble but has been able to buy from another in the region, usually South Africa or Zimbabwe. Bringing grain from across the world takes months and costs twice as much.
The drought is having deadly ripple effects on local economies. Zimbabwe, for example, usually produces 450,000 tons of sugar, much of it for export. This year the cane crop was just 12,000 tons. Local cotton, used in a profitable textile industry, is down 70 percent. Bulawayo, the country's second city, has only a 40-day water supply left.
The economic growth rate in Zimbabwe is negative now: minus 8 to 10 percent. The official inflation rate is 43 percent. And prices are bound to go higher with the cost of imported corn, sugar, cotton, oil and other staples.
All this is a cruel blow to a country and a region that had reason to think better times were coming: racial conflicts easing, regional growth a real possibility. Now people are thinking only about getting through to the next rain -- if it comes.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Man in the News;
A Man Who Was Raised to Be the President: Albert Arnold Gore Jr.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
When he announced last summer that he would not run for President this year, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee said he had too many family responsibilities. But Mr. Gore left no doubt about his ultimate ambition.
"I would like to be President," he said. 
 The thought has been in his mind and that of his family since he was a child. "We raised him for it," Mr. Gore's father, a Representative and Senator for more than 30 years, said in an interview today.
A Representative at the age of 28, a Senator at 36 and an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination at 39, Mr. Gore, now 44, is tall and broad-shouldered, somewhat resembling Christopher Reeve, the actor who played Superman.
 
Served in Vietnam
 Like Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, he has an Ivy League education, middle-of-the-road positions on most issues and a strong-willed wife.
But unlike Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore has a long public record on foreign and military matters. He enlisted in the Army and served in Vietnam, despite his opposition to the war. Now he is a strong advocate of environmental causes, an area where Mr. Clinton has been criticized.
And potentially most important to the Clinton campaign, Mr. Gore has a reputation as a straight arrow who will probably not be vulnerable to the Republican stiletto on personal problems and family values.
Mr. Gore's unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination four years ago often seemed unfocused, characterized by shifts in emphasis if not in positions. He did reasonably well in the Southern primaries but dropped out after a poor showing in New York. Still, the experience and the contacts he made in that national campaign could prove valuable in this year's race.
Since his 1988 campaign, Mr. Gore, who is 19 months younger than Mr. Clinton, has concentrated on foreign policy, technology and environmental issues. He was one of 10 Democratic Senators who broke with their party's leaders and voted to give President Bush authority to wage war against Iraq. He wrote a book on ecology that was on The New York Times best-seller list for six weeks this spring. And he led the Senate delegation to the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June.
Mr. Gore, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 and to the Senate eight years later, has made a legislative career of mastering complicated issues like arms control, global warming, biotechnology and computer networks.
"He is extremely intelligent, superbly educated, very industrious and single-minded," said Jim Sasser, the senior Democratic Senator from Tennessee. "His style is to learn absolutely everything there is to know about an issue."
But Mr. Gore has often seemed bored with the legislative process -- more interested in holding hearings and exploring ideas than in making deals and writing laws. In that regard, he is more like John F. Kennedy, who was an indifferent lawmaker, than Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee four years ago, who is a master of the art of legislating.
As a child, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. led something of a double life. His father, Albert Gore Sr., was a Representative and Senator for more than 30 years, a New Deal populist on social issues and at the end of his career, one of the Senate's fiercest opponents of the war in Vietnam. His mother, Pauline, is a lawyer.
Mr. Gore was born in Washington on March 31, 1948. During the school year, he lived in his parents' suite at the Fairfax Hotel on Embassy Row and had his head patted by many of the most prominent politicians in the country. He graduated from St. Alban's Episcopal School for Boys in Washington, where he was a top student and played football and basketball.
As a counterweight, he spent the summers on the family farm in Carthage, Tenn., about 40 miles east of Nashville. He worked in the fields with the tenant farmers during the days and hunted with coon dogs at night.
 
Opposed Vietnam War
 Mr. Gore enrolled at Harvard University in 1965 and became active in the antiwar movement. He worked on Senator Eugene J. McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968 and graduated with honors in government in 1969.
As a student, he has said, he occasionally smoked marijuana. But he said he had not used drugs since he became a politician.
Mr. Gore considered going to Canada to avoid Vietnam. But after agonizing with his family and friends, he enlisted in the Army, despite his opposition to the war. Friends say the deciding factor was that his father was up for re-election to the Senate, and Mr. Gore did not want to impose on his father the political burden of having a draft-dodging son.
Albert Gore Sr. lost the 1970 election, anyway, to the Republican Bill Brock, and the main campaign issue was Vietnam. Now in their 80's and still active, the senior Gores live on their farm in Carthage.
In Vietnam for about a year, Mr. Gore was a journalist with an engineering unit; he never saw combat. But he did sometimes carry a rifle, and in his campaign literature, he has often used a photograph of himself in full uniform, carrying his weapon.
Just before he left for Vietnam, he married Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson, whom he had met at a party the night of his high school graduation. Known as Tipper, Mrs. Gore, who has a master's degree in psychology, has led campaigns against what she considers to be the bad influence of pop culture on children. She has written a book called "Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society" (Abingdon Press, 1987).
The Gores, who are Baptists, have four children: Karenna, 18; Kristen, 15; Sara, 13, and Albert 3d, 9, all of whom attend private schools.
Financially, the Gores are comfortable but not so well off as most other senators. Their assets total less than $1 million, and most of that is tied up in two homes, one in Arlington, Va., the house Mrs. Gore grew up in, and the other in Carthage.
After he returned from Vietnam, Mr. Gore went to work as a reporter and later an editorial writer for The Tennessean in Nashville.
His career as a journalist ended in 1976 when Joe L. Evins, the veteran Democratic Representative from the district that Mr. Gore's father once represented, decided to retire. Mr. Gore immediately moved to Carthage and ran successfully for the office.
After Mr. Gore had been in the House for eight years, Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., a Republican, decided not to run for re-election. Mr. Gore easily won the seat. He was re-elected in 1990.
As a campaign speaker, Mr. Gore is erratic -- spirited and evocative one night and flat and routine the next. He often uses a shouting cadence that works better with large audiences than with smaller gatherings.
Mr. Gore's position on abortion is somewhat different from Mr. Clinton's and from the plank in this year's Democratic platform. He opposes Government financing of abortions for poor women. Since the mid-1980's, Mr. Gore has favored legal abortions, although before that, he was less firm.
Beyond that, Mr. Gore's stances on issues are similar to the ones Mr. Clinton has expressed. This year, for example, Mr. Gore has been a chief sponsor of a measure that would raise the income taxes of the wealthy and use the money to give a tax break to middle-class families with children. That is also a pet proposal of Mr. Clinton's.
 
Position on Gulf War
 On military issues, Mr. Gore has usually stood slightly to the right of the Democratic Party's center. He called his decision to support President Bush on the war in the Persian Gulf "excruciating," but told the Senate he believed that the risks of not going to war were ultimately "larger, greater and more costly" than the risks of going to war.
After the war, he attacked the Bush Administration for criticizing Democrats who voted against the war resolution, and he urged the President to use American troops to ground Iraqi helicopters that were killing fleeing Kurds and Shiites. "We cannot wash our hands of what's going on over there," he said at the time.
On domestic and economic issues, he has generally voted as a liberal Democrat. He voted against Clarence Thomas's confirmation to the Supreme Court because, he said, Judge Thomas's constitutional stands "embraced the extreme." Mr. Gore also said he found Anita F. Hill's testimony about Judge Thomas and sexual harassment "honest and credible."
His book, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit" (Houghton Mifflin, 1992), assesses forces like overpopulation, deforestation, soil erosion, air and water pollution, and concludes that now that the cold war is over, destruction of the environment is the greatest threat to mankind.
Most politicians do not have the patience to read and study. Mr. Gore does, and one of his main strengths is his ability to master and explain complicated topics.
His close friend, Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat from Long Island, recalled today a small dinner party a few months ago when Mr. Gore was explaining an environmental principle on the back of a napkin to Chen Ning Yang, who holds a Nobel Prize in physics and teaches at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
"Imagine," Mr. Downey said, "a United States Senator explaining a scientific principle to Professor Yang."

HEADLINE: BRAZIL AND BANKS REACH AGREEMENT ON REDUCING DEBT

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Brazil, the largest debtor in the developing world, and its creditor banks agreed yesterday on a series of steps to reduce its $44 billion debt and provide the country with lower interest rates and new longer-term loans.
For Brazil the agreement, which will cut its debt by billions of dollars, is crucial to its Government's effort to liberalize its economy, attract foreign investment and stabilize prices. 
 For the banks, which include some of the largest in the United States, the incentive is the guarantees they receive on payments of debt and interest. In addition, the agreement could provide profits for some banks by increasing the value of the debt they have on their books.
Over the last 10 years, the world's financial systems and some of the largest banks have been severely strained as major Latin American countries began defaulting on hundreds of billions of dollars in loans.
 
Secretary Brady's New Policy
 The Brazilian agreement caps three years of successful negotiations with Mexico, Argentina and other debtors that began after the Bush Administration outlined a new debt policy, known as the Brady plan, for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
Under the plan, bankers were encouraged to help debtor nations reduce their burdens, while the foreign governments were required to reduce inflation, open their economies to foreign investment and follow guidelines of the International Monetary Fund.
Paul A. Volcker, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1982, when Mexico began the debt crisis by defaulting, said in an interview yesterday: "I think you can say that the Latin American debt crisis is no longer a crisis. Most Latin American countries are hopefully back on a growth pattern, and the debts are manageable and should not be a threat to the financial system."
But for all the progress on Latin American debt, many other debtor nations, especially in Africa, still have major problems, even though some debt relief has been granted by the United States and other governments.
"Africa is a different kind of situation," Mr. Volcker said. "It is a disaster for the Africans. But it never has had implications for the world financial system. It is not a financial crisis in the same sense. It is a development crisis."
And while Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina have made progress in reducing their debts and opening their economies, it is not clear that they have surely turned a corner, for political and social problems abound. These include a thwarted coup in Venezuela, accusations of corruption in Brazil and continued high inflation and widespread poverty.
The agreement, reached at 5 A.M. yesterday, came after a year of talks between the Brazilian Government and a committee of 19 banks that negotiated on behalf of hundreds of lenders. One of the most difficult issues was the guarantees. And the solution reached provided one of the most novel twists to the negotations and a sign of how anxious the banks were to get the negotations behind them.
Even with new loans from the International Monetary Fund, Brazil will have only $3.2 billion in the guarantee fund, which may not be enough to assure the banks of payment. Should be the fund be inadequate, the banks agreed to allow the guarantees to be phased in over two years.
 
Subject to Legislative Approval
 The agreement is subject to approval by the Senate in Brazil, but the negotiators said they were optimistic that it would pass. Then the accord must be offered to the hundreds of creditor banks, which will choose among six options. These include reducing the unpaid principal of existing loans by 35 percent; reducing interest owed by a similar amount, and offering new loans, which could be used to pay for the guarantees.
Because each bank can choose among the options, it is not clear how much Brazil's debt will be reduced. If the balance of the options chosen is not favorable to Brazil, the country can ask banks to reconsider their choices. In addition to the $44 billion it owes commercial banks, Brazil is burdened by an additional $72 billion of debt owed to foreign governments and other lenders.
The Brazilian economy has been dragged through a deep recession and still has high inflation, despite the efforts to open the economy made by President Fernando Collor de Mello since he took office in 1990. President Collor is scheduled to present his newest economic plan to the Brazilian Congress next week.
 
Citibank Calls Accord Crucial
 The agreement was reached even though Mr. Collor's economic program is far from complete and while he has been damaged politically by accusations of corruption in his Government from his brother, opposition politicians and others.
In announcing the debt agreement, William R. Rhodes, Citibank's vice chairman, said, "It is crucial for carrying Brazil forward in its economic plan and all the more so with the turmoil in the country." Citibank was the head of the 19-bank negotiating committee.
One banker involved in the negotiations acknowledged that the Brazilian President and the country's economy faced major difficulties and said doubt remained that Brazil could meet the economic reform guidelines set out by the International Monetary Fund. But, he added, "this agreement will give them a much better chance of doing that."
Pedro Milan, Brazil's chief negotiator, said the agreement "is part of a wider strategy for the integration of the Brazilian economy with the world economy." But he did not want to speculate about whether the country's economic plan would stay on track. "I would like to cross that bridge when we come to it," he said.
The agreement yesterday does cap a remarkable five years of changes in Latin America. Mexico and Chile, for example, have drastically reformed their economies, opening their markets to foreign investment, selling state-owned companies to investors, reducing inflation and putting an end to wholesale government support of the economy. Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina are following their lead.
The debt deals have been criticized by some economists because they have not significantly reduced the developing nations' outstanding debt. Indeed, in some cases, the deals have involved fresh loans.
 
Renewed Confidence for Investors
 But the arrangements have provided one major benefit, especially in Mexico -- giving both local business executives and foreign investors renewed confidence.
This confidence, in the case of Mexico, has led to a flood of foreign investment and the return of billions of dollars that Mexican businessmen had shipped out of the country to protect their wealth from the ravages of inflation and taxes.
One unresolved issue is that while banks are making agreements to reduce past debt, new borrowing is continuing. There are new loan options in the Brazilian deal, just as there have been in agreements reached with other countries, like Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela, since the Brady debt policy was announced.
In addition to receiving fresh loans from banks, Latin American countries have been raising money in the financial markets through bond sales, either by companies that have been recently privatized or by companies owned or controlled by governments.
It will be some time before it is clear whether these new debts will be less of a burden than those of the past.
Under the agreement with Brazil, the first two of six options provide 35 percent debt reduction either by a cut in the loan amount owed the banks -- the so-called discount bond -- or by reducing the interest owed, the par bond. The interest rate starts at 4 percent and rises to a fixed rate of 6 percent by the seventh year. These two options come with guarantees on both the principal and interest owed. If there is a problem with phasing in the guarantees, the banks will be paid higher interest rates.
A third option provides debt reduction but with a greater reduction in interest rates up front. The rate rises from 4 to 5 percent over six years, then jumps to the market rate plus thirteen-sixteenths of one percentage point. The market rate is the London interbank offered rate. It is currently about 3.5 percent.
 
Lower Interest Payments
 Two other options provide lower interest payments or principal payments over the next six years but no permanent debt reduction. The interest not paid in the early years is added to the principal that must be paid back over the following 14 years. These options have no guarantees.
The last option is to make new loans to Brazil.
The agreement also sets out a plan for increasing Brazil's current interest payements, which are now 30 percent of what is owed. In addition, interest not paid over the last two year will be turned into bonds to be paid off over 12 years.
The debt pact with Mexico was reached in July 1989, after long, complex negotiations. In the end a deal was reached only when the Bush Adminstration intervened and brought in the chairmen of the banks involved.
Since then, the negotiations with other countries have seemed to go more smoothly, in part, because a pattern was set in the Mexican negotiations. For example, the Brazilian and Argentine plans include the option of a 35 percent reduction in debt, just like the Mexican plan.
In addition, many banks have already written down the value of the loans and taken losses for them. But the successful debt negotiations have increased the value of some of this debt. And some debt has been traded for equity stakes that are increasing in value in companies in the debtor countries. Both these developments are now providing some banks with the opportunity for profits.
Citibank, the largest American bank, has the largest outstanding loans to Brazil still on its books, $1.2 billion. The next three biggest American lenders are Chemical Bank, with $737 million; Chase Manhattan, with $557 million, and Bank of America, with $500 million in loans.
In addition to Mexico and Argentina, there have been debt agreements with the Philipines, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Morocco. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are the developing world's worlds top three debtor nations.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Turn Up

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, after being down for much of a fairly active session.
Rumors that a report from the Federal Reserve would show greater weakness in money supply than had been expected seemed to spark the market's turn, traders said. But other factors were also at work. 
 The money supply rumors were validated late in the session, as the Fed reported big declines in the two largest monetary aggregates for the week ended June 29.
The reported $7.3 billion drop in M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, and the $13.8 billion decline in M-3, the broadest money measure, were both substantially larger than expected.
The drop in M-2 reduced its growth since the end of the fourth quarter to nine-tenths of 1 percent, well below the 2.5 percent level that represents the low end of the Fed's 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent target range. And the weekly decline in M-3 put its growth at a negative seven-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Bullish Flavor of Market
 While acknowledging that the money supply figures were much weaker than expected, some analysts said the rebound in Treasury prices had more to do with the market's continued bullish flavor as well as diminishing fears about the effects heavy issuance of new corporate debt securities might have on the Government market.
Corporate issues were heavy again yesterday, highlighted by a $1.5 billion five-year global bond offering from the World Bank.
The new issues did put pressure on Treasury prices during the morning. But the market recovered later on.
"After the run we have had, some participants may have been expecting people to bail out," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Chemical Securities Inc. "But a lot of profit taking has taken place without prices falling too much."
In addition, Mr. Lieberman said that "demand for corporate supply has been better than expected."
One government securities trader, who asked not to be identified, said, "It seems to me that almost everybody is feverishly bullish, or at the very least doesn't think that short-term interest rates are going to go higher."
The market's optimism extends to today's report on producer price activity during June, the trader said.
Most analysts are forecasting that producer prices rose by a very modest two-tenths to three-tenths of a percent last month, and only one-tenth of a percent when food and energy prices are excluded.
 
Secondary Securities Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 3/4, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.59 percent, compared with 7.60 percent late Wednesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 104 13/32 , up 2/32 , to yield 6.87 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 7/32 , up 1/32 , to yield 4.34 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills inched lower.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.19 percent late yesterday, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.26 percent.
In the corporate bond market, demand for the World Bank bonds was so strong that the issue was sold at razor-thin spreads over Treasury securities.
The 5 7/8 percent bonds were priced at $99.425 to yield 6.01 percent, 5 basis points above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The spread over the five-year was well under the 7 or 8 basis points that many market participants had predicted before the pricing. Indeed, the spread awarded the World Bank securities is half as large as that offered on debt securities issued by Government sponsored agencies.
Merrill Lynch & Company and IBJ International acted as joint lead managers for the World Bank offering.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for a $300 million offering of 8.50 percent 30-year debentures from the Province of Saskatchewan.
The noncallable debentures were priced at $99.841, to yield 8.515 percent, 90 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's.
The focal point of attention in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was the competitive sale of $120 million worth of general obligation bonds for the State of Tennessee.
A bid from a group led by Dillon, Read & Company won the securities.
Serial bonds reoffered to investors carry yields from 2.60 percent in 1993 to 5.65 percent in 2005. Bonds maturing from 2006 to 2012 were not reoffered.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

Although President Bush reassured President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia this week that Washington would support his economic reform program, the Administration's Russian aid package, which finally passed the Senate last week, still faces an uphill battle for approval in the House.
A month ago, Congressional leaders said the Freedom Support Act, as the United States contribution to the $24 billion Western aid package for Russia is known, had little chance of passage in the House in this election year. Since then, however, two things have happened to improve its prospects. 
 The first, and perhaps most important, was the articulate and emotional appeal that Mr. Yeltsin made for the aid package in his recent speech to a joint meeting of Congress. House members, like their Senate counterparts, said they were impressed by the sincerity and leadership qualities shown by the Russian President, and were left more inclined to help him than before. But what is still not clear is how far this inclination goes in an election season.
"The mood in the House is very receptive to Yeltsin, but still not very receptive to spending money abroad," said Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House subcommittee on foreign operations.
"Conversations with Yeltsin don't impress people very much when you are back home in the district," Mr. Obey said. "You still have to do a lot of hard work to bring people around to the idea of giving Russia aid."
 
Democrats Hold Up Vote
 The other new element is the fact that Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley and Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt have told the White House that they will not even bring the Russian aid bill to a vote until the Administration first supported a four-part domestic renewal program.
The first part of the program is a $1 billion supplemental emergency spending program to aid victims of the Chicago flood and the Los Angeles riots, and to create summer jobs in both cities. The second is extended unemployment insurance, and the third is the creation of 50 enterprise zones, at a cost of $5 billion, to stimulate urban reconstruction and employment.
At the end of last week, all three had been passed by the House, with the endorsement and cooperation of the White House. But there is a fourth bill that remains to be acted upon. It is an amendment to the transportation bill introduced by the Democrats that will create some 125,000 jobs on a variety of projects.
The transportation bill was debated in the House today. The jobs amendment is being opposed by the White House because it would be financed from money earmarked for foreign aid, violating the 1990 budget agreement against such shifting of funds.
Nevertheless, with at least most of these domestic programs having been passed, many House members said they feel they have a little more political protection to vote in favor of Russian aid than they did before. But they still don't say that very loudly because in a year in which domestic problems are the focus of most campaigns, none of the Representatives running for re-election is quite sure that a vote for Russian aid won't be used against them in November.
Mr. Foley has repeatedly told colleagues that rather than a quick vote on the Russian aid bill, he wants a "good vote." By that he means a vote that will have a solid majority. And a "good vote" is simply not assured at this time, Congressional aides say.
What is first going to be required to assure passage, say Congressmen, is some agreement between the House Republican and Democratic leaders that "we all jump off the gang plank together," as one committee staff member put it. Each party is afraid that it will come out for the Russian aid package, only to find that as the votes start being tallied, the other will back off. Neither wants to bear the responsiblity of having sent money to Russia that could have been spent at home.
While President Bush actively campaigned for the Russian aid package during Mr. Yeltsin's visit, he has not spoken about it since. There is a general feeling in the House that he will have to lead a more aggressive public campaign that will take some of the pressure off lawmakers if he wants to see the package passed.
Since there is no room on the legislative calendar at the moment to bring the bill to a vote, nothing is likely to happen before the House goes out in recess for the Democratic Convention next week. After that convention, the House leadership is expected to canvass members, and if a majority is assured, try to bring the bill to a vote before the Republican Convention in August. But that is the optimistic view.
An Administration official overseeing the bill said: "I think we will have as much trouble with Republicans as Democrats. It is going to take a lot of hard work to get this through the House."
Mr. Obey said that in his opinion "it will still take a minor miracle to pass it," adding that it is certainly "going to necessitate the President getting out and selling it more."

HEADLINE: Secession Study Finds Cost High For Staten I.

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Staten Island gets more in city services than it pays in taxes and would face a $170 million budget shortfall if it seceded from New York City, a state commission found in a report released yesterday.
And residents of an independent Staten Island would face a 60 percent rise in property taxes to offset the budget gap, city officials said after the report was released. 
 The report is the first economic study issued by the State Commission on Staten Island Secession, which was established last year to examine the possible effects of secession and to draft a City Charter for Staten Island.
The report says that Staten Island generated $955 million in revenues in 1991 from property, sales and income taxes, Federal and state aid and debt service. But the borough receives about $1.13 billion in city services.
The study contradicts an opinion held by many Staten Islanders: that they pay more than their share of taxes and receive less than their share of services. That belief and a desire for increased home rule have driven the move to secede.
"I hope those who felt dissatisfied that they were not getting a fair share of our city's resources will now rethink their positions," Mayor David N. Dinkins said. "I say to the people of Staten Island what I have said in the past. We need them, and they need us. We are one city."
In November, Staten Islanders voted to establish a commission to ready a charter for vote by November 1993. If it is approved, it will go before the Legislature and then the Governor.
"The fact that we don't produce as much revenue as we get from the city is a danger signal that we should not act too quickly, because the jury is still out as far as I am concerned," said the Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari.

HEADLINE: House Panel Urges Special Counsel for Iraq Inquiry

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
The House Judiciary Committee today requested the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate whether the Bush Administration broke Federal laws in executing and defending its policy toward Iraq.
Today's decision challenges President Bush's contention that his policy toward Iraq before it invaded Kuwait in August 1990 was flawed, but not criminal, and focuses more attention on an issue that has already been used effectively by Democrats in the Presidential campaign. 
 In announcing the request, Representative Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said: "Our investigation and our request are not an attempt to second-guess the Administration's policy in 'tilting' toward Iraq. The stupidity of that policy speaks for itself, and even the President has acknowledged that it was an utter failure."
"What we are concerned about," he added, "is the possibility that high Administration officials, in their zeal to carry out this policy, and then to keep it from being exposed, may have broken the law."
Mr. Bush has said that although the policy failed, it was well-intentioned, designed to bring the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, "into the family of nations" through economic and political means. He has reacted angrily to accusations that he or his aides did anything criminal in executing or defending the policy.
Twenty Judiciary Committee Democrats, in a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr formally making the request for an independent counsel, cited assertions that former and current officials illegally assisted Baghdad and that Administration officials tried to mislead Congress by making false statements and altering and withholding documents. It also cited assertions that the Administration interfered in the criminal prosecution of the Atlanta branch of the Italian-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which provided Iraq with billions of dollars in illegal loans and export credits.
Mr. Barr has 30 days to advise the committee if he will begin a preliminary inquiry into the appointment of the independent counsel and can delay his final decision for four months. That would mean that the matter would not be decided until early December, after the Presidential election and within days of the expiration on Dec. 15 of the Federal statute that allows for the appointment of independent counsels.
The House committee's decision also follows the disclosure this week that a lawyer working on Mr. Bush's personal legal staff discussed the criminal investigation directly with the Federal prosecutor supervising the case, suggesting that the White House may have interfered improperly in the bank case.
 
Ex-Aide Denies Charges
 The lawyer, Jay S. Bybee, confirmed in a telephone interview today that he had called the prosecutor, Gail McKenzie, twice in early November, just before the Administration decided to extend an additional $500 million in agricultural loan guarantees to Iraq.
But Mr. Bybee denied that the calls were an attempt to influence Ms. McKenzie's investigation into allegations that senior Iraqi officials were involved in a multibillion-dollar bank fraud in the United States and that they used some of the money to build Baghdad's huge military arsenal.
Rather, he said, the White House was concerned that both the Agriculture and State Departments were rushing through the loan program, and he wanted to know if she had any evidence that could embarrass the White House if it approved the credit extension.
"It wasn't the indictments we were concerned about," said Mr. Bybee, who now teaches law at Louisiana State University. "We were concerned about being embarrassed if we went ahead and guaranteed loans for Iraq given the track record at the same time the Justice Department was indicting Iraqi officials."
Asked if his calls could be viewed as an obstruction of justice, Mr. Bybee said: "Baloney. To the best of my recollection I made it clear to her that I had no intention of influencing anything she did on the case. She didn't seem uncomfortable, and we had a very friendly, professional conversation."
Mr. Bybee, who said that the White House yesterday found and read him his notes of the phone conversations, denied that he had been ordered to call Ms. McKenzie by the chief White House counsel, C. Boyden Gray, but could not recall how he did come to call her. Nor could he say why he did not ask the Justice Department for information about the case, which would have been the normal channel. "On reflection, I probably should have," he said.
Ms. McKenzie faxed Mr. Bybee a number of newspaper articles linking B.N.L. to Iraqi weapon programs, but disclosed no information about the case, which was before the grand jury, or when her office might issue indictments. Mr. Bybee said he also made calls to the State and Agriculture Departments as part of his inquiry."
In 1991, after the Persian Gulf war, the Government charged two former executives of the bank with conspiring with Iraqi officials to arrange more than $4 billion in illegal loans and export credits to Iraq.
 
A Complicated Connection
 The connection between the Atlanta bank and the obscure farm loan program is complicated and has been misrepresented on many occasions by Congressional Democrats critical of the Iraq policy.
Since the 1983 fiscal year, when the United States first began to guarantee Iraqi farm loans, B.N.L. extended many but not all of the loans that would be repaid by the United States in case Iraq defaulted. By the fall of 1989, there were a number of reports that Iraq had used money from the bank to pay for weapons programs.
Because of the seriousness of the Federal investigation of the bank, the Bush Administration excluded B.N.L. from the program in September 1989, two months before the new loan guarantees were approved.

HEADLINE: Officers Arrested in Theft of Chanel Bags

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Four New York City police officers and two retired ones were charged yesterday with stealing and then fencing thousands of counterfeit Chanel handbags that had been seized by the Manhattan District Attorney in February.
The handbags were seized as part of a crackdown on black-market counterfeits of Chanel handbags that, if legitimate, would cost from $100 to more than $1,000 in stores. The handbags were seized at four Manhattan sites and most of them were destined for street vendors who sold them for $30 to $50. 
 But the seizures involved thousands of bags, far too many to be held as seized evidence in his office, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said yesterday. His assistants, he said, arranged for the bags to be held in a commercial storage warehouse in Lower Manhattan. Then, breaking with normal procedure, they accepted an offer by Chanel to organize the transportation and storage.
The supervisor of the project for Chanel, he said, was a retired officer who worked part time for Chanel and who hired 40 off-duty and retired officers to transport 10 truckloads of boxes of the seized handbags.
What happened instead, Mr. Morgenthau said, was that some of the hired officers stole handbags from the trucks and then changed the police locks on the bins holding the bags so they could steal more later. The officers placed many of the handbags elsewhere in the warehouse in bins they rented on their own, and then sold them to fences, he said.
 
'As Much as They Could'
 "These off-duty police officers, retired officers and civilians stole whatever they could and as much as they could," Mr. Morgenthau said. "They stole both haphazardly and systematically. The end result was that thousands of pieces of evidence seized under the authority of the law were stolen and fenced by police officers sworn to uphold the law."
The Police Department has been battered recently by allegations of corruption. The storage of the bags was supervised by the District Attorney's detective squad, which consists of police officers. Michael Cherkasky, chief of the District Attorney's Investigation Division, said the supervision was inadequate but that the detectives were not part of the scheme.
"Clearly this was woefully inadequate supervision that occurred," said Mr. Cherkasky. But he added, "There was no criminality in the squad. I can say that with a high degree of probability."
The Police Department's Internal Affairs Division is investigating why supervision was lax and if anyone on the squad should be disciplined. Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Morgenthau, said that investigators were also trying to determine who had permitted a Chanel representative to organize the storage of prosecution evidence, and why.
 
Thefts Noticed in March
 The missing bags were noticed in early March, when investigators visited the warehouse for the pretrial work and realized that there were far fewer bags than there should have been, Mr. McKelvey said. The investigation into the thefts was conducted by the Internal Affairs Division and the District Attorney's office. Officials say the investigation is continuing.
The kingpin of the operation, Mr. Morgenthau said, was Aniello Tuzzio, a 49-year-old defendant who retired from the police department in 1989 and who worked for Chanel part time.
Mr. Morgenthau said Mr. Tuzzio, on Chanel's behalf, recruited the others, including his 27-year-old son, Neil, an officer assigned to the police automobile pound in Whitestone, Queens, who was charged along with his father with criminal possession of stolen property and with tampering with physical evidence.
The three other officers who were similarly charged were Kevin Mikes, 26, and Robert Hohl, both assigned to the 19th Precinct in Manhattan, and Daniel LiBecci, 31, of the 61st Precinct in Brooklyn. All the active officers were suspended without pay.
A fifth defendant, Raymond Garvey, 35, retired from the department with a disability last year. Two other defendants were Michael Sullivan, 31, the son of a retired police officer, and Frank Boni, 27, a part-time employee of the Hempstead Town Court.
The four officers, along with Mr. Tuzzio, were arrested yesterday and all pleaded not guilty at their arraignments later in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The others were scheduled to surrender later.
If convicted, the defendants face sentences of 4 to 7 years in prison.
At a news conference, Mr. Morgenthau and Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown said that the indictments did not reflect any increase in police corruption. Rather, they said the charges were against what Mr. Morgenthau called "individual officers for specific crimes."
Mr. Brown emphatically said, "There is no room in the department for criminals," adding, "They will be rooted out and crushed."
He also said that police corruption was "not systemic" when he took office 30 months ago and that "it is not systemic now."
A person answering the telephone at Chanel's New York headquarters at 9 West 57th Street said no one was available for comment.

HEADLINE: Ex-Envoy Calls Indictment 'a Shock'

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, Colo., July 9

 BODY:
Former United States Ambassador Sam H. Zakhem, a native of Lebanon whose wealthy father disinherited him for emigrating to America, often said that he gave up a fortune for the love of his adopted country.
Mr. Zakhem's patriotism, along, no doubt, with his efforts to raise money for conservative political causes, helped to earn him the appointment as Ambassador to Bahrain by President Reagan in 1986. 
 But his resume lacked foreign affairs expertise, and one State Department observer labeled him an "amateur" dangerously miscast in the hot-spot of Middle East politics.
In an indictment announced on Tuesday, Mr. Zakhem, 56 years old, and two other men were charged with secretly accepting $7.7 million from the Government of Kuwait to act as undisclosed foreign agents in a "propaganda campaign" to generate support for the war against Iraq.
The Justice Department claims that Mr. Zakhem, along with William R. Kennedy, the former owner and publisher of The Conservative Digest, and Scott Stanley Jr., a former editor of the publication, spent $2 million on public relations and advertising and diverted the rest of the money to their "personal and undisclosed profit."
 
Will Plead Not Guilty
 Mr. Zakhem, who lives in an elegant stone house in suburban Lakewood, said today that the indictment "came as a shock -- especially considering the nature and timing of the charges."
In a telephone interview, Mr. Zakhem, who ran unsuccessfully in May for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate, said he would plead not guilty.
"I am a straight-shooting politician who calls a spade a spade," he said.
There have been other reports that Mr. Zakhem sought personal benefits from his contracts in the Gulf States. The Iraqi News Agency has circulated what it says is a letter dated May 18, 1990, from the Kuwait ambassador to the United States, Sheik Saud Nasir al Sabah. The letter, to Kuwait's minister of oil, reportedly states that "Mr. Zakhem is requesting us to help him, for the present time and until 1992," to be given a salary "to ensure for him a legal income enabling him to be totally dedicated to his next electoral campaign."
The Ambassador is said to have written, "As you know, we maintain good relations with Mr. Zakhem and his good stances towards our Gulf issues."
Mr. Zakhem dismissed the letter as "Iraqi propaganda."
 
Appointment Criticized
 The appointment to Bahrain, brought some criticism at a time when Washington was increasingly relying on that country in its efforts to limit the tanker wars between Iran and Iraq.
Richard B. Straus, the editor of the Middle East Policy Survey, wrote in a Los Angeles Times essay that President Reagan had followed an unwise tradition of sending weak political appointees to key foreign posts in "funny, cute little countries."
Mr. Straus added: "These days, however, Bahrain is not a cute little country. It has become de facto headquarters for the biggest U.S. Naval armada assembled since World War II."
During his tenure, Mr. Zakhem was often regarded as a competitive diplomat who considered himself a leading expert on Arab matters. He was recalled once by Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead for dealing outside of channels with the Bahrain Government.
He also argued with Central Intelligence Agency analysts who had contended at various times that the ruling family in Bahrain was in imminent danger of being overthrown by the country's pro-Iranian Shiite majority. As it turned out, the intelligence analysis was wrong; Mr. Zakhem's instincts were right.
Supporters of Mr. Zakhem say the United States benefited from his close contacts. They contrast his approach with that of April Glaspie, the former Ambassador to Iraq, who was taken by surprise by Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
Mr. Zakhem first came to the United States after graduating from the American University in Cairo in 1957. He earned his masters degree in economics at the University of Detroit. He later returned to Lebanon, but became disenchanted with some of the country's traditions, such as arranged marriages, according to his campaign biography.
He moved to Denver in 1965, where he worked as a night watchman and car parker to put himself through graduate school at the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he studied political science. As a student, he founded groups in support of missing soldiers in Vietnam.
After receiving his Ph.D., he became the director of international student affairs at the University of Denver, and also worked as a researcher for the Heritage Foundation.
He was elected to the Colorado Legislature in 1974 and won re-election in 1976. He was elected to the Colorado Senate in 1978 and also held other jobs, including a stint as a motivational speaker for an orthodontics company.
In Colorado politics, he was known as a maverick who disdained compromise. A Republican colleague, Ray Powers, described Mr. Zakhem as a "super patriot."
But Arie Taylor, a former Democratic state representative, said Mr. Zakhem took a tone of righteousness. "What Sam really stood for, I couldn't say," she said. "He was against everything other than believing that he was a better American than most of us who were born here."
 
Theatrical Inclinations
 He also had a penchant for publicity stunts. In 1975, he challenged five women in the Legislature to a game of volleyball. Playing alone, he defeated them handily.
On one occasion, Mr. Zakhem was ridiculed for jamming a letter opener into the "no" button on his electronic voting machine while he was off making a speech.
In the indictment, prosecutors charged that the men violated Federal tax laws by failing to report the money, and ignored the Foreign Agents Registration Act by failing to disclose their status as Kuwaiti agents when they lobbied Congress and the Administration.
The indictment charges that Mr. Zakhem and his two associates were contacted by the Kuwait Government after it had been invaded by Iraq in 1990. It says they set up two "front" organizations, the Coalition for America at Risk, and later, the Freedom Task Force.
The group ran television advertisements in support of the war against Iraq and lobbied members of Congress. Prosecutors said the men used multiple bank accounts to conceal the source of the funding.

HEADLINE: House Votes to Breach 1990 Budget Act

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Trying to crack the barriers of the 1990 budget law that have curbed domestic spending, the House voted today to take $400 million in foreign aid savings and spend it instead on transportation.
The Bush Administration threatened a veto, saying the measure would trouble financial markets and cause interest rates to rise, thus undercutting the job-creating purpose behind the transportation legislation. 
 The vote was 213 to 190, far short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. One hundred ninety-six Democrats, 16 Republicans and one independent voted in favor of shifting the money, while 51 Democrats and 139 Republicans were opposed.
Earlier, the House had voted in favor of applying all budget savings to deficit reduction, but the second vote meant the House was saying all savings except this $400 million should go to deficit reduction. The second vote, in favor of shifting the money, rendered the first one ineffective.
 
Michel Argument Spurned
 The House went along with the urging of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, who said there had been a change in circumstances and that the House had to "deal with a recession that's in front of us" with 10 million Americans out of work. The shift of money to highway spending, he said, would produce jobs and help the country rebuild the infrastructure that was dragging the economy down.
The vote spurned the argument of Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, who said that Congressional credibility had to be re-established by sticking to the 1990 budget agreement and using the money to reduce the deficit. "At the very time when we should, when we must, begin to re-establish trust, the majority is asking us to break our word," he said.
A similar effort is expected in the Senate when that chamber acts later this summer on the $35 billion transportation appropriation bill. If the effort succeeds there, the likelihood of a veto and the chances of overriding it would probably depend heavily on the fall political situation for the President and for lawmakers facing re-election.
 
Virtually Painless Shift
 Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on transportation, said, "If the opportunity exists in the Senate, I'll be looking for ways to add more money to the transportation budget."
The Budget Act of 1990, aimed at reducing the Federal deficit, set overall spending limits and for three years prohibited the Government from applying savings achieved in any one of three broad categories -- domestic spending, military spending and foreign aid -- toward programs in either of the two other categories. Today's vote was important as a precedent, especially since the House, on March 31, rejected a more sweeping change that would have shifted $7.5 billion from military spending to domestic areas.
The vote today was easier because the proposal was to take money from an unpopular area, foreign aid, and apply it to a political winner, highway building. Indeed, since the House had already cut more than $400 million from foreign aid, the shift was virtually painless. A letter from the measure's sponsors to their colleagues contended that the shift would create 125,000 jobs and warned that if the money was not shifted, "the Senate may spend these funds for unnecessary foreign aid."
Ultimately, the $400 million would translate into about $2.6 billion in spending, since it would be used as contract authority and commit the Federal Government and state governments that use it to $2.2 billion more in future years.
Most of that would go to Federal aid to highway construction to pay the costs of an expanded program that was adopted last year as the President and Congress congratulated themselves on a major job-creating program they said would start fighting the recession immediately.
The shift would allow obligations to be made for highways totaling $16.7 billion, a $2.25 billion increase over what the House Appropriations Committee was able to provide out of the domestic spending limits set in the Budget Act of 1990.
The law's prohibition against shifting money from one category to another, intended to protect military and foreign aid spending from domestic appetites, will expire after Sept. 30, 1993. But that prohibition is now acting to crimp a wide range of domestic spending programs, often holding spending increases below what is necessary to allow for inflation.
The amendment voted today would also allow obligations for mass transit discretionary grants to reach $1.85 billion, an increase of $257 million over the committee proposal. The obligation ceiling for airport construction would grow by $50 million, to $1.85 billion, and the appropriation for the Coast Guard would be increased by $38 million to $2.55 billion.
If the effort to shift funds becomes law, New York would get an extra $125 million in highway funds, New Jersey $67 million, and Connecticut $44 million.
In adopting the plan, the House rejected the arguments of several lawmakers who said the shift could threaten Israel by denying the Bush Administration the flexibility it might need to provide loan guarantees. Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California, said it would impose a "straitjacket on U.S. policy makers."
 
Why the Deficit Grew
 To Republican arguments that this was the time for lawmakers to cast the difficult votes to cut spending, as they had promised their constitutents, Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat, answered that the deficit had grown not because of excessive spending, but "because the economy fell apart."
Mr. Obey, who managed the amendment and heads the subcommittee that deals with foreign aid, said the Adminstration was already working to restore the cuts the House had made in the foreign aid bill.
Representative Bill Gradison, Republican of Ohio, said the Democrats were not keeping their word and applying savings to cut the deficit, but were "deciding to spend it on things that have election-year appeal."
But arguments citing the flagging econmomy and the 7.8 percent unemployment rate were decisive. Representative Bob Wise, Democrat of West Virginia, said, "Shift foreign aid to U.S. aid."

HEADLINE: Making a Case for a Fiscal Jolt

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Could fiscal policy, long buried under the rubble of the $4 trillion Federal debt, rise from the grave?
A few months ago, the prospects of using tax cuts or government spending to jolt the economy from its torpor were virtually nil. But higher unemployment and, more important, the growing realization that business-as-usual means high unemployment for years to come, have made the unthinkable merely unlikely. 
 In fact, 100 leading economists, including six Nobel laureates, recently urged the Government to spend $50 billion a year on investment to speed growth. And Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas is offering a public investment plan in his campaign. But many others are still skeptical.
 
Economists Lose Faith
 Why is fiscal stimulus such a hard sell? In the stagflation of the 1970's, many mainstream economists lost faith in the efficacy of economic fine-tuning. The new view, notes Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University, was that "tax cuts are dissipated in private savings, and spending takes too long."
In recent years, however, this post-Keynesian critique has been overshadowed by the problems of managing the economy in an era of $300 billion budget deficits. While there is plenty of unused productive capacity today, the deficit, to many, represents a large, already mortgaged claim on future savings. Many analysts interpret stubbornly high long-term interest rates as the financial markets' vote of no-confidence in Washington's ability to contain demand once the economy is again chugging. "They must be projecting a capital shortage," concludes Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution.
 
Prospects Seem Bleak
 By this logic, the tonic of deficit spending might be fully offset by the depressant of higher long-term interest rates. Even economists who scoff at the idea of a dollar-for-dollar offset acknowledge that fiscal stimulus could tilt output toward consumption and away from investment -- hardly the game plan of choice in an era of sagging productivity growth.
All this suggests that the prospects for applying a fiscal jolt (or getting the desired results, if applied) are bleak. The mechanics alone represent a formidable political barrier: To get past the deficit reduction agreement of 1990, notes Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, the President would have to declare an emergency and Congress would have to accede. But even today, four months before the election, 7.8 percent unemployment has a way of clarifying politicians' priorities. And those who dread the consequences of fiddling while the voters burn can certainly muster arguments to justify taking action.
Mr. Gordon, for example, doubts that the traditional argument against public works applies. With financially pressed local governments cutting back on projects already begun, he argues, "every dime from Washington would be spent."
Analysts caution, however, that any stimulus package would have to be crafted with care to generate maximum effect with minimum backlash. It makes sense, for example, to focus spending on muscle rather than fat -- on highways or job training rather than supplements to personal income. And Mr. Bosworth says Washington must show that any deficit increase would be temporary.
The best means to this end, he suggests, would be to tie the spending increase to a tax surcharge down the road. That way, there would be less reason to believe that money invested in 1992-93 would push the budget even further out of balance later.
But Mr. Reischauer warns that no matter what the recipe, lunch would not be free or even cheap.
What follows are the views of nine economic experts on where the economy might get the most useful jolt -- with the biggest future payoff -- if the Federal Government decided it did want to loosen its purse strings.
 
Rebuilding Inner Cities
 
Paul S. Grogan
President, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which provides financial and technical assistance to nonprofit community-based developers
The great physicist Niels Bohr once observed: "There is not much hope if we have only one difficulty, but when we have two, we can match them off against each other."
That's how we should be approaching two of the nation's most pressing problems: stimulating the American economy for the short and long term and doing something about the inner cities.
Both sets of problems have been festering for years. And the Federal response, despite the Los Angeles riots and renewed evidence that the economy languishes, has been painfully anemic.
Understandably, there is little enthusiasm for the rigid and prescriptive government spending programs of the past that were better at producing bureaucracy than results.
But there is another way, one that relies on bedrock American values such as decentralized local initiative, self-help, partnership and private investment. Using a constellation of existing, modest Federal programs, administered primarily at the state and local levels, public money can be quickly used to stimulate substantial long-term private investment in rebuilding inner cities.
The most efficient way to proceed is by funding existing programs that have bipartisan support and can be expanded without red tape. Here are three:
*The Low Income Housing Tax Credit, at a cost of $2.5 billion over five years, should be extended permanently and increased. Since 1987, the credit has attracted billions of private investment dollars to build 400,000 low-cost housing units and is linked to 94 percent of all new affordable rental housing. The credit creates 100,000 jobs each year, 40 percent of them in construction, as well as $16.8 billion in economic activity and $1.2 billion in tax revenue.
*The HOME program, established in 1990 as part of a new Federal housing act, should be fully funded at $2 billion instead of slashed, as the President has proposed. It gives cities and states flexible funds to invest in homeownership and rental housing, money that attracts other private investment.
*Community Development Block Grant funding should be doubled to $6 billion restoring it to 1980 levels (adjusted for inflation.) Cities and states use C.D.B.G. for a wide range of economic development, housing and infrastructure investments in low-income communities.
Finally, to add to these proven winners, Congress should enact a new tax credit for inner-city economic development projects like supermarkets. Such a credit would create thousands of jobs for low-income residents, slash exorbitant food costs and re-create an essential part of community life.
 
Needed: New Ideas On Investment
 
Michael H. Walsh
 President and chief executive, Tenneco Inc.
Changing the country is hugely more difficult than changing a company, but the principles are similar. It starts with facing facts. We consume too much and invest too little. We've got to pay the piper for past excesses. Frequently this means saying "no" to things we need, but can't afford. Mostly it means saving and investing -- sacrificing -- to build for tomorrow.
What does this mean for the country? First, it means investment in people, technology and infrastructure -- three of the key things which drive our economy. Second, unless we cut back on the runaway entitlements in the Federal budget, there won't be much added Federal money to invest in anything. Third, it means a joint effort between the public and private sectors, with less posturing and much more leadership from both. Fourth, and most importantly, it requires mobilizing a collective national will to conquer the economic and social challenges we face as we look ahead to the 21st century.
All of this requires a high level of infrastructure investment. Creative investment vehicles (such as Felix Rohatyn's idea of investment-rated bonds to be acquired by private and public pension funds) need to be examined with an eye as to how they can be made to work (as opposed to finding the endless reasons they won't because we haven't tried).
We also need to be creative about long-term tax incentives to stimulate productive investment, as well as market-related efforts like Jack Kemp's proposal for enterprise zones.
A focus on productivity -- doing more with less -- is also critical. So is new thinking.
The bottom line? Our problems will not fix themselves. They require genuine tough-minded leadership from business and government. We can find additional funds (provided we think the need is great enough) from tough but necessary measures such as increased gasoline taxes, possibly even temporary income tax surcharges, reductions in the growth of entitlements, creative finance devices, major improvement in government efficiencies, and so on.
The payback from all of this will be less inner-city decay, fewer inadequate public schools, reduced unemployment and increased competitiveness. None of these steps is popular or easy. But if our current paralysis continues, we'll go nowhere -- except down.
 
Technologies Need Nurturing
 
William J. Spencer
 President and chief executive, Sematech, an alliance of companies in the semiconductor industry.
It's time for the United States to think about investing in the United States -- and in the critical technologies that will determine the nation's competitiveness.
Those technologies, which include such fields as semiconductors, electronics, software and advanced materials, have already been identified by such diverse organizations as the Departments of Commerce and Defense, the President's science adviser, and the commercial Council on Competitiveness, as well as by Japan's Ministry for International Trade and Industry and by the European community. The interesting aspect of these lists is not that they exist, but that they are nearly identical.
Other economic regions are already investing in these technologies. Only the United States among leading nations has hesitated in setting national priorities and finding ways to develop U.S. leadership in them.
One approach to investing in these technologies is to set up a series of national experiments in critical industries. They should involve industry and government, and -- where they have expertise -- our universities and national labs.
One such experiment, Sematech, has been under way for five years. Eighty percent of the United States semiconductor industry banded together to focus on manufacturing capabilities in this key industry. Costs were shared by industry and government, and the directions for the program were principally set by industry.
In 1991, an independent research organization showed that for the first time in more than a decade, the United States market share in semiconductor manufacturing equipment increased. This increase represented jobs generated in the United States, or not lost, greater than the government investment in the experiment. If this market share increases, as we expect, it should generate additional new jobs, tax revenue and personal income.
The experiments should be short term, and must focus on measurable technical results, as well as such measurable criteria as job creation, increased exports and increased tax revenue. The experiments should be constantly monitored, and those that are unsuccessful should be ruthlessly terminated.
These experiments would represent an American approach to partnership aimed at establishing American manufacturing and industrial leadership in technology. If we want to be among the world's leaders in the future, we must have a stake in developing new critical technologies today.
 
$25 Billion For Programs
 
Sar A. Levitan
Director of the George Washington University Center for Social Policy Studies.
Measured by rising unemployment rates, current economic conditions reflect the longest downturn since World War II. Even as President Bush repeatedly proclaims that the recession is over, joblessness and welfare caseloads continue to rise. Monetary policy has fallen short of pulling the economy from its prolonged doldrums. The time is long overdue for Congress to stimulate the economy by creating jobs and expanding educational and training opportunities. In response to every recession during the past three decades, the Federal Government funded job creations initiatives -- even during the Reagan Administration. But President Bush has shunned such measures.
It would take five million new jobs to reduce unemployment to 4 percent, close to full employment, but creating only 600,000 jobs immediately would significantly ameliorate hardship. Society's work is never done, and there is no shortage of unmet needs, particularly since state and local governments have cut many essential services. A jobs program should fund services and labor-intensive public works projects because they would boost employment quickly, target the jobless least likely to find work on their own, and invest funds in jobs rather than materiel.
Eligibility criteria, therefore, should offer priority to the long-term, jobless and job-ready welfare recipients. The limited skills of these individuals could be readily matched with important unmet societal needs. Additional aides in public schools, hospitals and the criminal justice system could enable teachers to devote more time to instruction, free nurses for more skilled tasks, and put more police officers on the street. By employing job-ready welfare recipients, the program would encourage work and raise the living standards of recipients.
Jobs programs are often dismissed as too costly, but the price of inaction is compelling. In addition to boosting income support outlays, higher unemployment rates have demonstrated a correlation with rising mortality, health impairments, crime, mental illness and divorce rates.
Expanded education and training programs would also produce longer-term benefits. Millions of Americans are inadequately prepared for work. "Second-chance" programs would assist individuals who failed in or were failed by the educational systems.
Altogether these proposals would carry an annual price tag of about $25 billion above current Federal expenditures, to be divided equally among job creation, education and training. But the added outlays would reduce the current annual $50 billion welfare and unemployment insurance expenditures and produce a better educated, trained and more productive labor force.
 
Time to Plan For Long Run
 
William J. Baumol
Director, C. V. Starr Center for Applied Economics, New York University.
If Japan's growth is founded on borrowed technology, United States growth policy has missed the lesson: the need to facilitate rapid adoption of the latest technological developments from abroad.
It is probably too late to do much about our shorter-run recession problem, particularly as the legacy of Reaganomics has largely destroyed many of the policy options. Any anti-recession measures we adopt today are unlikely to show results until it is all over and very different programs are required. Now is the time to plan for the longer run, and particularly policies to encourage growth.
Most discussions advocate stimulating savings. But surprisingly, we know almost nothing about how to do that. Various tax gimmicks are proposed, most notably, reducing the capital gains tax, but statistical studies yield inconclusive or even negative results.
Three courses of action seem more promising: infrastructure investment, industrial policy to encourage promising industries and public sector support for the adoption and dissemination of foreign technology.
Almost every industrial economy has cut back on investment in governmentally provided infrastructure -- the airports, bridges, rail networks and other structures that are a foundation of economic performance. This provides an opportunity for the United States to forge ahead, but we have cut back more than anyone.
Reductions in the military budget can provide the requisite funds and can be timed to provide new jobs for those laid off by military cuts. Paradoxically, such reallocation of funds will actually help to strengthen our defense, because, as American military history confirms, our productive capacity has often been the key to victory.
Second, any country that succeeds in expanding a growth industry with scale economies attains a powerful competitive advantage over its rivals. The danger lies in succumbing to the political temptation to resuscitate dying industries. We must focus only on fields that promise to permit substantial growth.
 
Useful Investment In a Hurry
 
Francis M. Bator and Robert M. Solow
Dr. Bator is professor of political economy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and Dr. Solow is a professor of economics at M.I.T. and a Nobel laureate.
The economy has been stagnant since the last quarter of 1988. The resulting loss of production and jobs is irrecoverable. The further danger is that prolonged stagnation makes ultimate recovery even slower.
Under these circumstances, almost any kind of prompt action to increase total demand is desirable, and there is every reason to believe that direct fiscal steps will be effective. A temporary widening of the budget deficit is a price well worth paying, in fact not much of a price at all; it will lead to more, not less, private investment. Our businesses need customers right now, not savers.
Although any effective stimulus would help solve the short run problem, the country will gain in the long run if it takes the form of higher investment in future productive capacity. So the real question is: How can the Federal budget get us some useful investment right now, in a hurry?
We favor tax incentives for incremental business investment, as part of a long-run program. But with idle capacity increasing, that will take too long and temporary tax credits will just borrow investment from the immediate future. So we turn to direct Federal spending. The country is short of infrastructure and what we have is crumbling. A more efficient transportation network and a high-technology information transfer system would add to the productivity of private industry. The trick is to get moving fast.
The most effective way to get needed public investment quickly is through a prompt increase in Federal grants in aid to states and cities, earmarked for increased spending on infrastructure. Many states and cities have been canceling and postponing projects that could be ready to go in a few weeks. Workers and materials are easily available. Of course there will be slippage. Mayors and governors, desperate for funds, will try to pass off ongoing activities as candidates for Federal financing, and squirrel the new money into operating budgets. But under the scrutiny of Federal watchdogs they would not want to risk disqualification.
We think $50 billion could be spent very productively in one year. But we caution that continuation of increased public investment will need to be financed by new taxes or reduced military spending when the economy returns to prosperous conditions. For adequate total investment we must gradually shift the Federal budget into surplus. Private saving is unlikely to be large enough to finance both private and public investment.
Federal infrastructure investment would be welcome too. Federal money could probably find quick and useful employment in buying civilian research and development, perhaps by letting contracts to idled high-tech defense contractors.
The principle is clear: To put idle workers and capacity back to work, buy now -- but buy for the future.
 
Need to Insure Technology Base
 
George N. Hatsopoulos
 Mr. Hatsopoulos is chairman and president, Thermo Electron Corporation.
Historically, the U.S. Government's expenditures for aerospace and defense research have paid great dividends in fields such as computers, commercial aviation, energy and the environment. As defense research and development declines, we need to insure that the nation's technology base continues to receive the support necessary to sustain future growth through the creation of new commercial activities and all-new industries.
In considering additional short-term measures to stimulate economic recovery, we should avoid creating new governmental organizations and try to work within the present structure. We must also take care that our actions will strengthen this country's long-term competitiveness. These goals can be met by concentrating on what America does best -- conducting advanced scientific research and developing innovative new products and services. I believe that significant results can be achieved over the next few years by applying a reasonable portion of the money we are currently cutting from the defense budget.
One way to obtain fast results, without expanding the Government's existing bureaucracy, is to appropriate additional R&D funding for agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, and the Department of Transportation. These agencies already sponsor programs designed to meet society's current and emerging problems -- health care, air and water quality, energy conservation, airline and highway safety and many others. We can capitalize on this structure by boosting Federal sponsorship of technology development without substantially altering the present national priorities and goals.
Additional research and development spending introduces an almost immediate stimulus to the economy through the procurement of equipment, software, and other supplies, and it expands employment in a wide range of industries. There is no lack of problems to which new research funding can be productively applied. Furthermore, we have seen that the commercialization of advanced technologies, particularly through small start-up ventures, has been one of our most effective vehicles for creating new, high-value jobs.
 
Highest Priority: Young People
 
Reuben Mark
Chairman, president and chief executive, Colgate-Palmolive Company.
Our society cries out desperately major investment in many areas. But investment in our young people should be of our highest priority.
Think back to what happened when we first approached school.
First, we came to school somewhat prepared. Second, we entered a building that, generally speaking, was hospitable, well maintained, and technologically equipped to fulfill our needs. Third, we encountered caring, motivated individuals whose training and experience helped us learn.
Contrast that with the situation today. Many urban youngsters approach school totally unprepared and face the difficult, if not impossible, task of "catching up". School buildings are dilapidated, detrimental to the learning process, and not up to the technological standards required.
And finally, while teachers and principals are as caring as ever, frustration, poor pay, and cuts in professional and leadership training budgets have taken their toll.
Federal investment is needed in each of these three areas:
1. Investment in Early Childhood Development
Increased early childhood investment is critical. If a child cannot read by second grade, he or she is lost to the educational system. Headstart's effectiveness is widely acknowledged, but the program currently reaches only 30% of eligible, disadvantaged children. It must be expanded to 100% as quickly as possible, must address chidren as young as two, and must be extended to full rather than half-days.
Further, funding must be increased for Chapter 1, the national remedial program for math and reading. In addition, chapter 1 needs greater flexibility for a broader array of services and school projects.
2. Investment in School Buildings and Facilities
Capital investment in school buildings is vital. Just as a nation must put huge sums into bridges and roads, the federal government must find ways to improve the physical plant and technological capabilities of our nation's schools.
3. Investment in Teaching Skills and School Leadership
Every human endeavor depends on people. Our teachers must be viewed as performing a vital national role. An investment mechanism must be found to insure appropriate pay and to increase morale, retention and performance.
Funds must be found for increased training at all levels and for reducing class size. We must also further develop the leadership of school principals and administrators. We must invest in these three areas: Pre-school education; school buildings and facilities; and the training, motivation and encouraging of the people who affect our children profoundly.

HEADLINE: An Unequal Justice;
Little Aid for Hard-Time Sisterhood

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
T. J. Rivera lingered remorsefully over her role in one of the most startling social turns of America's last decade -- a tripling of the number of women in United States prisons and jails, a growth rate well beyond that of male inmates.
"Here I had just assaulted this 74-year-old woman," Ms. Rivera recalled, backtracking to bad times on the streets of Manhattan as a 28-year-old drug-addicted mugger of a pedestrian, a particularly vulnerable woman whose purse she grabbed. 
 "Franny was covered in blood," the ex-convict continued, now knowing the name and nature of her victim. "I stopped. 'Oh my God,' I said. 'I'm so sorry.' And Franny said, 'Honey, if you had just asked me.' "
The underlying notion of sisterhood that drove Ms. Rivera to meet and befriend her victim of six years ago is a driving factor in her new post-prison life as an organizer of female convicts and their children who have the AIDS virus.
Sisterhood is no less a motivation for Ms. Rivera's new partner, Ann Jacobs, the executive director of the 150-year-old Women's Prison Association. She is busy shedding the vestiges of noblesse oblige from the esteemed organization's 19th-century roots and throwing open the doors of its brownstone headquarters, 110 Second Avenue at East Seventh Street in lower Manhattan, to H.I.V.-positive babies and their felonious mothers. Ms. Rivera is a regular visitor as the association takes on its new focus.
 
Institutional Invisibility
 "The criminal justice system remains male-focused in spite of the fact that women are the fastest growing part of the prison population," noted Ms. Jacobs, who is turning the association toward rough-edged inmate organizations like Ms. Rivera's Ace-Out (AIDS Education Counseling on the Outside). She is living with the problem that, amid the nation's vast growth in prison population in the past decade of the "war on drugs," the number of incarcerated women has grown by 202 percent, compared with the male population's 112 percent increase.
The dragnets of the narcotics police are sweeping in more women from a growing cottage drug industry in ghetto neighborhoods. Many of these women, while likely to be fix-hungry addicts and low-ranking surrogates of men in drug deals, have had to do more hard time as a result of recent mandatory drug-sentencing laws. With these laws, state legislatures across the nation have deprived judges of leeway to consider extenuating circumstances, most notably that more than three-fourths of the sentenced women are mothers.
A result in New York is that between 1982 and 1989 the number of women entering prison went up more than 500 percent, from 337 to 2,264. Convictions for violent crimes went down, while drug sentences rose more than twentyfold, from 67 in 1982 to 1,641 in 1989.
 
Lost in a Flood of Men
 Nationally, the numbers show that men remain the more felonious sex by almost 19 to one. There were 40,556 women in Federal and state prisons in 1989, a record tripling from the 13,420 imprisoned at the start of the decade, according to the Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. The number of male prisoners totaled 669,498 in 1989, slightly more than doubling during a decade of vast prison construction that leaves the United States with the highest rate of incarceration of any industrialized nation.
In New York, leaders in addressing the badly overlooked needs of female inmates include Tracy Huling, director of the Women in Prison project of the Correctional Association of New York, a private monitoring organization. She is focusing on the special problem of women being used increasingly as unwitting "drug mules" -- relatively naive or desperate drug couriers who are receiving long sentences, as if they were substantial drug dealers.
"Mandatory sentencing is primarily being used against drug offenders, with the most harsh sentences going to the least offensive individuals," Ms. Huling said in an interview. "Everybody in the criminal justice system knows it's a joke. But it provides very effective political cover, an easy way to be 'tough on crime.' "
She prefers alternatives to prison time like intensive probation, house arrest and community service, programs that, while increasingly talked about, involve less than 5 percent of the nation's offender population.
While Ms. Huling has been working to reduce the number of female inmates by getting drug penalties eased, Elaine Roulet, a nun, has been starting infant nurseries inside the prison system and a chain of nine halfway houses in the metropolitan area for female ex-convicts with babies. The latter deal with a Catch-22, in which an ex-convict, dealing with multiple bureaucracies, cannot gather her children from foster care without adequate housing, which she cannot obtain without having her children in tow to show her need.
 
Looking for a Way Out
 "As I get older, I am obsessed with the thought that I have made these prisons 'prettier,' " said Sister Elaine, who has spent 22 years as a social worker at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison for women a few miles north of Mount Kisco, N.Y. "But I don't believe in prison. We now have 23 mothers and babies in Bedford Hills -- and these are felons?" she said, offering an incredulous smile.
Sister Elaine cited the stories of two young women from the prison arrested in the same crack bust at an apartment in New York. One, a low-level courier for her boyfriend, accepted a plea bargain and served 18 months. The other, insisting she was an uninvolved baby sitter, declined to plea bargain and pressed her innocence in court. But she was convicted and is serving 15 years to life. The two work together in a Bedford Hills social service program, on separate sides of the prison wall.
Young black and Hispanci women who use drugs have proved to be among the easiest targets of antinarcotics police sweeps, said Jo Anne Page, director of the Fortune Society, a private program that helps ex-convicts. Whatever the public thinks of the headlined war on drugs that focuses most easily on the economic underclass, Ms. Page notes that some studies suggest the white majority's drug abuse is comparable.
"All we've really been doing for the past decade is building low-income housing for the poor -- prison cages -- at an astronomical level," said Ms. Page, referring to the $52,000 median cost of providing space for each new prisoner and noting the hidden costs were even greater for the majority of women in prison whose children were placed in foster care, at a cost of $20,000 or more annually per child.
The cost of space for two new prisoners would almost make the budget of Women Care, a mentor program for female ex-inmates in the city that is highly praised but, even with a budget of $110,000 a year, is scrambling to find new financing. "I always had the quick answers and thought I knew poor people," said the program's founder, Eileen Hogan, a nun who worked nine years with female inmates at Rikers Island and realized something more was needed.
Sister Eileen started a program to reach beyond group programs and carefully match female inmates one to one with female mentors -- a cross-section of society, from lawyers to a few ex-convicts. They talk to the ex-inmates daily about immediate problems, meet with them at least weekly and build some very deep and beneficial friendships, program workers said.
 
The Trouble With Leniency
 The State Legislature, reflecting constituent fears, has demonstrated its continuing faith in prison construction. It has been skittish about Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's recent attempt to soften some sentencing laws, like one that mandates prison time for anyone convicted of a felony for the second time. But Ms. Huling of the Correctional Association hopes that the attention being paid to the issue of women used as drug mules in such influential circles as the office of John Cardinal O'Connor of the New York Archdiocese may eventually provide the first wedge for drug-law reform in more than a decade.
The second-felony law, in particular, has been contributing to the record rise of female inmates, corrections specialists say. They say a drug-addicted woman shown leniency in a first offense typically turns back to illicit low-level criminal activity within a few weeks in order to maintain her habit and her family.
"Every day I want out of here," said Miriam Benitez, a 33-year-old inmate at Bedford Hills who fell into just such a pattern and is to be released July 16 after finishing a second drug-related prison term of 22 months. Her daughter, Felisha, was born in the Bedford Hills prison nursery 21 months ago. Mrs. Benitez went through labor with a handcuff holding one wrist to the bed.
Mrs. Benitez, who has three older children, said that Bedford Hills remained every bit a prison, brooding and confining, despite its pastel colors and well-praised programs and administrators. But they have allowed Felisha to become the state's first prison-commuting infant. By law, the baby had to leave the prison after 18 months, but Sister Elaine recruited a local family to provide foster care and drop the baby off at prison for six hours every weekday.
"The mothers in here worry a lot about our kids out there," Mrs. Benitez said. "The streets. The killings. The drugs. I pray every night for my kids." If she falls a third time in society's war on drugs, she will face 25 years to life.
Marty Melendez, an ex-convict who was released after a drug term last December, had supported her drug habit through prostitution, from which she traces her infection with the AIDS virus. Female inmates from the drug subculture are particularly alarming to AIDS researchers, for some estimates are that well over a quarter of them may be carrying the virus back to a world offering more drugs and prostitution.
"I didn't want to bring a baby into this world who was H.I.V.-positive," Mrs. Melendez recalled thinking, but then changed her mind and gave birth, days before her prison term began, to a daughter, Punky, now 15 months old and H.I.V.-positive.
"Oh, I love my baby. I'm glad she's here," said Mrs. Melendez, bolstered for a moment by Ace-Out as she visited the Women's Prison Association. Ms. Jacobs welcomed her as a bit of progress in reaching the growing prison sisterhood.

HEADLINE: Mugabe's Aura Fades as Drought Sears Zimbabwe

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe

 BODY:
After enjoying more than a decade of respect at home and abroad, President Robert G. Mugabe is beginning to fit a common profile on the continent: the African leader under fire.
One of the few African countries with a semi-modern economy, Zimbabwe now has an unemployment rate of more than 40 percent, inflation of nearly 40 percent, interest rates of 36 percent and critical food shortages caused as much by bad Government policies as by a devastating drought. 
 Malnutrition has soared in this country, which usually exports food, and many children are being turned away from public schools because their parents cannot afford the fees.
 
Captain Is Absent
 In the face of this grim economic and social picture, Mr. Mugabe has failed to make decisions or inspire confidence, say both his supporters and his critics in this country of 10 million.
"Mugabe gives the impression of being overwhelmed," said Ariston Chambati, the chairman of a major business conglomerate here, TA Holdings, and a former Ambassador to West Germany who still sees the President. "The boat is without a captain. Two years ago he was very much in charge."
[On July 3, Mr. Mugabe announced that he was abolishing seven Cabinet positions. Some of the Cabinet departments will be closed and others melded into existing departments, he said. It was a step that international donors, eager for Zimbabwe to reduce the size of its civil service, had been demanding for two years].
 
Early Hopes Eroded
 When Mr. Mugabe became Zimbabwe's first leader in 1980, he was bequeathed a country in a different league from most of Africa's economic crisis cases. Industry, agriculture and a relatively sophisticated transportation network had been developed in the white-ruled Rhodesia of Prime Minister Ian D. Smith.
Indeed, it is the promising start that is causing much of the disappointment now. "With what we inherited, the economy in Zimbabwe could have done much better," said A. Abner Botsch, a prominent businessman and former head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Internationally, Mr. Mugabe was given high marks for encouraging the white large-scale farmers to stay and at the same time developing broader education and health services for poor black Zimbabweans than were available in most other African countries.
Jesuit-educated and the holder of several university degrees, including two law degrees from the University of London, Mr. Mugabe mixes easily with admirers, white and black, in New York and London.
 
A Mixed Reputation
 Unlike most of his colleagues on the continent, Mr. Mugabe has not been seen as personally corrupt. The same cannot be said of many of his ministers. And he does indulge in an opulent headquarters for ZANU, his political party, and demands an airport reception by traditional dancers when he arrives home from overseas.
He has long espoused socialist principles; civil servants must still call one another comrade. But Mr. Mugabe officially abandoned his commitment to socialism at the end of 1990 when he accepted World Bank and International Monetary Fund programs to get new infusions of cash into the economy.
In a speech to Parliament in late June, Mr. Mugabe promised to carry out the World Bank programs -- mostly by creating a more competitive economy -- despite the drought. But so far the Government has been slow in changing the economy.
"The Government could have avoided half the total food import with better policies," said John Robertson, the chief economist of the First Merchant Bank in Harare.
 
The Corn Shortage
 In the last several years, Mr. Robertson said, the Government decided to pay a low price to farmers who grew corn, the staple crop. This meant that the large-scale farmers switched to other crops and the Government had to rely on the small peasant farmers, who live on less fertile land.
Relying on this less certain source for corn, the Government, expecting the usual rainfall in January and February, sold its entire corn reserves by last December, Mr. Robertson said.
But instead of rain, record high temperatures swept across southern Africa, causing the worst drought in this century. If the Government had not sold the reserves, it would have had to start importing grain only now instead of in April, economists say.
As ordinary Zimbabweans find food hard to get, there are increasing complaints about corruption at the top of Government as well as among lesser bureaucrats.
 
Corruption as Disincentive
 Mr. Mugabe's Minister for the Public Service, Eddison Zvobgo, acknowledged recently that there was a "high incidence" of corruption in Government and that the civil service was "wrought with bribery, patronage, embezzlement and extortion."
Business executives say that the scale of corruption has not reached the levels found in Nigeria and Kenya but that it remains a barrier to badly needed foreign investment. The Canadian High Commissioner, Charles Bassett, recently warned that corruption was discouraging investment.
In contrast to the diversifying political activity in other African countries, the organized opposition here is so far muted, largely because dissatisfaction has only gathered steam in the past two years.
 
Opposition Emerges
 A new political group, the Forum for Democratic Reform, emerged in May, led by lawyers and business executives, both black and white. So far, many Zimbabweans say, the group has too many whites to be credible. But it is bringing issues into the open by calling for a market economy, a more limited presidential tenure than the current six years and the re-establishment of the upper house of Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe lashed out at the Forum recently, saying he would not make way for "Ian Smith's people." He was aware, he said, of opposition groups with ambitions "based on false calculations that they can raise little armies," adding, "We will not let those ambitions take effect."
The whites in the Forum are liberals who opposed Mr. Smith and favored black majority rule.
Perhaps a more significant call for change came from the Roman Catholic Church. Its magazine, Moto, ran an article on Mr. Mugabe in May headlined "Time To Go, Comrade Mugabe."
A general election is not scheduled until 1995. By then, when Mr. Mugabe will be nearing 70, there will be an organized opposition, Mr. Chambati, the former Ambassador, said. "The only way this Government can successfully forestall a credible opposition is to deliver the goods," he said.

HEADLINE: Jordan Starts Enforcing Sanctions On Iraqi Trade and Exports of Oil

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, July 9

 BODY:
The Jordanian Government, which has permitted Iraq to export oil and import goods across its border in violation of the United Nations embargo, appears to have ended this trade in the past week, according to Western officials who monitor the traffic.
The decision by Jordan to stop the flow of oil and other goods across the border will further isolate President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and increase the strains on the Iraqi economy. 
The move is seen by many Western diplomats as one more step in a concerted effort by the Bush Administration to topple the Iraqi leader by the end of the year. "Jordan is the Iraqi lifeline," said a European diplomat, "and if the Jordanians are really serious about this, it will be a big blow."
 
We're Trying, King Says
 Jordanian officials, who have always maintained that they were complying with the United Nations sanctions, said there was no change in policy. "We've tried our best to adhere to these sanctions and implement them," King Hussein said in an interview Tuesday.
But a recent United States estimate said that up to 30 percent of the cargo crossing into Iraq from Jordan violated the embargo. Some smuggling also occurs across Iraq's borders with Turkey and Syria, but the quantity is negligible, these officials said.
The end of the illegal traffic was confirmed by shipping agents in Amman. "The clamp-down happened about a week ago," said Tawfik Qawar, the president of Amin Qawar & Sons, one of the largest shipping agencies in Jordan. "As long as it is foodstuffs or medicines, it can go into Iraq, but anything else is not allowed."
If the sanctions are tightened up, this will help ease the strain between King Hussein and the Bush Administration, which believes that the Jordanian monarch reneged on a promise he made in March at a White House meeting with President Bush.
In a display of Washington's pique with Jordan, the Pentagon last month canceled joint military exercises and slowed military aid to Amman.
The decision to tighten border controls was a result of intense lobbying by United States officials, including the Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates, who met with King Hussein three weeks ago in Amman, officials here said.
United States officials at first asked the King to place up to 50 United Nations inspectors in the Red Sea port of Aqaba to turn back Iraq-bound cargo, according to diplomats and Jordanian officials.
 
Jordan Rejected Monitors
 But the plan was angrily rebuffed by the King, who said the proposal violated Jordanian sovereignty. "We will not be treated as suspects who are in need of observations and supervision," King Hussein said of the proposal in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press.
Despite the King's denunciation of the plan, however, the Government ordered customs officials a week ago to tighten border controls, Jordanian officials said.
Western officials also contend that the Jordanians have offered to cooperate in a campaign to oust the Iraqi leader, although it was not clear what this cooperation would entail. Since last year, the C.I.A. has been authorized to step up efforts to destabilize the Baghdad Government, including making covert contact with Iraqi citizens and Government officials.
"The Jordanians have come to realize that Saddam Hussein will not last forever and they had better get back in the good graces of the Persian Gulf states and the West," said one Arab diplomat. "They straddled the fence as long as they could."

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 9

 BODY:
Following are excerpts, as transcribed by Reuters, from the news conference today at which Gov. Bill Clinton presented his running mate, Senator Al Gore.
 
CLINTON'S REMARKS
 Several weeks ago, when I named Warren Christopher, Madeleine Kunin and Vernon Jordan to head a team to recommend a Vice-Presidential running mate, I asked them to look for a candidate who met three tests. I said I wanted a Vice President who really understood what had happened to ordinary Americans in the last 12 years, someone who was committed to making government work again for average, hard-working American families. 
 I said I wanted a Vice President who would complement me and my own experiences and bring other experiences, knowledge and understanding to our common endeavor.
And above all, I said I wanted a Vice President who would be ready, should something happen to me, to immediately assume the office of President of the United States.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The running mate I have chosen is a leader of great strength, integrity and stature, a father who, like me, loves his children and shares my hunger to turn this economy around, to change our country, and to do it so that we don't raise the first generation of children to do worse than their parents.
The man standing beside me today has what it takes to lead this nation from the day we take office -- Senator Al Gore of Tennessee.
Throughout his public life, Al Gore has done what I've tried to do here in Arkansas. He's put government back on the side of ordinary men and women. Time and again he's stood up to powerful interests, to put people first. He's fought for health care and consumer protection. He is perhaps America's leading proponent of the development of new technologies like fiber optics and biotechnology to create the high-wage jobs America needs to move into the 21st century.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Al Gore has spent the last decade working on the global environmental challenges we desperately need to address: global warming, ozone depletion, energy conservation. He has written a magnificent book on his thoughts and recommendations. He has asked me to join in his commitment to preserve not only the environment of America but to preserve the environment of our globe for future generations, and together we will finally give the United States a real environmental Presidency.
Al Gore is a leading expert in foreign policy, national security and arms control. He supported the use of American force to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. And when the gulf war was over, Al Gore did himself even more credit by being the one who took George Bush to task for abandoning the Kurds, and shaming the Republicans for trying to use patriotism as a political issue.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In the end Al Gore and I understand what this election is really all about -- the end of years of drift and division and denial, the beginning of an honest attempt to rebuild and reunite, and to renew this great nation, not just for ourselves but for our children and for our children's children.
 
GORE'S REMARKS
 I can tell you truthfully, I didn't seek this. And up until very recently when I began to get an inkling that I would get the call that came late last night, I didn't expect it.
But I'm here for one simple reason: I love my country.
And I believe in my heart that this ticket gives our country the best chance for the change we so desperately need -- to move forward again.
I'm proud to stand here with Bill Clinton at the beginning of a long, hard fight on behalf of the hard-working people of the United States of America. We have watched for 12 long years as the Republican Administration still in power has driven this country into the ditch. The time has come for all Americans to get off the sidelines, to get involved in the process, to be a part of the healing this country needs, to bring us together, not divide us one from another, to get to work on the changes for the average working people of this country.
 
'They've Run Out of Ideas'
 The time has come. Throughout American history, each generation has passed on leadership to the next. That time has come again -- the time for a new generation of leadership for the United States of America.
I believe very deeply that this nation simply cannot afford another four years of the kind of leadership that we have now. They've run out of ideas. They've run out energy. They've run out of the ability to inspire our people.
One of my greatest hopes as I join this ticket is to help Bill Clinton in his dramatic effort to lift the public dialogue so that we can make this campaign a national conversation about America's future, so that we can present to the American people ideas, choices, a sensible plan for getting our country moving in the right direction again.
Bill Clinton has for his entire career stood for that kind of responsible change, to improve the lives of the average people in Arkansas and in this country. I want to be a part of that effort.
I know from conversations that the two of us have had, that Bill Clinton is speaking from his heart when he says here, as he did just a few minutes ago, that together we can make all the difference in determining whether or not the United States of America will offer the leadership our world needs to save the earth's environment. We're in a race against time. That leadership is critical and it can't wait four years or eight years. It can't wait any longer than November.
We're going to make that change for the earth's environment and for the people of this country. The Republican Administration has been trying to divide us for too long. They claim to be pro-family, but when we pass legislation for the people of this country which gives mothers and fathers a chance to have a little time off from work when a child is seriously injured, or when a child is first born, the Bush-Quayle Administration vetoes it because they're afraid that it's going to cost money to the wealthy and powerful in this country.

 	 	 		. . .	 	When the Democratic Congress passes an idea that Bill Clinton advanced, to give a tax credit for working families with children, to make it possible for families to stay together, for families to be able to give their children the kind of upbringing that they need, the Bush-Quayle Administration vetoes that legislation and still tries to describe itself as pro-family.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I come from Carthage, Tenn. I've never been to Hope, Ark. But I'm told that it's just like Carthage in one respect: it's a place where people know about it when you're born and care about it when you die.
That's the America Bill Clinton and I grew up in, and when we elect Bill Clinton President, that's the kind of nation we will once again become.

HEADLINE: Convention Costs Keep Going Up and Away

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Three days before the Democratic National Convention opens, the costly reality of putting on a show in New York City has sunk in.
The bid for blowing up the balloons that will be dropped from the ceiling in Madison Square Garden was $30,000 -- 50 cents a balloon -- so the Democrats recruited 50 volunteers to get the job done for nothing. 
 New York Telephone is demanding an advance payment of $600 for each telephone line it installs at the Garden, more than twice the price being charged in Houston, where the Republicans will hold their convention next month.
 
Expensive Cable>
 Estimates for the cost of laying cable for the radio and television networks that have to broadcast from an office building across from the Garden range from $2 a foot to $5 a foot. In Houston, the cost is 20 cents a foot.
To the Democrats, the convention is an all-out show for the media, but many in the media are grumbling.
Upset by unforseen costs and the Garden's complicated work rules, which delayed the installation of equipment, some Democratic officials are worried that logistics, not post-prime-time speechmaking or backroom politicking, will alienate producers and correspondents who should be pampered. The Democrats' concern is that behind-the-scene snafus will keep the party from taking advantage of the convention as a weeklong showcase, a coast-to-coast chance to spread their message -- and get on television -- without having to spend money for the exposure.
Already, the convention is exacting a price in psychic energy. Caffeine and long nights have become a staple for broadcast technicians and their bosses even before the opening gavel on Monday. In part this reflects the new realities of broadcasting: satellite technology has made it possible for local stations to send correspondents to national events like conventions. That means more hookups, and potentially more confusion, than in the days when conventions were the virtually exclusive province of only three networks.
"It's the unions," said one television producer for a group of stations who insisted on anonymity, adding that she was worried that angry technicians might snip a cable and cripple her operation if she was quoted by name. "This isn't Eugene V. Debs organizing garment workers in the 1930's. This is big business. These are people making good money, looking for a lot more."
Producers say some of their headaches at the Garden involve questions about union jurisdictions. There were meetings about whether the Garden's electricians could pull cables from the Garden across 33d Street. The answer was no. Other electricians had to be called in.
Some producers also said they had been given stratospheric estimates for the work they needed done. One television producer said the quote for labor on a cable-laying job was $49,000. After some bargaining, the figure was reduced to $6,000.
 
That New York Attitude
 But not all the complaints have to do with work rules and jurisdictions. In the temporary newsrooms set up near the Garden, budget-conscious network officials are complaining about being charged $3 a square foot for space. In Houston, they say, they will be given work inside the Astrodome at no charge.
"Just to have the freight moved in cost a couple of thousand," said Norb Gallery, the election technical director for National Public Radio, referring to trunks filled with tape decks, amplifiers and computers that were shipped from Washington.
The age-old New York attitude -- "You want the job done? It's going to cost you" -- has been compounded by a recession that has hit the construction trades especially hard, making construction companies and the craftsmen who work for them unusually eager for work. Even though they have a long history as the party of organized labor, the Democrats came to town hoping for a break.
"We expected more assistance" in making deals that did not bust budgets, said one Democratic official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Part of it is City Hall is unwilling or unable to exert pressure to make things happen."
 
17 Unions Involved
 High-ranking city officials worked last week to settle the dispute over electricity to television trailers parked outside the Garden. But some of the snags are tied to the sheer complexity of the Garden as a convention site. The Garden has contracts with 17 unions, from stagehands to projectionists, although fewer than 10 are involved in this event.
"Sometimes because things seem to be confusing -- who takes a cable from point A to point B and from point B to point C -- that gets exaggerated to a general problem, which is not the case," said Robert Russo, the Garden's senior vice-president and general manager. "Things cost, but not just here."
Mr. Russo defended the way the work had been managed, particularly the Garden's efforts to hold down overtime. "We've oversupervised, probably," Mr. Russo said. "We've been supervising it and the city is supervising it and the D.N.C.C. is on site, to keep the hours down." The D.N.C.C. is the Democratic National Convention Committee.
With or without overtime, some producers are worried about an uncertain bottom line. "We haven't a clue" about the cost of cable, said Ray Conover, the vice president and director of engineering for Conus, a national news cooperative based in Minneapolis. "It's changed every day since we've been here."
As for telephones, New York Telephone says part of the $600 advance payment covers the regular business installation rate, $150 a line. But the company is adding a one-time special-event charge of $207 a line, $9 less than the comparable charge for the 1980 convention. The rest goes toward the calls made.
"It's expensive to put in, then take it all out four days later," said Steven Marcus, a New York Telephone spokesman.
Some media executives came to the same conclusion and decided to set up shop elsewhere. Congressional Quarterly, which is publishing a daily newspaper for delegates in with International Medial Partners Inc., rented a room in the Hotel Macklowe on West 44th Street after estimates for its costs at the Garden came in.
"I think there was a certain price gamesmanship going on" at the Garden, said Robert W. Merry, the executive editor. "I didn't want to play."

HEADLINE: Plant Expansion Project Near Swamp Is Criticized

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHATHAM, N.J., July 6

 BODY:
Morris County conservationists are calling it the Second Battle of the Great Swamp, and as with so many sequels, the issues are not as clear cut as they were the first time around.
The fight, specifically, is over a request by the Township of Chatham to upgrade the capacity of its sewage-treatment plant, a move that would allow a developer to build a million square feet of prime office space, which would in turn generate millions of tax dollars for the township and school district. Opponents of the plan say it would pour unmanageable amounts of water into the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, 8,000 acres of burbling, chirping and croaking nature less than 20 miles from the unnatural chaos of Manhattan. 
 More broadly, the fight represents the new reality of the old tussle between development and conservation in suburbia. Instead of the sweep of earlier fights like the one over a Port Authority plan to build a new international airport where the swamp was located, or the plan to flood the Delaware Water Gap with a dam at Tocks Island, or the proposal to build an airport for Philadelphia in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, many of today's environmental battles tend instead to be drawn out arguments over fractions of an inch of this, or so many parts per million of that.
"In a sense, we've settled a lot of the big issues," said John Weingart, assistant commissioner for environmental regulation for the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy and the man to whom the issue may come for a final administrative decision. "Now when we have debates over the environment versus the economy, people say it's a stupid question -- of course we have to protect the environment. But we still have to decide where we draw the line."
Chatham Township has already spent $7 million to upgrade its sewage treatment plant and to enlarge its capacity by 33 percent, from 750,000 gallons per day to 1 million gallons per day. Now it is seeking permission of the Department of Environmental Protection to use the extra capacity, which will be the subject of a hearing July 23 in Chatham. A decision will not come before the end of September.
 
More Dollars or More Water?
 If the township wins approval to use the capacity, the Prudential Life Insurance Company will proceed with its plans to expand its big Giralda Farms office campus development from adjoining Madison Township into Chatham Township. And it will pay the township $4 million toward the cost of expanding the plant and $2.5 million to help the township meet state requirements to provide affordable housing.
But a rising groundwater-table level in the Great Swamp is already forcing people who live nearby to build septic systems above ground, under odd-looking mounds the size of tennis courts. And opponents of the township's plan maintain that putting more water into the swamp and more traffic on the surrounding roads would make things worse.
"The Great Swamp is like a giant bathtub that can only let so much water out at the end," said Helen Fenske, until two years ago the deputy commissioner for natural resources at the Environmental Protection Department and, as a resident of Green Village, at the edge of the swamp in Chatham Township, a leader of the opposition.
"So where does it go?" she said. "It goes into my basement, it's where my husband can't garden any more, it's in my neighbor's septic system that doesn't work any more."
Prudential says the added water flow into the Great Swamp would amount to less than one-half of 1 percent of the annual flow, and elaborate measures would be taken to keep runoff from roofs and roadways from polluting the wetlands.
 
Issue Less Clear Cut
 It took Morris County residents just two years to win the first Battle of the Great Swamp, when they routed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which wanted to pave over the wilderness, along with several hundred houses, for a new international airport. The fight over Chatham's sewage-treatment-plant expansion has been going on for at least four years, with studies, commission meetings, hearings and yet more studies, the most recent of which concluded that, to determine the impact of the sewage-plant expansion on the swamp, another study was needed.
Defenders of the development plan maintain that the environmentalists are disappointed that no clear-cut environmental threat to the Great Swamp could be pinpointed in a study that was released in January by the Great Swamp Watershed Advisory Committee, a 30-member panel set up by the Department of Environmental Protection.
"We do not want to antagonize the D.E.P. or anyone else, but to date we have not been able to see any adverse results from this plan," said Ken Hetrick, the Chatham township manager, who represents his town on the advisory committee. "People will say there would be adverse effects, but they are so minor that we don't really think they are valid."
Opponents like Mrs. Fenske concede that there was no clear-cut harmful impact that could be identified in any of the studies, but they insist that the degradation of natural spaces occurs in small increments as well as by major disruptions. For example, few of the houses in the surrounding townships are connected to sewers, said Sally Dudley, a Harding Township Committee member and a leader in the state environmental movement. With more and more septic systems leaching into the groundwater, the addition of a new source of water, even when treated to the right cleanliness, only adds to the swamp's rising waters, she said.
 
Little Bit May Mean Much
 Added car traffic from the Prudential development would mean dirtier runoff from more crowded streets and more air contamination to settle on the soupy waters of the swamp, opponents say. The tributary streams to the swamp are weed-choked where they used to be free running, and the swamp itself is increasingly clogged with growth from nutrients washed in from fertilized lawns and from treated sewer water.
So Mrs. Fenske bristles when she is asked if the fight is not, after all, just about keeping newcomers out of a tranquil, upscale enclave.
"That question really disturbs me," she replied. "I really care about the public land, and the question is, do we protect it for us and for our children, or do we just protect it by itself, and say anything goes in the area around it?"

HEADLINE: New Unemployment Claims Drop for 2d Straight Week

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits shrank by 4,000 in late June, the Government said today. It was the second straight weekly decline.
"It's consistent with other data that the economy has lost some of its earlier momentum, but keeps moving higher," said Robert G. Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. 
 The number of first-time applications for jobless benefits totaled 416,000 during the week that ended on June 27, down from 420,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department reported.
After ranging in the 450,000 level during the winter, new claims for unemployment benefits dropped below 410,000 for much of the spring before jumping to 421,000 during the week of June 13.
 
Four-Week Average Climbs
 But despite the back-to-back declines in the two weeks that followed, the four-week moving average of new claims climbed to 415,750 during the period that ended on June 27, up from 414,000 a week earlier and the highest since it reached 427,250 during the period that ended on April 11.
Because of the volatility of the weekly applications, analysts often prefer to track the four-week average to discern trends.
Still, Mr. Dederick said, the back-to-back drops in weekly claims were more "consistent with small gains in nonfarm payrolls" than with the June unemployment report.
The department reported last week that the unemployment rate in June had jumped to 7.8 percent, from 7.5 percent the month before. The June figure was the highest monthly rate in eight years.
Most economists expect little job creation until there is noticeable improvement in the economy. Until then, employers are expected to rely on overtime to meet any increase in demand, rather than hire new workers.
The largest increases in benefit claims were recorded in Massachusetts, up 5,084; New Jersey, 2,917; New York, 2,500; Virginia, 1,650, and Michigan, 1,512.
The largest drops were reported by North Carolina, down 3,300; Pennsylvania, 2,952; Minnesota, 2,151; Texas, 1,452, and Wisconsin, 1,417.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies, but Many Discount Technical Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday in an active, technically driven rally. But many traders said they expected the gains to be short-lived.
The dollar rallied early in the day after the French Economics Minister, Michel Sapin, said France and the United States had agreed that the dollar had fallen far enough. 
 The dollar kept its strength despite reports that members of Germany's Bundesbank were comfortable with the German mark's rise in value.
Scott Cozzens, treasury officer for Chemical Bank's foreign exchange unit, said the German and French comments forced traders who had bet on a dollar decline to buy dollars to cover their losses. That had the technical effect of raising the dollar's value even more.
Earl Johnson, vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said the technical rally did not mask the fundamental problems facing the dollar. It is burdened by a weak United States economy, an uncertain Presidential race, and unfavorable comparisons with higher interest rates in other countries, Mr. Johnson said.
"As far as I'm concerned, the sentiment still is very bearish for the dollar," Mr. Johnson said.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 124.57 Japanese yen, from 124 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, it rose to 125.65 yen. At closing in New York, the dollar fetched 125.60 yen, up from 124.70 yen late Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8960, from $1.9190 late Wednesday. At closing in New York, sterling fetched $1.9000, less expensive than $1.9300 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday rates, included: 1.5130 marks, up from 1.4885; 1.3670 Swiss francs, up from 1.3415; 5.1035 French francs, up from 5.0160; 1,144.00 Italian lire, up from 1,124.25, and 1.19125 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19155.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.5165 marks, up from 1.4965; 1.3720 Swiss francs, up from 1.3475; 5.1130 French francs, up from 5.0412; 1.7095 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6865; 1,147.25 Italian lire, up from 1,130, and 1.1933 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1912.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Rises as Uncertainty Over Currencies Continues

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Gold prices rose yesterday as the wild fluctuations of foreign exchange markets highlighted gold's role as a safe haven in times of uncertainties.
On New York's Commodity Exchange, August gold ended up $1.00 at $349.40 an ounce, near the session's high of $349.50. 
 "I think gold is supported by general concerns over the choppiness of foreign exchange trade," said William O'Neill at Merrill Lynch.
Foreign exchange trading has been chaotic in the last week, with the dollar tumbling to a 17-month low against the German mark after Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Washington was not worried about its falling currency.
 
Silver in Technical Rebound
 Silver rose in a technical rebound from Tuesday's free fall on reports that Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank had sold millions of ounces of silver.
The sale of silver, which traders estimated at 6 million to 20 million ounces, drove July silver on the Commodity Exchange to $3.873 an ounce on Tuesday, its lowest since December. The July contract ended at $3.926 an ounce, up 4.3 cents from Wednesday's close.
"It appears to have been a one-time sale, and people are relieved that the market was able to absorb it all," said George Nickas at Geldermann Inc.
He said traders were still uneasy about the outlook for silver.
"The value-minded traders who usually buy after big price falls aren't convinced that the selloff in silver has leveled off," Mr. Nickas said.
Analysts said the market reflected uncertainty about the economy. Silver is widely used by the electrical and photographic industries, and a weak recovery from the recession could cripple demand.
Some analysts expect silver to return soon to $4 an ounce, a former psychological level.
Oil prices finished mixed.
Light sweet crude for delivery in August settled at $21.40 a barrel, down 1 cent from Wednesday, at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices for delivery in later months were slightly higher.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans fell on reports that growing conditions may be ideal for the crop. Weather forecasts called for rain this weekend in the Midwest growing states, which would benefit the maturing soybean crop, trade sources said.
July soybeans closed 5 cents lower at $5.6975 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Eric Sevareid, 79, Is Dead; Commentator and Reporter

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
Eric Sevareid, a radio and television correspondent who became one of the country's most respected reporters and commentators, died yesterday at his home in Washington. He was 79 years old.
He died of stomach cancer, said a spokesman for CBS. 
 Mr. Sevareid, who was recruited as a CBS News correspondent by Edward R. Murrow when both men were covering the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939, wrote elegant commentaries that he delivered in grave and sonorous tones, even when he was being caustically witty. Like Mr. Murrow, Mr. Sevareid was tall with rugged good looks that served him well during the transition from radio to television.
His writing ability and experience, combined with an ability to project a sense of fairness and sound judgment, brought him the respect of his peers and audiences, allowed Mr. Sevareid the right to introduce analysis and even opinion into his broadcasts. Among his colleagues, he was considered a journalist above the daily battle for news who had a scholarly mien and a knowledge of the American past to his choice of words.
Mr. Sevareid took outspoken positions in favor of civil and constitutional rights on the air and in writing. During the Vietnam War, Mr. Sevareid traveled to South Vietnam in 1966 and, in a special broadcast, clearly indicated that prolonging the war was unwise and that a negotiated peace was desirable.
In his long career, he worked in several European and South American countries and in Washington and New York. He became nationally known for breaking through the strictures of straight-news reporting by pioneering editorial analysis on prime-time television.
Mr. Sevareid defined himself as a cultural conservative and a political liberal. "I find myself politically liberal on domestic affairs and increasingly conservative on foreign affairs," he wrote in 1964 in the introduction to his book "This Is Eric Sevareid." He worried a good deal about America's sense of direction. "The hour may be too late for a high civilization," he said. "We are frightened to think that the very rich grow richer, the very poor poorer, the dark-skinned more violent, our cities simultaneously more crowded and more desolate, our countryside more ugly."
His was an adventurous life, which included a harrowing month among headhunters in the Burmese jungles. That was in 1943, after the plane in which he was riding developed engine trouble as it was flying over the Himalayas from India to China. Mr. Sevareid and 19 others had to bail out on the India-Burma border but made it out of the jungle on foot.
 
Saw Himself as a Writer
 Even at the height of his fame as a television correspondent, when his appearance and stature drew movie offers and invitations to do lucrative commercials -- which he declined -- Mr. Sevareid told friends that he always considered himself primarily a writer, not a performer. He wrote dozens of magazine articles, a syndicated newspaper column and half a dozen books.
"This is the age of the journalist more than the age of the artist, the teacher or the pastor," he once said. "It is the age of nonfiction because imagination cannot keep up with the fantastic daily realities."
Mr. Severeid's best-known book, "Not So Wild a Dream," was first published in 1946 after his years of war reporting. The autobiography covered his boyhood in the Dakotas, journey by canoe through Canada to Hudson Bay, wanderings among hoboes, apprenticeship as a newspaper reporter in Minneapolis and his adventures in wartime. He never forgot witnessing the terror of Nazism and anti-Semitism in Germany. The book went through 11 printings over the next 28 years and became a reference book for historians and other students of the Depression and war years.
 
'The Concept of Citizen'
 "It was a lucky stroke of timing to have been born and to have lived as an American in this last generation," he wrote in 1976 for a new edition of the book. "It was good fortune to be a journalist in Washington, now the greatest single news headquarters in the world since ancient Rome. But we are not Rome; the world is too big, too varied. The 'American Century' concept of Henry Luce was an absurdity, too. We were not born to be imperialists; we never learned the style, and the time for this is gone. We understand the concept of citizen, not that of subject."
As an essayist who used journalism as the springboard for his idealism, he wrote: "Travels in all the continents have not lessened my love and respect for America, but deepened both, in spite of the distressing spread of our vulgarities. There is a civilization of the heart, too, and the goodness in Americans, the evangelical strain, has not disappeared. We have often been innocents abroad and at time have done unintended harm, but no other great power has the confidence and stability to expose and face its own blunders. We are a turbulent society but a stable republic."
Arnold Eric Sevareid was born to parents of Norwegian heritage on Nov. 26, 1912, in Velva, N.D. He spent his first years on the prairie wheatlands, but when drought struck in the 1920's, the family moved to Minneapolis.
After graduating from Minneapolis Central High School in 1930, he and a friend embarked on a 2,200-mile canoe trip from Minneapolis to Hudson Bay, to prove that it was possible to make such a trip through the continent's heartland entirely by water. He used his experiences as the basis for his first book, "Canoeing With the Cree" (1935).
At the age of 18, Mr. Sevareid worked as a copy boy and reporter for The Minneapolis Journal while attending the University of Minnesota. After being laid off from his reporting job in 1936, he and his first wife, the former Lois Finger, sailed for Europe. He studied political science at the London School of Economics, then attended the Alliance Francaise in Paris.
 
Europe During World War II
 In 1938, he was hired by the Paris edition of The New York Herald Tribune and soon became its night city editor. At the same time, he worked in the Paris bureau of United Press, the wire service.
In August 1939, only weeks before the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Murrow called him from London and asked if he wanted to try radio reporting. "I don't know very much about your experience," Mr. Murrow said, "but I like the way you write and I like your ideas."
Thus, Mr. Sevareid became one of "Murrow's Boys," who would enable CBS to dominate radio news for many years. He joined a group of former newspapermen turned CBS correspondents that was to include William L. Shirer, Charles Collingwood, Alexander Kendrick, Howard K. Smith, David Schoenbrun, Daniel Schorr and Richard C. Hottelet.
 
Last to Broadcast From Paris
 Mr. Sevareid covered the French Army and Air Force in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and he was the last American to broadcast from Paris. He fled the city with his wife and their infant sons just before the Nazis marched in. At Bordeaux, he broadcast the news that France was about to surrender. Then Mr. Sevareid joined Mr. Murrow in London for broadcasts during the Battle of Britain bombing raids.
Assigned to the CBS Washington bureau after his return to the United States in late 1940, Mr. Sevareid covered President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the war effort. Feeling restive at home while the war was still on, however, he headed for the China-Burma-India theater in 1943.
Back in Europe in 1944, Mr. Sevareid covered the campaign in Italy and Marshal Tito's partisans in Yugoslavia, landed with the first wave of Americans in southern France and accompanied them across the Rhine into Germany.
His postwar assignments included Washington, France, Germany and Britain. In 1964, he became a roving correspondent based in Washington; his commentaries were regularly featured on the "CBS Evening News With Walter Cronkite" until 1977, when Mr. Sevareid reached the company's mandatory retirement age of 65. His last appearance on a CBS News program was in "Remember Pearl Harbor," which was broadcast on Dec. 7, 1991.
 
'Passion and Beauty'
 Walter Cronkite recently commented that he regarded Mr. Sevareid as "a master of the extemporaneous essay," citing Mr. Sevareid's performance when he first covered a space flight. "I remember that he was skeptical of manned space flights until he witnessed his first moon launching," Mr. Cronkite said. "Then he turned to the camera as the rocket disappeared into the stratosphere and delivered a totally spontaneous tribute to the astronauts and the technical successes on which they rode, a tribute that was a lovely ode of passion and beauty."
Charles Kuralt, the anchor of "Sunday Morning" on CBS, said: "Eric was the best thinker and writer who ever sat down to a microphone. He was the one giant tree in the forest. He stood alone."
Mr. Sevareid's books included "In One Ear" (1952) and "Small Sounds in the Night" (1956), which are collections of his magazine and newspaper articles and CBS broadcasts. He once wrote of himself: "I am cursed with a somewhat forbidding Scandinavian manner, with a restraint that spells stuffiness to a lot of people. But . . . inside I am mush, full of a lot of almost bathetic sentimentality about this country, the Midwest, Abraham Lincoln and the English language."
 
Article Cited for Its 'Terrific Impact'
 He had a long conversation with Adlai E. Stevenson, the United Nations Ambassador, two days before Mr. Stevenson's death in July 1965. An article based on that conversation, which was published in the Nov. 30, 1965, issue of Look magazine, won the New York Newspaper Guild's Page One Award, citing Mr. Sevareid's "excellent writing" and the piece's "terrific impact on the United States and the world."
In retirement, at his home in Washington or at his weekend cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, Mr. Sevareid wrote, read and fished.
He is survived by his wife, Suzanne St. Pierre, a former producer for the CBS News broadcast "60 Minutes"; three children from two previous marriages, which ended in divorce, and six grandchildren. His two sons, Peter, of Swarthmore, Pa., and Michael, of Mount Joy, Pa., were born during his first marriage to the former Miss Finger, and his daughter, Cristina Kennedy, of Frederick, Md., was born during his second marriage, to Belen Marshall. Services will be private and a memorial is being planned in September in Washington.

Examining the Appeal Of David Duke's Oratory

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"Backlash: Race and the American Dream" was evidently made while David Duke, the Louisiana politician best known as a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, still seemed to be a formidable figure in the 1992 Presidential campaign. But even after the collapse of his candidacy, concern over his appeal lingers. So tonight's hourlong documentary is by no means out of date.
Clips from speeches and interviews show that Mr. Duke has tidied up his prose since the days when he wore the sheet and peddled Nazi pamphlets. But you don't have to be a historian to detect the nativist strains meant to incite white working-class Americans who have been hurt by the recession. 
 The Duke supporters interviewed here deny hating any group and direct their animus instead at Government programs, especially affirmative action. Workers on an oil rig tell of experienced whites losing jobs or promotions to untried blacks. An us-versus-them spirit predominates. "What more can we do for them?" is the refrain.
The program, made in Louisiana, comes together well, without the glue of narration. Pictures of cross-burnings and clips of Southern politicians of the 1950's in the throes of segregationist rodomontade establish Mr. Duke's roots. The only distraction here is a musical accompaniment that goes in for exclamatory clangs to punctuate racist statements.
Mr. Duke's support is said to be mainly among younger whites with incomes of $15,000 to $35,000 a year who are having trouble getting by. One of the historians on hand notes that such feelings of being kept down by what a Duke supporter calls "the unseen enemy" have in the past been directed against both the rich and the poor. This time, he adds, "The have-littles are turning on the have-nots." All present agree that the plausible-sounding Mr. Duke is focusing the free-flowing anger onto the black poor, whom he portrays as criminals and incorrigibly idle producers of illegitimate children.
His admirers seem to be longing for a return to what their man calls "traditional American western Christian values." Slogans of "white pride" are heard. As the historians note, the phenomenon is far from new, but these days those who would probably have been part of the white supremacy mobs 40 years ago tend to say, as one does tonight, "I hope I don't sound like a racist." And that must be accounted a sort of progress after all.
 
'National Audubon Society Specials'
PBS, Tuesdays at 9 P.M.
(Channel 13, New York, Saturdays at 7 P.M.)
The subjects of the Audubon Society's eight-program summer series are familiar; indeed, several of the documentaries have already been shown either on public television or on cable. But the hosts are even more familiar: Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, James Earl Jones, Michael Douglas and other actors.
Tomorrow night you can see Ms. Fonda express her concern for what is being done to "Mysterious Elephants of the Congo" by African ivory poachers and American consumers. In two weeks she will express her concern about environmental problems in the Great Plains. Also coming up: Mr. Jones and the Great Lakes, Mr. Douglas and the dolphin, Mr. Redford and the grizzly bear. The smog of virtue can become a little thick, but the photography is as sharp as ever.
 
'Brit Coms'
Channel 21, New York, Fridays at 8 P.M.
Fans of British sitcoms are herewith alerted to the weekly assortment strung together by Long Island's public station. Hilarity does not reign steadily through the evening -- it's more like an occasional shower -- but the English-style nuttiness can be engaging even when the shows are as dumb as any domestic product.
For viewers like me, with a weakness for music-hall madness, the funniest of them is "The Black Adder II," with Rowland Atkinson as the nastiest nobleman in the court of Queen Elizabeth I; the characters are dim, the punch lines are broad and low, the spirit is implacably irreverent. For more sedate tastes, Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, who made a hit out of "To the Manor Born," are together again as a married team of book publishers in "Executive Stress"; no socko gags here, just the pleasure of seeing pros at work in a fairly sensible setting. And, in the interests of Anglo-American inanity, Anne Bancroft shows up as a transplanted American actress in "Freddie and Max." She seems to be having a jolly time.
 
'The Firing Line'
PBS
(Channel 13, New York, Saturdays at 10 A.M.)
William Buckley addresses the questions "Reunification in Korea: Is It Possible? Is It Probable?" in tomorrow's segment of a four-part series about that troublesome land. Kicking them around with him is Kim Kyung-Won, a former Ambassador to Washington from South Korea, who is not optimistic about any opening up of North Korea. In August Mr. Buckley moves on to Taiwan.

A Rembrandt Leads
The priciest painting in this summer's round of Impressionist, modern, contemporary and Old Master sales in London may be Rembrandt's "Portrait of Johannes Uytten bogaert," which was sold at Sotheby's on Wednesday for $7.94 million to Alfred Bader, a collector from Milwaukee.
That an Old Master painting fetched significantly more than any Impressionist work is not surprising these days. In fact, compared with Canaletto's "Old Horse Guards, London, From St. James's Park," which was sold at Christie's in April to the composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for $17.7 million, and Titian's "Venus and Adonis," which fetched $13.4 million at Christie's in London in December, the sum is quite small. Nonetheless, it exceeded Sotheby's $5 million estimate. "We were very happy," said Julian Stock, who heads Sotheby's Old Masters department in London. The painting belonged to the Earl of Rosebery, whose family had owned it since the 1860's. 
 "It's the same old story," Mr. Stock added. "When works are fresh to the market, they do well. It's the things that have been at auction over the last 10 years that don't sell."
The day's sale totaled $16.5 million, far below Sotheby's estimate of $21 million to $30 million. The big disappointment was that Guido Reni's "David With the Head of Goliath," which the auction house had expected would bring $3.8 million to $5.7 million, failed to sell. Christie's Old Masters sale in London takes place today.
The London sales of Impressionist and modern art at both Sotheby's and Christie's had no spectacular moments. Both sales fared worse than the auction houses had hoped. "It was a difficult season to persuade people to sell," said David Nash, the head of the department of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's.
Sotheby's sale on June 30 totaled $12.4 million, well below the auction house estimate of $24 million to $31 million. Christie's sale the day before totaled $15 million; the auction house had estimated it would bring $18.9 million to $26.4 million. Surprisingly, given the recent economic troubles in the Far East, particularly in Japan,Asian collectors bought the most expensive paintings in both sales. At Christie's, Asians purchased Monet's "Charing Cross Bridge, La Tamise" for $4 million, Chagall's "Grand Parade" for $1.9 million and Cezanne's "Bathers," a study for the "Grand Bathers" in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, for $1.4 million. At Sotheby's, van Gogh's "Still Life With Almond Branch" was sold to a Japanese buyer for $2.5 million. It was the most expensive work in the sale. "It just proves that contrary to popular belief, there is still Asian money for good things," said Michael Findlay, who heads Christie's department of Impressionist and modern art in London.
Experts at both auction houses agree that the overall mood of the sales was selective, with many of the same collectors who bought in New York in May bidding for the few high-quality works. "Prices of the top things are half of what they were at the height of the market," Mr. Findlay said. "But if priced properly, they will sell."
While the numbers weren't as high, the mood at the contemporary sales was far more upbeat. "There is more excitement in this field, in part because the price levels are more affordable," Mr. Nash said. Sotheby's sale on July 2 totaled $5.4 million, well below its estimate of $8 million to $11 million. The highest-priced work was Lucio Fontana's "End of God," which was sold to an anonymous buyer for $606,100. Christie's sale totaled $7.5 million, right on its high estimate.
Christie's fared better because about a third of the sale was the property of the Swedish collector Fredrik Roos, who died in May 1991. (A large part of the Roos estate, which featured artists who made their reputations in the 1980's, had been sold at Christie's in New York in May.) Not part of the Roos estate, but also a big draw at the London sale, were seven works by the Belgian Surrealist Marcel Broodthaers. Four out of the five most expensive paintings in the sale were by Broodthaers. The most expensive in the sale, Broodthaers's "White Armoire and White Table," was bought by the London dealers Berggruen & Zevi for $752,004.
Martha Baer, director of 20th-century fine art at Christie's in New York, said, "A concentration of works, whether it be by artists who made it in the 80's or artists like Marcel Broodthaers, whose work rarely comes up at auctions, triggered the excitement." So did the fact that all the contemporary works offered at either auction house were well under $1 million.
 
Suing to Tour
 It looks as if the trustees of the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pa., are about to win a major battle in their struggle to break the restrictions established by Dr. Albert C. Barnes, the founder of the 70-year-old institution. Barnes prohibited works in the renowned collection from leaving the institution. But last week, in the Montgomery County Orphans' Court, Judge Louis D. Stefan concluded three days of hearings on whether the foundation can send about 90 of its paintings, including works by Renoir, Degas, Monet and Cezanne, on tour.
"The Attorney General has no objection to the exhibition," said Judge Stefan, who added that he expected to announce his decision next week. If he approves the plan, it will be a major step in the trustees' attempt to open up the famously reclusive institution.
The proposed exhibition is yet another cause of dissension between the Barnes trustees and the De Mazia Trust. The trust, created by Violette De Mazia, a protegee and companion of Barnes's, who was vice president of the institution and its education director, is suing the foundation, contending it is violating its charter. The exhibition is also opposed by Friends of the Barnes Foundation, a group of former students, employees and local residents who contend that some of the paintings are far too fragile to withstand the rigors of an international tour.
The show is to open at the National Gallery of Art in Washington next spring, then move to the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, the Museum of Western Art in Tokyo and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
"There has been no final decision about which paintings will go abroad," Judge Stefan said. "Experts from the National Endowment for the Arts testified that if properly crated, the paintings would not be damaged. But if there is any danger that some of them are too fragile to travel, they simply will not be sent."
James Beam, the lawyer for the De Mazia Trust, said there were still many unanswered questions about the particulars of the tour. "The board of trustees have testified about generalities, saying everything will be fine," Mr. Beam said. "But the stakes are so high in allowing this priceless collection to travel we think it's crucial that the court have specifics before making its decision. Neither the French nor the Japanese have drawn up contracts detailing the exhibition, spelling out everything from dollars and security to insurance."
Richard H. Glanton, the president of the Barnes Foundation, said: "This is false. Yes, there are contracts from both the French and the Japanese. It was discussed as a matter of record in court. The De Mazia Trust is trying to sabotage our exhibition."
Mr. Glanton estimates that the show would make at least $7 million for the foundation. "But with the catalogues and books, it could be substantially more," he said. The proceeds would go toward modernizing the Barnes Foundation's building. During the tour, the museum, built in 1926, would close for renovations.
Another museum interested in the Barnes Foundation's holdings, particularly the prized works by Matisse, is the Museum of Modern Art, whose Matisse retrospective is to open this fall. "I'm not saying they haven't approached us," Mr. Glanton said. "But I have not had any discussions with them."
Asked if the Barnes would consider lending works to the show, Mr. Glanton declined to comment.
 
A Sudden Vacancy
 Robert Stearns, the director of the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, abruptly resigned last week. Insiders say Mr. Stearns was forced out of the Wexner, an avant-garde center for performing and visual arts at Ohio State University, by members of the center's board and by the staff.
"There were lots of personality clashes," Mr. Stearns admitted. "The job had become more about management than about art. The Wexner Center is a difficult place. There are a lot of different agendas. And being part of a university makes it especially complex."
Mr. Stearns had directed the Wexner Center since 1989, the year the $43 million highly abstract building by the New York architect Peter Eisenman opened.
Until a successor is named, William Cooke, who was the center's associate director, will be the acting director. Adrienne Bosworth, the center's director of communication, said that a search committee was being formed and that the center hoped to have a new director in place by the fall. Meanwhile, Mr. Stearns said he would pursue freelance curatorial work.

HEADLINE: Festival Featuring Hip-Hop Dancing

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
When the hip-hop choreographer Jamale Graves brings his troupe of dancers to the stage of Alice Tully Hall tomorrow night as part of Lincoln Center's Serious Fun festival, it will be a turning point in the evolution of urban street dance. Break dancing, a genre that is struggling for respectability after having nearly been exploited to death as a commercial fad, is being officially blessed by Lincoln Center, which has commissioned Mr. Graves's newest work.
Sharing the bill with his dancers on a program titled "Mo' Moves," are the Rhythm Technicians and Rock Steady Crew, two groups of young hip-hop dancers that joined forces last year to put on a musical, "So! What Happens Now," which won favorable notice when it was performed at Performance Space 122 in the East Village. 
 Two of Mr. Graves's new pieces -- "The Yard" and "Tech No Love" -- directly deal with the genre's struggle for artistic recognition.
 
'West Side Story,' Updated
 " 'The Yard' takes place in a schoolyard with two groups of kids dancing for control of the space," Mr. Graves said last week. "It's kind of like Jerome Robbins's 'West Side Story,' but with hip-hop. In 'Tech No Love,' competing groups of dancers, one classical, the other raw and street-oriented, fall in admiration of each other and decide they have a mutual love for dance."
The Rhythm Technicians and Rock Steady Crew will introduce a new work called "Concrete Jungle," which compares hip-hop dance movement to African and West Indian tribal rituals.
"The piece shows the relationship between the ghetto jungle and to the jungles of yesteryear back in Africa and their relationship to break dancing," said Richard (Crazy Legs) Colon, of Rock Steady Crew, last week. "It's a dance with a lot of expression that shows we're still in the jungle, except that it's not trees we're dealing with but buildings. The piece is political in that it deals with police brutality."
The arrival of black and Hispanic street dance on the stage of Lincoln Center is the latest sign of Lincoln Center's interest in producing and showcasing work that is not predominantly European-oriented.
"When we launched Serious Fun and Classical Jazz in 1987, one of our principal purposes was to open our curtains and stages to people who had not been represented before," said Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center. "This is a natural step in that process."
 
Budget Exceeds $1 Million
 Mr. Leventhal also said that this year's Serious Fun festival, which opened on Tuesday evening with the director Robert Wilson's interpretation of Gertrude Stein's "Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights," was the most ambitious yet. For the first time, the budget for the series, which extends through July 30, exceeds $1 million, with most of that money provided by Philip Morris.
Serious Fun's commitment to the cutting edge of black culture will continue a week from tomorrow with "49 Blues Songs for a Jealous Vampire," a specially commissioned evening-length work by the Los Angeles-based poet and performance artist Keith Antar Mason. "Blues Songs," will be performed by six members of the Hittite Empire, a performance collective that formed in St. Louis in 1979 and settled in the Los Angeles area in 1985.
Mr. Mason described the collective, which has 10 to 15 members, as an "all-black male, indigenous, politically correct cultural elite who are redefining, reshaping and struggling to continue the struggle of our forefathers."
The title of the piece comes, he said, "from my grandfather's telling me when I was kid that if you sang 49 blues songs the vampire wouldn't get you."
"It's a contemporary ritual set in an interrogation room that deals with an oppressive authority nibbling away at your identity bit by bit," he said. "It uses a jazz esthetic, but brings it all the way to hip-hop. The piece is filled with Afro-centric cultural references that black people will get while everyone else will not know what I'm talking about. I'm concerned about the festival's effectively reaching to get an African-American audience to see it."
 
On the Avant-Garde
 For Mr. Mason, the work belongs squarely within the avant-garde tradition that Serious Fun celebrates.
"The avant-garde wouldn't be the American avant-garde without the African-American presence," he asserted. "This piece is in the tradition of Josephine Baker stopping in the middle of one of her Parisian shows and talking about racism in America."
In its milder way, this weekend's street-dance program is just as indicative of Lincoln Center's new open-armed cultural perspective as Mr. Mason's work.
"In the world of dance, there has always been debate about what is art and what is entertainment," said Mr. Graves, who has choreographed the music videos for C&C Music Factory and other popular acts. "What we need to realize is that art is entertaining and that entertainment is art."
Mr. Graves, who is in his early 30's, has studied both classical ballet and modern dance.
"Hip-hop dancers may not stand in front of a barre and a mirror, but they have their own school," he said. "The movement has a root and foundation in ethnic and primitive dance. Although my studies have not been that extensive, I know that a lot of the dances have influences from places like Senegal, and others from Katherine Dunham, who was from Haiti."
 
A Double Life
 When Mr. Graves was 5 years old and growing up in St. Louis, he said, he wanted to be James Brown. At 18, he won a $10,000 prize in a dance competition and used the money to go to Webster University in St. Louis, where he majored in dance education with an emphasis on choreography.
"In college, I would do my 'Nutcrackers' and 'Firebirds' and 'Giselles,' " he said, "then on Saturdays run over to Katherine Dunham's school in East St. Louis."
Since moving to New York in 1980, he has choreographed many music videos and television commercials and worked both on Broadway and Off. Two years ago with his partner, Kenneth Still, he established Onboard Productions, a production company and talent agency specializing in pop choreography. It has made him a force in a field that has grown into a small, thriving industry that offers new employment opportunities for professional dancers.
"It used to be that in order to make a living as a dancer you had to work on Broadway or be a concert dancer," he said. "Now you can make a living off of being a hip-hop dancer. Major artists like Hammer, Janet Jackson and C&C Music Factory tour with four or six dancers. In New York City, there are 20 videos being shot aday. For a dancer, what that means is that when you're not doing City Ballet or when Alvin Ailey is down for four months, you don't have to be unemployed. A dancer can do a video every other week and make an additional $2,000 or $3,000 and go on a tour with a recording artist. There's a whole new industry keeping the art alive."
Performances of "Mo' Moves" are at 8 P.M. tomorrow at Alice Tully Hall. Tickets are $20. Box office: (212) 875-5050.

'Re-electing George . . . Washington, That Is'
 Fraunces Tavern Museum
 54 Pearl Street (at Broad Street)
 Lower Manhattan
 (212) 425-1778
 Recommended ages: 7 and up
 Through Dec. 4
This mini-exhibition in a corner of the Revolutionary War museum lets visitors consider the Presidential qualities (or lack thereof) of four candidates for a restaged 1792 election: George Washington, George Clinton (the first Governor of New York), King George III of England and John Adams. The exhibition observes the 200th anniversary of Washington's re-election. Although he was the popular candidate, he himself was unsure if he wanted to be President again. 
 After reading placards displaying the candidates' curricula vitae, visitors may choose whom they would have liked to become President. Adams's resume describes him as "brilliant, witty and pompous," among other characteristics. Washington is described as "cautious, courteous, dull." King George, not an official candidate or even close to ideal, is "stubborn, intolerant and insecure." And Mr. Clinton, "frugal, businesslike and courageous," has the makings of a strong contender but opposes "big government." Anybody can vote, no matter how young. The votes will be counted on Dec. 4, the anniversary of Washington's re-election and also the day he bade farewell to his officers in the Long Room of Fraunces Tavern.
At the museum, visitors may also peruse the Clinton Room, with its panoramic French wallpaper depicting Revolutionary War scenes; the Long Room, with its eerie ambiance of invisible soldiers quaffing ale and slurping clams, and the exhibition, "Come All You Gallant Heroes: The World of the Revolutionary Soldier," with 18th-century war memorabilia. On display are muskets, canteens, an original haversack, various implements and tableware, a tricorn hat, and a fife and a very worn drum set.
The museum is open Mondays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Admission is $2.50 for adults and $1 for children.
 
 'The Age of Exploration'
 Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum
 Hudson River at West 46th Street
 Manhattan
 (212) 245-2533
 Recommended ages: 7 and up
 Through October 1993
Once you forge through the crowds waiting in line to board the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria and make your way onto the Intrepid, there is a quiet but thorough exhibition in one corner of the carrier about European voyages to the Americas before and after Columbus. The displays feature boat models, artifacts, costumes, handsome maps, tapestries and videos as well as texts, all of which are presented coherently but require a lot of reading. Some of the texts are enlightening and supply enough information to write several school reports this fall. The Europeans' search for a sea route to Cathay (and the gold and silk that seemingly awaited them there) drove most of the explorers west. But they weren't too disappointed that they never arrived there. In 1499 and 1500, for example, as Amerigo Vespucci traveled along the northeast coast of South America en route to Portugal, he rightly said that it wasn't Cathay, but a "new world."
The most informative (and time-consuming display) presents the Old World explorers, from Jacques Cartier to Hernando Cortes, and their achievements, along with meticulously drawn portraits. In another part of the show, the grueling life of sailors is depicted (they worked four-hour watches, timed by sandglasses); replicas of the Columbus caravels hang in another display, and a cartography exhibition reveals that the science once relied on religious scribes. Two continuous videos (one of which is oddly obscured by a railing and hard to hear), present a dramatization in which Columbus's son tells what made his father tick. The videos are enhanced with taped music by the Waverly Consort.
The exhibition is not air-conditioned; strollers are allowed, but there are steep steps up to the show. The crowds milling outside to board the Columbus caravels may daunt some visitors, but getting aboard the Intrepid doesn't take long. Vendors on the pier also add to the general buzz. Admission to the Intrepid is $7 for adults and $4 for ages 6 to 11; hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily through Labor Day. The caravels remain there through Tuesday. The hours to board are 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. today through Sunday and 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Monday and Tuesday. Admission is $5 for adults and $3 for children 6 and up.
 
'From Sea to Shining Sea'
 Theaterworks/USA
 Promenade Theater
 2162 Broadway (at 76th Street)
 Upper West Side
 (212) 677-5959
 Recommended ages: 5 and up
 Through Aug. 3
The building of the American transcontinental railroad in the 1860's entailed more than sweat and dynamite. Theaterworks/USA's newest play, "From Sea to Shining Sea," conveys the human drama among the workers of various ethnic backgrounds. The hourlong play, which is swept along vigorously by Jeffrey Lunden's American folk-style music (inspired by Copland), depicts the racism and harsh conditions that many of the laborers endured. The multi-cultural, all-male cast (apparently the few women near the work sites were usually prostitutes) convincingly conveys the ordeal, say, of earning $3 a day for work that required Herculean strength, and the emotional trauma of being Chinese, not knowing English and being abused by a prejudiced boss.
The play switches back and forth between crews on the Union Pacific line and the Central Pacific line; the tactic is slightly confusing, but workable with a narrator's help. The Central Pacific crew (whose actors also play the Union Pacific employees) includes Chinese workers bold enough to risk losing their jobs when the group holds a protest. The Union Pacific crew is dominated by a relationship between Sean, a naive but industrious Irishman, and Nate, a runaway slave who escaped through the Underground Railroad. Sean and Nate become comrades despite their boss, who seethes with rancor. (The actor, Rob Woronoff, also plays the boss on the other crew and is just as nasty.) Eventually, both crews make decisions about their welfare, squaring off before their bosses.
The play presents the laborers' tough working conditions without making the characters seem like caricatures and without being a simplistic tale of prejudice. Woo Lee, for example, is a Chinese worker sent down the side of a mountain to light dynamite. He doesn't speak English and has never done this work before, but he takes the plunge.
Performances are at 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. Mondays through Fridays and at 11 A.M. on Saturdays. Admission is free. Tickets may be obtained at the theater at 10 A.M. the day of performance. Groups may call ahead to arrange for tickets.
 
 'Kids and Politics'
 Children's Museum of Manhattan
 212 West 83d Street
 Upper West Side
 (212) 721-1223
 Recommended ages: 5 and up
When the Children's Museum asked children what they would do if they were President, many said they would focus on homelessness and unemployment, said June Schneider, the senior curator and director of public programs. As part of what the museum is calling a "Video Soapbox," the museum videotaped children ages 7 and up, asking them questions about the Presidency and how the present officeholder was doing, whom they would vote for, and their hopes for the country.
The children, despite their savvy, show some charming naivete. When asked whom they want to be President, many say their mothers. As a follow-up question, they are asked if they realize no woman has ever been President. "Then that question leads us to something else," Ms. Schneider said. The children are also highly focused on the environment and how money should be spent. (Not on weapons, many say.) Roving interviews will continue this week at the museum.
The museum has also invited the Democratic front-runner, Gov. Bill Clinton, and his wife, Hillary, to visit this week; no commitment has been made as yet. Museum hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Mondays and Wednesdays through Sundays. Admission is $4, but Democratic National Convention delegates with credentials and journalists covering the convention are invited to the museum free tomorrow through July 17.
 
Keep in Mind
"A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CITIZEN SOLDIER," about the way a militiaman trained and what he ate in a camp. Tomorrow from 1 to 4 P.M. at the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House, Clarendon Road and Ralph Avenue, East Flatbush, Brooklyn. Admission: $2; $1 for children. Information: (718) 629-5400.

Now a Money Pit Endangers U.S. Open Construction Plans

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
The United States Tennis Association's controversial plans to construct a modern site for the United States Open adjacent to the current location at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park are once again in jeopardy. This time it is financing, rather than site selection or political snafus or architectural details, that is causing dissension over a project whose construction was originally scheduled to begin this year but continues to idle.
Although the project was supposed to reach completion in time for the 1995 Open, the latest forecast is that the tournament will be conducted under "as is" conditions possibly until 1997. That finding is certain to cause displeasure among the players, who toil under hot, noisy and cramped conditions there at the end of every summer. They have already voted the 15-year-old Flushing Meadows complex the least amenable of the four Grand Slam sites.
 
$197 Million in Total Costs
 
 The latest construction estimates given to the U.S.T.A.'s board of directors indicate that the much-delayed project could end up costing more than $197 million, an increase of nearly $50 million from the initial estimates.
The new facility, which would have three stadiums, carried a $150 million price tag when the plans were unveiled in 1990. Last winter the U.S.T.A. learned that minor renovations to their plans, which have yet to receive official endorsement from New York City or land-use approval from the state, would cost an additional $30 million. The latest inflation has prompted Robert Cookson, the U.S.T.A. president, to consider scrapping the plan, which the association is financing, unless a cap is put on its cost.
Meanwhile, the U.S.T.A. still has not received a formal lease agreement with its landlord, the city of New York, for the site, which contains 31 acres of additional parkland. Its $250,000 yearly lease of the current 17-acre site was signed in 1981 and expires in 1994.
The proposed complex has yet to undergo a yearlong community review and a series of environmental impact hearings, and the enthusiasm of Mayor David N. Dinkins was undercut when he learned of the U.S.T.A.'s plans to relocate its executive offices from New York City to Westchester County.
In addition, several conservation groups have pledged to oppose the project even it means losing the Open, which draws 450,000 spectators and generates $14 million in yearly tax revenues. The United States championships has been held in New York City since 1915.

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 8

 BODY:
Clint Frank, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1937 as a two-way back for Yale, died Tuesday at Evanston (Ill.) Hospital after a brief illness. He was 76 years old.
Mr. Frank was the third winner of the Heisman, which goes to the outstanding college football player in the nation, and the second one from Yale, following the selection of his teammate Larry Kelley in 1936. The runner-up to Mr. Frank in 1937 was Byron (Whizzer) White of Colorado, who now serves on the United States Supreme Court. 
 After Mr. Frank graduated with a degree in economics, he went into advertising. After five years with the Army Air Corps during World War II, he returned to advertising. In 1954, he founded Clinton E. Frank Inc., which he sold to Campbell-Ewald Co. in Detroit in 1976.
He was elected to the Football Hall of Fame in 1955 and in 1988 was named recipient of the Gold Medal, the hall's highest award.
He is survived by his wife, Margaret Rathje Frank, three sons and six daughters.

HEADLINE: America's Mixed Neighborhoods Need Support

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Two Neighborhoods, and a Wall Called Race" (front page, June 21), about the Chicago communities of Roseland and Mount Greenwood, gives the depressing side of the story of racial change in urban America. 
 Curiously, you omit mention of the two stably integrated communities of Morgan Park and Beverly, which are situated between the two neighborhoods you profile and would give readers a more optimistic picture of race relations in Chicago.
In the 1970's these two communities lay directly in the path of southwest expansion of African-American families moving out of the inner city. Although some whites in Morgan Park-Beverly succumbed to the panic-peddling tactics of unscrupulous real-estate brokers and joined their Roseland predecessors in fleeing farther west, a sizable majority of families decided to put a stop to the insanity of white flight.
Under the leadership of the Beverly Area Planning Association, and with support from a local bank and from a shopping-center developer, neighborhood residents organized to resist panic selling, to quell rumors about crime and to promote their neighborhood.
The residents formed a housing center for the purpose of encouraging more integrated patterns of settlement by new home buyers.
Although racial divisions have not disappeared, the latest census attests to the success of these two neighborhoods in remaining integrated in the presence of a minority population whose proportion is well above the historical tipping point.
The census shows that between 1980 and 1990 the proportion of white residents held steady at about 34 percent in Morgan Park and that the proportion of black residents increased gradually from 14 percent to 24 percent in Beverly.
This is in sharp contrast with Roseland, which went from 72 percent white to 97 percent black in less than two decades.
What poses a major threat to the continued vitality of all four of these Southwest Chicago neighborhoods, beyond the racial distrust that lingers, is the reluctance of businesses to invest in them because their economic and demographic profiles compare less favorably with their suburban neighbors.
Unless economic investment in mixed-race and mixed-income urban neighborhoods becomes a higher national priority, our fears about a separate, hostile, unequal America are likely to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Everything Changed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I feel compelled to comment on "Two Neighborhoods, and a Wall Called Race" (front page, June 21), about the two South Side Chicago neighorhoods of Roseland and Mount Greenwood. 
 I grew up in Roseland, as my father did, his father did, and so on. While it's not in any history book, my forefathers were the first settlers of the Roseland area, first after the Potawatomi Indians, that is.
In 1865, my great-great-grandfather came here from Holland with absolutely nothing. He and his family lived in a squatter's shack on the Illinois Central Railroad at 95th Street and South Park Avenue (now Martin Luther King Jr. Drive). He ended up working as a gandy dancer for the Illinois Central. He was never rich, but he made a living from nothing, and his descendants lived in the area for more than 100 years, till 1970.
From the 1890's, when the nearby town of Pullman was established, Roseland was a melting pot of nationalities and cultures, including blacks. Like many ethnically integrated neighborhoods in Chicago, its diversity was its strength, and the community flourished.
Then, in the 1960's, in tandem with the civil rights movement, everything changed.
Roseland was no longer a nice place to live. I can personally relate experiences that are a heck of a lot more offensive than the one you describe in your second article on June 22 of the white cashier in Mount Greenwood who wouldn't put a black customer's change in his hand but only on the counter.
Local businesses could not withstand the vandalism, crime and violence any more than the residents could. People moved away, not from fear of integration but from fear for their own safety.
Now, according to you, Roseland's plight is the fault of the whites who left, as if we chose to walk away from our homes, our churches, our livelihood and our heritage.
Last year, Roseland received news media attention because of demonstrations against local businesses. Roseland residents were blaming their problems on Asian merchants who had established the successful businesses. It seems people can still make a good living in Roseland, despite racism and cultural barriers.
As we've seen recently in Los Angeles and other blighted urban areas, people are quick to blame someone or something else for their situation. You can blame your old neighbors or your new neighbors or the fact that your daddy was a sharecropper or a squatter. You can point an accusing finger at the "wall" between your neighborhood and the white neighborhoods or the lack of attention by public officials.
But, all the blame and finger pointing won't buy you a cup of coffee. To quote the lyric of a popular song, "If you want to change the world, just look in a mirror and change yourself."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
CLINTON SELECTS SENATOR GORE OF TENNESSEE AS RUNNING MATE

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 9

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas today selected Senator Al Gore of Tennessee to join him as his Vice-Presidential running mate when he receives the Democratic nomination for President in New York next week.
In making the much-anticipated announcement on the lawn of the Governor's mansion here, Mr. Clinton emphasized Mr. Gore's experience in foreign policy and the environment. And with their wives and children arrayed behind them in the baking noonday sun, both men spoke of their commitment to family values. 
 Mr. Clinton offered Mr. Gore the position during a 20-minute conversation shortly before midnight on Wednesday.
 
Relative Youth Stressed
 If elected, Mr. Gore, 44 years old, and Mr. Clinton, 45, would be the youngest team to make it to the White House in the country's history.
Aides to the Arkansas Governor emphasized their relative youth as a positive factor in an election year that has turned on which candidate can offer the best formula for change, a pointed to reference to President Bush, 68, who has been a member of the Washington establishment for more than two decades.
"Throughout American history, each generation has passed on leadership to the next," Mr. Gore said. "That time has come again, the time for a new generation of leadership for the United States of America."
 
Ready to Battle in South
 In selecting a fellow Southerner, Mr. Clinton cast aside traditional strategies for choosing a Vice-Presidential running mate that have dictated the need for geographical diversity to balance the ticket.
The choice also signaled that the Democrats were ready to battle the Republicans to regain control of the South and gather the support of swing voters who are concerned about the environment.
"The running mate I have chosen is a leader of great strength, integrity and stature, a father who like me loves his children and shares my hunger to turn this economy around, to change our country and to do it so that we don't raise the first generation of children to do worse than their parents," Mr. Clinton said to a crowd of supporters and friends.
But the wisdom of Mr. Clinton's choice was immediately questioned by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has twice unsucessfully sought the Democratic nomination for President and has on several occasions offered himself as a Vice-Presidential running mate. "I have deep concerns about the ticket. It takes two wings to fly and here you have two of the same wing."
And Republican campaign officials quickly denounced Mr. Gore as a liberal and said the Clinton-Gore combination would be far out of the mainstream.
"We think it shows Clinton is operating from weakness," said Frederic V. Malek, the manager of the Bush campaign. "And he's chosen somebody to cover those weaknesses -- his lack of a military record, his association with liberal social values, and his need to strengthen himself in the South, his own home region."
Ross Perot, the still-undeclared independent candidate for President, has focused most of his attacks on Mr. Bush and had only kind words for Mr. Gore today. "He's a fine man, wonderful family, and I think he's an excellent choice."
Mr. Gore, who like Mr. Clinton has tried to position himself in the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, sought the Presidential nomination in 1988 on much the same model as Mr. Clinton chose this year. By seeking to prove that Democrats can be strong on the military as well as supportive of social programs, he is among younger Democrats who have sought to prove that they can regain the White House by retaking the middle ground.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore are both active members of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of mostly Southern Democrats who organized in 1985 with the mission of guiding their party toward more centrist ideals.
 
'Long Hard Fight'
 Nearly a year ago, Mr. Gore decided not to run in 1992, saying he was concerned that a grueling campaign could harm his family. His son, Albert 3d, who is now 9 years old, was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Baltimore in 1989 but is now fully recovered.
Mr. Gore said today that he looks forward to a "long hard fight" in the general election campaign. He also took up the Clinton campaign's theme that the ticket would point the country in a new direction.
"I believe in my heart that this ticket gives our country the best chance for the change we so deperately need, to move foward again," Mr. Gore said.
Successive Republican administrations, he said, have "driven this country into the ditch."
"I believe very deeply that this nation simply cannot afford another four years of the kind of leadership that we have now," he said. "They've run out of ideas, they've run out of energy, they've run out of the ability to inspire people."
Mr. Gore spoke with some force today in denouncing the Bush Administration, which he said "has been trying to divide us for too long." Some campaign advisers commented approvingly afterward that the Tennessee Senator's reputation for substance would contrast favorably with Vice President Dan Quayle.
Mr. Clinton has shown a renewed determination in recent days to challenge the President on the issue of what constitutes family values. In public remarks today, both he and Mr. Gore made special mention of their school-age children and of their wives, Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton.
The Clintons -- who today stood beaming alongside their 12-year-old daughter, Chelsea -- had to fight backaccusations of marital infidelity and Mrs. Clinton's image as a woman who chose career over family early in the campaign.
The timing of the announcement reflected the campaign's concern that the selection would leak out and its desire to enter next week's convention with a ticket already in place. Campaign officials said this would help them avoid unnecessary distractions during a week that they hoped would focus on a unified party, with Mr. Clinton at its head.
Mr. Clinton called Mr. Gore to offer him the spot on his ticket at 11:15 P.M. Wednesday after meeting with three of his closest aides for about two hours at the Governor's mansion to go over the final list of choices.
Clinton campaign officials confirmed today that the other finalists were Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, Bob Graham of Florida and Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana.
In the end, Mr. Clinton went for the allure of youth. If elected, the combined ages of Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton would make them the youngest Presidential team to enter the White House. President Ulysses S. Grant, who was 46 years old when he assumed offfice in 1869, and his Vice President, Schuyler Colfax, who was also 46, held the record previously.
As a courtesy, Mr. Clinton called Mr. Graham, who had to decide by Friday whether to run for re-election to his Senate seat, shortly before he called Mr. Gore. Today, before making the announcement, he called the other contenders, as well as Democratic Party leaders.
Mr. Clinton's list of finalists did not include either Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey or Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, apparently because both men had repeatedly said they did not want to be considered for the post.
 
From 40 Names to 6
 Former Gov. Madeleine Kunin of Vermont, who served on the selection team that was headed by the Los Angeles lawyer Warren Christopher, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Gore's name "would come up again and again" as they worked to winnow an initial list of about 40 names to the 6 from which Mr. Clinton ultimately chose.
Ms. Kunin said the choice of Mr. Gore was an important one for Mr. Clinton because the Democratic nominee would be "defined by the choices he makes."
Campaign officials said they expected the selection of Mr. Gore to be especially helpful in California, where voters express special concern about the environment. Mr. Gore, who has long been a champion of environmental issues in Congress, wrote a a best-selling book, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit" (Houghton Mifflin, 1992), that made it to The New York Times best-seller list.
Stan Greenberg, the campaign's poll taker, said the all-Southern ticket would put states like Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina "readily in reach" for Democrats for the first time since Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976.
He said Mr. Clinton's Southern roots alone might not have been enough to win the South because of the virtual certainty that Mr. Perot, the billionaire from Texas, would be in the race along with President Bush, who also calls Texas his home.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore will hold a joint news conference here on Friday before Mr. Gore and his family return to Tennessee. They plan to campaign together in Nashville on Saturday before flying to New York for the Democratic National Convention. After the convention, the two men will travel together on a five-day bus tour from New York to St. Louis.

"He's a fine man, wonderful family, and I think he's an excellent choice." -- Ross Perot

HEADLINE: Grant System To Help Poor To Be Revised

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration, entering the volatile arena of antipoverty politics, is planning to abolish the community policy boards that have distributed tens of millions of Federal antipoverty dollars.
In a major overhaul of the poverty program run by the Community Development Agency, the city has also revised the formula that determines which neighborhoods are eligible for the money. It hopes to encourage the development of comprehensive services instead of the current hodgepodge of small programs now supported by the grants. 
 All told the proposals, which are to be presented today to a City Council panel, would give City Hall control over $13.5 million that has been the lifeblood of hundreds of small community organizations, and an important if obscure source of power for the local politicians who control the boards that disburse it.
Opponents charge that the administration is simply trying to take control of a lucrative patronage network the year before the mayoral election. Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch responds that the Mayor is trying to shake up an entrenched system of "employment mills" and "patronage mills."
 
Money Goes to 33 Area Boards
 Currently, Federal money is funneled through the city's Community Development Agency to 33 area policy boards that award grants for programs ranging from youth groups to services for the elderly. The boards, created by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1977 after a series of scandals, are in a sense the inheritors of the war on poverty's call for grass-roots control of social services.
Under the new plan, the Community Development Agency would award grants directly, with some form of community participation. Who will benefit and who will lose under the draft proposals is not yet entirely clear. Some small, single-service nonprofit agencies like youth centers may no longer be able to compete successfully for grants unless they broaden their services. In the future, a new network of nonprofit service agencies may grow up to challenge those that now get funding.
The new plan would make two additional communities in Brooklyn eligible for grants. But 7 out of 33 areas of the city would lose eligibility for antipoverty money. In many of these areas, however, clusters of census blocks showing high concentrations of poverty would still be able to get grants.
Gladys Carrion, the commissioner of the Community Development Agency, said the review of the poverty program was long overdue and that money was still being distributed under an outdated formula, although the city's poor had increased and shifted. She added that some nonprofit agencies had come to view the money as an entitlement.
"In the past, people expected that they would always be funded by C.D.A. and that past performance wasn't necessarily a factor of future funding," said Ms. Carrion. "There are tremendous problems out there. There's less money. We really need to look at alternatives to what we're doing and different approaches, because poverty has increased."
She said the plan was to be presented today to a City Council committee and would be made public later this month. She said public hearings would then be held. She said it could be put in place administratively and did not require Council approval.
 
Reorganized in 1977
 When Mr. Koch, who campaigned in 1977 against "poverty pimps," reorganized the system, the Community Development Agency was put directly under the mayor's office. And 33 community councils, known as area policy boards, were set up to play a major role in deciding which organizations would get money. The boards replaced community corporations, which had been criticized for inefficiency, patronage and in some cases corruption.
But Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch charged in an interview that the program remained subject to abuse. Mr. Lynch said the system of grants had often led to the creation of "employment mills" and "patronage mills" that provide political bases and jobs for local politicians and community advocates. He said the system of poverty patronage had become so entrenched in the city that it was difficult to battle. "It's like trying to push the Queen Mary sideways," he said.
The status quo has a large and varied constituency. For while the money distributed annually through the Community Development Agency is only $13.5 million, a network of more than 300 nonprofit agencies have come to depend on the money. The recipients of the grants cover a broad range of groups, among them the Hispanic Service Society, the Korean Manpower Development, the Torah Academy for Girls, the Bronx Youth Ministry Leadership Council, the Chinese American Planning Council.
 
Meetings Poorly Attended
 Frank Marrero, chairman of Area Policy Board 2 in the Bronx, admitted that his group's meetings are poorly attended and subject to pressure from politicians. But he also said he opposed Ms. Carrion's plan because then "she can make her own political decisions and completely leave out the community."
In Crown Heights, Rabbi Jacob Goldstein, the chairman of Community Board 9, tied the overhaul of the poverty program to the Community Development Agency's move late last year to reduce the number of offices where the poor can apply for Federal subsidies for heat. The management of some remaining offices was shifted away from Jewish groups to black and Hispanic groups. "They wanted to see how much they could, as far as I'm concerned, hurt the Jews," he said, noting that both Crown Heights and the Rockaways would lose eligibility under the new plan.
Ms. Carrion vehemently denied that the overhaul of the poverty program had anything to do with race or ethnicity.
The formula for determining areas eligible for aid has been updated to reflect the 1990 census and revised to reflect the working poor instead of just recipients of public assistance, Ms. Carrion said. Under the plan, seven community boards would lose eligibility for antipoverty money, including Ms. Carrion's neighborhood: Bronx Community Board 12, covering the northeast Bronx.
The other neighborhoods that would lose eligibility are Community Boards 2, 6 and 9 in Brooklyn, including Fort Greene-Boerum Hill, Crown Heights, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill and Red Hook; in Manhattan, Community Board 4, including Chelsea and Clinton; in Queens, Community Board 14, the Rockaways, and in Staten Island, Community Board 1.
As another part of the reorganization, Ms. Carrion said, the administration plans to eliminate all 33 of the area policy boards that largely decided which nonprofit agencies received antipoverty money. The boards, which cover the same geographic areas as community boards, have up to 21 members each. Up to five members are local elected officials. Two seats are reserved for representatives of the private sector. And 12 members are representatives of the poor elected by local voters every four years.
But Ms. Carrion said that the last election in 1987 drew a turnout of only one-half of 1 percent of eligible voters and cost the city $700,000. She canceled the scheduled 1991 elections, which were expected to cost $1 million. "We didn't have $1 million and if we did I'd put it to another use," she said.
She said there had been numerous city investigations of grants made by the boards and that their grant decisions had been "fraught with problems." Last year, for example, Bertha Thomas, chairwoman of a Queens area policy board, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor after she was charged with soliciting a bribe from a community service organization in the Rockaways over an antipoverty contract, according to the city Department of Investigation.
Mr. Marrero, the chairman of Area Policy Board 2 in the Bronx, described the pressures his board felt last year when it decided to cut off $35,000 to an agency headed by Caroline Velez, the wife of former City Councilman Ramon Velez, the political figure who carved a controversial empire out of antipoverty programs.
Mr. Marrero said that the Velezes came to his home and demanded that he sign a letter saying other nonprofit agencies had agreed to reductions to allow Mrs. Velez's program to be restored. Mr. Velez, he said, "Grabs me in a headlock, he says, 'What are you doing? You're messing up with my family.' " He said he signed the letter and sent an account of what happened and a letter of resignation to C.D.A. He said he subsequently rejoined the board after several months. The $35,000 grant was not restored.
Mr. Velez, reached by telephone yesterday, said he had gone to Mr. Marrero's home because his wife wanted to protest that the board's decision was "totally illegal."
"He was abusive to my wife and that is the only thing I remember about and I asked my wife to leave with me," Mr. Velez said.

Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about proposed changes in New York City's antipoverty system referred incorrectly to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in some editions. Under the proposed rules, the community board district that includes Crown Heights would not be eligible to receive Federal antipoverty money. But poorer sections within the district, including black and Hasidic neighborhoods, would continue to receive grants.

HEADLINE: Private-Sector Grants Given For a New Breed of Schools

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Grants were awarded today by a private foundation set up by business leaders last year at the request of President Bush to finance a "new generation" of American schools. Awards went to 11 design teams, including two New York-based groups.
The number was far fewer than the 20 to 30 grants the group had originally anticipated giving out by spring 1992, although officials denied that this was the result of the foundation's raising less money than anticipated. 
 "It's really in the eye of the beholder," said Ann D. McLaughlin, president and chief executive of the private, nonprofit foundation, the New American Schools Development Corporation, based in Arlington, Va. She said the group had raised $50 million for the 11 grants but had not yet determined how much money each project would get.
Today's 11 design team winners included several coalitions of well-known education reformers, like one teaming Theodore R. Sizer, head of the Coalition of Essential Schools, and James P. Comer, director of the School Development Program at the Yale Child Study Center. It also included some newcomers.
 
Radical New Thinking
 The New American Schools Development Corporation was created last July at the behest of Mr. Bush to persuade American businesses to donate enough money to create 535 experimental schools over a five-year period. The group's statement of purpose reads, "While NASDC recognizes that successful change may come from within existing schools, NASDC's responsibility is dramatically different: To help create radical new thinking about what American schools of the future might be."
When Mr. Bush announced the private-sector effort in a Rose Garden ceremony, foundation officials talked confidently of raising $200 million to finance 20 to 30 projects. Many business leaders saw the idea as an occasion to encourage corporate donations to education, but fund raising was slowed by a depressed economy and by competition with existing philanthropic programs financed by businesses.
Ms. McLaughlin, a former Secretary of Labor in the Reagan Administration, was elected to run the organization at the end of May with a mandate to improve fund raising. She joined the foundation five days ago.
"And I can assure you we're going to absolutely reach our goal" of raising $200 million for the foundation, she said.
Ms. McLaughlin said that the grant recipients would receive their money sometime during the next two months, after their contracts were signed and their grant negotiations completed.
 
One Winner Allied With Apple
 One winning proposal came from a design team of several well-known school researchers that included Marc Tucker, president and founder of the National Center on Education and the Economy, an education research and consulting group based in Rochester; Lauren Resnick, director of the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh and of the New Standards Project, a testing reform group; and David Hornbeck, a former Maryland State Superintendent of Schools.
Their group, called the National Alliance for Restructuring Education, based in Rochester, includes Apple Computer Inc. as a partner and proposes a system that would address the health and psychological needs of children as well as their academic performance and would develop more efficient ways to channel the latest in instructional resources into schools. The proposal also calls for involving communities in supporting schools.
The team is meeting this week in Sagamore, N.Y., to refine the project with the help of more than 200 teachers, principals, researchers and state and local officials.
When the group at Sagamore heard that the project had won a grant, "250 people broke into an incredible level of applause," said Andy Plattner, communications director for the National Center on Education and the Economy. The other New York group to win an award is the College for Human Services in New York City, a design team led by Audrey Cohen.
Today's winners were selected from more than 600 proposals. These are the other winners:
The Odyssey Project, Gaston County School System, Gaston County, N.C.; The Bensenville Community Design Team, Bensenville, Ill.; Community Learning Centers, Minneapolis and other Minnesota districts; The Co-NECT School, Cambridge, Boston and Worcester, Mass.; Expeditionary Learning, Boston and other sites; Los Angeles Learning Centers; The Modern Red Schoolhouse, Indianapolis and other sites; Roots and Wings, Lexington Park, Md., and Johns Hopkins University.

HEADLINE: Dow Closes Nearly Unchanged for Week

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market edged up yesterday, squeezing some modest benefit out of the favorable news on inflation.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.48 points, to 3,330.56, to finish the week practically where it began, with a net gain of 0.27 point. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered those that declined, 1,023 to 675, on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board was 164.8 million shares, down from 209.2 million on Thursday.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods rose two-tenths of a percent in June compared with a rise of four-tenths of a percent in May.
Analysts said investors saw the report as a favorable sign for the inflation outlook. But bonds managed no more than a mixed showing after the report was published. Enthusiasm was muted in the stock market because lower inflation also reflects sluggishness in the economy.
Similarly, a positive report on inflation is expected on Tuesday, when the Government issues figures on consumer prices for June. Estimates see that index rising only two-tenths of a percent, matching the increase for May.
 
Conner Is Active
 Conner Peripherals was actively traded, up 1 3/8, to 20 3/8. Late Thursday, the company reported second-quarter earnings of 77 cents a share, up from 45 cents a share in the corresponding period of 1991.
But as a sector, bank stocks took the lead. Citicorp gained 3/8, to 21 1/8; BankAmerica 1, to 43 1/4; J. P. Morgan 1 5/8, to 61 5/8, and Chemical Banking 5/8, to 38 7/8.
In the mortgage-finance sector, Federal Home Loan Mortgage rose 1 1/4, to 42 1/8, and Federal National Mortgage advanced 1, to 64 1/2.
Sierra Pacific Resources tumbled 5 3/8, to 18 3/8. The utility holding company cut its quarterly dividend to 28 cents a share from 46 cents, citing new capital requirements and lower rates of return allowed for its utility subsidiary.
Elan jumped 2 3/8, to 41 7/8, and was among the volume leaders on the American Stock Exchange. The company declared a 3-for-2 split.
Unilab, which is traded over-the-counter, dropped 1 1/8, to 5 1/8. On Thursday, the medical-testing and supplies company said it would take a $12 million charge against earnings because of changes in the billing system at its operations in Northern California.
Among Big Board issues, Boeing fell 1, to 39. The stock was under pressure since midweek, when the company lost out to Airbus in the competition for a big aircraft leasing deal with UAL.
Blue chips that contributed to the Dow's gain included United Technologies, up 7/8, to 51 1/4; McDonald's, up 1 3/8, to 47; Procter & Gamble, up 3/4, to 49 5/8, and American Express, up 1/4, to 24.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 3.05 points, to 567.80; the Amex composite index, 0.48, to 382.32; the Standard & Poor's index of 500 issues, 0.39, to 414.62, and the Big Board composite index, 0.33, to 227.88.

HEADLINE: Summary of Action in New York State Legislature's 215th Session

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 10

 BODY:
The 211 members of the State Legislature began their summer recess at 7:46 A.M. on July 3 in an atmosphere of considerable tension, after all-night negotiations on an $800 million bond act for jobs and a fiscal bailout plan for Suffolk and Nassau counties collapsed.
But the session was nonetheless notable for a budget produced almost on time: after several years of weeks-long delays, lawmakers missed the April 1 deadline this year by a single day. And the final few days of the session last week rush of important legislation, including a measure to revamp health insurance by banning discrimination in setting rates. 
 Before leaving town, the Democratic-led Assembly approved 1,748 bills and the Republican-controlled Senate 1,661. Of these, 910 passed both houses.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has already signed 301 of these bills into law and vetoed 9 of them; over the next few weeks hundreds more will be sent to his office for approval or veto.
Following are the major actions of the session.
 
The Budget
 As in the last several years, the budget and New York's fiscal problems in the face of the recession dominated the first few months of the session. But spurred in part by public disgust and rebukes from Governor Cuomo over their delays in the past, lawmakers joined forces to produce the virtually on-time budget.
The spending plan for the fiscal year that began April 1, including all Federal funds, totaled $55.9 billion, up 7 percent from the previous year. The so-called general fund budget, which includes most state tax collections and spending, totaled $30.8 billion, up 3.2 percent.
When they started the budget process, lawmakers faced a potential deficit of $4.8 billion, meaning that in the absence of any decisions on their part, projected spending would outpace projected revenues by that amount. Among actions taken to close the gap was postponement of $1 billion in scheduled income-tax cuts, tuition increases of up to $500 at public universities, $1 billion in cuts and new charges on health-care providers for Medicaid and welfare and elimination of thousands of state jobs.
Among a variety of tax-and-fee measures were an increase in the cost of four-year driver's licenses to $20, from $16, a $25 charge for license reinstatement, a charge of $1 for every beeper or paging device and new filing fees for serving a summons.
 
Redistricting
 After the budget was signed, much of the rest of the session was dominated by an issue that goes to the core of politicians' livelihood: redistricting.
The once-a-decade process, required because of population shifts charted in the census, was particularly difficult for the state's Congressional delegation, which must shrink from 34 members to 31. After months of negotiations, the Assembly and the Senate were unable to agree on a plan, and two lawsuits finally led to two separate courts devising two different plans.
In the end, the Legislature adopted a state court plan considered likely to protect most incumbents, although it will probably force Representatives Gary Ackerman and James H. Scheuer, both Queens Democrats, to run against each other. The plan would also create one new district in New York City with a majority of Hispanic voters. Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat, said he would run in the new district, rather than in the districts now represented by Ted Weiss, a Manhattan Democrat, or Bill Green, a Manhattan Republican.
Redistricting for the State Legislature proved somewhat less contentious, in part because the number of districts remained unchanged and in part because the Senate Republicans were essentially allowed to draw their new district lines, while the Assembly Democrats controlled the process in their house. The chief features of the plan, which survived a variety of court challenges, are the creation in each chamber of a few new seats in New York City where ethnic minorities make up a majority of voters and the preservation of districts for nearly every incumbent in the majority parties.

HEADLINE: N.A.A.C.P. Is Assembling, Wondering About Its Future

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, July 10

 BODY:
The pre-convention profile sounds familiar: a venerable pillar of the nation's politics that is buffeted by generational change, uncertainty about its leadership, questions about its relevance and nagging doubts as to whether it can still serve the interests of its traditional constituents.
This weekend, just before the Democrats open for business in New York, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People begins its annual convention here amid many of the same questions the Democrats face. 
 After a bitter internal battle that split the N.A.A.C.P. board in February, the 15,000 people expected here must try to redefine their organization's future in an atmosphere of general skepticism about nearly all the nation's political institutions, as well as the enormous and growing problems peculiar to black America.
 
'I Wish I Knew'
 "It takes a very dense black soul to look at what's going on in America today and not say at some point, 'God, I wish I knew how to help,' " said Roger Wilkins, a history professor at George Mason University whose uncle, Roy Wilkins, led the N.A.A.C.P. from 1955 to 1977. "The task of leadership is to define the problems and to give people ways to work on them.
"Blacks need the N.A.A.C.P. We're rooting for it to transform itself into a modern instrument that is as effective as the organization was from the 40's to the 60's."
The most pressing issue it faces is to find a successor to the departing Executive Director, the Rev. Benjamin L. Hooks Jr. But that problem will not be resolved at the meeting, which opens officially on Sunday and runs through Thursday.
Rather, the meeting's high point is likely to come on Saturday, when Gov. Bill Clinton, the certain Democratic Presidential nominee; his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, and Ross Perot, the undeclared independent Presidential candidate, are to address the organization.
But the meeting is likely to reflect the ferment, some of it substantive and some of it merely internal warfare, moving through the 83-year-old civil rights organization.
 
Upheaval in February
 At a tumultuous board meeting in February, Mr. Hooks announced his resignation; Hazel N. Dukes was replaced as president; Julian Bond, a longtime civil rights leader, was removed from the board, and Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough President, also resigned from the board.
Those on both sides of the upheaval say the resignation of Mr. Hooks, 66 years old and the N.A.A.C.P.'s head for the last 15 years, had been planned and was not directly related to the other personnel changes.
But his retirement and the departure of the others, in a dispute over whether to limit the terms of board members and officers, figured into a continuing leadership struggle that has seen the chairman, William F. Gibson, a South Carolina dentist, come out on top.
Dr. Gibson said he hoped the February meeting would not become a focus of the meeting here. "We hope that's passed," he said. "We can't afford as a civil rights movement to get caught up anymore in internal fighting."
But several longtime N.A.A.C.P. figures said the question of who is in charge is certain to be at least an underlying question at the meeting. Of particular concern is what effect it will have on the efforts to find a successor to Dr. Hooks, a decision that could shape the N.A.A.C.P.'s image and direction well into the next century.
Some longtime N.A.A.C.P. members and officials also say that Dr. Gibson's ascendancy, his perceived interest in taking some of the visibility and power that have traditionally gone with Mr. Hooks's job, and the presence of Dr. Gibson and his allies on the selection committee, raise questions about how much independence Dr. Hooks's successor will have. If so, the fear is that the organization could have trouble finding the successor it needs.
"From what I understand, there's a faction on the board that wants an office manager at the headquarters in Baltimore, with the chairman as the national spokesman," Mr. Bond said. "I don't think you'll get many first-rate people if you put out a job description like that."
 
Purpose for the Future
 The broader issues of policy and direction cut to the heart of the N.A.A.C.P.'s future.
Dr. Hooks is acutely aware and often frustrated by recurring criticism that the N.A.A.C.P. is not on the cutting edge of social change to the degree it was during the height of the civil rights era. But there's no agreement on where that cutting edge should be.
Denton L. Watson, a former N.A.A.C.P. staff member, wrote "Lion in the Lobby," (Morrow, 1990), a history of the N.A.A.C.P. leadership during the civil rights movement. He is among those who see a troubling drift toward protests and demonstrations and away from the organization's traditional focus on lobbying, policy and programs.
Emmett C. Burns, a longtime N.A.A.C.P. member and civil rights campaigner, is campaigning for Mr. Hooks's job, but those familiar with the selection process do not give him much chance of getting it. He sees the organization as lacking the street-level impact of the civil rights days.
Conservative blacks say the organization has kept its focus on racism instead of the cultural and economic issues most affecting blacks.
Dr. Hooks says the N.A.A.C.P. has focused on all those areas, and part of the criticism reflects ignorance of the wide range of the organization's activities. But he said some of it reflects the degree to which the moral clarity of the civil rights era is absent from the current environment.
"Any objective, unbiased observer would agree that when there was segregation, the only way to end it was to have integration; you could be laser sharp," he said. "If you're talking about solving the problems of the poor, there's no way under God's sun you can have the same kind of agreement and focus."
 
Distrust of Institutions
 Mr. Bond agrees that, despite the criticism, the N.A.A.C.P. remains in the forefront of most of the issues facing blacks. He says some of the criticism reflects the national mood in which almost all institutions seem suspect.
"This is a time when all institutions are under attack," he said. "If something was good yesterday we assume it's no good today."
Mr. Bond and others say the N.A.A.C.P., which ended last year with a $500,000 deficit, faces generational problems -- trying to lure both imperiled black youths and successful 25-to-45-year-old people, who remain largely absent from its active membership. The N.A.A.C.P. says it has 500,000 members, but it is widely believed within the organization that the figure is considerably lower.
"Back in the 1950's, we had all the veterans from World War II and the Korean War as the core of our membership," said Gilbert Jonas, a major N.A.A.C.P. fund-raiser. "They've aged and grayed. The important thing going on now is finding a way to reach the younger people we need."
Still, to many members, despite the battling up above, the organization remains largely unchanged in the trenches where most of the work gets done at the 1,800 adult chapters.
The Rev. Marvin A. McMickle, president of the N.A.A.C.P.'s Cleveland Chapter, said that despite the speculative questions about the future, the organization remained alive and well at the local level, dealing with education and specific issues of discrimination and inequality much as it has in the past.
"Take it from me, there's no correlation between the strength of the branches around the country and the confusion in the national office," he said. "Whoever the next director is, our phones will ring the next day with someone needing help."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Racial Politics;
Perot Brings Mixed Record To His First Black Audience

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, July 10

 BODY:
Having appeared at rallies so far that have been overwhelmingly attended by whites, Ross Perot is scheduled Saturday to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, his first appearance before a predominantly black audience since considering a run for President.
His speech to the civil rights group comes at a time when some black strategists view the Texas billionaire as a fulcrum to increase their leverage in a Democratic Party they feel has paid them too little attention. It also comes when a number of younger black voters have expressed tentative support for Mr. Perot's possible candidacy. 
 "The Democratic Party, every four years, becomes very arrogant and high-handed with respect to blacks," said Roger Wilkins, a professor of history at George Mason University who has also been an adviser to the Rev. Jesse Jackson. "Its campaigns are invariably run by some new wave of young white men. One of the attitudes is that we blacks have nowhere else to go. The attitude is, really, that we should shut up, stay out of the way, not make waves, but show up at the polls in November."
 
Unfamiliar Territory
 But Mr. Jackson, who has long sought to increase his own and black voters' leverage within the Democratic Party, said today that he would not support Mr. Perot.
In making his initial public courting of black voters, Mr. Perot brings to them a record and statements that are decidedly mixed on issues of concern to nonwhites.
On one hand, all of the top strategists in Mr. Perot's campaign organization are white men, and he has reached out little to black and Hispanic voters. He has spoken critically of a free-trade pact with Mexico, an agreement that is strongly supported by many Hispanic people in this country, especially Mexican-Americans.
Mr. Perot has expressed discomfort with the concept of affirmative action, saying such racial preference programs place "stresses on the melting pot." When asked at a news conference last month if he would have signed the civil rights bill passed by Congress last year after a contentious debate over whether it would force businesses to adopt racial quotas, Mr. Perot said he was unfamiliar with the legislation.
Electronic Data Systems, the company through which he made his fortune, had a poor record of promoting minorities under his directorship. In 1986, the last year Mr. Perot controlled E.D.S. before it was completely taken over by General Motors, only 1 percent of the company's managers and supervisors were minorities. Last year, that figure was 10 percent.
 
Diversity 'a Strength'
 On the other side of the equation, Mr. Perot invariably tells the overwhelmingly white audiences that the country's diversity should be seen "as a strength and not a weakness." Last year, he told reporters that if his company had a plant in Louisiana and David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, was elected governor there, he would move his business out of the state.
And officials at some minority organizations give Mr. Perot high marks for his attempt to reform the public school system in Texas, an effort that included trying to increase spending on poorer school districts.
To date there has been no wholesale defection of black and Hispanic voters to Mr. Perot. But several recent polls indicate there is increased interest in him, particularly among younger blacks.
A survey conducted in June by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black-oriented research organization in Washington, found that 21 percent of black voters from 18 to 34 years old supported Mr. Perot. The poll of 750 voting-age blacks found that 43 percent of them supported Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, 13 percent favored President Bush, 20 percent were undecided and 11 percent did not like any of the three Presidential aspirants.
Similar results were found in a survey of 3,500 voting-age people conducted by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press. The poll indicated that 30 percent of black voters under the age of 50 supported Mr. Perot.
 
Dissatisfied With Democrats
 For the moment, the interest of some minority voters in Mr. Perot does not reflect an impassioned embrace of Mr. Perot by younger blacks, but a dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party by a group of voters who were children or not even born when the Civil Rights Bill of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Great Society -- watersheds in black advancement -- were pushed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and passed by a Democratically controlled Congress.
Polls showing increasing Hispanic support for Mr. Perot are considered unreliable by many experts because often the size of the sample is small and poll takers do not always speak Spanish. But some leaders of Hispanic organizations say they are interested in alternatives to traditional conservatives who seem uninterested in their problems and liberals who speak of poverty and race only in terms of blacks.
"We're intrigued by the notion that there may be someone like Perot who can cut across and cut through the ideological gridlock and bring a more pragmatic view to issues," said Charles Kamasaki, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization.
Whether Mr. Perot's standing among minorities can hold up as he puts flesh on the bare bones of his position on racial issues is an open question. If it does, political analysts see potential problems for Mr. Clinton. Since 1964, Democratic nominees have been able to count on close to 90 percent of the black vote. A movement of a hefty portion of minority voters to Mr. Perot could badly damage Mr. Clinton's chances in a number of states, especially in the South.
"If Perot got 13 percent of the black vote, that would be a substantial rejection of Bill Clinton," said David Bositis, a senior researcher at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. "If that happens, Bill Clinton would probably lose the election."

HEADLINE: NATO AND EUROPE TIGHTEN SANCTIONS AGAINST YUGOSLAVS

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, July 10

 BODY:
As leaders from 52 countries condemned the Serbian-dominated Government of Yugoslavia for a war that has killed more than 50,000 people, nine Western European nations and the NATO alliance decided today to tighten trade sanctions with naval surveillance of the Adriatic Sea and debated even stronger military moves.
Coordinated operations by the nine-nation Western European Union and NATO will involve participation of ships from the United States Sixth Fleet and at least five European naval vessels, according to separate resolutions. They were adopted by both organizations before the close of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
 The Western European Union also decided to draw up plans for a military operation to open a corridor for overland convoys from Adriatic ports into Bosnia and Herzegovina. A United Nations airlift has been flying in food and medicine since the beginning of the month to the besieged population of Sarajevo, the capital.
 
Putting Pressure on Serbs
 But such an operation, which could pit peacekeeping forces against Serbian forces bombarding Sarajevo, would require a new Security Council resolution, and Western leaders here today expressed a continued reluctance to send in troops to defend the relief effort, and an even stronger unwillingness to give direct military assistance to the Bosnian Government.
"If we were asked, we would say that other methods appear to be preferable," President Francois Mitterrand of France said. President Bush said, in an interview for American public television, "People are reluctant to get bogged down."
But support for a new Security Council resolution appeared to be growing here, as a way to pressure the Serbian authorities to call off the attacks.
 
New Leader Flies In
 The pressure appeared to be having some political effect, even if none was yet evident on the ground. Milan Panic, a businessman who immigrated to the United States from Yugoslavia and is designated to become the Yugoslav Prime Minister on Tuesday, also flew in today to meet with some of the leaders before they started flying out.
At a news conference this afternoon, he seemed confused about whether he was to become President or Prime Minister, dismissed the strongly nationalist President of the Serbian republic, Slobodan Milosevic, as having no power, and said repeatedly, "God help him if he gets in my way."
"We must stop the killing," Mr. Panic said. "I want everybody to agree to withdraw the arms, especially heavy arms from Bosnia, under United Nations control."
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who saw him this afternoon, said that he had told Mr. Panic that the world would now demand deeds from Yugoslavia, not just words.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, said he had told Mr. Panic that Russia would support a lifting of the United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia if it ended the violence, and would help get it reinstated to the security conference, from which it has been suspended until Oct. 14.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who also saw Mr. Panic today, said: "I believe that he has good intentions. Let us see what happens after he becomes Prime Minister."
 
An Official Statement
 As leaders scurried to leave the conference, the Finnish chairman, President Mauno Koivisto, gaveled into the record a statement on Yugoslavia suggested by President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, making it an official conference document some leaders said afterward they were unaware they had adopted.
"The violence and aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia continues," it said. "The prime responsibility for this lies with the authorities in Belgrade."
The summit conference, originally foreseen as a giant celebration of the end of the cold war, turned instead into a crisis meeting, to cope with Yugoslavia and try to prevent similar conflicts from erupting elsewhere.
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia supported the idea of a European rapid reaction force. "The most important thing is to get such forces into action not when blood is already flowing, but at the stage when conflicts are intensifying," he said, speaking in the hangar-sized exhibition center hall that the Finns provided for one of the world's biggest summit meetings ever.
 
Revivals of Animosities
 Leader after leader warned that unless the nations of the world could do something to stop the violence in the Balkans, ethnic and national rivalries could explode in many parts of the former Communist empire.
"All the ancient conflicts, wrongs, injustices and animosities are suddenly coming back to life and back to mind," President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, which Czech and Slovak nationalism is tearing asunder, said on Thursday. "The sudden outburst of freedom has thus not only untied the straitjacket made by Communism, it has also unveiled the centuries-old, often thorny history of nations."
Before leaving today, President Bush also talked with Mr. Havel, whose days in office are numbered after Slovak nationalists in Parliament blocked his re-election this month. Mr. Bush said that if the country did break up, it should happen peacefully, he told reporters today.
Twenty-nine countries at the conference signed a treaty setting limits on the size of their armed forces stationed on European territory, following up a 1990 accord pledging them to sizable reductions of tanks, artillery pieces and combat aircraft. Under the accord, Germany can have 345,000 troops, down from more than 500,000 two years ago; France will have a right to 325,000 and Britain can keep 260,000 under arms.
The United States will have a ceiling of 250,000 soldiers in Europe, though it plans to reduce the actual number to far below that. The Russian ceiling is 1,450,000 and Ukraine's is 450,000.

Up to 5,000 Job Cuts Set By Douglas

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the aviation and military contracting giant, told employees yesterday that it would cut as many as 5,000 jobs, or about 15 percent of its work force, by the end of the year at its struggling commercial aviation division.
The announcement is the latest in a flurry of employment cutbacks in recent months, including the Amoco Corporation's decision this week to eliminate 8,500 jobs, or more than 15 percent of its work force. The cutbacks of thousands of jobs have raised concerns among economists and could hobble the current tepid recovery. 
 The dismissals will strike particularly hard in California, which has already seen a good deal of cuts in the aerospace business as military cutbacks and the airline industry's difficulties have hurt the bottom line of most companies. Last week, Hughes Aircraft, which is based in Los Angeles, announced that it would be laying off 9,000 workers, or 15 percent of its employees, over the next 18 months.
 
 
Letter to Employees
 In a letter to employees, Bob Hood, the president of the Douglas Aircraft division, said the continuing slump in the commercial aviation industry left the company with little choice but to cut back on its employment costs.
"We must right-size our business operations to weather this storm and insure our long-term success," Mr. Hood wrote in the letter. "No decision is harder than one that affects jobs."
Mr. Hood, who said that the number of dismissals will range from 4,000 to 5,000, said that about half of the cuts would be made among manufacturing workers, while the other half would be in what he described as "indirect" functions, which include administrative jobs.
McDonnell Douglas, based in St. Louis, Mo., has had to make large cutbacks in Douglas Aircraft, which is based in Long Beach, Calif., in recent years because of troubles in getting financing for its planned MD-12 jumbo jet project and declining orders for other jets, including the MD-11 trijet.
Over the last two years, the number of jobs at Douglas Aircraft has shrunk to 36,000, from 52,000. That does not include either the impact of yesterday's announcement or the plans announced last month by the company to shut down a component plant in California that would lead to the elimination of about 2,000 jobs by the end of next year.
 
 
Commitment Is Stressed
 The rash of dismissals and other bad news at the company have raised speculation about McDonnell's commitment to the business. Indeed, with the postponement of its jumbo jet project and its prolonged negotiations with Taiwan about a $2 billion investment from a Government-backed aerospace venture for 40 percent of the company, few things seemed to be going right for Douglas Aircraft.
But in his letter, Mr. Hood emphasized that McDonnell Douglas remained committed to the division. McDonnell Douglas "has weathered previous downturns in our industry, and we are prepared to weather this one as well," he said.
Despite the troubles in negotiating with Taiwan, Mr. Hood also said he believed the talks would eventually prove sucessful. "Coming to an agreement is going to take time," he wrote. "No one ever said closing a deal of this magnitude with a potential partner thousands of miles away would be easy. However, I remain convinced we will sucessfully negotiate a mutally satisfactory agreement with investors in Taiwan."
Despite his expression of confidence, Mr. Hood conceded that the talks with Taiwan "have slowed," but added that the company was making progress in talks with other potential partners. "The additional interest now makes it less important that we rely predominantly on any one partnership agreement," he said.

HEADLINE: Loan Penalties Deter Small-Business Expansion

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
A growing number of small-business owners are accusing the Small Business Administration -- and the Bush Administration -- of stifling their growth through its lending practices. Some even equate the Government with a loan shark.
Consider the case of Jim Owens, owner of Lauks Testing Laboratories Inc. in Seattle, which specializes in environmental testing. An S.B.A. loan in 1981 allowed his company to expand, creating jobs. Now, Mr. Owens says his employees "are packed in like sardines," but paying off his $336,000, 25-year S.B.A. loan early to clear the way to move into a new building would cost him a $123,123 prepayment penalty.
 
Penalties 'Extraordinarily High'
 Mr. Owens's laboratory is one of 3,913 companies that in February were still paying off loans taken out in the early 1980's under the small-business agency's 503 loan program. The loans, financed through the Federal Financing Bank, an arm of the Treasury, are at rates as high as 15.7 percent, high now but comparatively low at the time. 
 While President Bush is encouraging investment to help create jobs and has jawboned the Federal Reserve to bring down interest rates further, prepayment penalties of as much as 40 percent of the original loan are preventing many of these small-business owners from expanding or selling their businesses or from refinancing their loans to take advantage of lower interest rates.
"If it's a 40 percent charge, then that's extraordinarily high," said James Barth, a finance professor at Auburn University. "It's even more unusual and unreasonable that the Government would be doing this. But this is not an easy time to argue that people should be paying less for Government-supported programs."
Small-business agency officials say, however, that they are bound by the current regulations. Dan Eramian, a spokesman for the S.B.A., said, "These are the Treasury Department's requirements, not ours."
Anger over the prepayment penalties has spurred a grass-roots movement to persuade Congress and the Administration to lower those fees through legislation. More recent S.B.A. borrowers, after all, do not pay such high penalties. Responding to changes in Government accounting procedures, Congress in 1986 created the S.B.A. 504 program, in which loans are financed through the private sector rather than the Treasury, alleviating some prepayment problems, said LeAnn Oliver, deputy director for the Office of Rural Affairs and Economic Development of the S.B.A.
But a measure that would make the penalty on 503 loans more consistent with commercial rates of 7 percent to 9 percent is stalled in committee on Capitol Hill, and last week companion legislation was introduced in the Senate. The Treasury Department has urged President Bush to veto the legislation on the ground that changing the rules would widen the Federal budget deficit and cost taxpayers.
"If they are allowed to prepay the loans, there would be a direct cost to the Federal Government, and everybody else who has these kinds of loans would come in and ask for this type of arrangement, too," said a senior Treasury official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "Then we couldn't give the same kind of low, long-term rate. Changing the agreement would be an inefficient, haphazard way to conduct a lending program."
Although prepaying the loans early would reduce the Federal deficit temporarily, in the long run the deficit would increase in the absence of the interest payments the borrowers would have been making, he said. He added that 10 or 15 other agencies, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Rural Electrification Agency, are or have been bound by the same prepayment rules.
In 1988, President Reagan vetoed legislation that would have lowered the prepayment premium. And two years ago, the bill was introduced and opposed by the Bush Administration, which said that Congress would have to offset an estimated loss of more than $150 million to the budget by cutting the same amount from other small business programs.
But Representative Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who introduced the measure along with Representative Rod Chandler, a Washington Republican, said he thinks the move would cost the Government closer to $50 million, adding that he believes the bill still has a chance because bipartisan support is growing. "We don't deny there are some costs to this," Mr. Wyden said.
Doris Johnson, co-owner of Vancouver Bolt and Supply Inc., in Vancouver, Wash., which sells supplies like nuts, bolts, wheelbarrows and drills, started the grass-roots group, called the S.B.A.-503 Small Business Coalition, after finding that she would have to pay a $45,000 penalty to prepay her $177,000 loan.
Mrs. Johnson said she had looked forward to eventually turning over her business to her son, but "we can't do any estate planning because we can't move the ownership," she said. "So you can't die, you can't refinance and you can't sell it," she added.
"Uncle Sam has become one of the biggest loan sharks of all time," said Mrs. Johnson, who has sent more than 2,000 letters to small-business owners and lawmakers in the three months since she organized the coalition. "This has turned out to be one of the largest tragedies of our business history."
Bernilda Britt knows this all too well. After her husband, Paul, died in February, as his sole survivor she found herself thrust into an unfamiliar role as president of a Minnesota company she knew little if anything about and with 100 anxious employees. Several months ago, when she looked into selling Dubuque Stamping and Manufacturing Inc., which makes metal parts for the construction and farm equipment industries, she found that paying off the S.B.A. 503 loan required her to come up with a prepayment premium of $135,000.
"When you're not involved in a business and all of a sudden you are involved, it is difficult," said Mrs. Britt, who had not worked at the company for 30 years. "It seems unfair to me that such a law can hold a penalty over the borrower, who does not know what type of catastrophe could befall them."
 
Labyrinthine Loan Language
 To pay off the 503 loans, the borrowers essentially have to pay the equivalent of the principal balance and all the interest they would have had to pay had the loan been paid over the original time span -- in many cases 20 to 25 years. Under the 504 program, each of the loans carries a prepayment provision that allows the businesses to pay the equivalent of one year's interest if the loan is paid off within a year, and the penalty decreases and is completely eliminated if the remaining life of the loan is less than one-half the life of the original loan.
Under the 504 program, for example, Mr. Owens's prepayment penalty, using a payoff date of July 11 of this year, would be $4,870.66 instead of $113,978.45 under the 503 plan, said Ms. Oliver of the S.B.A.'s rural affairs office. Mrs. Johnson's penalty would have been $7,426.16 under the 504 program instead of $33,361.40 under the 503 plan, Ms. Oliver said. Mrs. Britt's penalty would be zero instead of $81,581.18, she said.
The differences between the two programs have led S.B.A. 503 borrowers to compare themselves to the aggrieved "notch babies" of the Social Security system. These are people born between 1917 and 1921 who, because of a technicality in a bill Congress passed in 1977, receive significantly fewer benefits.
The prepayment language buried in the fine print of the S.B.A. 503 agreement is so dense that many of the borrowers say they do not even understand it in hindsight: "The debenture may be prepaid at such price as will result in a yield from the date of prepayment to maturity, equal to the U.S. Treasury new issued yield for a security with a maturity and payment schedule comparable to the remaining maturity and payment schedule of the debenture, computed as of the close of business two business days prior to the date of prepayment, plus accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of prepayment."
"One argument has been, 'Well, you knew what you signed,' " Mrs. Johnson said. "But we didn't know what we signed. No one spelled it out. The terms of the agreement were too complicated for even our attorneys to understand."

HEADLINE: Nigeria's Monumental Steel Plant: Nationalist Mission or Colossal Mistake?

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AJAOKUTA, Nigeria, July 9

 BODY:
With its sprawling network of pipes and cylinders and immense exhaust towers, the 60,000-acre Ajaokuta steel complex, the biggest industrial project in sub-Saharan Africa, poses a striking contrast to the villages of straw-roofed huts that surround it.
Officials hope that once the plant begins pouring metal as scheduled this month, this remote town in the heart of southern Nigeria will stand as a symbol of this developing country's dream of greatness and a monument to engineering tenacity. 
 But Ajaokuta has also become a target of increasing cynicism among Nigerians who have come to regard the project, after 12 years of delays and cost overruns, as a seemingly endless economic drain.
"If there is such a thing as a white elephant, this is surely one of its more awesome specimens," said Nosa Igiebor, editor of Tell magazine, an independent weekly that has published several articles highly critical of the project.
 
'Impressive Achievement'
 Indeed, although initially planned for completion in about six years at a cost of $1.4 billion, the Ajaokuta project has already cost more than $4 billion, and Western diplomats and donors say it may need hundreds of millions more before it becomes fully operational.
Ajaokuta, some Nigerian analysts and Western diplomats say, is a relic from another era, when many third-world nations, aspiring to catch up with industrialized societies in the West, built vast prestige projects that often proved to be financial flops.
"Even to have built such a project is an impressive achievement, and the Nigerians should be lauded for that," a Western diplomat said. "But in the end, the real issue is whether it will ever prove commercially viable, and for now, that seems unlikely."
To succeed, he said, the plant will need to be heavily subsidized by the Government for the indefinite future -- a prospect Nigeria can ill afford given its already historically high levels of external debt, now estimated at about $35 billion.
 
Skeptical Western Donors
 Officials involved with the plant strongly defend it.
"Our job is not just to produce steel," said Philip Atanmo, project director and chief executive of the plant. "We also have the job of opening up the area where we are located, providing schools, hospitals and housing and other infrastructural activities that you do not have to be concerned with in the U.S. or Europe.
"I will say emphatically that Nigeria is lucky that it contracted the construction of this plant when it did because, given the economic situation as it is today, nobody can think of this country being able to build a plant of this nature."
A Soviet-led consortium began work on the project in 1980 when the price of oil -- the commodity that drives Nigeria's economy, black Africa's biggest -- was riding high. With Government coffers overflowing, the country's leaders, hoping to reflect Nigeria's emergence as a world power, decided to build on a grand scale. As originally envisioned, the project included a raw-materials treatment plant, coke ovens, blast furnaces and four rolling mills.
But from the start, Western donors were skeptical. For one thing, they expressed misgivings about the plant's location -- the site is nearly 250 miles from the ports that handle critical raw materials, coke and iron ore. And because the Niger River is at times relatively narrow, it would have to be dredged before steel barges could navigate its waters.
 
80's World Oil Glut
 Some also questioned whether there was enough demand in the local market to justify such a mammoth investment.
There there was the issue of corruption. In its early years, the Ajaokuta project became known for the kickbacks that enriched the pockets of officials who were in a position to award contracts and whose who received them.
Those and other factors led some observers to conclude that the project would never be competitive in terms of price or quality with European or North American steel, not to mention steel made at recently built and technically more sophisticated plants in Japan and South Korea.
But what practically no one anticipated was the world oil glut of the mid-1980's, which caused Government revenue to plummet. As the bottom fell out of the market, external debt also rose, pushing Nigeria to adopt restraints on big capital projects, especially those with long gestation periods like Ajaokuta.
 
Growth's Starting Point
 By the time Gen. Ibrahim Babangida seized power in a 1985 military coup, Ajaokuta had already become a catchword for excess. But because so much money had already been committed to the project, the new military authorities were reluctant to abandon it.
"We had already poured so much time and energy into the thing that we couldn't allow it to fail," said a senior Nigerian official who is close to General Babangida.
It is too early to tell whether pouring more and more resources into the project will eventually pay off. Mr. Atanmo, the project director, said skeptics are focusing too much on the short term and missing the larger picture.
The plant, he insists, will serve "as a starting point for this country's industrial growth."
And he said that Ajaokuta would serve not only as a model for Nigeria's future, but "for the future of the black man all over the world."

HEADLINE: Lunches at $19.92 Put 4 Stars In Eyes of New York Diners

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
Restaurant fever struck New York with a vengeance this week, leaving maitres d'hotel, owners and chefs breathless in a deluge of requests for reservations.
"It is bordering on hysteria," Barry Wine, owner of the four-star Quilted Giraffe, said yesterday as he contemplated the sudden demand that resulted from announcements that his restaurant, along with some 100 others in New York City, would offer lunch for $19.92 next week during the Democratic National Convention. The restaurant normally charges $45. 
 "Do you know what six calls per minute for five hours does to your phone lines?" Mr. Wine said. "I can honestly say that we've received over 3,000 phone calls requesting reservations for lunch next week, including ones from celebrities who would normally be out of town in July. We are answering six calls a minute, and we were sold out by last Friday."
 
Seizing the Moment
 So far, the restaurateurs say, the calls have come mainly from New Yorkers, either people seizing the opportunity to dine at places they cannot normally afford or people who revel in the delight of a bargain, no matter their economic status.
"It's New Yorkers, but it is very touching," Mr. Wine said. "It is people who have been dreaming of eating in such places all their lives, the ones for whom even $19.92 is a lot of money. I hope we have a lot of those people."
His wife, Susan Wine, recounted turning down a request from Robert De Niro: "Someone from his office called and said he had to give a very important lunch. I said, 'If it's so important, why doesn't he come for dinner at the regular price? Robert De Niro can afford it.' " She said that Sylvester Stallone had managed to secure a reservation but that she had been compelled to put both Senators from Ohio and Representative Ted Weiss of New York City on a waiting list.
Will the promotion, which the sponsors say is aimed at both New Yorkers and delegates, miss all the Democrats from west of the Hudson? Well, there are many parties on Sunday night and there are also 56 delegate luncheons at Manhattan restaurants on Monday, when the price will be even more enticing than $19.92: free to delegates.
Peggy Gibbons, a manager of the four-star Bouley, whose lunch usually carries a $32 price tag, said: "I personally took 2,000 calls on Wednesday. I read about it in the paper, rushed in at 8:30 A.M. and the phones were already ringing off the hook." That was the day an article about the project organized by Tim Zagat and Joseph Baum, co-chairmen of the restaurant and hospitality committee of the New York '92 Host Committee, appeared in The New York Times, listing the participating restaurants, which range from the Ambassador Grill to Zarela.
"It had already been in Crain's, and gotten a tremendous response," Ms. Gibbons said.
Mr. Zagat, who publishes the Zagat Restaurant Surveys, quoted a comment to Allan Ripp, an assistant, by Mary Beth Flynn, a manager of Bouley: "It's been like American Airlines at Thanksgiving here. We have added a whole second seating to accommodate the demand, starting at 2:30 P.M. That's 27 tables five days for the overflow. The amazing thing is how many people are willing to eat lunch at 2:30. We really knew we were caught up in something wild when we started getting requests for lunches to go." Carry-out lunches, she said, were not possible.
At Le Cirque (four stars), one of the city's pre-eminent gathering places for the lunch bunch and the power brokers. Marco Maccioni, the son of the owner, Sirio Maccioni, told the Zagat surveyors: "The week after July 4 is normally the start of our summer vacation, but we've decided to stay open to be part of the 1992 effort for the convention. A lot of our customers go away too this time of year, so we weren't sure how busy we'd be. We sold out after the first newscast mentioning it."
And then there is the case of Cafe des Artistes, a three-star restaurant, which, like all the other establishments, has been swamped. But its new price is no bargain; its regular prix fixe luncheon is $19.50, 42 cents less than the bargain price. Would it be adjusted to conform? "No, of course not, " said Steve Gurgely, the manager.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Running Mates;
On Environment Issues, Quayle Curbed the Rules and Gore Wrote the Book

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
On environmental issues, Vice President Dan Quayle and Senator Al Gore are almost always at opposite poles, and this is likely to be the main battleground when they tangle in the fall election campaign.
Mr. Quayle and his staff have worked overtime this year to cut environmental regulations and open natural resources to development. 
 Mr. Gore has been the Congress's leading advocate of environmental causes and the Bush Administration's chief critic on the subject. Now that the cold war is over, he maintains, destruction of the environment is the gravest threat to the human race.
This is the fundamental difference: Mr. Quayle holds that sometimes the environment must be spoiled for the sake of development, jobs and economic growth. Mr. Gore says that the environment should come first and that the strength of the economy cannot be measured properly unless the cost of environmental damage is factored in.
 
'They Are Perfectly Matched'
 Each man's staff members say their boss thinks the other is an extremist.
"They are perfectly matched," said Claude E. Barfield, director of science and technology projects at the American Enterprise Institute. "Gore is not in any sense a moderate. He's a flaming environmentalist. Quayle has probably overextended the other way. He represents the most aggressive position on the other side."
The announcement Thursday that Mr. Gore, the junior senator from Tennessee, would be the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee and go head-to-head with Mr. Quayle had the admirers and detractors of both men sharpening their tongues.
Richard N. Bond, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, called Mr. Gore an "environmental elitist." The line going around the White House today was that Mr. Quayle is for jobs and Mr. Gore for the giant garter snake.
Jonathan Adler, an environmental policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a research organization that promotes free-market policies, said Mr. Gore was an extremist who favored a "wrenching transformation of the American society."
As for the Vice President, Mr. Adler said: "I'm not going to say Dan Quayle is an intellectual giant. But he understands the basic truth that what's best for the country economically is also what's best for it environmentally."
On the other side, environmental organizations could hardly contain their glee at Mr. Gore's selection. This came on the fax machine today from the League of Conservation Voters, a lobbying organization:
"Senator Albert Gore is an environmental Paul Revere. Long before most of his colleagues are even aware of a problem, Gore is likely to be studying it, and if he sees the opportunity, holding hearings and sounding the alarm."
James Maddy, the league's executive director, said in an interview that Mr. Gore was probably the highest rated senator on environmental issues and that Mr. Quayle favored "creating jobs by trashing the environment."
The battle over the environment between Mr. Gore and the Bush Administration reached a pitch this spring over the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Mr. Gore headed the Senate delegation.
Mr. Gore was sharply critical of two of the Administration's positions in Rio that Mr. Quayle was instrumental in developing: its refusal to sign a pact intended to preserve as many species of plants and animals as possible, known as the biodiversity treaty, and its refusal to accept specific limits on the emission of gases that may cause global climate changes.
 
Foe of Regulations
 Mr. Quayle has channeled his energies on the matter into the White House Council on Competitiveness, which he heads. Its mandate is to root out regulations that unnecessarily hamstring American business.
These are some of the steps that have become Administration policy under Mr. Quayle's direction of the council in the last year:
*It proposed changes in the Clean Water Act that would open 50 million acres of swamps, marshes, wet forests and other wetlands to development.
*It curbed the public's ability to block timber cutting, oil drilling, mining and grazing on public lands.
*It proposed rules that would remove restrictions on the storage and disposal of 45 percent of the world's hazardous wastes.
*It interpreted the Clean Air Act of 1990 to mean that the public has no right to review a company's plan to increase air pollution above permitted levels.
All this is anathema to Mr. Gore. He has been at the forefront of environmental protection issues since he first arrived in Congress in 1977. He helped write the superfund program to clean up toxic waste, which Mr. Quayle opposes as ineffective and a drain on Government and private resources. He favors big Federal investments in energy conservation and mass transit and laws requiring more fuel-efficient cars, all of which Mr. Quayle opposes.
His book, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit," which was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1992 and was on The New York Times Best Seller list for six weeks this spring, assesses as overpopulation, deforestation, soil erosion and air and water pollution and concludes that destruction of the environment is the greatest threat to mankind.
But from the environmentalists perspective, even Mr. Gore slips now and then. A big environmental battle of the 1970's was whether the Tellico Dam should be built at the cost of the extinction of a tiny species of fish called the snail darter. Mr. Gore favored killing off the fish.
The Tellico Dam is in Tennessee.

Jackson Won't Say Which Democrat

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson traveled the length and breadth of Manhattan yesterday talking about the need to elect a Democratic President in the fall. But he doggedly dodged every opportunity offered him to endorse the Clinton-Gore ticket.
When the ticket was formally announced on Thursday, Mr. Jackson said he had "deep concerns" about it but pulled up shy of rejecting it. Yesterday, in a series of interviews and at a rally in Washington Heights, he said that a Jackson endorsement should not be an issue. 
 What, then, was the issue, given Mr. Jackson's differences with Gov. Bill Clinton over racial issues and his history of withholding endorsements to obtain political leverage for his own ideas and proposals?
"The issue is the economic rejuvenation of this country," he answered, proffering copies of a 12-page pamphlet that was entitled "Rebuild America." It carried his byline and his latest thoughts about the nation's needs, particularly in the inner cities.
He said Governor Clinton's proposal to rebuild America with $200 billion in public works projects was "a start."

Dollar Loses Momentum, Dropping After a Brief Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A brief rally for the dollar lost momentum yesterday and sent it lower against all major currencies.
Gold also fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell 40 cents to close at $348.30 a troy ounce. A late bid at the Republic National Bank in New York quoted it down 30 cents at $348. 
The dollar came under heavy selling pressure after a report that the Dutch central bank was raising its reserve requirements, said Tom Hoge, corporate trader for Credit Suisse. Some traders initially misinterpreted market news accounts, believing the Dutch were moving to tighten their money supply, which would increase the guilder's value against the dollar.
As it turned out, the move by the Dutch central bank was only technical and did not reflect a change in monetary policy, Mr. Hoge said.
Nevertheless, many traders sold dollars and bought German marks on the report, believing any action by the Dutch would portend higher rates in Germany, another trader said.
Traders also said they expected the dollar's brief rally earlier this week to end quickly because of the poor United States economy, political uncertainty and higher rates of other currencies.
"We basically corrected what I considered to be an ill-conceived move in the first place," Mr. Hoge said.
In New York, the dollar closed at 1.4940 German marks, down from 1.5130 late Thursday. In Europe, it closed at 1.4975 German marks, down from 1.5165 late Thursday.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing of 125.78 Japanese yen from 124.57 at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 125.40 yen, and at the close of trading in New York it was quoted at 125.25 yen, down from 125.60 in the previous session.

Nike's Olympian Trademark Fight

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, July 10

 BODY:
Imagine the following live broadcast during the Olympic Games this month: The Spanish police interrupt a basketball game and ask American athletes to strip. The officers then confiscate any shirts or shorts carrying Nike Inc.'s logo.
Although such a scene is a worst-case scenario, it could happen as a result of a dispute over trademark rights between the Beaverton, Ore., maker of athletic wear and Juan Amigo, a lawyer and associate of Nike's former distributor in Spain. 
 Nike, sponsor of American Olympic teams, had hoped for wide advertising exposure during the Games. But that hope has been dashed by a Spanish court ruling that bans the company from marketing its sports clothing during the Olympics. An appeal of the ruling, which does not forbid Nike to market its logo on shoes, is unlikely to be taken up in time for the July 25 start of the Games.
 
'Tremendous Economic Damage'
 "It's unfair that the court is supporting someone who is taking advantage of someone else's success and who is causing tremendous economic damage," complained Cesar Garcelan, marketing director of American Nike, the company's current distributor in Spain, who estimates Nike's apparel sales in Spain at more than 2 billion pesetas, or $20 million, a year.
The company must now sell its clothing line at souvenir stands in Barcelona without the logo. Lawyers for Nike estimate that at the Olympic stand, those lost apparel sales were expected to represent about 10 percent of total sales. Sports bags account for perhaps another 10 percent, with shoes, which Nike is allowed to market, representing the bulk of the sales.
Richard K. Donahue, Nike's president and chief operating officer, was quoted in the Spanish business paper Expansion as saying that the company's trademark rights have been "trampled" in Spain.
 
No Negotiation 'With Pirates'
 A United States Embassy official said that while the Embassy was supporting the American company, trademark battles often occurred in Spain and companies usually agreed to settlements in which they paid to gain control of their names. Adidas A.G. had a similar case and wound up paying.
But one Nike executive said, "Our company's policy is not to negotiate with pirates."
The former Nike distributor and Mr. Amigo are now marketing their own identical range of Nike sportswear. Various people involved in the case contend that Mr. Amigo has asked for amounts varying from an early offer of $8 million to $10 million to settle the wrangle.
Mr. Amigo and the lawyers who are handling his case were unavailable for comment.
The name Nike was first registered in Spain in 1932 by a Catalonian sock knitter and included a picture of a statue of an armless Greek goddess that stands at one of the stairway entrances to the Louvre in Paris titled, "The Victory of Samotrace." The word "NIKE" is written at the pedestal in this 1932 registration.
Mr. Amigo bought the rights to this trademark, which had never been used, in 1982. The Nike company in Oregon was granted trademark registration for shoes in 1983 and for sports clothes several years later.
Trouble started when the American company decided to change distributors in 1989 when its contract expired. Mr. Amigo, a friend and associate of the former distributor, according to Spanish Nike sources, then sought to register as a trademark a practically identical version of the United States logo, as well as some 200 versions of names using the word "Nike."
Spain's trademark registrar denied the application. Mr. Amigo then filed for an injunction banning the marketing of Nike apparel in Spain on the ground that the two logos, the 1932 Greek goddess Nike and the American trademark, were "confusing for clients." A lower court ruled in favor of the injunction in March 1991.
Nike appealed to Spain's Constitutional Court, the highest court. In April 1991, the court accepted the proceeding, but a definitive ruling is not expected for two to three years, well after the summer games.
Because the Constitutional Court normally rejects about 90 percent of all appeals, Nike applied to post bond as a precaution that would allow the company to market its logo until a final ruling was made. It lost this second proceeding July 3 and has appealed in a last-ditch effort that is unlikely to beat the Olympic deadline.
"It is absolutely incredible that this man, Mr. Juan Amigo, can affect Nike's exposure all over the world by preventing Nike from dressing the U.S. team," Mr. Garcelan complained.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Edge Up Just 0.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
Prices paid by wholesalers rose modestly in June, as widespread declines nearly offset a run-up in oil costs, the Government said today in a report that illustrated the weak level of economic demand.
The two-tenths of a percent gain in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index for Finished Goods was half the rise for May. For the first half of the year, the index increased at an annualized rate of only 2 percent. 
 "The good news is you need a microscope to see inflation, but the bad news is you need a microscope to see growth," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
In June, energy prices were up 2.3 percent, the biggest advance since October 1990, when the Persian Gulf crisis sent oil prices soaring. Saudi Arabia's call for higher oil prices helped push up crude oil prices worldwide.
But food prices rose just two-tenths of a percent. And excluding the volatile food and energy components, the index edged down one-tenth of a percent, the first decline in five years.
Economists said that while the mild inflation was a symptom of the slow recovery, it was also an important condition for better economic growth later on.
"Low inflation is about the only good news coming out of the weak economic environment," said Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
"It lays the foundation for stronger growth going forward," he added. "It's good for the profitability of most businesses. Producer prices reflect the costs that most businesses have to pay. If they're not increasing, that goes right to the bottom line."
The low level of inflation has allowed the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in an attempt to stimulate business and consumer borrowing, with little fear of aggravating inflation.
The Labor Department is scheduled to release the Consumer Price Index for June on Tuesday. In addition to the retail prices of many of the goods tracked by the producer index, it also covers services.
The latest producer price report, according to analysts, means the Fed would have little reason not to cut rates again if the economy weakened further. The Fed's most recent cut came last week when it reduced the discount rate -- the interest charged on its loans to banks, to 3 percent from 3.5 percent. This put the rate at its lowest level since 1963.
Gasoline costs rose 7.4 percent last month after a 2 percent gain in May. Fuel oil prices jumped 9 percent after a 5.7 percent rise. Natural gas was up 1.6 percent but residential electricity fell eight-tenths of a percent.
Auto prices dropped eight-tenths of a percent last month after a five-tenths of a percent decline the month before.
Fresh fruit prices fell 10 percent in June, and vegetable prices tumbled 13.7 percent. Beef and veal were down 2.2 percent, and pork, 4.2 percent. There also were drops in the costs of eggs, rice, turkeys and candy.
Prices jumped 13.5 percent for fish, however, and were also up for pasta, chickens, cooking oils, soft drinks and dairy products.
Prices fell for tobacco, home electronic equipment and women's clothing; they rose for footwear, tires, books and floor coverings.

HEADLINE: Taystee Bakery Closes in Bitterness;
Manufacturing Shift Leaves Flushing Workers Feeling Deserted, Betrayed and Afraid

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
For 20 years, Leroy Morgan rose early each morning to weigh and mix the dough at the Taystee Bakery plant in Queens. It was hard work, but he made a decent living, raised a family, bought his own house in Jamaica. Now it is over.
Just after 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, the last packages of hamburger and hot dog buns rolled off the assembly lines at Taystee, ending more than three decades of production at the hulking plant in Flushing and leaving the last of more than 500 employees without jobs, and with dim prospects for new ones. 
 "I'm like a drowning man grabbing at a straw," said Mr. Morgan, who is 52 years old. "A man at my age looking for a job, with a wife and two kids, a mortgage. I try not to think about it."
 
'What Do We Have to Lose?'
 Taystee, once the largest bakery in the nation, closed despite months of pressure by the city and state, and an against-the-odds effort by its workers, to persuade its owner, Stroehmann Bakeries, not to move it to Pennsylvania. Now the workers, supported by religious and political leaders, are fighting the closing in court, boycotting Stroehmann's products and trying to start their own bakery, mostly because they have nowhere else to go.
"We can't give up now," said Mr. Morgan, whose wife lost her job at a bank two years ago when it moved upstate. "What do we have to lose?"
Both the closing and the workers' campaign have become emblematic of the shifts in New York City's economy that have eliminated thousands of manufacturing jobs, most of them unskilled, many of them held by minorities and immigrants.
From 1979 to 1991, New York City lost 205,000 manufacturing jobs, more than 40 percent, even as its overall economy boomed over most of that time.
"In those halcyon days of the 1980's, this was the forgotten sector of the economy," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Stroehmann Bakeries, through an arrangement with the city, bought Taystee in 1988 with $5.2 million in bonds exempt from Federal, state and city taxes, and $780,000 in tax abatements. It decided to move its operation to its bakeries in Pennsylvania for many of the reasons that have led other manufacturers to leave the city.
 
Building Called Antiquated
 David H. Allshouse, the company's vice president of human resources, said that the building was antiquated and that operating costs, including wages, utilities and taxes, were too high. Stroehmann, a subsidiary of George Weston Ltd., a Toronto conglomerate, has lost at least $23 million since buying the bakery, he said.
As the operations wound down yesterday and the familiar waft of baking bread began to fade, workers already laid off gathered outside the bakery beside the Van Wyck Expressway to greet those finishing their last day. The workers, embittered and afraid, said they felt betrayed by the company that had taken over, and then abandoned, the landmark bakery.
Stroehmann has offered severance packages and $1,000 grants for retraining, but most workers say they have little chance of replacing their $12- to $14-an-hour wages and medical benefits.
"People have nowhere else to go," said Lynn Bell, a Taystee employee for 13 years, and, as the union's shop steward, the leader of the workers' campaign. "All these people out of work puts a lot of people in the unemployment lines. A lot of people, I know, will end up on welfare."
Several workers, like Jennie Call, have been through this before. Ms. Call started working at Taystee eight years ago after losing her job at a bakery in Queens that moved away. With overtime, she was making more than $30,000 a year at Taystee until she was laid off in March.
Ms. Call, 31, a native of North Carolina with a high school diploma, has looked for jobs at other bakeries so far because she wants to stay in the union and maintain her pension, but there are few openings anywhere.
"I don't think what they did was fair," Ms. Call said. "A lot of people put a lot of their lives in there."
The workers' campaign began in the Maple Crest, a bar near the plant, after Stroehmann, based in Horsham, Pa., announced in November that it would close the bakery.
At first, the workers hoped to pressure the company to reconsider, but as it became apparent that Taystee would close, they concentrated on other options, primarily the opening of an employee-owned bakery somewhere in Queens.
The campaign's leaders, who have received support from several religious and community organizations, including the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Flushing, hope to model their bakery after City Pride, a bakery in Pittsburgh being built by a coalition of church and community groups.
As if to underline their optimism, they distributed job applications outside the bakery yesterday. "I'm happy we have somewhere to go," Ms. Bell said. "Otherwise, we'd go home, collect unemployment and cry."
City and state officials have expressed support. The city's Industrial Development Agency has ordered Stroehmann to repay its tax waivers because it violated its financing agreement with the city, and has voted to use that $780,000 to help the workers open their bakery.
The city's support of the workers has underscored a realization that after years of trying to lure and keep thousands of white-collar jobs, it must do more to keep what manufacturing jobs are left.
 
Company Says It Has Buyer
 "It is clear that manufacturing has not and will not have the same role it had 50 years ago," said Wallace L. Ford 2d, the commissioner of the city's Department of Business Services. "But it is still extremely important."
The workers have also sued Stroehmann in State Supreme Court to stop the company from dismantling the plant in preparation for its sale. On Thursday, Stroehmann announced it had reached an agreement to sell the property to another company, which Mr. Allshouse would not identify except to say it was not a manufacturer.
In the meantime, the workers have pressed their boycott, partly out of vengeance, and partly to clear shelves for their own products.
"This is our chance to get back at them," Randy Bowen, a packer at Taystee for six years, said as he sat in front of a Pathmark supermarket in Flushing the other day, handing out boycott fliers. "To hurt them for taking our jobs out of the city, but sending the bread back."

HEADLINE: Bridge

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
There is no way to prove it, but it can be safely asserted that the number of home bridge games has declined in the last six decades. This is partly due to the increasing number of attractions: In the days of Ely Culbertson a bridge game with the neighbors was both convenient and economical, a consideration in the years of Depression.
A player from the 30's who was transported to the 90's would be surprised to find that the form of the game has changed. The standard rubber bridge game has given way in North America -- though not in Britain -- to Chicago or four-deal bridge. One of the few surviving regular rubber-bridge games is in East Norwalk, Conn., where the diagramed deal was played recently at the home of Dorothy Greenberg, who reported the episode. 
 Over the opening bid of one heart South leaped to four spades, and was surprised to be raised to slam. Slams with 20 points in the combined hands are rarely reached in the face of an opening bid, and this was an excellent one.
West led a heart, and South crossruffed to remove her heart losers and eventually drew trumps. Since East held the diamond king, a likely circumstance in view of the opening bid, the slam was made.
In the post-mortem it was suggested that a trump lead would have permitted the defense to prevail. It would indeed have prevented South from ruffing all the heart losers, but a loser-on-loser play would have succeeded. South would have won in dummy, led a high club, and discarded a red-suit loser. If West wins, the remaining high club can be removed from the East hand with a ruff, and all the red-suit losers disappear.
Even with the actual heart lead, this would have been a better play, for the danger that West has the diamond king is greater than the danger that he has both the ace and queen of clubs.
A diamond opening lead would have been somewhat awkward. Playing low from dummy would have allowed East to win and shift to a trump, so the winning play would be to take the ace, crossruff, and eventually lead a diamond toward the king. South would then feel foolish in the unlikely event that West had led a diamond away from the king. [Diagram]

A Native Son's Hopeful Return

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
APPROXIMATELY 15 minutes into Rolando Blackman's first official interview as a New York Knick, someone produced a newspaper clipping from 1977 that showed pictures of a group of New York city high school basketball stars.
In the middle, with the biggest picture, was Albert King, the star of Alexander Hamilton High School who was being billed as the greatest high school player in New York City history. There were also pictures of Riley Clarida, Joe Foster, Larry Washington. Not recognizable names now, but high school megastars then. 
 In the upper right-hand part of the page there was a small photo of a thin, young-looking player with a big Afro who played for Grady High School in Brooklyn.
Blackman looked at his picture, smiled and shook his head as memories returned.
"This was a time when I had no goals whatsoever as far as playing basketball," he said, laughing. "I was just trying to get a scholarship and go to school. All these guys were talking about being pros."
Blackman received his scholarship. He left the city on a journey that carried him to Manhattan, Kan., and Kansas State University, then to the National Basketball Association, where he spent 11 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks. In more than a decade Blackman established himself as a clutch player and a consistently deadly outside shooter.
Yesterday, Blackman began his newest odyssey, with the Knicks, who obtained the 33-year-old guard from Dallas for a first-round draft choice in 1995. The deal seems to be a gift.
Blackman could be the bridge, if not the missing link, to New York's ascendancy to an Eastern Conference championship.
Despite the Knicks' spectacular playoff run last spring, the coaching staff continued to stress the need for a consistent, lethal perimeter threat. There was an unspoken desire for a player who did not run from the ball in clutch situations. Blackman, it seems, fits the bill.
New York represents a rejuvenation for Blackman after playing with a team that lost 60 games last year. The trade also fulfills his teen-age dream of playing for the Knicks in Madison Square Garden.
"My dad used to bring me to the basketball games -- we didn't have the best seats; we were pretty high up," said Blackman. "You could only see 10 people running up and down the court; you really couldn't make anybody out. But at least we were at the Knick game.
"Of course, the applied pressures are greater here in New York. But the up side can be greater, too. For me the most important thing is being consistent."
A few changes have been made in New York in Blackman's absence. When he left the city for Kansas State in the fall of 1977, Ed Koch was elected Mayor and the Knicks were coming off a 40-42 season in which they failed to make the playoffs.
Fifteen years later, the city has its first African-American Mayor -- David N. Dinkins -- and the Knicks suddenly find themselves perhaps one point guard away from challenging Chicago for the Eastern Conference championship. In other respects, Blackman is returning to a city whose basic personality has remained unchanged. New York continues to be an expanding fabric of ethnic diversity with each group jockeying for elbow room and fighting to attach its signature to the city's political, cultural and economic tapestry.
Just as he has followed the Knicks' various ups and downs, Blackman has followed the city's social turmoil. Earlier this week he and his wife, Tamara, and one of his three daughters, 9-year-old Valarie, arrived in New York to the news of violence in Washington Heights in the aftermath of the shooting death of a Dominican man by a New York City police officer.
"It's like a little war going on here," said Blackman, who is vice president of the N.B.A. players association. "Communities are trying to come together and achieve peace, but it's just not happening. You have unrest in Manhattan. You have it in Queens. You have it in Brooklyn. It's not like everything is peachy keen and wonderful. In my basketball world it is. Outside of it, people are struggling and dealing with real life. I'm aware of that."
In addition to the athletic gifts he is expected to provide, Blackman may provide a needed intellectual presence to a team that is aspiring to a higher plane and to a city that could use enlightened perspectives from as many avenues as possible. "I don't know how I can help, but I know I'm going to be part of that effort to get out there and help," he said.
For a number of reasons, Blackman seems to be returning to the right place at the right time.

Kirov's National Style, Before Homogenization

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
It is hard to know how to judge musical performing groups from Russia and Eastern Europe these days. Although distinctive national vocal and instrumental styles have already largely disappeared in the West (and how might the earlymusickers bring those back?), much variety of coloration and accent still survives in the former Soviet bloc. But it probably cannot long endure in an era of heightened interchange with the West, despite the frenzied nationalism of the moment.
Under the circumstances, with so many venerable traditions in danger, it becomes too easy to adopt a skewed esthetic for a company like the Kirov Opera, setting aside relatively bland international standards of excellence and seeking Russian-ness for its own sake (though not mere provincialism of the sort displayed this year in New York by the St. Petersburg National Opera). But of course, the Kirov and other companies are entitled to their international aspirations as well and can only be judged accordingly. So there is little for the traditionalist to do but luxuriate in the remnants of the great national sounds where they can still be heard. 
 Fortunately, the Kirov's first performance of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov" at the Metropolitan Opera House, on Thursday evening, offered a wealth of national flavor in the singing and playing. At the same time, it met the highest current international standard. Indeed, it was remarkable in this house to hear such evenness of casting and such strength in the minor roles.
The production, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky with additional staging by Stephen Lawless, had less to offer. The dinginess of the single set, designed by Nikolai Dvigubsky, probably stemmed as much from the economic realities faced by the company and the exigencies of touring as from an attempt to suggest the woes of a nation decaying under Boris's rule.
In any case, the dinginess was concealed by washes of smoke in the prologue, affording the coronation scene a semblance of grandeur, and it never hampered the real work of the opera, carried out in the individual characterizations and crowd scenes. Its economy, in fact, brought to mind the Met's own production of Mussorgsky's "Khovanshchina," which was conceived on the cheap but has served as the backdrop for some stirring evenings.
Mr. Dvigubsky's costumes were lively, and the lighting added brilliant effects. There were few props to speak of, although the human "statues" in the Polish garden lent a nice touch of whimsy. On the other hand, ponderous symbols fell heavily, notably a mammoth pendulum, replacing the clock whose chiming unhinges Boris.
Compared with the Borises usually encountered in this house, imposing of voice and stature, Nikolai Okhotnikov seemed at first a lightweight, but he quickly won listeners over with the power and the expressivity of his characterization.
Gegam Grigorian, as the Pretender Dmitri, fell short of a few high notes but rang out spectacularly on others. Olga Borodina sang Marina beautifully. Sergei Leiferkus was exquisitely despicable as Rangoni, and Mikhail Kit carried Pimen's part with strength and dignity. Other considerable vocal pleasures came from Tatyana Kravtsova's Kseniya, Larisa Dyadkova's Fyodor and Nikolai Putilin's Shchelkalov.
Vladimir Ognovenko proved a delightful comic actor as well as a sturdy bass as the vagabond monk Varlaam, and Vladimir Solodovnikov gave an affecting portrayal of the Simpleton. For the rest, the vocal and theatrical work was solid, even down to the brief appearance of the two Jesuit priests.
But the real stars of this show were Valery Gergiyev's orchestra and chorus. Only in the choral work could purists find any of the nasal stridency that used to characterize so much Russian singing in high registers and grate on the Western ear. The orchestral winds, too, lacked most of the swagger once typical of Russian playing, but the strings gave off a haunting darkness. In general, the playing substituted a wonderful pliancy for the machine-tooled precision usually heard from the Met pit.
Mr. Gergiyev, using the re-orchestration by Dmitri Shostakovich, included almost all the music Mussorgsky wrote for his two main versions of the work, but he kept things moving nicely. His careful preparation was evident in the way even the most unwieldy scenes held together in surroundings unfamiliar to most of the performers.
"Boris Godunov" will have its four last performances next week with varied casts.

HEADLINE: Adirondacks Will Remain a Wilderness Without More Rules

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Last Stand for the Adirondacks?" by John B. Oakes (Op-Ed, June 19): As the editor of Adirondack Life magazine for more than three years, and owner of a camp in the Adirondacks, I can testify that regulations galore exist to protect and preserve the Adirondacks. The sole purpose of the large and hard-working Adirondack Park Agency is to administer those regulations. 
 More regulations are not needed. Developers aren't waiting to tear up the woods. If the current legislation is not passed, the Adirondacks will not lose their wilderness character.
State Senator Ronald Stafford, who represents the Adirondacks, is doing what an elected official is supposed to do in a democracy: follow the wishes of his constituents, who are against additional regulations.
Outside the villages of Lake Placid and Lake George, the Adirondacks lack "intense speculative pressure," in boom times or recession. The reasons for lack of speculation: (1) no potential for profit; (2) an abundance of regulations; (3) the long distance from New York City; (4) long, cold winters, and (5) black flies.
In the last decade the populations of the only two counties entirely in the Adirondacks, Essex and Hamilton, have stayed the same or declined. Very little building, including second homes, is going on anywhere. Adirondack Park is there for everyone in this state, including those who live there, to enjoy.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Tourism After the Riots

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD; ROBERT REINHOLD is chief of the Los Angeles bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
ONLY a few days after the riots and arson that wreaked havoc on Los Angeles in April, a group of intrepid Italian tourists rebelled during their Starline Tour of movie-star swankiendas in Beverly Hills. They told the bus driver they preferred to see riot wreckage, and he obligingly wheeled around to the charred hulks of what had been shops in Koreatown, where the passengers happily snapped pictures of the blackened rubble.
The riot had become a kind of tourist attraction in the land of make-believe, a real-life mirror image of the fake mayhem Hollywood studios stage for celluloid and television. But if one tour group took a certain perverse curiosity in the terrible events that followed the acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney G. King, the same cannot be said for the Japanese or most other visitors to the Los Angeles area. 
 The tourism and travel industry in what is the largest hotel market in the world with 86,000 rooms is struggling to recover from a body blow, and the experts say it could take years to return to pre-riot levels. While tourism always suffers after natural calamities, such as the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco area, studies have shown that violent civil and political disorders have a much more lasting effect on travel plans than natural upheavals.
The June 28 earthquake -- whose epicenter was in the high desert near Landers, 125 miles east of Los Angeles -- is a case in point. Although it was the biggest quake in California in 40 years, reaching 7.4 on the Richter scale and underscoring fears of a major quake in the city itself, it did relatively little damage for its size. Hotel and resort operators in Palm Springs and other desert resorts just south of the epicenter said it had only a fleeting effect on bookings and business. There were cancellations for two days, then business quickly returned almost to normal.
The immediate effects of the riots were dramatic. With graphic televised news reports that carried terrifying images of murder, burning and looting on the streets of Los Angeles throughout the world, visitors canceled by the thousands in the first few days. Even those who went, or were there, found little to do, hemmed in by a five-day curfew that kept most restaurants, clubs, shows and movie houses shut at night. By one estimate, the city lost $146 million in direct spending by out-of-town visitors, mainly in downtown and Hollywood, during just the first five days.
At the Hollywood Tour and Gift Shop, next to the fabled Mann's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard, business during the first month or so after the riot was down by 75 percent, with a loss of as much as $50,000 a day in sales of movie kitsch. Downtown, the New Otani, a Japanese-owned hotel that caters mainly to visiting Japanese business people, lost half its normal occupancy in May, though it picked up substantially in June. Hotel occupancy in Los Angeles in May and June was 50 percent, down 15 percent from March, the month before the riots, and down 20 percent in May and June of 1990, the Convention and Visitors Bureau reported. (In this period in 1991 figures were depressed by the Gulf war.) Actually, the occupancy rates in May-June this year would have fallen by about 40 percent had it not been for the thousands of National Guard troops accommodated in hotels.
Japanese business at the landmark Yamashiro Restaurant, in a massive Buddhist temple-like structure on a hill overlooking Hollywood, has been slow, according to Thomas Y. Glover, the owner. It is not only visitors who are nervous. Mark Peel, a co-owner of the fashionable Campanile restaurant on South La Brea Avenue near Hollywood, says that many of his regulars from the affluent Westside have avoided the restaurant because when they exit the Santa Monica Freeway they must drive along a stretch of La Brea Avenue that was looted and burned in the riots. But Californians have continued to visit attractions like Disneyland -- 30 miles south of downtown Los Angeles -- that are not near areas affected by the riots.
If there has been a gradual recovery in recent weeks, local officials are uneasy about the summer high season for Los Angeles tourism -- already recession-stricken -- and for the long-term prospects. After the riots, the Convention and Visitors Bureau commissioned a special report from the San Francisco consulting firm Economics Research Associates. The report said that, before the disturbances, tourism generated $16.6 billion a year in direct and indirect economic activity in Los Angeles County, including $3.6 billion in incomes and the equivalent of 196,000 full-time jobs.
THE study estimated a decline in foreign tourism of 30 to 40 percent this summer and forecast a loss of $1.1 billion in visitor spending and 31,000 jobs over the next year. Over the long term, a decline of 15 to 25 percent and a loss of 14,000 jobs was forecast. As for domestic tourism, the report anticipated less damage, 15 to 25 percent in the short run, 5 to 10 percent in the long term. The task of repairing the image will be hardest among foreign tourists, who account for 22 percent of the visitors and a far greater share of the spending; most, 700,000 a year, are Japanese.
"We were their principal gateway into the country, so the imagery from civil disturbances is really punishing," said Michael Collins, vice president of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. "People in Osaka saw burning streets and violence on their TV screens with 'Los Angeles' written underneath. Our challenge is to show the scale, to show the large areas where this did not happen, and it will take a year or two to do that."
Indeed, the average visitor to the Los Angeles area will, like the Italians on the bus tour, have to go out of his way to find evidence of the disorders. The hardest hit areas, South-Central Los Angeles and Koreatown, are off the beaten tourist path. There was substantial looting and arson in Hollywood -- along Hollywood, Sunset and Santa Monica Boulevards -- but that has mostly been cleaned up now. Some visitors, along with Angelenos, were caught in the terror of the initial outbreaks of violence, but they were not a particular target. No hotels were burned or looted. The glittery boutiques on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, which now cater mainly to Japanese tourists, are as over-priced as ever. f
But none of this is likely to soothe fears quickly. "The travel industry's vulnerability to capricious and volatile events is immense," the economic report stated. "Violent acts of nature or manmade disturbances can create total disruption, upheaval and chaos to the tourism industry. The quest for paradise -- or just a fun place -- suddenly transforms into a dangerous journey that most travelers would rather avoid."
The economists compared the impact of crises on four other destinations heavily dependent on foreign tourism: Fiji after the coup in 1987, Sri Lanka during the Tamil uprising that intensified in 1985, China and Hong Kong after the Tiananmen Square protests and killings in 1988, and the San Francisco earthquake in October 1989.
In the first three cases, all involving civil unrest, the study found "rapid and long lasting" drops in foreign visitors compared with the levels expected had each area maintained its share of tourism growth for the Pacific area. The decrease was more than 30 percent for Fiji and Sri Lanka, 22 percent for China and 12 percent for Hong Kong. By contrast, San Francisco tourism had returned to normal a year after the quake.
The actual impact on Los Angeles will not be clear for some time, but this summer's high season should provide a good indicator of how severe the damage is. During other seasons, local tourism accounts for most of the traffic at such attractions as the Universal Studios Tour and Disneyland, and that has been largely undeterred. But the summer trade is more heavily dependent on out-of-towners. Tour operators report that Japanese visitors are hesitantly returning, particularly if business calls. Japanese tourists are more cautious, either opting for other destinations like Hawaii, Florida and the Caribbean or, if they still come to Southern California, choosing hotels far from the riot areas in Anaheim, Santa Monica and the Century City area.
Hotel and tourism leaders have begun the daunting task of trying to neutralize the searing television images seen worldwide. Within 24 hours of the outbreak of violence, the Convention and Visitors Bureau started to issue soothing communications by telephone and fascimile to such organizations as the American Society of Travel Agents, the United States Travel and Tourism Administration and the American Bus Association. The messages said the area's visitor attractions were unaffected and open for business. Similar messages were given to airline reservations systems, to Canadian tour operators and American consular offices abroad.
THEN, a week after the riots, bureau staff members fanned out to key foreign markets, meeting with tour wholesalers and airline officials in Japan, Korea, Australia, Britain, Germany and France. A week later, Disneyland was host to a group of visiting journalists from Britain, Germany and Italy who "spent a full day in Los Angeles, 14 days after disturbances began, to experience local attractions, restaurants and sightseeing opportunities first hand," to quote a release from the Convention Bureau. The theme park paid for the visitors' trip. In addition, the bureau took a topographical map exhibit of Los Angeles County to a major international travel meeting "to help orient the trade and pinpoint area attractions." The map presumably was meant to show how far the attractions were from mostly black and Hispanic South-Central Los Angeles where the worst unrest occurred.
Just how effective all this will be remains to be seen. Los Angeles is quiet now, with a veneer of normality covering deep-seated racial tensions. Over the next several months more trials are scheduled: for the one police officer still under charges in the Rodney King beating and for hundreds charged with arson, assault, theft and murder in the riots. The response to these verdicts will have as much to do with the capacity of Los Angeles to resume its tourism role as the fantasy getaway land as anything the fretful hotel and tourism people can do.

The big sleeper of the Kirov Ballet season was the revival of Leonid Lavrovsky's "Romeo and Juliet," created in 1940. Common wisdom had it that Lavrovsky's remarkable fusion of mime and dancing would look old-fashioned, that this Socialist Realist epic with decadent aristocrats pitted against "the people" could no longer be taken seriously.
Surprisingly, this once-controversial treatment of Prokofiev's score (seen in New York with the Bolshoi in 1959) was a superb revelation all over again. Here was dramatic realism made marvelously bold and conveyed through a choreographic style totally different from that seen in the West. In dance-dramas like Antony Tudor's, body language symbolizes psychological truths. (A fall might telegraph an emotional collapse.) In this "Romeo and Juliet," a gesture communicates its meaning directly. Yet such movement is never naturalistic but is incorporated into a gestural flow. The Juliet of Galina Ulanova, with her seamless line, introduced this sculptural and supple silhouette to the West and left hundreds of viewers deeply moved. 
 The Kirov's current leads looked more academic in their dancing, although the Bolshoi-trained Nina Ananiashvili and Andris Liepa, who were guest stars this season at the Metropolitan Opera House, showed genuine passion. Altynai Asylmuratova and Konstantin Zaklinsky were too sophisticated. Alekasandr Gulyayev partnered two Juliets: the lyrical Zhanna Ayupova and the more glittering Larissa Lezhnina. All three tended to be presentational in manner, drawing attention to themselves as dancers, not characters.
While this "Romeo and Juliet," restaged by Oleg Vinogradov, the company's artistic director, focuses on Juliet, there is another main character: the people. Lavrovsky's sure sense of dramatic structure is felt in the first scene, as he builds the action slowly from a spare beginning to an action-filled panorama. Much of the ballet's stunning pictorial impact comes from the sets, which are based on Pyotr Williams's originals. These do not use the checkerboard floor of the Bolshoi staging, and the curtain opens on a classical landscape.
There is no Rosaline, but Romeo, because he enters sleepily, may have been courting. It is morning, and he touches a Bacchus-like statue for luck. The town square begins to stir with activity. Three wenches plunge into a folk dance with Capulet men, who bar the path of two Montagues. Brilliantly, economically, this provocation sets the scene for the clan strife that explodes into highly animated dueling.
The interior scenes are danced against the simulated richness of Renaissance frescoes and tapestries. Juliet's playfulness with an ambling nurse is cut short momentarily by her haughty mother, penetratingly portrayed by Nina Mikhailova, who orders her daughter to meet Paris.
As much as Lavrovsky meant to bring out the aristocracy's decadence, the Kirov currently exaggerates some telling scenes. En route to the Capulet ball, a husband storms out after finding his wife in the arms of another man. A vain Paris preens before a mirror held by a page and ignores a handkerchief dropped by an admirer. The page picks it up and blows a kiss.
Later, in Act II, three women in men's clothing, all part of traditional Renaissance fun, come reeling in with Tybalt and his friends and kick a fruit seller.
The ballroom scene is resplendent. In a huge fresco, Europa is seen sitting astride her bull while below the Capulet banquet is in full swing amid goblets, tables and dazzling candelabra. Tybalt stands atop one of the tables, which are cleared for the now-legendary dance of the cushions. The Capulets advance with pillows, kneel on them and grab their partners in a voracious embrace.
The classical idiom, reserved until now for Juliet in her first scene, is expanded in her duet with Paris and later in her first encounter with Romeo. The image that Miss Ulanova made famous and which recurs in the lovers' other duets is seen here for the first time: Romeo lifts Juliet so that she is kneeling on his chest and looking down lovingly at his face.
A classical divertissement by seven troubadours and Juliet's friends leads into a moment that is surely one of the ballet's dramatic highlights. Juliet is told that Romeo is a Montague: Tragedy is foreshadowed by her reaction.
Miss Ananiashvili brought her hand to her mouth in horror and bowed her head. Miss Lezhnina looked dazed. Miss Asylmuratova closed her eyes. Miss Ayupova needed time for the thought to sink in before tilting her chin upward in determination.
The two key pas de deux for the lovers amplify the motifs of their first duet. But vivid contrasts color the second act. Revelers cavort on a terrace above the square, which becomes filled with colorful folk dances and a jesters' quintet. On the other hand, Friar Laurence's cell is austere, and Romeo strews lilies in Juliet's path before he marries her.
This version leaves no doubt that Tybalt kills Mercutio on purpose, and the best characterizations came from two different performers. Dmitri Korneyev made Tybalt a lout. Gennadi Bababin was more aristocratic and sardonic. When Lady Capulet, sitting on Tybalt's body as it was carried aloft, swore revenge, the townsfolk below cringed at the promised violence.
Indeed, the Soviet dance historian Yuri Slonimsky saw Lavrovsky's theme as "the unequal struggle waged by the children of tomorrow against the injustice of yesterday." Lavrovsky's stroke of genius consisted of his never losing sight of the love story while placing in it an interpretive social context. We might not agree with that context, but he gave the death of Romeo and Juliet a dimension that most Western versions omit. He reconciled the clans at the end and thus remained true to Shakespeare.

HEADLINE: New Federal Law For the Disabled Slow to Take Hold

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
WHEN the Americans With Disabilities Act took effect in January, it was heralded as a revolutionary Federal civil rights law that would radically revamp commercial real estate, removing many of the countless barriers that block the physically handicapped from moving throughout restaurants, offices, hotels, airports, theaters and myriad other privately owned places open to the public.
The day after the law took effect, groups representing the disabled in New York City began filing complaints with the Department of Justice against the owners of the Empire State Building, the Hotel Inter-Continental and other properties for failing to comply with a key provision that requires people who own or operate places of "public accommodation" to remove architectural barriers if the changes are "readily achievable." 
 In the last six months, however, most of those first complaints remain unresolved, the number of new ones has swelled, and businesses, landlords, real-estate companies and the disabled are all questioning the efficacy of the law, which was passed by Congress two years ago.
The most vexing problem appears to be defining "readily achievable."
" 'Readily achievable' is not a particularly high standard, and it is very vague," said Brian Diamond, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in advising landlords on how to comply with the law.
"From the perspective of an owner attempting to comply," Mr. Diamond said, "you are given very little guidance in what it means."
To be sure, many property owners and their tenants -- both parties are liable -- have improved access for the disabled or are making sincere attempts to comply with the law's voluminous and somewhat arcane guidelines.
Last month, for example, the owners of the Hotel Inter-Continental, at 111 East 48th Street, agreed to build a ramp to make the building accessible from the street. They also agreed to other structural changes, including making the restaurant, bar, bathrooms and public telephones accessible to the disabled.
"It is an example for the hotel industry to follow in making their facilities truly hospitable to their guests with disabilities," said Herbert Semmel, an attorney with non-profit New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, which is representing Disabled in Action, a civil rights organization.
For the most part, though, the impact of the law is not yet what its proponents had hoped. "There will be good faith efforts to comply, and others will have to be pushed," said Deborah B. Beck, the executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York. She also said that the troubled economic times made compliance even more difficult for many property owners.
"The recession, coupled with the fact that there is a real liquidity crisis in the marketplace, not enough capital to do improvements, means that this is an environment where people are looking at profit margins and saying we cannot spend this money," she said. "Compliance will be a slow, gradual process. The responsible owner of office properties wants to make them accessible, but the constraints of the marketplace are such that it will be unlikely that there will be a massive infusion of capital going into A.D.A. work."
The costs may be particularly high for some older buildings, such as the Empire State Building.
"IN many office buildings, the corridor sizes in the primary entrances are of a dimension that would be considered in compliance," Ms. Beck said. "The major problems that occur are in vertical transportation. Some older buildings, particularly wedding-cake-shaped buildings, are not accessible because they sometimes have a floor at the top that encloses the top of the elevator shaft, and those upper floors are accessed by a stairway. In a more contemporary building, such as the World Trade Center, it is accessible."
The six-month-old, unresolved complaint against the Empire State concerns three flights of stairs that keep most disabled people from entering the 86th-floor observatory, gift shops, bathrooms or snack bars, which can be reached only by stairs. Though the 102d floor is accessible to the disabled by elevator, the observatory on that floor is not. The structural barriers on this floor, however, are not part of the complaint.
"The only thing that could possibly be done to enable someone to look at the view from a wheelchair is build something that they could wheel up on, and I don't think there is enough floor space to do that on the 102d floor," said Cary LaCheen, staff attorney with the New York Lawyers for the Public Interest. "That's why it is critical that the 86th floor be made accesible."
Joseph J. Carella, a spokesman for building, said its owners, Helmsley-Spear, would not comment until the complaint was resolved with the Justice Department. "We are looking to resolve this as soon as possible," he said.
Mr. Carella added that signs have been placed throughout the building that direct people in wheelchairs to where they can get access information or assistance. He said that some disabled persons, if they are able to stand, could, with the help of building personnel, maneuver the stairs. He also said that those unable to stand could be lifted up and down the stairs.
"The building makes every attempt to assist the visitors," he said.
Mr. Semmel, however, has been sharply critical of the Empire State Building owner's actions. The new signs are misleading, he said, "because someone would get the impression that there is some way to get up into the towers, where, in fact, they can't." He added that carrying the physically disabled up and down the stairs was "totally unacceptable" because it was not only an indignity but also increased the likelihood of an accident for which the landlord would be liable.
Mr. Semmel also said that the Empire State Building owners were refusing to negotiate a settlement, attempting to delay compliance and hoped to force an expensive legal battle. He added that the situation had been exacerbated by the length of time the Justice Department has been taking to investigate the complaints.
"They aren't going anywhere because the Justice Department doesn't have the staff to handle them," he said. "They have hundreds of complaints from all over the country, and they have to check everything out themselves."
SINCE the law took effect the Justice Department has received 286 complaints from around the nation; most deal with physical barriers in existing structures. The complaints, all but a handful of which are ongoing, are being investigated by eight lawyers and two architects. Three more lawyers are expected to join the staff within a few weeks. The department has requested an additional nine lawyers for the fiscal year that begins in October.
John R. Dunne, the assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, said that it was not overwhelmed by complaints.
"Right now, we feel it is under control," he said. "What the future will bring we can't be sure, but we have made a request to Congress for additional personnel."
The ratio of lawyers to complaints is about the same for other civil areas the Justice Department investigates, he said.
He also defended the length of time the department has taken investigating most of the complaints. "One complaint might be six weeks, another a year," he said.
Thus far, penalties for violating the new law -- which is only one section, Title III, of a sweeping anti-discrimination act -- can be levied only against large companies. Businesses with 25 or fewer employees and gross receipts of less than $1 million do not have to come into compliance until July 26. Businesses with 10 or fewer employees and gross revenue of less than $500,000 do not have to comply until next Jan. 26.
The new Federal law does not apply to residential buildings. But residential buildings do fall under the city's five-year-old Local Law 58, which imposes obligations on landlords to increase accessibility for the handicapped when a building is being renovated or altered, or if the building is newly constructed. Existing walk-up buildings, as well as one- and two-family homes, are exempted.
The city's strict local law also applies to commercial buildings and areas of public accommodation that are being renovated or newly constructed.
Unlike the Federal law, though, it does not mandate making existing areas of public accommodation accessible to the disabled where "readily achievable."
"There are many, many buildings already in compliance," said Jerry Lieberman, a senior vice president for property administration with Olympia & York Companies (USA). "The local law here is so stringent that little needs to be done."
In multi-use buildings that are primarily residential but have some areas of public accommodation, such as a laundry or a restaurant, the areas of public accommodation must comply with the new Federal law while the residential areas will continue to fall under the local law.
Thus, the principal impact of the Federal law will be on existing privately owned buildings that offer public accommodation. In these, existing architectural or communications barriers must be removed if the removal can be "readily achieved" without significant difficulty or expense.
There are no estimates on how much it costs landlords to bring areas of public accommodation into compliance, but the expense is substantial.
"You could easily spend $100,000 plus redoing a restroom," Mr. Lieberman said.
COST aside, one of the biggest questionmarks about the implementation of the law is how the phrase "readily achieved" will be interpreted. The law does say the cost of doing the work and the financial wherewithal of the owner should be considered when disputes over compliance arise.
"What a mom-and-pop grocery store might have to do is different from what Macy's might have to do," said Robert Boehlert, the counsel for the state Office of the Advocate for the Disabled.
Mr. Diamond noted that there is no certification process.
"We have been unable to get architects and consultants to tell us where readily achievable ends," he said. "You always want to comply. But you may not want to overcomply, and the vagueness of the law makes that very difficult."
And, he added, regardless of how much good faith a building owner may show, building owners might still end up in litigation.
The law allows an individual who has been subjected to disability discrimination, or who has reasonable grounds to believe that he or she is about to be discriminated against, to bring a civil action in court. In addition, the Department of Justice is authorized to investigate any alleged violations of the public accommodation provisions of the act and sue violators. If the owners or operators are found in violation, they can face fines up to $50,000 for the first offense and $100,000 for subsequent violations of the same offense.
Mr. Diamond also noted that those penalties might be dwarfed by legal expenses and the cost of a court-ordered redesign and construction.
"The law certainly has its troubles, but, hopefully, over time, these things will get hammered out," he said. "Any compliance law takes time to evolve over judicial hearings.
"Owners, though, should be in a position to know what is readily achievable and not readily achievable," he added. "And landlords should make sure that tenants comply because the burden is on both of them, irrespective of the fact that the landlord has written a lease that says the tenant is responsible. The A.D.A. gives the Department of Justice the right to look at both jointly."
Mr. Diamond noted that banks will also inquire about compliance with the law before lending money for a building renovation or construction.
"WE have been advising our clients that compliance is their responsibility," he said. "One would hope that eventually, even without the Department of Justice seeking enforcement at every opportunity, every building will fall into compliance just because of the increased business risk."
Several large New York City landlords, such as Olympia & York and Chase Manhattan Bank, have begun surveying their properties to determine what they will have to do to comply with the law.
Amy Sudol, a spokeswoman for Chase Manhattan, said that the new law has prompted the bank to hold sensitivity training sessions for employees who encounter the disabled and install TTDs -- telecommunications devices for the deaf -- in service areas. The bank has also recently added a ramp to the main entrance at Chase Manhattan Plaza on Cedar Street.
"We have tried to work with the handicapped to see what their needs are," Ms. Sodol said, noting that the bank has met with the Lighthouse, a nonprofit organization that supports the disabled.
Olympia & York has also made some structural changes in response to the new law.
"We are putting signage in place, changing doors, adding Braille characters," Mr. Lieberman said. "These are safety issues, and they have to be addressed. Besides, it makes a lot more sense economically to address these issues now, rather than later."

How David (Westchester) Beat Goliath (Connecticut)

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
IN what has been described as a "slugfest," Westchester County recently went toe-to-toe with Connecticut in a fight to hold onto a multimillion-dollar corporation that was looking to expand outside of the county.
In the end, Westchester scored a knockout. JWP Inc., a multinational technology company, agreed to lease 78,000 square feet of office space in the village of Rye Brook for its world headquarters and other operations, despite an offer of more than $3 million in relocation perks by Connecticut. 
 "It was important for us to keep this company," said Norma Drummond, an economic development specialist for the county's Office of Commerce and Economic Development. "With this move, the company will triple its square footage and bring new people and jobs into the county."
JWP, a New York Stock Exchange company with holdings in electronics, mechanical equipment, computers and information services, had revenues of $3.6 billion last year. It plans to move in August into a structure vacant for five years in the six-building Royal Executive Park, on King Street.
"With this lease, the first two phases of the development are now fully occupied," said Anthony P. Grant, chief executive officer of London and Leeds Development Corporation, the project's developer. "We're now looking at the third phase of the development, which would be for 345,000 square feet. We have the outline for the site plan, but don't know when we'll start on that."
JWP will vacate its current site in Purchase, where it leases 30,000 square feet for its corporate headquarters. That operation, with 125 employees, will move into the new Rye Brook building. It also will relocate its voice and data unit from Canton, Mass.
"The company wanted to bring down 225 people, but now it looks like only 125 employees will be relocating," said Ms. Drummond. "So some new jobs will be created."
The story of the county's fight to keep JWP testifies to the lengths local governments will go to these days to retain or attract business.
The effort began last February when JWP first approached the county. "They alerted us they were in the very preliminary stages of relocating to Connecticut or expanding in Westchester," Ms. Drummond said.
The company looked at buildings in Stamford and Greenwich, and was offered financial incentives, including the entire cost of relocation, for a total of more than $3 million, said Margaret S. Soter, director of Westchester's economic development agency.
In the last year and a half, Connecticut has stressedjob retention and creation. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker has made jobs his top priority. As a result, the state's Department of Economic Development has an array of loan and grant programs available to help businesses looking to expand in or relocate to the state. A spokesman for the agency declined to specify the incentives offered.
In contrast, Westchester seemed ill-equipped to compete, with few financial incentives in its arsenal.
When apprised of JWP's intentions, the county's economic development agency promptly got touch with Alfred B. DelBello, former lieutenant governor and Westchester County Executive, who now works as a private lawyer and unpaid consultant to the county.
"He's called the czar of the county," said Salvatore M. Cresenzi, Mayor of Rye Brook. "He knows a tremendous number of people and was really the catalyst to the whole negotiation."
Mr. DelBello worked in conjunction with the economic development agency, the Village of Rye Brook and the Town of Rye, in a coordinated attempt to persuade JWP to stay in Westchester. They could not find a state program that would induce a company to stay, according to Mr. DelBello, "especially when you're trying to compete against an offer like Connecticut's."
All they really had was bonds issued by Westchester's Industrial Development Agency, but since JWP decided to lease instead of buy, these did not apply. So they had to create something.
"YOU have to let a company know that you love them," Mr. DelBello said, "and you have to create a pro-business climate for them to operate in."
The major financial component of the eventual deal offered to JWP was a 33 percent reduction in property taxes on the Rye Brook buildings, to $534,000 a year from $784,000, retroactive to last year. Technically, that reduction goes to the owner of the buildings, which in this case is London and Leeds. But, said Mayor Cresenzi, "we were given an ironclad guarantee that those savings would be passed on to JWP."
In addition, the county is going to help JWP relocate its employees. "We're looking into what educational grants might be available to them, and we're going to help with other quality-of-life issues," said Ms. Drummond.
Despite Westchester's best intentions, some companies do cross the border to Connecticut, lured by offers they feel they can't refuse.
"We recently moved a few companies from Westchester," said Joseph M. Cohen, the spokesman for Connecticut's Department of Economic Development. "I can't say their names because they haven't made an announcement yet. Very few companies leave Connecticut for Westchester."
Purdue Frederick Company, an international pharmaceutical concern, announced last month that it would be moving its research and development division from Yonkers to a 156,000-square-foot building in Norwalk. The company already has several associated companies in Connecticut, with a total of 300 employees.
"We wanted to have our research facility on the same site as our corporate headquarters," said Howard R. Udell, the company's group vice president and general counsel. "The Connecticut building met our needs for the future."
THE move is expected to bring 100 to 125 new jobs. The state and the City of Norwalk offered the company incentives worth more than $2 million, including a flat-out reimbursement of $1 million in relocation costs.
The other $1 million will be garnered mainly from local property tax abatements and corporation tax credits.
Governor Weicker said that the Purdue Frederick deal "is a tremendous credit to the economic recovery package Connecticut has put in place to rebuild business and industry and provide a job to everyone who wants one."
Aside from the financial perks, a major component in the company's decision was the desire to consolidate its operations in a familiar environment.
The same could be said of JWP's decision to remain in Westchester. Most of the company's top executives already live in the county, and it would have been "disruptive ot our employee base" to move to Connecticut, according to a company spokesman.
Some people believe that companies are taking unfair advantage of the current economic downturn by threatening to relocate to gain financial incentives.
One multinational chemical company, the Loctite Corporation, pointedly declined public-sector assistance when it decided to build a new corporate headquarters and research and development facility in Rocky Hill Ken Butterworth, chairman of Locite -- which expects to add 40 to 50 people to its current workforce of 540 -- said Connecticut has "more pressing needs, than providing taxpayer dollars to profitable corporations."
Whether JWP would have remained in Westchester without the financial perks provided by the county was a risk no one wanted to take.
"When a company like that says they're going to leave the county, you can't just sit on the sidelines," said Rye Brook's Mayor Cresenzi. "You've got to do something."

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Darien Gets a New Chinese Restaurant

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
THE economy may stumble but chances are there will always be a new Chinese restaurant opening.
One of the most attractive to do so in recent months is Li's Brothers Inn in Darien. The restaurant, which occupies a large space in the Good Wives Shopping Center, is obviously a serious enterprise, not a neighborhood chop suey parlor. Frosted glass panels at the entrance lead into a spacious dining room with a pale plum patterned wallpaper, Chinese art and lacquered wainscoting. A green and rose carpet, well-spaced tables with comfortable high-back chairs and tapes of soft Chinese music add to the dining experience, which is enhanced considerably by an unusually considerate and well-trained staff. 
While all this merely sets the table for the main event -- the food -- it does indicate a purposefulness. When the menus appeared we were ready. Unfortunately, the offerings are much the same as so many Chinese restaurant menus, with the usual bases touched: General Tang's chicken, Hunan lamb, moo goo gai pan, Peking duck, moo shu pork and various seafood, poultry, pork, beef and vegetable dishes. It is a very large menu augmented by a short printed list of daily specials. One addition that should be welcome news for Sunday brunch fans: there are nine different dim sum choices with pictures of each, a help to those who wish to sample but are unfamiliar with or forgetful of the specific names.
We concentrated on the regular menu, succumbing to just one seasonal special, which turned out to be the best dish of all: sauteed soft-shell crabs. If you like these molted-shell blue crustaceans to begin with, we think you will find Li's Brothers Inn's rendering exceptional. The crabs were fried lightly to the crunchy stage, then cut into large segments. The legs were as delicate and wispy-crisp as good shoestring potatoes and the body portions were equally tasty. With the order came a small dish of sweet garlicky dipping sauce. It was an exemplary entree.
Also flavorful, if less memorable, was an order of crispy beef with orange flavor, though as is too often the case, the large pieces of beef were unable to be handled with chopsticks. Crispy whole sea bass, swathed in an assortment of finely chopped vegetables (scallions, carrots, et al), was deftly deboned by our waiter and proved meaty and moist, not desiccated as is frequently the case elsewhere. Both dishes, though, were gently seasoned, not hot and spicy as the red stars on the menu promised. In fact, we had specified that we wanted all starred dishes very spicy, a request that never made it to the kitchen. Inasmuch as the menu's subhead is "Hunan and Szechuan cuisine," one would expect that "hot and spicy" would be the norm. Something has been lost in translation.
Among appetizers, the sesame wontons, topped with chopped scallions, were winning. The steamed dumplings had good flavor and a tangy, creamy sesame sauce, similar to the one that enveloped our order of cold sesame noodles, which was another satisfying starter.
We could have done without the canned pineapple cube and maraschino cherry at the tip of each skewer in our order of Szechuan marinated beef, but the meat itself was tender and well-seasoned (though not spicy). For those who like spring rolls, the Li's Brothers' version had the advantage of fresh-tasting ingredients. That wasn't the case with fried Peking dumplings, which had thick casings and the taste of a frozen product.
Dinner for two came to $31.50 and included two courses each (no dessert) before beverages, tax and tip. There is a full bar but as is always the case with Chinese food, the preferred drink is Tsingtao beer. For comfortable dining, agreeable food and an ingratiating staff, Li's Brothers Inn brings a refreshing new dimension to Darien. There is a take-out menu as well. Li's Brothers Inn also has a cash-only take-out place (Broad River, Norwalk, on the Norwalk-New Canaan line) with four tables where one can eat in on trays with paper plates and plastic utensils.

HEADLINE: Showdown Looms on Sports Betting

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
LIKE a tied ball game in the closing minutes of play, the battle over sports betting in New Jersey's casinos has intensified in recent weeks as each side in the debate goes all out against its opponent.
With time running out to place on the November ballot a state constitutional-amendment referendum on sports betting, the opposing sides have stepped up their efforts to highlight either the economic advantages or the moral pitfalls of permitting gambling on sporting events. 
 Proponents say that legalized sports betting will bring increased revenue to the state through the Atlantic City casinos and will undermine the widely acknowledged illegal gambling that now takes place on sporting events. At the very least, they say, residents should be given an opportunity to make up their own minds on the issue by voting on a constitutional-amendment referendum in November.
Opponents, however, say that if sports betting undermines anything it will be the integrity of professional sports and the enjoyment that fans derive from wholesome competition unfettered by financial incentives. They say that legalizing sports betting will actually increase illegal gambling activities and will send a signal to youths that such activities are socially acceptable.
The debate comes as Congress contemplates Federal legislation that would ban sports betting except in states where it is now permitted. One bill under consideration provides a one-year "window of opportunity" for New Jersey to adopt the necessary constitutional amendment, but that opportunity could be missed if the Legislature fails to place the question on the November ballot by the end of this month.
"This either happens soon or it doesn't happen at all," said Thomas D. Carver, president of the Casino Association of New Jersey in Atlantic City. The organization, which represents the interests of the state's 12 casinos, has mounted an aggressive campaign in support of legalized betting on sporting events.
"All we want is for the people to vote on it," Mr. Carver said. "And we have reason to believe that they will support our position."
Proponents of sports betting have some hurdles to clear, however, if they are to see the practice legalized in New Jersey.
 
Two Bills Before Congress
 There are now two bills before Congress on sports betting. One, which was co-sponsored by Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, bans sports betting except in those states where it is already permitted. That bill has passed the Senate. The other bill, which has been passed by the House of Representatives, would similarly ban sports betting, but provides New Jersey with the one-year "window of opportunity."
Sports betting proponents say that the best way to insure that the state can take advantage of that provision would be for the Legislature to pass a resolution in time to put the amendment on this November's ballot. To comply with state law, that would have to be done by Aug. 3.
A resolution that calls for the referendum is now ready for a vote in the Senate, which has only two scheduled sessions in July -- on the 20th and the 23d.
Under the resolution, the state's voters would be asked in November whether they want to amend the State Constitution to allow sports betting in the Atlantic City casinos. Patrons at the casinos could place bets, in person, on the results of most sports events. Specifically prohibited, however, would be those events involving nonprofessional or educational organizations principally situated in the state.
If the resolution passes the New Jersey Senate by a three-fifths majority, it would then have to pass by the same majority in the Assembly, which is scheduled to meet only on July 23.
 
'The Clock Is Ticking'
 "The clock is ticking," said Assemblyman Robert W. Singer, Republican of Lakewood and a supporter of a referendum on sports betting. Both he and State Senator C. Louis Bassano, Republican of Union and sponsor of the Senate resolution, expressed reservations about the likelihood that the resolution will make it through both houses in such a short time period.
The casino gambling industry, however, sensing that this might be its last chance to get sports betting approved for Atlantic City, has organized a vigorous campaign to persuade legislators to give voters the opportunity to express their views on the issue.
Sharon Gordon, chairman of New Jersey Cares, a New Brunswick-based coalition that supports sports betting, said her organization was running radio advertisements and mailing 830,000 brochures to voters across the state urging them to ask their legislators to support the resolution.
"This is not something that should be decided in Washington," Ms. Gordon said. "This is a decision that should be left to New Jersey voters."
Ms. Gordon said that legalizing sports betting would also undermine the illegal betting that now takes place.
"There is sports betting going on all over the place," Ms. Gordon said.Legalizing the practice, she said, "regulates it and puts some of the money into New Jersey's coffers."
 
Opposed by Coalition
 Opposed to legalized sports betting, however, is the Coalition Against Sports Betting, a group of individuals and organizations including the New Jersey Sheriffs' Association, the New Jersey Council of Churches and the Garden State Athletic Conference. The coalition has started a campaign of its own with radio advertisements and mailings proclaiming the theme "Don't Gamble With Our Children's Heroes."
Gary R. Bettman, senior vice president and general counsel of the National Basketball Association, a member of the coalition, said that legalized sports betting "puts the game and the players under a cloud of suspicion." It also, he said, "changes our fans into 'point-spread' fans" who are predominantly concerned with the game's ultimate point differential, regardless of who wins or loses.
The point spread is the number of points by which a particular team is favored to win. A favored team must "cover the spread," or beat its opponent by the point spread, in order for a person betting on that team to win the bet. For example, a bet placed on a team favored by 5 points would be a losing bet if the team won by only 4 points.
"The players are adamantly opposed to it," Mr. Bettman said. "If you miss a shot at the buzzer and don't cover the spread, all of a sudden you're a bum."
 
Sports Betting in Las Vegas
 Mr. Carver, president of the casino association, pointed out that sports betting is legal in Las Vegas and that the professional sports teams seem comfortable with the practice.
Moreover, he said, making sports betting legal in New Jersey is essential if Atlantic City is to remain competitive with Las Vegas, which now books as much as $1.7 billion a year in sports bets. In fact, he said, if sports betting were allowed here, New Jersey could end up booking twice the amount that is bet in Las Vegas.
"We're sitting in the middle of 32 million people who can be here within an hour," Mr. Carver said. "We could do $1.7 billion in half a year, minimally."
If Mr. Carver's estimates are accurate -- they are fiercely disputed by his opponents -- then $3.4 billion bet on sporting events in a year could result in as much as $100 million in gross revenue for the casino industry from the sports bets alone. That, along with a projected 10 percent increase in other gambling revenue generated as a result of having sports betting, could amount to a total increase in revenue of as much as $400 million.
 
Money Would Help the Elderly
 Of that amount, Mr. Carver said, $32 million would go to the Casino Revenue Fund, which finances programs for senior citizens and the disabled, and $5 million would go into Atlantic City redevelopment. In addition, he said, one thousand new jobs would be created, casino vendor purchases in the state would increase by $30 million and $20 million more in sales and payroll taxes would filter into the State Treasury.
The total amount of money that the state could realize each year from legalized sports betting and its spinoffs, Mr. Carver said, could be as much as $127 million.
But William L. Stringer, an economist and former Deputy Treasurer of New Jersey, says the potential for increased state revenue is at best exaggerated and more likely nonexistent.
A study done last month by Mr. Stringer indicates that sports betting would not make any net contribution to state revenue and could, in fact, produce a net loss. He said the state would probably process about $715 million in sports betting as opposed to the $3.4 billion anticipated by the casino industry. His lower estimate was based upon the current ratio between total dollars bet in Atlantic City and the amount now bet in Las Vegas.
And any money spent on sports gambling in New Jersey, Mr. Stringer said, would draw from funds now being spent on consumer purchases in general and on other forms of gambling like casino games, horse racing and the state lottery. At the same time, he said, money spent on sports betting would produce far less revenue for the state than the same amount spent on the state lottery, for example, or the sales tax.
 
Study Says Loss Could Occur
 Mr. Stringer estimated that sports betting would result in either no increased revenue for the state or a loss of about $5 million, depending on its actual impact on consumer spending.
Arnie Wexler, director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, said that even if economic benefits were derived from sports betting, they would not compensate for the problems that state-sponsored gambling creates.
"We're going to see an increase in illegal gambling," Mr. Wexler said. "That's what happens when you legalize this stuff." In fact, he said, illegal betting on sporting events among compulsive gamblers has already increased from 29 percent in 1987 to 51 percent in 1991, according to a study his organization has conducted of gamblers calling the council's compulsive-gambling hot line.
That, he said, will increase if sports betting is legalized. "You get people who never gambled before going into a casino to make a bet on their favorite team," said Mr. Wexler, whose organization accepts calls from compulsive gamblers at 1-800-GAMBLER.
The increase in illegal betting occurs, he said, when those people then discover that if they cannot get to a casino they can get better odds, generous credit and the convenience of betting by telephone, from local bookies. And to make matters worse, Mr. Wexler said, many of those most intensely interested in sports betting are youngsters of high school age.
"And what are we telling these young kids?" Mr. Wexler said. "We're telling them: 'Don't worry about winning or losing; let's worry about the point spread instead.' We're telling them that what's really important is the payoff."

HEADLINE: Chrysler's New L/H, as in Last Hope

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
Live, from Chrysler Corporation headquarters in Highland Park, Mich., it's "Who Are We Anyhow?" Before an audience of hundreds of its advertising-agency people, Chrysler has brought in actors and stage props to produce the mock game show. The contestants are three couples who epitomize the ideal customers for a new line of three midsize cars on which Chrysler is staking its future. They answer questions about their tastes in everything from houses to magazines and reminisce about their first important cars. For one couple, it was a '57 Chevy for him, and the '60 Impala convertible she was driving when she met him.
The play-acting in Chrysler's auditorium last summer dramatized some deadly serious business for the nation's No. 3 auto maker. It is part of a three-pronged marketing campaign intended to win back a lost generation, buyers who have abandoned an auto maker that many associate with boxy, boring cars, sell-at-all-costs discounting, and corny pitches by Ricardo Montalban boasting of Corinthian leather interiors. 
 The company's make-or-break task is to persuade buyers to forget the past and snap up the new cars, which Chrysler began producing last week. The new line, code-named the L/H, comprises the Dodge Intrepid, priced at roughly $15,000; the Chrysler Concorde, around $25,000, and the Eagle Vision, at a still-to-be-announced price somewhere in between. The three, to be rolled out this autumn, have been widely praised by automotive enthusiasts. If they succeed, they could singlehandedly make Chrysler a financially stable company; if they bomb, Chrysler might never recover from the blow to its credibility.
"There's no way to overemphasize the importance of the L/H," said Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of the FCB/Leber Katz advertising agency and a former vice president of Chrysler. "If it was built by Ford or Toyota it would be the sensation of the decade. The issue is will people trust Chrysler? Trust takes years to win and seconds to lose."
 
Scrapping an Image
 The first step in the company's strategy is to use advertising, starting with a campaign last fall, to overcome Chrysler's reputation as a corporation of stodgy designs and old-fashioned, short-term thinking. For buyers who agree to reconsider Chrysler, a second wave of advertising, to start this fall, will focus on the three L/H models. Each model is aimed at a different kind of customer, as defined in the mock game show. Finally, Chrysler is undertaking a far-reaching retraining plan for employees and dealer personnel, aimed at eliminating the all-too-familiar hassles and indignities of car shopping.
The training and marketing campaigns, on top of the $1.6 billion spent to develop the cars, are lavish for a company whose pension fund is $4 billion short of solvency, whose bonds are rated as junk and whose losses last year totaled $795 million. The joke in Detroit is that the company is spending money as if it actually has it.
Chrysler executives bristle at the oft-made quip that L/H stands for Last Hope, asserting that the letters actually represent nothing in particular. But the fact is that the models represent Chrysler's last, best chance for stability. Chrysler hopes to sell 225,000 L/H models annually, on top of the roughly half-million cars it already sells. (All told, the company currently sells 1.5 million vehicles a year.)
Chrysler's Jeep and mini-van models have been money makers, but have not been able to offset the results of money-losing car lines. No auto maker expects to make much money on small cars, but midsize and large models can be quite lucrative -- as long as selling them doesn't require $2,000 rebates like those Chrysler offers for its hapless Imperial sedan.
But the L/H is important to Chrysler for another reason. The company has yet to prove that it can build a car that is equal, in substance and status, to the best Japanese and European competitors. By and large, its best and most successful models in the 1980's, like the Eagle Talon, were made with the help of the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation. Now that relations between the two companies have cooled, Chrysler must demonstrate competence on its own.
The three new models portend a radical departure from the doughty Dodge Dynastys, Chrysler LeBarons and Plymouth Acclaims, which inspired sneers and yawns from automotive enthusiasts. They have been been praised by magazine reviewers for improved handling and engine performance, tasteful aerodynamic styling and a design that makes them much roomier than earlier models, without a significant increase in exterior dimensions.
Wall Street apparently likes the cars as well. In the past year the company's stock price has more than doubled, to around $20, reflecting a positive reaction not only to Chrysler's new Jeep Grand Cherokee but also the glowing reviews of the L/H prototypes.
 
After Iacocca
 But convincing younger, affluent customers will be a chore worthy of Hercules. The buyers Chrysler will be trying to lure with the L/H have come to regard midsize models like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima and Ford Taurus as the standards of measure. These shoppers may be particularly skeptical of Chrysler's importunings, recalling that Lee Iacocca & Company permitted car development to languish while raking in fat paychecks and investing in non-automotive acquisitions like Gulfstream Aircraft.
One big reason for Chrysler's current financial struggle is that the company relied too long in the 1980's on models using a single basic chassis, known as the K platform. At first the K car fared well, but sales dove as customers migrated to other brands, and Chrysler's only success stories of late have been its mini-vans and Jeeps.
Chrysler officials acknowledge that their brands have grown bland and indistinct. In a similar way, the General Motors Corporation stumbled during the 1980's partly because key car models and brands were perceived as clones of one another. Instead of drawing from diverse pools of consumers, four or five G.M. models would attract only a single type of customer, so sales were weak.
The Ford Motor Company, conversely, scored a marketing victory by proving it could sell the similar Taurus and Sable models to two audiences, a middle-of-the-road buyer for Taurus and a more affluent buyer for Sable.
Chrysler's challenge, then, is to successfully differentiate its three L/H models.
So the mid-priced Eagle Vision will be shown in settings that appeal to young families who listen to public radio but don't watch much TV except for cable programs, are better educated than buyers targeted for the other two models, and have two wage earners. They aspire to an Audi or Lexus, but can't afford one yet.
Chrysler marketers view the buyers of the Concorde -- and the New Yorker, a slightly larger version to be built starting later this year -- as the oldest and most affluent of the three target groups. They may include the oldest baby-boomers, who owned imports but now are looking for something larger and more comfortable. And they might otherwise buy a Pontiac Bonneville or a Mercury Sable.
Dodge Intrepid buyers, Chrysler hopes, will be more numerous than those for the other two models, ranging in age from mid-30's to 50. They might otherwise buy a Honda Accord or a Pontiac Bonneville.
 
Getting the Word Out
 Conveying the message is the job of the Chrysler's three advertising agencies -- Campbell-Mithun-Esty for Eagle and its Vision, BBDO for Dodge and its Intrepid, and Bozell Inc. for Chrysler-Plymouth and its Concorde. Chrysler won't comment on the content of the ads, which are just now in production.
But it is clear that the company is pursuing a more affluent consumer and will sell its cars on the basis of their styling and performance, rather than cut-rate pricing. In the past, Chrysler's customers, less educated and of lower income, were "less frequently in the market and got knocked out quickly in times of economic weakness," said John Schnapp, a consultant with Temple, Barker & Sloane in Boston.
Selling buyers on a particular Chrysler brand will not work unless they can be made to trust the company behind the brand. "We did literally thousands of hours of research with import buyers in California," said John Damoose, Chrysler's vice president of marketing. "They said, 'You have to convince us you have re-invented your company.' "
Enter the corporate image campaign that began last fall. In 1989, Chrysler had thoroughly reorganized engineering and planning in order to speed model development, improve quality and lower costs. "We were changing the way we made our products and that required us to tell that story for the benefit of products that were coming and for the confidence of the public," said Ron DeLuca, who was vice chairman of the Bozell advertising agency until his retirement last year and continues as a Chrysler consultant.
 
'The New Chrysler'
 So Chrysler and Bozell have run a series of ads that proclaim a "new Chrysler" even before the new L/H models arrive. One showed the demolition of the old Jefferson Avenue plant in Detroit. Another was filled with aerial views of the $1 billion Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Mich. The Dodge Viper, a sexy two-seat roadster built in limited numbers to give Dodge a racy image, starred in another ad.
In the campaign and in messages to the automotive press, the company has explained why it switched to flexible product teams, the system favored by Honda, Toyota and others. The L/H models are the first to be developed from start to finish by a team -- and were done in three and a half years, record time for Chrysler.
As Chrysler marketers discussed how to convince buyers that the company had indeed changed, they commissioned research on whether Mr. Iacocca would still be an appropriate spokesman. After all, he had been at the helm when many mistakes took place, but "research showed people still related to him in the same way, with a high degree of recall and awareness," Mr. Damoose said.
The decision: Mr. Iacocca's ad appearances will dwindle as he nears his Jan. 1 retirement. (Robert Eaton, who came from G.M. earlier this year to replace Mr. Iacocca as chairman and chief executive, has no plans to appear in the advertisements, a spokesman said.)
Finally, Chrysler is working with its dealers to improve its appeal. Lexus, under Toyota, and Saturn, under G.M., have earned their popularity not only because of their cars' intrinsic appeal but because of their dealers, who pamper customers with well-trained salespeople, loaner cars, free fill-ups and washes, tasteful decor and home delivery of vehicles. Most important, customers tend to favor dealers who seem to be fair if and when the price is negotiated.
However, many dealers still rely on high-pressure negotiating tactics. As independent franchisees, they are free to choose their style of retailing. Chrysler executives fret that those who don't become more like Lexus and Saturn dealers could drive away prospects for the L/H with ruses like "highball" bids for trade-ins (used as a come-on but offset by inflated prices for new cars) or "lowball" offers on new cars that are later withdrawn. Not to mention the notorious "closing rooms," where specialists to whom salespeople refer customers are paid according to how many people they can browbeat into signing contracts.
"We believe it is time for our dealers to undergo change, and the timing is right because of the introduction of the L/H," said Theodor R. Cunningham, executive vice president of sales and marketing. This month, Chrysler is undertaking a $30 million program to teach some 100,000 workers at its 4,900 dealerships how to deliver better service. To underscore the program's seriousness -- compared with scores of previous, more modest efforts -- the automaker's top 200 executives, including Mr. Eaton, will attend classes.
 
Lessons From the Ritz
 Chrysler studied companies like Walt Disney and Ritz-Carlton Hotels to find out how they achieved reputations for pampering customers. Chrysler and an ad agency, Ross Roy, spent 18 months formulating the training program, which employs techniques like role-playing to dramatize the need for empathizing with customers. In a typical drill, a Dodge mechanic might pretend he is a bellhop trying to calm an irate guest. The idea is to allow the employee to experience a difficult situation for himself rather than simply be lectured on it.
While dealers applaud Chrysler's push to satisfy customers, their support is tinged with skepticism. For it is the dealers who have really borne the brunt of customer anger.
"It seems like when new cars get launched and the company announces programs, they go on for the first month and then there's no follow-up," said Mark Cassidy, sales manager of Ed Barwick Chrysler-Plymouth in Napa, Calif.
Whatever Chrysler can accomplish through ads and dealers, its executives realize their best friend is positive word-of-mouth. So several hundred L/H cars will be lent to "opinion leaders" -- doctors, lawyers, politicians, teachers -- in 25 cities in the hope that after a few days' test drive, they will laud the car.
In an attempt to insure quality, Chrysler will build only 50,000 L/H cars through the end of 1992. This could cost the company sales if demand is strong. At the same time, the three car divisions will have an excellent opportunity to sell every car and avoid the embarrassment of dealer lots jammed with unsold inventory, requiring the rebates and other incentives that have haunted so many Chrysler models of yesteryear.
 
 
 
GOOD PREVIEWS, BUT WILL THE LOOK FLY?

Automotive enthusiast magazines, important shapers and predictors of consumer opinion, have almost unanimously bestowed rave reviews on Chrysler's new L/H line for its roominess, handling, engine performance and styling. Automobile magazine couched its description in messianic terms, deeming the model a harbinger of "Chrysler's Second Coming."
Chrysler's L/H line embodies a radically new configuration. The cars are wider than previous Dodges and Chryslers of the same class; at the same time, the passenger cabin is moved forward over the front wheels and the rear wheels are moved farther to the back. To accomplish a stretching of interior space, the windshield is enlarged and tilted backward at a more extreme angle. The technique, used first by Japanese automakers in models like the Honda Accord, devotes about 15 percent more space to passengers and cargo than did in previous models.
By widening and lengthening the car, engineers encountered the problem of how to make the body torsionally rigid, so that rolling and swaying were minimized. "We found the competitive vehicle with the best torsional rigidity, benchmarked its tautness and proceeded to beat the standard," said Dennis N. Renneker, Chrysler executive engineer for large-car platforms.
Engineers also improved the mechanical wheel suspension systems to improve handling. Mr. Renneker said the L/H's suspension "is a better package than our competitors'," which Chrysler says will include no less than the Lexus LS 300, Nissan Maxima and Acura Vigor.
Chrysler has also moved toward quieter, more powerful and more fuel-efficient engines by redesigning many components.
Although the automaker wishes to maximize sales by reaching three groups of buyers, the three L/H models look, at first glance, very similar. Auto makers typically create several models from a common chassis by creating different exteriors or sheet-metal "skins" and different interiors.
About 88 percent of the sheet metal panels of the Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision differ. About 50 percent of the the Chrysler Concorde panels differ from those of the other two models. By mixing color combinations, plastic cladding along the lower half of the body, headlights, tail lights and wheel coverings, the appearance among the three models has been differentiated as much as possible. But there is still the danger that a customer for the most expensive model will migrate to the cheapest one.

THE ECONOMY
 
The World's Richest Nations Are Too Poor to Party at Munich
 

The heads of state of the world's richest democracies plus Russia were in no mood to party last week at the economic summit meeting in Munich. What put these world leaders in such a snit was what President Francois Mitterrand of France called "the morose state of the world economy." All the nations in attendance were either in recession or struggling to emerge. They were in no condition to be generous. The deadlock on trade -- the United States wants Europe to end subsidies on grain exports -- remained in place. The seven nations did extend a hand to Russia, but not without a reproach. They decided to channel $1 billion in aid to Russia as part of a comprehensive partnership. ("I didn't expect more," said the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin.) But then they added a testy warning: no more money unless Russia pursues reforms more vigorously.
 
Picture-Perfect V.P.?
 
There were no driveway interviews with prospective running mates at the Governor's mansion in Little Rock, Ark. But the "podium picture" -- the wide-angle shot of the full Democratic ticket with families in tow -- was a consideration in the choice of Senator Al Gore of Tennessee as Gov. Bill Clinton's choice for Vice President. Analysts said Mr. Gore will strengthen the ticket's appeal in the South, where President Bush and undeclared candidate Ross Perot are strong. And with Mr. Gore's record on the environment, his grasp of scientific issues and support for high-tech and space research, he is likely to add to Mr. Clinton's appeal in the West. Mr. Gore is also savvy about the ways of Washington. While Mr. Perot had kind words to say about Mr. Gore, the Republicans were not quite so charitable. The choice -- said Rich Bond, the Republican national chairman -- was a "dud."
 
Detroit Accelerates
 
Detroit has been languishing in the slow lane for months. But late last month, at least two of the Big Three managed to step on the gas. Sales of North American-built vehicles surged by 23.9 percent in late June, the auto makers reported. But while Ford's sales were up 30.7 percent and G.M.'s by 18.4 percent, Chrysler moved 12.2 percent less metal than last year. After a spate of rave reviews in the buff books and consumer magazines, sales of Saturns, G.M.'s import fighter, soared to 20,000 last month. That pushed the two-year-old Spring Hill, Tenn., Saturn factory to the limits of its capacity, arousing speculation that Saturn might soon need another plant.
 
Fewer Jobless Claims
 
A little good news on the jobless front -- but it's the word little that needs the emphasis. The number of new claims for unemployment insurance fell by 4,000 in late June, the Labor Department said last week. Though the drop in new claims is welcome, the economy still has too little punch, economists say, when it comes to job creation. Last month's jobless numbers are "consistent with other data that the economy has lost some of its earlier momentum, but keeps moving higher," said Robert G. Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company of Chicago.
 
Fear of Higher Prices
 
One benefit of having an economy without much oomph is that nervous suppliers are reluctant to raise prices. They don't want to scare away the few customers they have left. That was evident last week when the Labor Department released its Producer Price Index for June, which showed that prices at the producer level rose by a negligible 0.2 percent. That converts into a 2 percent inflation rate on an annual basis. Most of the increase was accounted for by rising energy prices. "Throw out energy and you don't have any inflation," said Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Girding for Future Bank Scandals
 
It took more than a year for them to get together, but last week the world's top banking regulators met in London to hammer out new rules to prevent a repeat of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandals. B.C.C.I. has been accused of massive wrongdoing in several countries, including charges of bilking depositors out of billions of dollars. The regulators decided that if a bank based in a country where the regulators are weak -- like Luxembourg, where B.C.C.I. was headquartered -- is suspected of committing crimes in a country where regulators are strong -- like the United States -- the strong regulators can initiate an investigation.
 
No Accord on Nuclear Safety
 
The leaders of the seven wealthiest nations meeting in Munich failed to reach an accord on ways to assure the safety of aging nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Amoco's Turn for Layoffs
 
When the Amoco Corporation said last week that it would eliminate 8,500 jobs -- 15.7 percent of its work force -- it was the latest in a series of large-scale layoffs gripping corporate America. Since April, six of America's largest companies -- Exxon U.S.A., Hughes Aircraft, Aetna, Chevron, Digital Equipment and Alcoa -- have eliminated more than 23,000 jobs. Amoco attributed its cuts to sluggishness in the global economy and the need to downsize its operations. "This is a significant move," said Eugene L. Nowalk, an oil analyst at Dean Witter. The company said the cuts would result in $600 million in before-tax savings by the end of 1993.
 
Seldane's Safety Questioned
 
Hay fever sufferers who take Seldane got a jolt last week. Not only did the Food and Drug Administration tell Marion Merrell Dow Inc., which makes the drug, to warn doctors that Seldane can cause irregular heartbeats and even death, but two law suits filed in Federal court in Kansas City allege the company knew of the problem for two years. The suits say the information was withheld to keep the company's stock price from falling. The company said it would defend itself "vigorously" against the charges.
 
Patching Up Continental
 
Continental Airlines has been bumping along under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code for more than a year. Last week, when it agreed to accept a $350 million offer for majority control from Charles E. Hurwitz, the Houston investor, it put itself on the path to recovery. Continental, which has $700 million in pension-fund liabilities, still must obtain court approval before it reorganizes under Mr. Hurwitz.
 
The Tinsel Frays for Japanese
 
The buzz in Hollywood is that when Japan's big electronics companies -- the Sony Corporation and the Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company -- bought into the studios, they got more than they bargained for. Instead of neatly managed businesses, they bought lots of chaos and loads of high-priced but temperamental executives. Columbia Pictures, owned by Sony, and MCA Inc., owned by Matsushita, brought out a string of money-losing flicks like last year's "Hudson Hawk." As a result, Tokyo told the studios to stop developing projects, some agents say. Tinsel town's ruling elite dismisses the talk. "It's patently not true to say we've stopped developing," said Mark Canton, Columbia's chairman.
 
Chalk Up One for Airbus
 
Lately, the most vicious dogfights in the air have been between the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie, the European aerospace consortium. Last week the aces at Airbus scored a hit. United Airlines said it would lease 50 two-engine Airbus A-320's. Though it's uncertain if Airbus will make a profit, the deal gives it a renewed American presence. "It's a move of big strategic significance," said George Shapiro, of Salomon Brothers.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
A New President Signs On At a Downsized Dataquest

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Like the personal computer industry it provides market research to, Dataquest Inc. has been through some lean times recently, marked by layoffs and the lack of a president for nearly a year. Last week, Judith H. Hamilton, who has spent 26 years in computer services and software, was chosen to fill the empty slot. A unit of Dun & Bradstreet, Dataquest is based in San Jose, Calif.
As a former buyer of consulting services, Ms. Hamilton said she knows consulting is often among the first things cut back during recessionary times, which makes it all the more important to offer exceptional service. Companies "don't eliminate it, but they do go for best of breed," she said. The computer industry "is going through a real sea change right now, and there are all kinds of indicators that service providers have to go through the changes as well." 
 Ms. Hamilton, who is 48, comes to Dataquest from the Locus Computing Corporation of Los Angeles, where she was senior vice president and general manager of the systems division. She was previously a partner at Ernst & Young, where she was national director of market development, information services.
Dataquest has "had the trims and is positioned now to begin anew in a growth mode," Ms. Hamilton said. "It's a nice position for me because the cutting was done before I got there." She said she sees new opportunities for Dataquest in the coming together of computing, communications and consumer electronics products, and in the growing globalization of these businesses.
"Some of the merging of these technologies will provoke interesting changes in the computer industry that will be reflected in the research concerns," she said. "More and more people want information on world markets," she said, adding that this plays to Dataquest's strengths, because 70 of its 450 employees are analysts working abroad.

HEADLINE: The Unquiet Future of Commercial Health Insurance

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
New state laws aimed at insuring that older and sicker people get affordable medical coverage are expected to accelerate a shakeout in the $108 billion commercial health insurance industry.
The most recently approved law, passed in New York this month, requires insurers to accept any individual or small business that applies and charge the same rate regardless of age, sex and health history. Vermont, Maine and Oregon have recently approved less stringent versions of this approach, and Hawaii has long had a similar system. Other states are considering such proposals. 
 Many insurers predict that the state laws will force out some companies, particularly smaller ones with limited resources or large ones with only small numbers of customers in the state. Such companies have in the past been able to "cherry pick" the healthiest applicants and offer them coverage at a lower price, leaving the older and sicker customers to other insurers or without coverage. Now that they must accept all comers, these insurers will have to raise their rates, and many of the younger, healthier customers might decide to drop their policies.
Insurers with small numbers of customers could be hurt much more severely than a large insurer by someone with a costly illness like cancer. The larger insurers can not only spread such a risk over more customers, they also benefit from economies of scale in administration.
No company has left New York, where the new law does not take effect until April 1993. But Aetna Casualty and Life, for example, stopped selling to small employers in Vermont, where it had only a few such customers. And Chris Petersen, senior counsel for the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group with 300 members who have 80 percent of the business, predicted that there would be fewer commercial insurers in New York.
Under the New York law, the state will now have to grant approval of rates for the commercial insurers, so it is too early to know how much policyholders' rates will rise and how they will react.
But Mr. Petersen said the law would mean higher rates for more than half the 500,000 New Yorkers with individual and small-group coverage from commercial insurers, and that 165,000 of them might decide to drop their coverage.
Emily Crandall, a vice president of the Guardian Life Insurance Company, which with about 100,000 people in New York is one of the state's bigger insurers of small groups, said her company had not decided whether to stay in New York, where it has 20 percent of its customers. "We are not a public utility," she said. "We have a business to run."
People who work for large employers, which usually insure themselves and use insurance companies only as administrators, are not affected by the state laws. And most health-maintenance organizations already accept all applicants at uniform rates even without the state laws.
In contrast to New York, 33 states have approved limits on rate increases for customers with expensive illnesses. Most big commercial insurers say they can live with the limits.
The new state laws are only the latest problem confronting the smaller insurance companies. They are also losing business to larger insurers who can afford to organize "managed care networks" that sign up doctors and hospitals with an eye to limiting medical cost increases. Squeezed by soaring medical costs as well, some companies have left the health-insurance business entirely, others are pulling out of certain states and some have stopped insuring individuals or small groups.
"The smaller companies are history," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health-care analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "They don't have any buying power" to influence hospitals and doctors. He predicts that 50 insurance companies and 400 health-maintenance organizations will control the health-care system in 15 years, compared with 300 companies and 550 H.M.O.'s that now have most of the business.
Analysts said the new laws have not yet had a discernible effect on profits. Most insurance companies have a number of lines of business, including life and property and casualty as well as health insurance. Insurance stocks have been buoyed recently by general economic trends including lower interest rates, according to Denis Callaghan, at Alex. Brown & Sons.
The Health Insurance Association of America says health insurance is not very profitable. The 20 largest companies reported combined losses on their health insurance underwriting every year from 1986 to 1990, the latest available year, the association said. Adding income on investments, the companies still had a combined loss in 1987 and thin after-tax profits the other four years.
Between 1987 and 1991, 72 health insurance businesses failed, says A. M. Best, the independent insurance-rating organization. The shakeout is evident in three major sectors: managing care for larger self-insured employers, insuring small groups and insuring individuals.
Having lost their risk-taking role to the self-insurance plans that most large employers have adopted, large insurers have been transforming themselves into managed-care companies.
But the networks require heavy startup investments for computerized information systems and recruiting campaigns. As a result, Lincoln National, Equitable, American Express and Transamerica have pulled out of managed care altogether. Analysts say the strongest companies remaining are Prudential and Metropolitan Life, which are mutual insurance companies owned by their policyholders, and Cigna, Aetna and Travelers, which are publicly traded.
Only Cigna, Prudential and Metropolitan Life announced profits in managed care last year. Mr. Callaghan at Alex. Brown said Aetna's H.M.O.'s and care networks should become profitable later this year. Travelers stopped breaking out its managed care results in 1990 after several years of losses.
Sixteen smaller companies, including Northwestern National Life, CNA Financial and Pacific Mutual, are sharing costs and profits as partners in a joint managed-care firm, Private Healthcare Systems Ltd., based in Lexington, Mass.
Travelers, Principal Mutual Life and the Employers Health Insurance unit of Lincoln National are the strongest companies in insurance for small groups, usually defined as fewer than 25 employees. "The small groups are where the growth opportunities are," said Brian Quigley, a Travelers lawyer. Travelers has just bought the national small-group business of Paul Revere, covering 200 employers and 15,000 people.
The big players in individual-customer insurance are Mutual of Omaha, Bankers Life and Trust, and American Family Life of Columbus, Ga. (selling only cancer insurance). But many companies, including Travelers, Aetna, Allstate and Pacific Mutual, have sold their unprofitable individual-customer lines.
If there is a beneficiary of the new state laws requiring uniform rates, it is the nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield associations, which in states like New York have been obliged to offer coverage to the people rejected by other carriers. These associations lobbied for many of the most stringent new state laws, and they reject the dire predictions that commercial insurance companies will be forced out of the market, leaving many more people uninsured.
 
 
ONE VOTE FOR COMPETITION
 Commercial health insurers, under fire because of rising rates and the fact that more than 30 million Americans are without coverage, are struggling to stave off even greater state and Federal regulation.
Industry spokesmen say that competition is the best way to lower costs and assure quality of care, but critics say the industry spends too much on administration and marketing, driving up the nation's $800 billion in annual health-care spending. The health-insurance industry has identified 120 proposals in 37 states, including New York, that would move toward a "single payer" health insurance system, like Canada's, in which the state pays the bill. Such a system could eventually eliminate all private insurers.
The California Legislature is considering a proposal by Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi that could eliminate many companies by funneling all payments through a few large H.M.O.'s and other insurers.
Congress is also debating proposals that could bring drastic reductions in the number of health insurers. "There's no way we can have significant reform in health care without reducing the number of insurance companies," said Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. "You cannot rein in health costs if we continue to have 1,500 companies."
There are 1,150 commercial companies that provide medical and disability insurance, 73 nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield associations, and 569 health maintenance organizations.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
A Bet That the Worst Is Over in Japan

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
John Koeneman is back in Japan, a signal that there are some prominent investors who think the worst is over in the world's second-largest stock market.
Mr. Koeneman, who is managing director of Koeneman Capital Management in Singapore, says his computer-driven analysis has given him a green light on Japan for the first time in more than two and a half years. 
 "So far, the methodology has worked very well for us," he said in an interview while in the United States last week, looking for new clients beyond his Australian-dominated core. "The Japanese market may not reach bottom for three to six months. But we cannot find a compelling reason not to adhere to our discipline."
It may not sound like a ringing endorsement of this market whose main index, the Nikkei 225, has fallen 60 percent since its all-time high at the end of 1989. But Mr. Koeneman, whose firm manages a total of about $400 million, has raised the portion of his global portfolios in Japanese stocks from 5 percent in April to 23 percent now.
What changed Mr. Koeneman's view on Japan is his analysis of expected returns from stock markets around the world. This gauge measures growth above a base that equalizes for the different investing risks among markets. It includes price-earnings ratios, the level of the yen against other currencies, interest rates and other factors he said have been crucial in driving stock markets' past performance.
The expected return for Japan has been negative for years. But all of a sudden it is back in positive territory and has swept past the United States, where the gauge is declining. In fact, Mr. Koeneman is getting the money to put into Japan by selling some of his stock in the United States.
Right now the expected-return gauge for the Japanese market is 1.27 percent for the next month, compared with 0.77 percent for the United States. That makes it far better than Germany, which is at 0.19 percent, but not nearly as good as Hong Kong, the go-go market of the year, at 3.77 percent.
But it was enough to nudge him back into the troubled Japanese market. Among the stocks he has bought are Chubu Electric Power, Itoham Food and Hokkaido Electric Power. He also likes the Suzuki Motor Corporation, which he sees as a bet that the export market for four-wheel-drive vehicles to the developing world will be strong. The sectors he likes are domestic Japanese companies, particularly utilities; some exporters, despite the strength of the yen, and consumer stocks, like food companies.
In June, his Tokyo investments fell 5 percent, while the market as a whole, as measured by the Topix index of more than 1,200 stocks, was down 10 percent.
Mr. Koeneman's decision to reinvest aggressively is not swayed by the shaky outlook for corporate earnings in Japan. The Institutional Brokers Estimate System in New York shows that earnings in Japan are forecast to decline for the third year in a row in the current Japanese fiscal year, which ends next March. And some forecasts predict a drop of 25 percent to 30 percent.
These earnings estimates are not a major factor in Mr. Koeneman's calculations. "Whether Japan is attractive or not does not depend on I.B.E.S.," he said. "It depends on the fundamentals and financial variables. Typically, a market will head up before you see an upturn in earnings."
But while Mr. Koeneman's investment direction has changed, others are not budging.
Barton Biggs, the global investment strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, has been bearish on Japan for some time. He now believes that the Nikkei index could fall as far as 12,000 before the stock market reaches the bottom. That would be another 25 percent plunge from 16,783.72, where the Nikkei closed on Friday. And it would leave the market almost 70 percent below its all-time high.
Mr. Biggs looks at the same information as Mr. Koeneman, but it does not make him optimistic. He acknowledges that the market as a whole "is around fair value," when using 1992 earnings, cash flow and the current level of interest rates.
These indicators, he said, are for normal times. But things are not normal in Tokyo right now. The Tokyo market is not merely in a bear market; it is in a downward spiral. It is in the decline that follows the bursting of a bubble, the ending of a major speculative boom. And by Mr. Biggs's calculation, this process should bring the market down by 70 percent to 95 percent from its all-time high.
At the same time, Mr. Biggs said his Morgan Stanley colleagues in London, who specialize in finding stocks at good values, are buying in Japan again. They too are picking among the export stocks, like the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. Mr. Biggs acknowledges that some of these export blue chips may be able to hold the line fairly well even as the rest of the market continues to decline.
Mr. Koeneman and Mr. Biggs are both strategists who pick their countries first. They are at the extremes on Japan and picking between them is a choice between process versus caution.
Mr. Koeneman is not being brave. He is following his system, the same rigorous pursuit that got him out of Japan. And he is being very careful in the choice of his stocks and is trying to find the kind of values Mr. Biggs's colleagues are looking for.
Mr. Biggs, on the other hand, doesn't even want to look for value stocks, "even the ones our value guys like," he said. "Are they among the 20 stocks that I'm going to buy for my father? No."

HEADLINE: All About/Ready-to-Assemble Furniture;
As Easy as Joining A to B and C to D

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
"Some assembly required." The words strike fear in the hearts of parents who have struggled to put together toys and of backyard warriors cursing the jigsaw pieces of a new hibachi. But for a growing number of Americans with a screwdriver and some patience, unassembled furniture is that rarity in hard times: an affordable option for sprucing up one's home.
Sales of traditional furniture have suffered in the recession, putting pressure on large manufacturers like Ladd Furniture Inc., which just entered the do-it-yourself market, and Drexel Heritage, now a subsidiary of the Masco Corporation. Some retailers have also been hard hit, with Seaman's, for example, filing for bankruptcy protection. 
 But sales of ready-to-assemble furniture have grown 10 percent a year in the last five years, now accounting for about 10 percent of all furniture shipped out by American manufacturers -- $1.1 billion worth in 1991 (or $1.8 billion at retail), up from $750 million in 1986.
"This is a product where the consumer adds value to the piece," said Jerry Epperson, a furniture analyst for Mann, Armistead & Epperson, an investment banking firm in Richmond, Va. "People like that. They feel like it's a bargain." It is estimated that consumers can save 25 to 50 percent on ready-to-assemble -- "R.T.A." to the industry -- compared with fully assembled pieces.
As demand has risen and technologies have improved, the range of furniture has moved beyond simple television stands and microwave carts. Consumers can now buy entertainment centers that cover half a wall, home office set-ups and even bedroom ensembles in a box.
Most unassembled furniture is still of particle-board construction. But new technology has meant more natural looking wood-like finishes and solid wood moldings -- even such intricate pieces as roll-top desks.
"In the old days, you'd say, 'Oh my God, don't put that in my house,' " said Ray Allegrezza, a furniture writer who concentrates on the R.T.A. market. "Now, you'd be hard pressed from across the room to tell if it's a solid wood piece."

 
 
Humble Beginnings
Particle Board, Born In Postwar Europe
 Unassembled furniture was developed, as were many consumer-product ideas, to alleviate a pressing problem in postwar Europe. After the devastation of World War II, there was a huge need for inexpensive home furnishings. With hardwood in short supply, furniture makers sought an alternative material. They found it: wood chips and shavings, compressed and then covered with stained paper, foil or melamine, a white resin. The new furniture was solid and potentially durable. And it was cheap because the materials were and the customer supplied the labor.
In the United States, manufacturers began experimenting with what they called knock-down furniture in the 1950's. Erie Sauder, founder of the Sauder Woodworking Company in Archbold, Ohio, marketed a snap-together end table that needed no hardware. It cost $9.95 in 1951.
In the 1970's, ready-to-assemble furniture became a function-driven industry, as companies made pieces for every innovation hitting the market. The trend grew stronger in the 1980's as new companies sprang up to provide TV/VCR stands, microwave carts and the surroundings for personal computers. (The second-largest R.T.A. maker, O'Sullivan Industries Inc., is owned by the Tandy Corporation, the computer maker, and sold through another Tandy subsidiary, Radio Shack.) They also began branching out into bookcases, bedrooms and children's furniture.
Prices have risen, naturally; your basic end table may run $39 these days. And some marketing drawbacks remain. Many people still consider particle-board furniture to be of low quality, especially in this country, where wood furniture has always been available at relatively moderate prices.
Thus, unassembled furniture still appeals mostly to younger people or to families furnishing a spare room or a second house.
"I don't think you're ever going to see it as primary furniture you sit on when the preacher comes to visit," Mr. Epperson said.

 
 
The Distributors
Pushing the Boxes At Kmart and Sears
 The real secret to the industry's success may be not in how the products are designed or made, but in how they are distributed.
The furniture is sold most frequently by major discount stores and mass merchants, not by traditional furniture retailers. Discounters like the Kmart Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. represent 30 percent of the retail market. Mass merchants like Sears and catalogue showrooms take another 35 percent. Discount retailers find R.T.A. pieces easy to handle: show one assembled unit and stack 20 boxed duplicates right next to it.
"You can't sell a set-up six-drawer dresser through Kmart," said Kevin Sauder, grandson of the founder and director of marketing for Sauder Woodworking, now the largest R.T.A. maker in the country.
Right behind the discounters have come home improvement centers, now with 7 percent of the R.T.A. market; membership warehouse clubs (6 percent) and office superstores (9 percent).
One of the most recent mass marketers to jump on the R.T.A. bandwagon is the Sears chain, which gets 9 percent of its furniture sales from unassembled furnishings.
"R.T.A., with its styling, was in the right place at the right time," said Mary Ellen Schumacher, a Sears buyer. "They make it differently than traditional furniture, but it's not any less of a product."

 
 
The Ikea Formula
Pick Out a Room And Drive It Home

If there is one aspect of the ready-to-assemble market that analysts and manufacturers can agree on, it is the Swedish phenomenon called Ikea.
The furniture retailer broke into the American market in 1985 with an enormous blue-and-gold store-cum-warehouse outside Philadelphia. There are now 10 stadium-sized stores in the United States, and the 11th will be opening in the Houston area this week.
Everything about the Ikea concept -- from quirky advertising to in-store signs depicting a talking Allen wrench that explains the do-it-yourself concept -- has helped to bring R.T.A. into the American mainstream.
The chain's total sales in 1991 were $284 million, up 68 percent from 1990, according to a spokeswoman, Pam Diaconis.
Ikea lures customers with splashy, colorful advertising and mailings. The maze-like pattern of its stores insures they see a dozen displays, even if they planned only to look at bookshelves. When a setting catches their eyes, they can take home the whole room -- from the shelves to the tables and chairs to the lampshades -- that day.
It's a concept shared by other specialty stores, like Conran's Habitat, that in total now account for an estimated 12 percent of the R.T.A. market. There is strong logic to it. Surveys show that most people hate the traditional furniture-shopping experience. The pricing and brands are confusing and once consumers have made a decision, they still must wait weeks for delivery.
Immediate gratification, then is one of R.T.A.'s biggest assets, a thought not lost on Ikea. .
"People walk around the store," said Robert Marks, a senior editor and furniture writer for HFD magazine, a home furnishings trade publication. "They find a piece, they strap it into the back of the car, go home and put it together and that afternoon they've got a new piece of furniture."

 
 
A TRADITIONALIST TAKES A FLYER ON THE R.T.A.
 Most times, a corporation with little more than than $400 million in annual sales does not cause much of a stir when makes an $8.4 million acquisition.
But the industry certainly took notice when Ladd Furniture Inc., the fourth-largest furniture maker in the country, best known for its Pennsylvania House line, announced July 3 that it was buying the Fournier Furniture Corporation. Fournier makes ready-to-assemble furniture, and this is the first time a traditional manufacturer has taken an R.T.A. maker into its fold..
Fournier is the fifth-largest ready-to-assemble furniture maker in the country, with sales of $30 million in 1991. It was founded in 1972 by Greg Sammons, originally to cash in on the market for something to put home electronics on or in. Now it offers furniture for every room in the house.
Mr. Sammons, who is staying on as president of Fournier, said the Ladd deal would help his company expand its styling efforts. "We want to bring the whole fashion design flair of the rigid furniture industry into our product," he said.
As Richard Allen, chairman and chief executive of Ladd, sees it, R.T.A. is just growing too fast to ignore. "There is a $15 billion market for furniture out there," he said, "and the distribution is changing."

HEADLINE: Technology;
Getting Nuclear Plants Down to Size

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
For the first 20 years of the nuclear era, reactor designers insisted that bigger was better. But in the last few years, as demand for existing designs dropped to zero, engineers have started fresh and are planning streamlined reactors incorporating advanced technology. Along the way they have rethought their ideas on size, and some people are now disputing the old idea that cheaper power can be achieved through economies of scale.
As a result, the most striking new nuclear designs are for reactors just half the size of the old ones, breaking a long trend of larger and larger plants. The trend began with the first commercial plant, a 60-megawatt generator in Shippingport, Pa., ordered in 1953, and ended with Palo Verde, a plant the Arizona Public Service ordered in 1973, which at 1,270 megawatts is 21 times larger. 
 In contrast, in a few weeks General Electric will submit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission a safety analysis of a design for a 600-megawatt "simplified" reactor. Westinghouse, a competitor, submitted a design for a plant that size last month.
The two plants, which the industry refers to as of moderate size, are part of a new generation of plants that would rely heavily on gravity, natural heat circulation and other non-mechanical principles to prevent overheating, instead of "engineered safety features" like pumps and valves.
Using such "passive" safety systems sets a limit on size. A 600-megawatt plant, engineers say, can be kept below dangerous temperatures by natural circulation, but a 1,300-megawatt plant cannot. A reactor that makes more use of gravity and natural circulation needs fewer safety-grade pumps and valves, which are very expensive because they must be designed to exacting standards.
The passive design's smaller size may be a virtue in meeting the desires of the customers: electric utilities. According to the Utility Data Institute, a consulting firm in Washington, American utilities will complete 56 non-nuclear generating stations this year with an average size of 54 megawatts, or about the size of Shippingport. Christopher Bergesen, a vice president at the institute, said this average is the smallest in 20 years. Of 25 plants that entered service last year, only 3 were above 600 megawatts. In times of normal electricity demand, a 600-megawatt plant can supply about 300,000 homes.
Nowadays, the nuclear pipeline is nearly dry, with all the plants ordered after 1975 having been canceled, although some plants started before then are still expected to come into service.
The Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., undertook a survey in 1982, when the reactor manufacturers started to think about new designs. "We got a strong statement from the utilities that if we could get a unit that was reasonably economic, we'd prefer it to be smaller," said John Taylor, the head of the group's nuclear research program.
The reason is that any power plant order is a bet about how much demand will develop in the future, and a smaller reactor is a smaller bet. "You have less uncertainty in terms of projecting electric demand," Mr. Taylor said.
In the 1970's, many utilities rushed ahead with large reactors when the price of oil jumped. But as electricity prices rose, the demand for power dropped, leaving them with surplus capacity. Regulators have sometimes ruled that surplus capacity is not "used and useful" and that utilities may not raise rates to bill their customers for it. In the Chicago area, Commonwealth Edison is still trying to have its newest reactors recognized in rates.
"A lot of companies have been burned very badly," Mr. Taylor said.
At the New York Power Pool, a seven-utility consortium that arranges power swaps and helps to coordinate planning, William J. Balet, the executive director, pointed out that growth in demand in New York State is now less than 200 megawatts a year. There may be some retirements, he said, but even so, a plant of 1,000 megawatts represents several years of growth and may be a chunk that is too big to swallow.
But some reactor manufacturers think this logic does not hold true around the country, setting the stage for an interesting market test. General Electric has already submitted an analysis to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of a more conventional plant of 1,300 megawatts, as has another company, Combustion Engineering, a subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri. These are described as "evolutionary" designs, making improvements on the last of the current generation of American plants, but without radical changes.
In contrast, Westinghouse, at least for now, has all its eggs in the small basket, the plants described as being in a new generation. Thus, if all goes according to the nuclear industry's plan, utilities in the market for new generating stations late in this decade will face a choice.
General Electric is hedging its bets and preparing a large design in part because it is hard for a utility to win approval to build on a site and, with permission in hand, "a lot of utilities are going to want to pack as many megawatts into a site as they can," said Robert C. Berglund, general manager of advanced reactor programs at General Electric.
That certainly holds true in Japan, where reactors are still being ordered and where G.E. is in a partnership with Tokyo Electric, Toshiba and Hitachi to build large reactors similar to the "evolutionary" design that G.E. submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Westinghouse is in partnership with a different utility, Kansai Electric, together with Mitsubishi, on a large plant design but is a step behind the General Electric-Tokyo Electric group.
There are still advantages to size. A 1,300-megawatt reactor has the same number of control rooms as a 600-megawatt reactor, advocates point out, the same number of guard shacks at the front gate and about the same size managerial staff. They do take longer to build, however, and, if interest rates are high, finance charges on capital invested in an unfinished plant for an extra year or so of construction could swing some utilities to favor the smaller plant.
A study by the United States Council for Energy Awareness, the public relations arm of the nuclear industry, estimated that a 600-megawatt plant coming on line at the end of this decade would produce power for about 4.5 cents a kilowatt-hour but said this could be lowered to 4.1 cents a kilowatt-hour by building two adjacent ones. But, the study said, the 1,200-megawatt "evolutionary" reactors could produce power for 3.8 cents a kilowatt-hour, which could be cut to 3.5 cents if they were built in pairs.
The point of the study was not to compare reactors of different sizes but to show that they could compete with coal- and natural gas-fired generation. One result, however, is to estimate the cost penalty for picking a smaller plant.
In the end, though, a utility that considers buying a nuclear plant may get the deciding push from its financial backers. Paul C. Parshley, who analyzes utility debt at Salomon Brothers, says no utility now seems eager to order a plant. But if one comes to market to borrow money to build one, he said, "if you're talking about a larger reactor, you've got an additional hurdle to clear."
In light of the stop-and-start nature of growth in demand for electricity and the risks of building a nuclear plant, he said, if there are utilities that want new reactors, they would probably prefer something even smaller than the new Westinghouse and G.E. designs, in the range of 400 megawatts, not 600.

HEADLINE: THE SEXES;
I Need You, You Need Me

BYLINE: By Suzanne Slesin

 BODY:
THERE'S a riddle going around at meetings where co-dependency is discussed. It is this: What is a co-dependent? Someone who, when hit by a bus, sees someone else's life flash by.
It was once assumed that in many troubled relationships it was the woman who was the co-dependent, the one who couldn't break away. The man had the drug or alcohol addiction and the woman had the job of caring for him, at the cost of subordinating her own needs and feelings. 
 Indeed, women predominate at co-dependency seminars, Al-Anon meetings and group therapy sessions. They also buy the majority of self-help books. But the image of the wife as victim is slowly being replaced, as people come to understand that there are men and women who willingly choose such relationships, and willingly participate in them.
Yet, perceiving co-dependency as a women's issue is still strong. The role women play in troubled relationships was probably first identified in the Al-Anon groups started by Lois Wilson, the wife of Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. But these days, women are less willing to accept this passive role, and a new book has taken a hard look at the so-called recovery movement and the reasons women have embraced it.
WENDY KAMINER, the author of "I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional: The Recovery Movement and Other Self-Help Fashions" (Addison Wesley, $18.95), sees co-dependency as "a catchall term for whatever ails you."
At a recovery conference, Ms. Kaminer said she saw "women that feminism bypassed." Through the recovery movement, she said, they have been given a "soft feminine pop message: 'You have a right to say no,' or 'You can't find yourself in someone else.' " Ms. Kaminer said it was strange to hear these things now, in the 90's, "as if they were being uttered for the first time."
What is missing at self-help conventions, she said, is any discussion of the fact that women are often trapped in relationships by economic circumstances. Women are told, "you are in this relationship because you are weak, not because we live in a society riddled with inequities," Ms. Kaminer added.
Some professionals see the issue differently. "Co-dependency, as in being dependent with, is everyone's issue," said Mary L. Bassett, a coordinator of Project Healthy Choice at the Bank Street College of Education in New York. "It is a feminist issue, but it is also a family, community and societal issue."
Tony Allen, a retired stockbroker who teaches meditation at the Renaissance Institute in Boca Raton, Fla., and who was a founder in New York of Adult Children of Alcoholics, said women "realize their victimization more quickly than men, who have been programmed not to be victims but perpetrators."
"When women realized they had the problem, they wanted to do something about it," he said. "When the movement grew, men became more aware."
Others contend that rather than selling women the pop bill of goods, as Ms. Kaminer suggests, the recovery movement has given women a new voice. "The recovery movement empowered women for the first time," said Marilyn White, the director of the Realization Center, an alcohol and substance-abuse treatment center in New York. "Many people are stuck in their lives, feel trapped and are looking for something to get them out of their situation."
T HE issue is "learned helplessness," Ms. White said.
"Early on, women are told they are nothing without men," she said. "But if women are so co-dependent, then who are we dependent on?"
Men, of course, in many instances. And men are just as dependent, Ms. White said. But on different things.
"It gets played out in their careers," Ms. White said. "When a man loses his job, it's as bad as when a woman loses a relationship. His relationship has been with work. Hers is with people."
Robert Subby, the executive director of Family Systems Center in Minneapolis, said the co-dependency pendulum swings both ways. "Do women always have to take responsibility for the emotional business of life?" he asked. "And do men always have to be defined by their work, education and position in a community?"
One effect of the recovery movement is that women are openly identifying themselves as alcoholics and addicts. In doing so, they encourage their mates to deal with their own co-dependency.
"Once I realized that my right as a man to control everyone around me, particularly my wife, was not a God-given right, then I had to try to understand what my real motives were," said Dick Fontaine, a film maker in New York.
Ms. Kaminer says the recovery movement has peaked and is fading. Mr. Allen agrees. "The part of the movement that has been taken over by high-powered hype people is waning," he said. "But not the 12-step grassroots level."
But for others, all the meetings, books and workshops have been only a beginning. "They won't fix the problems," Ms. White said. "The next step is to change the behavior."
And as a man who regularly attends recovery meetings noted, "There are still plenty of chairs waiting to be filled at any meeting I've ever attended."

HEADLINE: Why Supercollider Project Has to Stop

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On June 17, the House of Representatives voted to stop financing the superconducting supercollider. Your June 19 and June 20 articles emphasize the claims of contractors, high-energy physicists and the Department of Energy -- all with a stake in the survival of the project. All predict dire consequences for the country should the project be stopped. There is another side of the story. 
 If you believe the wailings coming from the self-interested champions of the supercollider, stopping the project is tantamount to dooming the United States to a hard scrabble, third-world quality of life in the next century. They ask us to believe that the sine qua non of improving America's competitiveness is to spend $8 million per high-energy physicist to build this one machine. This argument might be compelling if it weren't so self-evidently wrong. High-energy physics, with its expensive instruments and small cadre of experimentalists removed from practical questions or inventions, is a net consumer of national wealth.
The only thing that might correlate with having the most powerful high-energy physics facility in the world is winning Nobel prizes in physics. For most of the last 50 years, the United States has had the most advanced high-energy physics facilities. But while the United States has been collecting Nobels, the Japanese have been collecting markets (and not investing heavily in high-energy physics); and if there were a Nobel prize for national economic success, the Japanese would already have a 20-year lock on the award.
All the hype from the wounded supporters of the supercollider aside, we know how to make America more competitive. We must begin by separating merely desirable from absolutely essential investments; that is what the House vote on June 17 was about. While the supercollider is a laudable idea, it stretches the bounds of credulity to believe that it can become the cornerstone of an American economic renaissance.
After the Federal budget is brought under control and we have taken steps that do more than add to the rhetoric about restoring our competitiveness, I would invite high-energy physicists to come back to Washington with their most ambitious project, and we can then build it together.

The House Votes Its Wishes But Its Budget Constraints Deny the Usual Pleasures

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
The House faced the 1990 budget act's spending limits twice last week. First it pretended they weren't a problem, passing a bill to raise the theoretical maximum of Pell grants to needy college students from $3,100 to $3,700 in 1993-94 even though an Appropriations subcommittee voted to cut them from $2,400 to $2,300.
Then the House voted to change the budget law's spending limits, so $400 million from the unpopular foreign aid budget, money it had cut last month, could be spent on politically appealing highways. But the measure barely passed, and is unlikely to become law. 
 Both moves reflect a painful truth: Money is very tight. The 1990 act was supposed to pinch this year, and it has, holding increases in some areas below the inflation rate, and leaving just about nothing for new domestic programs, like bigger Pell grants or the Surface Transportation Act that Congress and President Bush congratulated themselves on enacting as a jobs bill last fall.
Being on the Appropriations Committees used to be more fun. There were opportunities to provide money for grand national causes and for desperately needed local projects. But not this year. A federal deficit likely to exceed $350 billion and widespread contempt for Congress cannot be ignored by Congress and its Appropriations Committee.
Representative William H. Natcher of Kentucky, the acting chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said recently, "This is going to be the most difficult year we've had since I've been on the committee." He's been there 38 years.

Laid-Off Bosses Scramble in A Changing World

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
AS the national economy teeters agonizingly between slow convalescence and recessionary relapse, the men and women who once helped run the private sector as mid-level bosses, as well as their sidekicks or their secretaries, are peculiarly plagued by America's economic ailments. A few jobs may be coming back -- but usually not their kind. Some of them may be returning to work, but it is taking longer than it once did. To fit into an economy that is reinventing itself, economists say, they may have to reinvent themselves, too.
When Peter Pollet was laid off from his job as sales manager of a manufacturing concern he joined a group called Capital Area Career Network near Concord, N.H. "We tell people to assess their skills, and we encourage them, if they can, to get into the service industry," he said. 
"If they can't, we tell them to figure out if they can get into some kind of business for themselves. We say, 'Don't plan on doing what you did before, because it won't be around.' " Janet Norwood, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington, said that "The mentality that says, 'We've had a downturn, eventually we'll have an upturn, everything is going to be the way it was,' has to change. Industry is changing, technologies are changing, even managerial styles are changing."
Dr. Norwood and several other economists see the unemployed managers, whose number topped 600,000 in May, as unwilling pioneers. When they joined the labor market, careers were like board games, with points or money slowly but surely gained. You might lose a few turns, but you moved inexorably along a defined route toward a defined goal.
That model is being replaced by something more like a Nintendo game, in which dodging, wheeling and grappling with the unexpected -- flexibility and quick reflexes -- are the skills of choice. Unlucky players don't lose turns; they drop off a screen and disappear.
While some economists point to labor force figures showing that managers have not been disproportionately hurt by the job losses that have hit the labor force, the segments of the economy that tend to hire the most managerial personnel are among the slowest to come back.
Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, noted that in 1991, white-collar managers were unemployed longer, on average, than blue-collar workers. In 1982, during the last major recession, the reverse was true.
 
Flat Employment Rate
 "The sector that employs the greatest percentage of managers is finance, insurance and real estate," Professor Sum said, adding that more than a quarter of this labor force fits the Federal Government's classification of "executive, administrative and managerial" workers. In that sector, he said, "employment is flat -- there's no change at all" between June 1991 and June 1992.
"The second sector -- and the biggest employer in absolute numbers -- is the private services sector. There are 5 million managers there, 12 percent of the total. If you exclude health services, we added only 250,000 jobs, a total of not even 1 percent."
In 1991, he added, the average duration of unemployment for laid-off managerial personnel was 13.5 weeks. In the second quarter of 1992, the unemployment rate among managers stood at 3.7 percent, almost one and a half percentage points higher than the average rate in 1990, the year the recession began.
Some experts note the phenomenon of unemployed professionals and managers is nothing new. In Sloan Wilson's novel, "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit," the protagonist runs into a fellow commuter who has been fired, but takes the train to keep his joblessness secret from his wife.
Nor is unemployment among these workers the dominant fact of the current labor market. More than 500,000 unemployed managerial personnel may be flailing around in an unwelcoming economy, but "if 10 million people are unemployed, this is not where the real problem in society is," said Sar A. Levitan, director of the Center for Policy Studies at George Washington University.
The issue, he said, is not who is geting laid off, but why. "It's more a question of the restructuring of the economy," Dr. Levitan said. "Before, industries continued to grow," weathering occasional downturns. "Competition was not as fierce as it is now," he added.
The ripples caused by these layoffs, however, may be more significant than the total number of managers displaced.
The first and most obvious effect is on the onetime bosses themselves, achievers deprived of the arena in which they achieved. "It's a severe process," said Sandra Smith Dupree, a spokeswoman for the state Employment Security office in New Hampshire, whose 1980's boom economy turned sour in 1990. Five major bank reorganizations and downsizing in the once feisty high technology sector led to a significant loss of management jobs, she said.
A second effect, Dr. Sum said, is on the sense of confidence, both emotional and economic, among family and friends of unemployed executives. These men -- and, Dr. Sum said, Federal statistics show that most newly laid-off managers are men -- tend to be visible members of their communities. For those around them, it is unsettling to realize that such a person can lose a job.
Another apparent result, economists say, is an increase in self-employed workers, as the executives become self-employed consultants, working on contract until better long-term prospects appear.
One possibly beneficial byproduct of the managerial dog days may be that it will prepare younger people for the job- and career-jumping likely to be their lot. They seem to be turning away from managerial careers.
An annual University of California at Los Angeles study of freshman showed that between 1987 and 1990 the number of students planning to major in accounting, business administration, finance, marketing or management dropped sharply.
"The economy's always in flux," said Dr. Norwood. "People have to recognize that it's going to be much rarer for people to pick an occupation, get a job, and stay with he same company throughout a lifetime. Or even stay with an occupation.
"I grew up in a family where my Dad was 50 years with one company," said Jim Murphy, a chemical engineer recently laid off from a Houston firm specializing in hydroblasting, the cleaning of chemical equipment with high-pressure water systems. "The two firms I was with before the last one took me everywhere -- I was with them for 15 years apiece."
But, he said, he tells his 20-year-old son, an electrical engineering major at Rice University, "Forget about brand loyalty. They're not going to be loyal to you. Don't be loyal to them." His son is preparing for two related careers -- one in Navy submarines, one in general engineering. The only question is whether two will be enough.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Russians Line Up for Gas as Refineries Sit On Cheap Oil

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
BY mid-morning, the line of cars at Gasoline Station No. 35 stretches for half a mile down Trifonovskaya Street. Everywhere in Russia there are similar lines, and filling the family car has become as frustrating and uncertain as it was for Americans during the Arab oil crises of the 1970's.
But the reasons are different. While the Americans suffered from shortages of Middle East oil, Russia's supplies are sufficient. However, the oil is being held in huge storage tanks at Russian refineries, without being shipped to gasoline stations. The problem is price. With oil selling for $19 a barrel on the world market, Russian oil goes for about 300 rubles, or less than $3 a barrel. So the Russian oil industry is holding back as much fuel as it can, waiting for prices to be allowed to rise. 
 "Have you seen anyone in New York selling one dollar for 10 cents?" asked Lev D. Churilov, president of the Russian Oil and Gas Association, an industry trade group. "No one does that. Nevertheless in Russia today we are told by the Government to sell oil for one-tenth its value."
No single economic issue is more troublesome for President Boris N. Yeltsin than oil prices. While the West presses him to let oil prices rise over sixfold this summer to match world levels, Parliament says so steep an increase would bankrupt enterprises dependent on cheap fuel and bring hardship to families forced to pay more for heat and electricity, as well as gasoline.
Lately, Mr. Yeltsin has sided with Parliament. He announced in late June that another oil price increase, the third this year, would be postponed for a while. That insures gasoline lines through the summer as the chiefs of oil production companies and refineries -- still state-owned but operating nearly autonomously -- bet that Mr. Yeltsin will soon give ground.
Already, the increases allowed this year have brought the price of crude oil from less than 5 rubles, or about 5 cents, a barrel in January to the current price of nearly 300 rubles.
"Everyone is keeping back oil, waiting for even higher prices and selling just enough to get by," said Dimitri Gabrilov, director of Qualitet, an investment banking operation that lends to PermNeft, a Siberian oil production company, enabling it to have funds to operate without having to sell all the oil it pumps. Qualitet takes as collateral PermNeft's unsold oil.
Sometimes the industry finds ways to sell oil or refined products at world prices -- for example, by selling to Russian middlemen who then re-sell the petroleum at world prices. But most is held back, and the result is the gasoline lines. They get particularly long on Fridays, when many Russians fill the family car for a weekend trip to the summer dacha, typically a wooden hut and a vegetable garden in a country village 60 miles or so from Moscow or some other Russian city.
 
Trying to Beat the System
 Sometimes people wait in line twice, to get more than the Government-imposed limit of 40 liters -- 10.6 gallons -- for a single purchase at the official price of 7.3 rubles a liter, or about 23 cents a gallon. If a driver is impatient, he might buy on the black market from men standing at the curb who sell gasoline from 20-liter drums at 30 rubles a liter. It is gasoline they waited in lines to purchase legally for 7.3 rubles a liter.
Or, a driver might slip a gasoline station attendant a few rubles to pump more than the limit, as a father and son in a white Zhiguli station wagon did at Station No. 35 on a recent weekday. The attendant filled the car's tank and also two plastic drums, a total of 60 liters. To fool the cashier in the station, the father paid for 40 liters and the son approached a few minutes later to pay for the remaining 20 liters, as if his were a separate purchase.
"Everyone is irritated; you can hear all kinds of awful language," said Valentina Svetikova, a manager of the state-owned Station No. 35. "They are ready to pay more for gasoline, but there is none. We call up the central agency that sends us gasoline and ask for more, but they say there is none."
The supply problem would undoubtedly disappear if the West had its way. It wants Mr. Yeltsin to let Russia's oil prices rise toward $19 a barrel -- the world market level -- instead of requiring the Russian oil industry to sell 80 percent of the nation's output at home for under $3 a barrel. That would mean gasoline prices of 30 rubles a liter, or about $1.10 a gallon. And gasoline lines would disappear. As supplies rose, car owners would cut their purchases in a nation where most family income is under 10,000 rubles, or $100, a month. Driving a car would become very expensive.
Falling demand would make more oil available for sale abroad, earning Russia more dollars from its chief export, especially if untapped Siberian reserves were brought into production. That would make repayment of the nation's foreign debt much easier. More foreign goods could be purchased, and there would be more dollars to repatriate profits from foreign investments.
These are major goals of the Western industrial nations. Their agent, the International Monetary Fund, insisted that Russia provide "a very precise schedule" for raising oil prices, a Russian official said, as a key part of an overall agreement to release $24 billion in foreign assistance. Mr. Yeltsin refused and the agreement signed last week between the I.M.F. and Russia, for only $1 billion in credits, postponed oil price negotiations to a later date. Even at the economic summit in Munich last week, Mr. Yeltsin resisted higher oil prices, proposing instead to swap Russian property, including oil, in exchange for canceling debt.
But pressure is also coming from the managers of state oil companies, who say that without higher prices they cannot afford the investment necessary to reverse the decline in Russia's oil production. "Mr. Yeltsin told us he would raise oil prices by the end of the year," Mr. Churilov said, "but first there must be a formula for offsetting the inflationary impact. That is difficult."
 
A Shared Burden
 Hopefully, the formula will be worked out soon. As oil production declines, Russia is forcing other republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States to bear more of the burden than Russia. With its huge Siberian fields, Russia produces 8.2 million barrels a day of the Commonwealth's 9.3 million barrel output. But as production has fallen, Russian crude oil shipments to refineries in other republics have fallen by nearly 3 barrels for each barrel cut back at Russian refineries.
"The pattern is that the Russian refineries are getting enough crude and the rest of the Commonwealth is not," said Thane Gustaffson, of the Cambridge Energy Institute in Cambridge, Mass. The gasoline lines in the other republics are even longer than in Russia. But they might seem like a blessing if Russia gives in to the West's pressure and raises fuel prices to world levels, not only for Russia but for the other Commonwealth states. Cheap Russian oil makes the other states in the Commonwealth dependent on Russia -- a dependence that has helped to hold the Commonwealth together.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Irresolute Meetings Chip Away at Summitry's Stature

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland

 BODY:
BOTH at the economic summit of seven leading industrial democracies in Munich and at the larger gathering of the 52-state European security conference here last week, world leaders tried hard to create the illusion of resolve. They sounded firm about the crucial economic and military problems before them, but what they actually did was very little.
In Munich, the leaders said it was a shame they had been unable to get their negotiators to make good on past promises to reach a new global trade agreement, and they vowed -- for the third straight year -- to push for agreement by the end of December. 
 In Helsinki and in Munich, they rattled sabers at Serbia. But when President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Herzegovina begged them to go beyond airlifts of emergency food and medical supplies and send troops and bombers to stop the Serbian bombardment of Sarajevo, they responded by ordering a naval blockade that will stand well offshore. They also vowed to keep the emergency supplies coming. "Aggression and its consequences cannot be stopped by charity," the Bosnian leader pleaded, but there was not a single national leader, President Bush included, who was yet willing to send troops into the quagmire.
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq could have told them that the illusion of resolve is never as persuasive as resolve itself. At their summits last week, the world leaders seemed to be trying to talk themselves into resolve, both on the trade issue and on the Balkans. They haven't quite got there yet, though this could change.
Most of them are in grave political difficulties this year. Without pressure from their domestic lobbies to worry about, both President Bush and President Francois Mitterrand of France might have found it possible to compromise on the trade issue. But Mr. Mitterrand was simply unwilling to make the concessions demanded by President Bush on reducing agricultural export subsidies for European produce -- not with French farmers still seething over the European Community's recent decision to cut back its expensive and extensive system of production subsidies. And, with his own political fate closely tied to a referendum on European unity to be held Sept. 20, Mr. Mitterrand is unlikely to change his mind for several months.
Even then, Mr. Bush will still be preoccupied by the political fight of his life, something that clearly inhibited him in Munich, where he kept such a low profile as to be practically invisible.
Domestic politics may also explain some of the American reluctance to march into the Balkans and chase Serbia back home the way allied forces chased Iraq out of Kuwait. "We have no plans to inject ourselves into a conflict situation in Yugoslavia," Mr. Bush said, confirming a series of briefings by American officials who made clear that at the most, the United States would be prepared to provide air cover for United Nations convoys of relief supplies for the people of Sarajevo if a new Security Council resolution authorizes such a step.
That leaves the ball in the court of international organizations like the 52-state Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO, and the nine-nation Western European Union, the European Community's military arm. The security conference agreed at the end of the week that it could work with these military organizations and the United Nations, if beefed-up military operations become advisable to try to keep peace in Yugoslavia.
With or without domestic politics as an obstacle, it is hard to see any way to impose peace on the Balkans without the kind of sizable military operation that drove Iraq out of Kuwait -- only this would be likely to take years instead of weeks, and nobody, in Europe or in the United States, wants to be drawn into such a nightmare.
Keeping the Sarajevo airport open for relief supplies is about at the limit of the United Nations' present powers, though the leaders in Munich and Helsinki said they would support the use of force to open the roads of Bosnia to relief convoys if it became necessary to keep the flow of supplies moving.
Will President Slobodan Milosevic call off the Serbian onslaught in the face of such threats? Probably not, Western diplomats in Helsinki conceded, but perhaps future aggressors in the seething cauldron of ethnic and national rivalries that used to be the Soviet Union might think twice, if NATO and the others have got their act together by then.
The alliance and the Western European Union took a small first step by sending in warships to tighten the United Nations blockade of Serbia, and the security conference sent observers into the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Armenia and Azerbaijan have been practically at war for several years.
To keep things from deteriorating that far in Russia, the industrial powers agreed in Munich to support a loan of a billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund, with the prospect of another $500 million or so in import loans. If President Boris N. Yeltsin makes good on his promises of bringing about a market economy, he may also get the equivalent of another $2.5 billion a year in deferral of interest payments on Russia's $71-billion debt.
Mr. Yeltsin is another past master of illusion, and left the summit leaders to dream of prospects of a tantalizing debt-for-equity swap -- Russian oil and diamonds in exchange for bank write-offs, perhaps.
But were the meager results of these two gargantuan summits really worth all the disruption and the money they cost? What the leaders of the world actually do during the year ahead may provide the answer.

HEADLINE: Trying to Contain Anarchy;
As Some Nations Build, the Past Devours Others

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE is a factory outside Toyota City, Japan, where 66 human beings and 310 robots build 300 Lexus sedans each day. There are hills around Sarajevo where five children were killed by tank fire last month as they were picking fruit from a cherry tree. In many ways the Lexus and the cherry tree are the symbols of the post-cold war world. Some countries, it seems, are emerging from the cold war intent on building a better Lexus, while others are emerging from the cold war intent on renewing tribal feuds over who owns which cherry trees. In Japan, in Taiwan, in Singapore, in Maastricht, the future seems to be burying the past. In Sarajevo, in the West Bank, in Nagorno-Karabakh, in Moldova, in Northern Ireland, the past seems to be burying the future.
It was not supposed to be this way. After the long march of the cold war, it seemed to many in the West that they deserved a rest and that from here on, history would be a story about free-market, pluralistic, democratic values gradually spreading around the globe: Lexus triumphant. 
 But since the Berlin Wall fell, so too have many illusions. Indeed, last week's Group of Seven summit in Munich was a perfect snapshot of what really comes next. The leaders there spent half their time futilely trying to work out a new international trading system and the other half fretting about what to do with Yugoslavia and other ethnic flashpoints. It is this new world melange, not some idyllic new world order, that lies ahead.
It is actually logical that the Lexus and the cherry tree would compete side by side as symbols for the post-cold war world, the Harvard political economist Robert Reich argues. This is because when the world becomes more technologically advanced and economically intertwined, with economic borders all but erased, there is a counter-reaction of ethnic self-assertion. As national boundaries fall, personal boundaries rise. "On the one hand, thanks to the CNN effect, there is a growing awareness around the world of the standard of living that awaits a rapidly industrializing nation which gets its priorities and its technologies right," said Mr. Reich. "But as geographical borders disappear there is simultaneously a renewed yearning to assert one's own uniqueness -- to create new borders based on history, religion, nationalism and culture."
That tension is at work in America, Western Europe and Japan, as well as in the Balkans, although up to now the industrially advanced nations have kept it in reasonable balance. Nevertheless, "America First" nativism has been apparent in the Patrick Buchanan campaign, not to mention the Ross Perot phenomenon. In Japan, a stronger strain of aggressive nationalism is asserting itself on the margins of politics, and in Italy, France and Germany right-wing groups opposed to immigration have flourished in recent elections. Even European integration, which was supposed to flower this year, is suddenly being resisted from Denmark to England, as their citizens chafe at depositing their identities into the European Community Cuisinart to be homogenized into a bland Euro-mush.
The challenge for modern societies is to get people to work together and maintain the rising standards of living that come from economic interdependence and technological advancement, while at the same time allowing people to seek greater psychological warmth from their ethnic identities. France and America have had centuries to develop the rule of laws and institutions that make that balance possible, and even Japan and Germany have had nearly 50 years now. In reborn states like Serbia, however, the imperatives of ethnic solidarity have run riot.
Unfortunately, most societies seem to have to find this balance the hard way. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin tells a Russian folk tale about a sultan who punished one of his wives by having her sealed with her son in a barrel and set adrift at sea. Again and again, the boy says he wants to stretch his legs, but his mother talks him out of it, saying he would only push out the barrel's bottom. Finally the boy says he simply must stretch his legs, no matter what. So he does, the bottom of the barrel gets pushed out and they drown.
The parable fits Serbia or Armenia or the Czech and Slovak republics. They seem intent on stretching their nationalist legs, no matter what the consequences. When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d went to Armenia and Azerbaijan last year he pleaded with their leaders to use their new freedom and scant resources on economic development instead of fighting over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. They listened politely, nodding their heads. And as soon as Mr. Baker left they went back to pummeling each other. There were just too many pent-up scores to settle.
"You cannot tell the Serbs that independence is not a storybook tale, that it is not the utopia they think it is," said Fouad Ajami, the Lebanese-born historian. "People maintain imaginary homelands in their minds. They carry them around for generations. When the call of the tribe beckons, you just have to stand aside and let it play itself out. Where Pandora's box has been opened no prudent man should tread. These are situations that do not lend themselves to the outsider's touch."
 
A Journey of Delusions
 Eventually the Serbs, Armenians, Azeris and Moldovans will probably learn what the Lebanese learned after 15 years of civil war: that theirs is a journey of delusions, that a politics based on an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth only ends up with a society with no eyes and no teeth. The lesson of Lebanon is that in the end reality always intrudes, because however good asserting one's identity is for the soul, it doesn't do much for the stomach. Eventually people have to produce something, even if it is not a Lexus. There is nothing like the collective pauperization the Lebanese have experienced to dampen a nationalist frenzy.
Two societies that may have learned that lesson without tumbling over the edge (at least for the moment) are Quebec and Israel. In both, the voters seem to have intuitively come to realize that in an era when Japan can assemble a Lexus with robots, they cannot afford to fall farther behind by focusing their energy on asserting ownership rights to a particular cherry or olive tree.
In Quebec, nationalists struggled mightily to persuade the middle class that separation would have no economic costs; but once people began to realize that there would, indeed, be less investment and fewer jobs, the separatist balloon burst. In Israel, voters seemed to say that it no longer made sense to risk being isolated and falling behind Taiwan and Singapore because they had to build another settlement in Gaza to fulfill the Likud party's religious-nationalist vision. "The Israeli public," said the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi, "wanted a better balance between the imperatives of security and the necessities of building a livable competitive society that is open to the world markets."
To the extent that Washington has a policy for dealing with these situations, that policy seems to have two facets. One is to help countries avoid succumbing to the call of the wild, by framing clear choices for them. President Bush made clear to the Israelis -- by holding up $10 billion in loan guarantees until Israel freezes settlements -- that they can have economic development or more nationalist settlements, but not both.
The other side of the policy is to isolate those countries like Serbia that have had choices framed for them but have made the wrong choice. World War I started in Sarajevo, but it seems unlikely that the current fighting there will ignite World War III. Why? Because great wars are made by great powers, and when Russia, Germany, Britain, France and the United States all decide that they do not want to get involved in the politics of small tribes because they have more important things to do at home, conflicts like Yugoslavia's become remarkably containable -- even in the heart of Europe.
In a way, Europe is once again being divided, but this time the Iron Curtain is being built not by Communists, but by those countries focused on building a better Lexus, who are trying to seal out those intent on fighting over their cherry trees.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
What Hidden Costs in Spreading the Insurance Risk?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
SHOULD health insurers be obliged to cover a 50-year-old overweight bartender for the same premium as a 20-year-old secretary who swims a mile each day?
"This is what insurance was designed to do," said Robert Jaffe, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis. The insurers' job, he added, is to "take those who are considered to be risky and blend them with those who are young and healthy." And last month the New York State Legislature agreed, requiring health insurers who write policies for any small group or individual to offer comparable policies to all, and at a uniform price. 
 But economists are skeptical. While many are in accord with Michael Blumenfeld of Empire Blue Cross that "health care is a right," they are reluctant to cut the link between the cost of providing insurance and the price charged to those insured. If universal access to health care is the goal, asks Richard Thaler, an economist at Cornell University, "why should we pay for it via insurance premiums rather than taxes?"
They also worry that similar risk-spreading rationales will be applied to other forms of insurance -- everything from auto to fire coverage -- pitting the middle class against the poor and drawing government into markets more efficiently regulated by competition. The "general socialization of risk," predicts Orin Kramer, a private consultant in Princeton, N.J., "will eliminate the possibility of non-political insurance coverage."
New York State's problem with health insurance illustrates the conundrum. As a quasi-public insurer, Empire Blue Cross allows anyone to enroll and charges a uniform rate. But commercial insurers have been under no such obligation. And with the help of computers, they have refined the abilities to discriminate by age, health and occupation.
The more precise commercial insurers became, Mr. Blumenfeld notes, the "more cherries were ripe for picking" and the higher the premiums needed to cover the costs of those left to insure by Blue Cross. Indeed, it was the pressure of exploding insurance rates for the increasingly concentrated pool of high-risk Blue Cross policyholders that forced the Legislature to act.
Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University, concedes that Albany had little choice. Higher Blue Cross premiums would have forced more people to give up their insurance, leaving the state to pick up the tab for their hospitalization. And the alternative of appealing to the companies' better nature, asking them to take on bad risks voluntarily at bargain rates, was no alternative at all: "Even a bunch of nuns competing in the 100-yard dash can't be expected to pick up trash along the road," Mr. Reinhardt concluded.
But the Princeton economist is hardly enthusiastic about the New York approach. If health insurance is a private responsibility, he asks, is it fair to charge the same rate to people who take care of themselves as, say, to those who smoke? For that matter, is it fair under any circumstance to force 20-year-olds making $8 an hour to subsidize the care of 60-year-old millionaires?
And then there are the pesky issues of enforcement. While insurers with big stakes in New York will no doubt comply with the letter of the law, they will have potent incentives to flout the spirit. At the very least, mandatory "community rating" of risk promises to be a headache for regulators left with the job of assuring universal access.
Some argue that the problems of setting rates in health insurance are unique because the product is unique: Everybody needs it. But the idea that health insurance alone deserves special consideration because no one can do without it would play poorly in California, where the right to a lane on the freeway is deemed almost as important as the right to a bed in a hospital.
 
Insurance by ZIPip Code
 Since the passage of Proposition 103 in 1989, California auto insurers have been obliged to assess risk according to age, driving record and mileage -- as well as other factors deemed relevant by state regulators. That latter catch-all puts the insurance commissioner in the hot seat, because ZIP codes have become a favorite rating criterion. And while Steven Miller, the deputy commissioner of insurance, points out that rates do vary greatly from company to company, it typically costs two or three times as much to purchase the mandatory minimum policy in impoverished South-Central Los Angeles as it does in the surrounding suburban sprawl.
The parallel with health insurance -- society's ambivalence about whether driving an auto is a privilege or a right -- is striking. In New York those who cannot afford medical coverage are still treated in emergencies, albeit inefficiently. In California, those who cannot afford auto insurance simply ignore their legal obligation. Nettie Hoge, an attorney for Consumers Union in San Francisco, estimates that 90 percent of inner-city drivers are uninsured.
California could, of course, deny registration to uninsured vehicles. But then, in theory, New York could impose a head tax on residents who did not buy medical insurance, or just leave uninsured heart attack victims to die on the street.
Mr. Miller would prefer to start over with a bare-bones "no fault" system to compensate accident victims -- one that covers everyone in the state at a modest, uniform rate. Drivers might then buy additional coverage at rates set by open competition. That would satisfy Ms. Hoge, a consumer advocate who has nonetheless come to the conclusion that "the essence of insurance is discrimination."
 
Suburban Rates Would Rise
 But trial lawyers bitterly oppose no-fault insurance and seem to have the muscle to block it. Thus California probably will allow auto insurers to factor in geography, but not as much as they have in the past.
Could such a compromise work? Mr. Miller acknowledges that it depends on how much regulated rates differ from insurers' own estimates of risk, and whether regulators can prevent insurers from cherry-picking profitable customers while freezing out the rest. But there is also a political unknown: Would suburban drivers, whose rates would be sure to go up, go along with it?
The lesson according to Economics 101 is simple: Those who fiddle with cost-based prices in order to achieve socially desired ends risk unintended consequences. Mr. Reinhardt does not disagree.
But in an ideal world, he says, insurers would discriminate according to risk. If society did not like the consequences of, say, an insurer charging $5,000 a year to a family earning $15,000, it would subsidize the family's income. And if it did not wish to give families the option of buying less than some minimum coverage, it would short-circuit the market and pay the bill from government revenues.
But this not that ideal world. There is no consensus about the sort of insurance that should be provided as a matter of right. And in an era of rapidly rising insurance costs, there is no agreement about who should bear the financial burden. Until these issues are faced squarely, he suggests, the best we can hope for is to muddle through.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
DEMOCRATS GATHER TO RESHAPE IMAGE AND CROWN CLINTON

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
As the cast of characters for the 41st Democratic National Convention assembled in Manhattan yesterday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson ended a long holdout and endorsed Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee -- the ticket the delegates will ratify later this week.
Mr. Clinton, who has seemed to regain his political equilibrium in recent days, won Mr. Jackson's backing, however grudging and however tardy, on his own terms. Unlike other recent Democratic nominees, he declined to bargain with the black leader for his support, lest he seem a captive. 
 "I have decided to vote for Bill Clinton and Al Gore," Mr. Jackson said, but he did not say he would campaign for them. And he implicitly chided Governor Clinton for his strategy of concentrating on middle-class voters with the comment, "We need a big-tent vision that makes room for us all."
 
Brown Withholds Endorsement
 The endorsement removed the next-to-last threat of a disruptive squabble at the convention, which opens Monday night in Madison Square Garden. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who fought Mr. Clinton for the nomination through the last primaries on June 2, has still not indicated whether he will join the party's effort to present a harmonious picture to the nation as Mr. Clinton begins an arduous three-sided campaign.
With recent polls showing him closing the gap on his rivals, President Bush and Ross Perot, and with a generally warm reaction to his selection of Mr. Gore last week, the Arkansas Governor appears far more confident than he did during the primary season. When he arrived in New York last night, he was greeted by Mayor David N. Dinkins, who had been supportive of the Governor but timed his official endorsement to coincide with the arrival of the candidate.
But the convention, bereft of conflict and suspense though it may be, represents a crucial test for Mr. Clinton.
 
Projecting Image of Order
 He must avoid the kinds of confusion that marred the Democratic conventions of 1968, 1972 and 1980, and cost the party dearly in the fall of those years. Even with the reduced television coverage planned this time by the broadcast networks, the convention will leave an image of the party and its candidates with many voters; the Democrats want to seem orderly, unified, serious, concerned, determined and above all stable and trustworthy.
"We have to demonstrate that this is not your typical Democratic convention," Ronald H. Brown, the party chairman, said yesterday in a rueful allusion to the tumultuous gatherings of the past. "This is not a convention to heal wounds. We are already in the general election campaign."
But John C. White of Texas, one of Mr. Brown's predecessors, warned that important work in rebuilding party unity remained before the broader appeal to the country begins.
"Bill Clinton's got the nomination, and he's got the power," Mr. White said. "But he's still got to bring the party together. He's got to make these regular Democrats feel like they're really part of it."
The party leaders and Mr. Clinton's strategists hope to reintroduce him to the nation here, emphasizing the story of his rise from humble origins in the hope that it will make many voters forget, or attach less importance to, the character issues that have dogged his campaign. They say they are convinced, as Robert Squier, one of his media consultants, remarked recently, that "the more you get to know Bill Clinton the more you like him."
Mr. Gore began the process of reintroduction even before Mr. Clinton arrived in New York. In a joint appearance on the steps of the courthouse in Carthage, Tenn., his hometown, Mr. Gore told a friendly crowd how the Arkansas Governor had grown up poor, in the kind of single-parent family that is now an American commonplace.
Mr. Clinton said he intended to "renew the sense of can-do optimism" that had once typified the United States. He asserted that "the American people are at sea now, they're disillusioned, they're confused, and many of them are scared."
Mr. Clinton told reporters that he was happy to be returning to New York, where he won one of his most important primary victories on April 7, defeating Mr. Brown by a relatively narrow margin after a bruising fight that featured tough questioning by reporters. This time, the Governor said, "it will be a different campaign, one that really reaches out to the people of the state."
 
Families on Display
 Asked about a television advertisement designed to revive charges that he carried on a 12-year affair with a former nightclub singer named Gennifer Flowers, he replied: "America knows everything they need to know about it. They know what my position is. It is just more sleazy Republican politics."
The advertisement, which has not yet appeared on television, was produced by Floyd G. Brown, who produced the Willie Horton commercial in 1988. The new one, urging viewers to call a telephone number to listen to purported tapes of conversations between Mr. Clinton and Ms. Flowers, has been disavowed in strong terms by President Bush.
After their rally in Carthage, during which members of both families stood with them to symbolize the ticket's commitment to "family values," Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore traveled to nearby Nashville to speak at the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Perot had preceded them to the podium.
In a preacherly introduction, the organization's outgoing director, the Rev. Benjamin L. Hooks Jr., predicted that Mr. Clinton would probably be "the next President of the United States." The Governor answered by telling the audience that his grandmother had once said, "You could be a preacher if you were just a little better boy."
"So I wound up in politics," Mr. Clinton said.
 
Bush Works the Golf Course
 To hearty applause, he harshly criticized Mr. Bush. "Last time we had a President promise us a kinder and gentler nation, it turns out he meant a meaner and harsher politics," Mr. Clinton said. "Last time you had a President who promised us, and I quote, a new economy and greater tolerance, turns out he meant he'd be the only President since Reconstruction, except for his predecessor, to veto a civil rights bill."
It was an important stop for Mr. Clinton because of his frayed relations with Mr. Jackson, with whom he recently clashed over Sister Souljah, a rap performer who he said advocated violence. Some black officials, though by no means all, have criticized the Democratic ticket, which is composed of two white Baptist men, as too narrowly based for a highly pluralistic society. Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan said yesterday he feared that Mr. Clinton intended to turn his back on economically marginal blacks.
While his rivals spoke in Tennessee, President Bush was at his seaside home in Kennebunkport, Me., resting up after summit conferences in Munich and Helsinki. Cameramen were permitted to videotape him driving onto the golf course in a cart, which many politicians here thought a curious bit of image management at a time when he is under attack for indifference to the economic plight of the middle class.
Before leaving Europe, Mr. Bush predicted an economic upturn that would help him in what he called a "dog-eat-dog" contest. In an interview on the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on PBS, he declined to predict victory, commenting that "it's a little early to know what the mood of the country will be come election time."
 
'Points of Creative Tension'
 Mr. Jackson's endorsement last night came on his CNN program, "Both Sides with Jesse Jackson."
Alluding to the thesis that the Democrats need to change their policies if they are to appeal to the half of the nation that now lives in the suburbs, he added: "We need not choose between city and suburb, between black, white and brown. Bill Clinton and Al Gore have the opportunity, if they will accept the burden, of putting forth a plan of healing, rebuilding and reconciliation to make America better. Thus, on Nov. 3, I have decided to vote for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. But for the Democrats to win, we must have more inclusive strategies and a broader vision."
Mr. Jackson said that "more and more people view both parties as two sides on one coin, one party with two names." He said that "points of creative tension remain" between himself and the Clinton campaign. He did not spell these out, but listed a number of his own priorities, including a plea for more help for the unemployed, the poor, and those without health insurance, implying that Mr. Clinton's programs did not go far enough.
"In the final analysis, people should exercise their right to vote, but they will not vote for exercise," Mr. Jackson added, in what some took as an implied threat to keep his supporters at home if his ideas were not adopted. "They will vote if their vote makes a difference in their lives."
Four years ago, Mr. Jackson, a candidate for the nomination himself that time, kept the eventual nominee, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, on tenterhooks all through Saturday and Sunday before the convention. Few people talked of anything else but his plans. Mr. Clinton was determined to avoid that this year and held no negotiations with him, but an official of his campaign said Mr. Jackson had been told that his speech on Tuesday night would be imperiled if he failed to issue his endorsement before then.
Mr. Dinkins's endorsement was far more enthusiastic and unqualified. Noting that the weeklong convention would bring about $190 million into the city's economy, he added, "But the best business of all for New York will be a new President and a new Vice President, for only then will this country and its cities have the leadership we need and the leadership we deserve."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Racial Politics;
Perot Speech Gets Cool Reception at N.A.A.C.P.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, July 11

 BODY:
In his first campaign appearance before an organization of blacks, Ross Perot called today for racial harmony and said economic development was the answer to the problems of the nation's cities. But he elicited little response from the audience and left some listeners offended by what they said were patronizing or insensitive remarks.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and his Vice-Presidential choice, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, also appeared today before the group, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, on a day that underscored the importance and uncertainty surrounding the black vote in the three-sided Presidential race. 
 Mr. Perot, in his most specific proposal, called for representation in Congress for the District of Columbia.
"I know that you feel, and I share the belief that Washington, D.C., should be properly represented in Congress," Mr. Perot told the group, which is holding its national convention here.
Mr. Perot, who has yet to announce his independent candidacy for President, offered no other specific programs and left much of his audience offended by his remarks. One man heckled him and others made negative comments to him when he twice used the phrase "your people" in singling out the problems of blacks. Mr. Perot also spoke of his parents' generosity toward blacks in the segregated South of his youth in a way that many said they found condescending.
 
Shouted Objections
 Talking about the nation's economic problems, Mr. Perot said: "Financially, at least, it's going to be a long, hot summer. I don't have to tell you who gets hurt first when this sort of thing happens, do I? You, your people do. Your people do. I know that and you know that."
One man called out objecting to the phrase. He called out again later when Mr. Perot said it was "your people" who suffer most from runaway crime.
Willie Clark, president of the N.A.A.C.P. branch in San Bernadino, Calif., said the overall tone of Mr. Perot's remarks and particularly his use of the phrase "your people" reflected how culturally out of touch he was with his audience.
"When he said 'you people' or 'your people,' it was like waving a red flag in front of a bull," he said. "It's something white folks have used when they don't want to call you nigger, but they don't want to treat you like an equal."
While Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore "were both very impressive" in their speeches to the group, Mr. Clark said, "Perot was just unprepared for this kind of audience. He blew himself out of the ball park."
Mr. Perot left the N.A.A.C.P.'s convention immediately after the speech. Asked later if he was aware that he had offended some people, he said, "If I did, then I'm sorry."
The Rev. Benjamin L. Hooks Jr., the group's departing Executive Director, said later that he planned to call Mr. Perot's campaign aides to try to explain why blacks were offended. "It's something we all have to work on, but I don't think it's a sign of irreparable failure," Mr. Hooks said. "None of us liked that language, but we don't want to lose the emphasis of the speech over one thing. I hate to see his appearance here marred."
In fact, most of Mr. Perot's speech was an appeal for racial harmony. He cited his opposition to the gubernatorial bid of David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, in Louisiana last year and his experience as a youth with poor blacks in his hometown of Texarkana, Tex., as evidence of his sensitivity to the needs of minorities.
"We will not have a great country until we get rid of hate and divisiveness and come together as a united, loving, winning team," he said.
 
Clinton and Gore Speak
 Mr. Clinton's efforts, particularly in the South, depend on his getting the overwhelming share of the black vote that has traditionally gone to the Democratic candidate. Polls have shown that Mr. Perot's campaign has attracted some interest, particularly among younger members of minority groups. Even though many here voiced skepticism about Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush, Mr. Perot's appearance apparently gained him little new support.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore spoke later in the afternoon to a larger and somewhat more appreciative audience.
Mr. Clinton received a warm response, especially when he criticized President Bush, saying Republicans had failed to live up to their promises.
"I pledge to you an administration that believes in and enforces the Voting Rights Act, an administration based on principles of community and respect, not division and blame," he said.
"Last time we had a President promise us a kinder and gentler nation, it turns out he meant a meaner and harsher politics," he said. "Last time you had a President who promised us, and I quote, a new economy and greater tolerance. Turns out he meant he'd be the only President since Reconstruction except for his predecessor to veto a civil rights bill."
Mr. Clinton also said: "What I want to do is to make economic empowerment opportunity the civil rights issue of the 1990's. I want to bridge the racial divide in this country by giving us all something to say yes to, not just things to say no to."
Mr. Hooks praised Mr. Clinton as someone who "has been diligent in trying to heal the old stubborn wounds of racial division."
Mr. Gore, who spoke before Mr. Clinton, caught himself as he stumbled over the word "plan" in discussing Mr. Clinton's economic plan.To widespread laughter, he said, "I almost said the Klan." He said the background he and Mr. Clinton had growing up in the South during the civil rights era made them particularly sensitive to racial issues. He promised rapid progress on domestic issues in the first 100 days of a Clinton-Gore administration.
"You just watch what we are going to do," he said in closing his remarks. "We shall overcome."
 
'A Big Wall'
 For Mr. Perot, the speech today was the first time he has appeared before an audience other than one organized by his campaign. It was a rocky debut.
"He did a lousy job," said Joseph H. Duff, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. "He showed he had very little experience with black people. When he used the phrase 'your people,' he put up a big wall, and when he tried to tell us we're people, he made a big mistake. We know we're people."
Much of Mr. Perot's speech was his standard depiction of a nation in economic crisis and of himself as a problem solver who can produce economic growth.
But he also made pointed efforts to connect with his audience. He told of his father's insistence on continuing to pay poor blacks who worked for him after they had retired, his experiences as a paper boy in a poor black neighborhood, his mother's insistence on feeding poor Depression-era hobos, and his visits to baptisms at black churches.
But the anecdotes that usually fit comfortably into the Norman Rockwell Americana he uses in speeches to volunteers and in television appearances, fell flat before a black audience that for the most part listened in polite silence.
 
'It Was Condescending'
 He cited his father's remarks on the poor blacks who worked for him: "The only words I ever heard him say were, 'Son, these are people too, and they have to live.' "
"It was condescending," said John J. Mance, of Granada Hills, Calif., one of the N.A.A.C.P.'s 64 national board members. "I don't think he helped himself by telling stories about how his father used to pay his old black sharecroppers."
Mr. Perot received his biggest rounds of applause in talking about economic issues, the need for job creation, particularly in manufacturing, and the need to stop the exporting of jobs overseas.
"Hungry people steal, hopeless people kill," he said. "So if you could put people to work, that would be a tremendous step toward helping to rebuild the society."
His remarks on economic development and his ability to create jobs got the most positive response in interviews with the audience, which dominated by members of the black middle class.
"I was impressed," said the Rev. H. H. Singleton of Conway, S.C. "He said a lot of things that needed to be said about the rebuilding of the country. We need jobs."
 
Money for Inner Cities
 Mr. Perot talked of the need for improvements in education and health care, but offered no solutions. He talked of the need for reviving inner cities, but offered no plan other than to say that small businesses, the backbone of inner-city neighborhoods, are starved for credit and capital, and that as President he would make sure those resources were made available.
Mr. Perot repeatedly said, however, that he believed government action alone would not solve the nation's problems.
"I don't believe that government and laws can be nearly as effective as strong families, strong churches, tightly knit neighborhoods where folks look after one another," he said.
But after building his improbable outsider's Presidential campaign on the strength of his image as a nonpolitician, some people here turned that image around on him. "He didn't move us," Mr. Mance said dismissively. "He's no politician."
Similarly, Mr. Perot's oft-stated remark that he doesn't need handlers or speech writers struck a different note here than it has in the past.
Midway through the speech, James Sykes, who owns a public relations firm in Denver, rolled his eyes and said: "He said he didn't have any speech writers. I think he ought to get some."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Convention;
Hoops Gone, Hoopla Begins: Democrats Are Given a Party

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Standing on a steamy platform -- the railroad kind, not the political kind -- Mayor David N. Dinkins welcomed the chairman of the Democratic Party to town yesterday as New York City kicked off what it hopes will be a financial and public-relations bonanza: the Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden.
With convention business giving hotels their best July in four years, the police spending $6 million, including overtime pay, and caterers whipping up hors d'oeuvres for hundreds of parties, city officials are upbeat about the prospect of an immediate psychological lift, with economic benefits to follow. Just how successful the convention is for the city will not be known until long after out-of-town delegates pack up and head home at the end of the week. 
 The first of the convention-week protests got under way yesterday: a handful of demonstrators from the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue gathered at one Manhattan abortion clinic, the Eastern Women's Center at Park Avenue and East 30th Street, and chained themselves to the door of another, Manhattan East Medical Offices at 225 East 64th Street, where three marchers were arrested. The confrontation at the Eastern Women's Center was a lopsided one. The Operation Rescue demonstrators were overwhelmed by more than 500 abortion-rights supporters. The police said that three others were taken into custody later at a third demonstration at St. John the Baptist Church on West 30th Street.
Abortion was not the only issue being argued in the streets yesterday. A demonstration to demand public support for homeless children drew about 40 people, who rallied at Union Square and then marched up Fifth Avenue to Central Park. But the event did not attract the contingent of 300 children the organizers said they had expected to take part.
As the day waned, the partying began. At Bryant Park, the city played host to many of the 15,000 journalists covering the convention. Delegates rushed off to private parties at the Plaza Hotel and the Water Club. The Hispanic Political Action Committee U.S.A. sponsored a Ruben Blades Festival at Roseland, where, for $30, revelers could dance until 4 A.M. today. Democrats who had donated at least $5,000 a year since 1988 filled the old waiting area at Grand Central Terminal, where the remodelers' scaffolding had been taken down and the almost-completed room opened for its first big event.
Mr. Dinkins promised to attend all of the gatherings planned for state delegations tonight, from the Georgia party on the Staten Island Ferry to the Washington State party at the Central Park Zoo to the Oklahoma party on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The Mayor was waiting yesterday at Pennsylvania Station when a "victory train" carrying Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, rolled in.
 
A Blooming Garden
 "New York knows how to throw a party," Mr. Dinkins said. "But we are not here only to have fun. We are here to elect the next leader of the free world." Asked about Vice President Dan Quayle's continued gibes at New York City, the Mayor said, "It shows how uninformed he is."
Mr. Brown, who seemed to have economics on his mind when he needed etiquette, flubbed his thank-you line. "On behalf of all of you, I want to express my appreciation for this tremendously warm recession," he said.
The Democratic volunteers who cheered the arriving Democrats were outnumbered by reporters and photographers, who jockeyed for the best angles. Several bewildered-looking travelers asked police officers what all the hubbub was about.
Later, Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Brown went on a "walk through" of the Garden, the last in a seemingly endless parade of Democratic officials who have been given glimpses of how the Democrats have changed the arena. The ice and the basketball hoops are gone, replaced by a giant wall of television monitors and renovations that cost the city more than $10 million.
Never mind that the Garden gave itself a face lift only last summer. Construction crews have put up temporary walls, electricians have put in new outlets and telephone installers have put in new lines. They all have to be taken down, taken apart or taken out once the Democrats leave. But yesterday, Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Brown stood on the podium, trying out the sound system.
The Democrats have issued 15,000 press credentials, three times as many as for delegates. Yesterday it seemed as if every other person walking down Seventh Avenue had a camera, a tape recorder or a notebook waiting to be filled with quotes.
 
Vigils Are Planned
 Advocates for the homeless had been concerned that the city was planning a pre-convention sweep of people living in the neighborhood near Madison Square Garden. City officials denied that. Yesterday the Coalition for the Homeless said it would hold candlelight vigils near the Garden each night of the convention to protest the Democrats' inaction "in addressing modern mass homelessness." The group also said it would provide space inside St. Francis Church on 32d Street for homeless people to sleep.
There were indications that an agreement between the Parks Department and protesters who wanted to camp out in Central Park was unraveling. The accord, announced Friday, promised space in a recreation center on East 54th Street off First Avenue, where the demonstrators could spend the night. In return, the protesters agreed to leave the park by 1 A.M.
But yesterday a group said it had parted company with the Rainbow Affinity Tribe, which agreed to the no-camping deal. John Green, from the breakaway group, said his group did not plan to leave the park after an Arlo Guthrie concert this afternoon.
"We are still planning to camp out," he said. "The leadership went behind our backs."
Unlike Mr. Brown, a native New Yorker who rarely misses an opportunity to say that Democrats have the answers to urban problems, not everyone who will be inside the Garden this week is enthusiastic about his decision to hold the convention in New York.
"Hellish traffic," said Katherine Drake of Burke, Va., whose job during the convention is handing out credentials. "Very disorienting. Our boss told us there were four muggings outside of the Garden on Thursday night." So instead of carrying a purse, she stuffed her hotel-room key, a granola bar and a dollar or two in the plastic credentials pouch she was wearing around her neck.

HEADLINE: Rural Cuba Speaks Up for Castro

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLGUIN, Cuba

 BODY:
In a rundown prerevolutionary building off the main square of this industrial town, Cubans fresh from food lines mill about an exhibit of home-grown biotechnology that the Government promises will soon increase crop production and help stem their encroaching misery.
In cosmopolitan Havana, 400 miles to the northwest, most residents long ago grew skeptical of such ballyhooed Government efforts in the face of economic realities that only seem to grow grimmer. But in provincial cities like this and in rural areas visited during a five-day trip to eastern Cuba, many people, though certainly not all, express faith in the country's Communist leadership, even as they declare that their lives have never been harder. 
 As he looked over a display of vials containing bacteria that are being introduced in fields to attack ravaging caterpillars, Osman Nasser, a 54-year-old high-school teacher, spoke proudly of the efforts of the Castro Government to overcome the worst economic conditions since it took power in 1959.
"We didn't just wait for the crisis to begin developing our own means," Mr. Nasser said, referring to the abrupt termination of Soviet subsidies last year. "We have been investing in our own ingenuity since the revolution. Of course times are hard, but I can honestly say that the little food we have tastes better when you know the love and sweat that has gone into producing it."
 
Rights Record Defended
 At an art exhibit on the same square, an anthropology student in her late teens angrily warned a visiting journalist not to write critically about human rights in Cuba.
"Cuba has a good human rights record, and if it weren't for the constant attacks of the United States, it would be the best in the world," she said.
On the outskirts of Holguin, a city of 250,000, sits the huge Bariay factory. Opened with great celebration on the 60th anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the plant builds the gigantic sugar harvesters that were to mechanize the country's main crop and propel growth.
Although a plaque outside still salutes the "unshakable friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Cuba," the sugar industry here has been plunged into deep crisis since the country lost its long-subsidized supply arrangements with the Soviet bloc. Critical items, from fertilizers and pesticides to the gasoline needed to run the lumbering harvesters, are now in short supply.
While the Bariay plant continues to crank out about 620 of the machines each year, just adjacent to it, in a hastily assembled hangarlike building, the Government recently began assembling the bicycles that people are being encouraged to use in place of a faltering public transportation system.
The workers on the assembly line for the clunky 40-pound bicycles, all painted the same shade of blue, are paid 200 pesos monthly, or $160 at the official exchange rate. On the black market, that amount is worth about $7.
One worker quickly spoke up to defend the wage, saying that housing, education and medical care were all provided by the state, and that food, while scarce, was inexpensive. Even so, a tour of downtown Holguin showed large old department stores reduced to selling only two or three items each and long, snaking lines wherever food or new goods were available.
"I have the greatest wealth anyone could ask," said Miguel Gonzales, a 32-year-old engineer who recently moved to the bicycle plant from the harvester factory next door. "Do you know what that is? It's security. I can walk the streets at night without fear of anyone. If you ask me which country I would rather live in, yours or mine, the answer will always be mine."
Another worker responded angrily when asked about liberty of expression and freedom from attack for those who disagree with Cuba's Communist system.
"The Government doesn't need to attack dissenters," he said. "Most of us love our country and are working hard to save it. If someone disagrees with that, we will stop them before the Government can."
Since the American visitor's arrival was both unannounced and unplanned, factory managers and party officials could not have prepared workers for the visit, as has often appeared to be the case during Government-guided tours in Cuba.
 
Cautious Comments
 Nonetheless, there was a sameness to many of the exchanges, a fact that suggested that whatever their faith in the system or sentiments toward the United States, these Cubans had a feeling for the bounds of safe discussion with an unknown foreigner. Many were unwilling to give their names, even as they spoke positively.
A local Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Francisco Exposito Cordon, used a Cuban expression to explain the contrast between most conversations with strangers in the country's smaller cities and towns and those in Havana, where complaints and political commentary have become commonplace.
"Small town, big hell," Father Exposito said. "Everyone here knows everyone else, and nobody wants trouble."
Some residents did speak of their grievances against the system, in each case careful that no other Cubans could overhear.
On a drive through decrepit old mill towns along a barren, buckled highway that leads to Santiago, Cuba's second city, farmers bent in the sun weeding rows of tall sugar cane.
"Since they suppressed the markets, we just have the feeling of being exploited," said one farmer, his face deeply creased by the sun. "We are working for nothing. There is nothing to buy, and people are losing interest in the land. Soon there will be nothing to eat too."
The reference was to peasant markets that allowed farmers to sell their surplus production. They were closed by Havana amid much ideological infighting in 1985. Asked why the Government had closed the markets, the farmer issued a wry laugh and said: "They said we were getting too rich. Can you believe that?"

HEADLINE: Ambassador to Moscow Returns To Lobby House for Russian Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 11

 BODY:
Ambassador Robert S. Strauss says he is planning to spend several weeks in Washington to "work the phones" there until the Bush Administration's Russian aid package "is out of the way."
Mr. Strauss, a Texas Democrat with a reputation as a dealmaker, said Friday at a briefing before his departure today that he recognizes the difficulties members of Congress have in voting for foreign aid in an election year, and that he believes he can spend the next few weeks acting as a nonpartisan lobbyist for the Russian aid package, which passed the Senate last week but is facing a tougher time in the House.
 
Democrats Seek 'Cover'
 He said that he thought House Democrats favored the bill, but that they wanted enough Republican votes to provide "political cover" in an election year. 
 Asked if there was anything Gov. Bill Clinton or Ross Perot could do to help the legislation along, Mr. Strauss said they had endorsed the bill, which was all the Administration could expect.
"It's up to me to go get the votes," Mr. Strauss said. "And frankly, I don't think any of them know how to work the phones as well as I do."
The bill calls for a $12 billion increase in the United States contribution to the International Monetary Fund, so the Fund can advance Russia some $4 billion this year as part of a $24 billion Western aid package. The Fund and Russia recently agreed over a first loan of $1 billion.
Mr. Strauss said he had been spending most of his time recently trying to get approval for American investment projects through the Russian bureaucracy. He met Friday, for example, with Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the main architect of Russia's economic reform, and gave him a list of projects that, Mr. Strauss said, "would put a couple billion dollars of U.S. investment into place in the next six months or so."
"But we can't close these deals," Mr. Strauss said. "We can't get them through the bureaucracy."
The difficulty, he said, is getting Russian bureaucrats to approve more reasonable export rules and tax exemptions, especially for American companies who want to export natural resources like oil and timber.
Mr. Strauss also said he thought that the new Russian tax rate on foreigners, after many complaints by foreign businessmen and diplomats, would be "in the 30-40 percent range," down from the 60 percent called for in a draft bill.
On Friday, the Russian Parliament approved a second reading of a tax bill that would set the maximum rate on individuals residing 183 days in Russia to 40 percent if they earn more than 600,000 rubles, or about $4,500, a year in worldwide income.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: In His Own Words;
Excerpts From Perot's Nashville Talk

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech yesterday by Ross Perot to the N.A.A.C.P. in Nashville, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, a transcription service. 
 I love this country. I love the principles it's founded upon. I don't like to see those principles violated. We've got a lot of work to do in our country. Talking about it won't get it done. We need action. We need good, careful plans and sure-footed action to finish the job.
You have made tremendous progress in your work, but there's more to be done. There's more to be done. I hope before I turn out the lights that every single American is looked on as an absolute first-class full partner in our country without all the biases and prejudices.
But where we are right now is, among other things, you've got to be financially strong to deal with all the problems our country has. And I don't have to tell this informed group that when you're $4 trillion in debt and you're going $400 billion in debt every year, you're about to break the bank.
Let's look at where we are right now.
 
Rising Unemployment
 I just picked up a magazine this morning. I say that our highest short-term priority is to put America back to work so that we have the tax base to do the things we must be doing.
June 30, Aetna Insurance Company cut its work force 10 percent and 4,800 jobs went out the window. July 1, the Aluminum Company of America cut 2,100 jobs. July 1, Hughes Aircraft cut 9,000 jobs and had to write off $789 million. July 2, hold on to your hat, the State of California is out of money and is paying its employees with scrip, or I.O.U.'s. That's California, folks.
July 2, the unemployment rate nationally surged to 7.8 percent. One hundred and seventeen thousand U.S. jobs were lost in the month of June alone. And California's unemployment has now reached 9.5 percent. Now, California we think of as kind of a recession-proof state, right? That's just a quick fix on where we are.
And I say with that in the background, financially at least it's going to be a long, hot summer, right? I don't have to tell you who gets hurt first when this sort of thing happens, do I? You, your people do. Your people do. I know that and you know that.
 
. . .
 We are who we are. Our values and beliefs are shaped when we're small. I had wonderful parents. My father and mother taught me, by example, that we are all equal. Interestingly enough, they never preached about it; they did it. The people who worked for my father who happened to be black, after they were too old to work, my father kept paying them with money he didn't have, and the only words I ever heard him say is, 'Son, they are people, too, and they have to live.'
Sunday after church, my father would take me out to visit with the people who were too old to work and he would go into their homes in the wintertime or we'd sit on the front porch in the summertime, and he would go to see them for one simple reason: He loved them. Now, he never said it, but I knew it because he always did it. Every person who worked for him carried his business card with the understanding that if anybody ever treated them rudely, to show them that card.
My dad, while he was a very modest man, was a very respected man in our community. And he was glad to put his name and his reputation on the line to see that everybody was treated fairly.
My mother, during the Depression -- we lived five blocks away from the railroad tracks -- had a steady stream of hobos, many of them black, come to our house looking for food. She always fed them. She never said anything, she just fed them.
And one day, I'll never forget, one came and said, 'Lady, do you wonder why so many people come to your house?' And she just smiled and said, 'Well, yes, I do.' And he took her out and he showed her a mark on the curb. He says: 'You're a mark, lady. This house is marked. People know you'll feed people.'
And after he left, I said, 'Mother, do you want me to wash that off?' And she looked at me and said, 'No, son, these are people just like you and me. The only difference is they're down on their luck.'
So I had the great fortune to grow up in that environment. My father used to go to the black churches. And white people didn't do that. If you've ever been in Texarkana, a long time ago, there was a famous Polly Chapel Church and the Polly Chapel Choir, and I will never forget those visits, and I will certainly never forget the beautiful singing in that church.
When the people who worked for him were baptized and their children were baptized and their relatives were baptized, we went because they were his friends. And as you know, back in that point in time, they weren't baptized in the church or in baptismals. It was in ponds and creeks. And we were there because he loved them.
 
'I Was Very Fortunate'
 Now, I was very fortunate. And finally, as a young man, I had a paper route in the poorest section of my town. It was so poor that people assumed that those who lived there would not take the paper because they only made $9 a week and many of them could not read. The streets were of sand and I had to ride a horse since a bicycle could not go through the streets. I found that these were just like the people my father was associated with, were warm, caring, decent people.
And I'll tell you one brief story. In the middle of that paper route, while I was delivering the papers, my dad had to have a kidney operation, which was a major operation at that time. No one else would throw the paper route. So I went to each of my customers, explained to them I would have to be gone for a few days. And almost a 100 percent of them said, 'Son, keep the papers and deliver them when you get back.' I said, 'You don't want old papers.' And they says, 'No, we don't want old papers, but if your dad is having an operation, your family needs the money.' Now, see that, that is an act of love from people who did not have the ability really to help others, but who did.
 
A Call for Unity
 I have learned throughout my life that there is something in each human being that cries out -- I'm unique, I'm special, there's only one person in the world like me, treat me as a human being, treat me with dignity and respect. And any society or any company that operates on that fundamental principle is a society or a company or a group that has a distinct advantage. We will not have a great country until we get rid of the hate and divisiveness and come together as a united, loving, winning team.
Can we agree that our diversity is a strength and not a weakness? Certainly it is.
As I go across this country for years, I like to look at what a person did before he got into this sort of thing. I've said for years, No. 1, we ought to love one another, and most of us do. Then, for those who can't do that, we ought to get along with one another, because a united team wins and a divided team loses. Very simple. In sports we'd know that in a minute, right? On the battlefield, we know that in a minute. But somehow in our country, we haven't figured that out yet. Divided teams lose.
Now, finally, there's a few hard-core haters. And my advice to them is, we're stuck with one another. Nobody's going anywhere. We're stuck with one another. So get up in category two at least. But I'd love to see everybody in category one because if you love one another, you're in better shape.
Since I've been involved in this process, I have said again and again on podiums across this country, if you hate other people, I don't want your vote because our country will fail. It's very simple.
If anybody here questions my sincerity, get my comments when David Duke was running for Governor of New Orleans -- Louisiana. I was in New Orleans on business, was besieged by the press and was asked what I thought about it, and I made it clear. So if you have any question, that pre-dates this activity, and that was straight from the heart and the heart hasn't changed.
So we must take advantage of diverse backgrounds. We must cross the final threshold of making each person in this country a first-class citizen. Some of this we can do by law. Much can be done by creating jobs for segments of our society who lose their pride and self-esteem because they have no work.
Hungry people steal. Hopeless people kill. So if you can put the people to work, that is a tremendous step forward in helping to rebuild the society.
There's no substitute for caring, sharing and loving one another. And this is a responsibility that cannot be legislated, and each of us must assume. But never forget that Teddy Roosevelt said that the White House is a bully pulpit. And I suggest that there should be a lot of talk like that coming out of the White House, no matter who's there.
I don't believe that government and laws can be nearly as effective as strong families, strong churches, tightly knit neighborhoods, where folks look after one another. And there's no substitute for that. We can't do it all by law and police work. You know that. All of us must assume part of this burden.

HEADLINE: SOME U.S. OFFICIALS REMAIN SKEPTICAL ON TRADE PROGRESS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Countering what they perceive as unwarranted optimism after the Munich summit meeting this week, high-ranking Bush Administration officials say the meeting did not produce substantial progress toward a 108-nation agreement aimed at lowering world trade barriers.
Carla A. Hills, the United States Trade Representative, said Friday that the Munich meeting left unchanged the stalemate in farm trade negotiations with the European Community. "I'm tempted to say they're not affected," she said, "because in effect we still don't have a proposal from the Europeans." 
 "The E.C. has never had a single proposal," Mrs. Hills added. "They have had a wish list. Their negotiators have never had a mandate to negotiate."
 
Gloom and Frustration
 At the heart of the dispute are farm subsidies, which the United States and other food-exporting nations have been trying to eliminate or sharply reduce. Washington contends that the subsidies the French and other European Governments pay to their farmers enable them to compete unfairly.
Gloomy remarks similar to Mrs. Hills's echoed around Washington as American officials reviewed the negotiations in Munich.
"Substantively, I don't think anything took place," said another senior Administration official, who insisted on anonymity. "I know of no detail that was settled there, no issue that was set in concrete." Three other senior American officials echoed similar frustrations.
In Munich, State Department and other officials in Munich had sought to put a rosy glow on the outcome, presenting the occasion as a diplomatic success at which the heads of state from seven leading industrial democracies narrowed their differences on trade.
 
Different Trade Agendas
 Traditionally, diplomats and politicians have attempted, for both domestic and international consumption, to portray summit meetings as triumphs. On the American said, the effort was to project President Bush as a world leader and America's foreign alliances as strong.
Mrs. Hills, by contrast, has a different agenda, trying to force heads of state to focus on trade issues.
"Her analytical view is that she is making a distinction between the politics and the technical level," an Administration official speaking for the White House said today. The official spoke on the condition of anonomity.
Several officials in Washington noted that President Bush himself, in a news conference at the summit's end, said he was disappointed by the lack of progress on trade.
"I've made very clear," Mr. Bush said, "some political comments to the contrary at home notwithstanding, that the politics does not interfere with the United States' readiness to go forward. And we made that point here. But I'm disappointed."
Mr. Bush, however, refrained from criticizing the Europeans or assessing whether any progress had taken place, and his remark received little public attention.
Indeed, more in keeping with the publicly expressed sentiments were the words of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who said of the summit meeting, "I am not only optimistic, but I truly expect that we will finally reach an agreement by the end of the year."
 
Hills Blames France
 While saying she still hoped a broad agreement could be struck by the end of this year, Mrs. Hills took the unusual step of repeatedly holding the French responsible for the European Community's reluctance to make compromises. She expressed concern about the two and a half months of negotiating time that could be lost if France did not show more flexibility before Sept. 20, when it will hold an important referendum on whether to pursue European monetary and political integration.
That was a departure from her tack in recent months, during which Mrs. Hills had been consistently blaming the European Community as a whole for the impasse.
In Washington, a French diplomat who insisted that he not be identified strongly disagreed that France was obstructing or delaying a global trade pact.
"It's not correct to say the French are standing in the way of a deal," the diplomat said. He pointed out that at a news conference in Munich, President Francois Mitterrand denied that France was unwilling to strike a deal until after the September referendum.
Mrs. Hills's tone marked an escalation in a public relations battle between the United States and the countries of the European Community, as each seeks to avoid being portrayed as the obstacle to a deal that could increase world economic growth.
And Mrs. Hills did acknowledge that the summit talks produced some improvement in the international mood for trade talks.
"There may have been a greater awareness among the heads of state" about the issues involved, Mrs. Hills said, and a greater potential for an extra $1 trillion in economic output during the rest of the century if a deal can be reached.
 
Four Big Obstacles
 Efforts to achieve a global trade pact, orchestrated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body that oversees trade, failed in 1990 and again last year. And they now face four possibly insurmountable obstacles.
One is the declining personal popularity of Mr. Bush and other leaders of major trading nations. Another is the international ground swell of resistance to free trade from environmentalists who fear unsafe food imports and the large-scale transfer of polluting industries to poor countries that have no environmental safeguards. A third obstacle is the continued weakening of foreign economies; while imports seem to be driving factories out of business, additional exports have a less visible effect on employment.
The fourth obstacle lies in the fairly strong but steadily waning interest of many large corporations. This is especially the case in the United States, where many senior executives see few benefits in a global deal and increasingly prefer regional trade pacts, like the free-trade agreement being negotiated with Mexico.
The steel and textile industries, for example, have long been hostile to the loss of their protection from Asian imports. And now some high-technology companies, including pharmaceutical and semiconductor manufacturers, are contending that the preliminary drafts of a global trade agreement provide inadequate protection from foreign products that violate American patents or provide other forms of unfair competition. Bilateral deals, they say, may offer more protection.
Even if the controversy over the European Community's subsidies can be resolved, serious disputes loom over international trade in telecommunications, shipping, banking services and certain tariffs. The European Community, for example, contends that American limits on interstate banking unfairly prevent large foreign banks from setting up national operations in the United States.
American officials respond that the interstate banking rules affect foreign and domestic banks equally, and that Congress would not allow these and other basic tenets of American financial regulation to be displaced by a trade agreement.
 
Both Sides Await Concessions
 In specificially blaming the French for the lack of progress, Mrs. Hills said that they had blocked a consensus on agricultural trade within the European Community and prevented European officials from presenting a new negotiating position since the community's decision in May to pursue modest subsidy reductions unilaterally.
President Bush said on Wednesday that he foresaw "more of a readiness on the part of the French" to negotiate after France's referendum. But Mrs. Hills said that French officials had given her no indication that they were prepared to change their stance then or at any other time in the future.
While denying that the referendum was a factor, President Mitterrand said on Wednesday that the European Community had already made all of its concessions and that he was waiting for the United States to move.
Noting that France will be holding parliamentary elections in March and that French polls showed that the Government-backed referendum in September was likely to pass, Mrs. Hills criticized the consensus in Munich that trade talks could not proceed until the end of September.
"You might legitimately say, 'Why is that date important?' " Mrs. Hills said, adding, "Everyone faces an election."
 
Congressional Deadline
 The prolonged deadlock in the world trade talks seriously threatens the prospects for Congressional approval of an overall agreement. Support from corporate and farm groups is eroding, and time is running out for a trade pact to be submitted to Congress under special rules that require speedy consideration and prevent amendments.
A complete agreement must be initialed by March 1 of next year for inclusion under the special rules. Mrs. Hills said it would be "nearly impossible" to persuade Congress to extend that date for a global trade agreement.
Mrs. Hills also denied reports from the summit that the United States had made any offer to cap exports of corn gluten, an animal feed product. European Community officials have been calling for such export limits by the United States as one way to appease European farmers angered by cutbacks in government subsidies.
The negotiations have already lasted almost six years -- so long that even some farm-trade experts are beginning to lose interest. "People are jaded, except for those who have the luxury of time to follow every twist and turn," said Steven A. McCoy, the president of the North American Export Grain Association, a Washington-based trade group. "The rest of us are sitting back and seeing it all as improbable."
 
Not a Campaign Issue
 Even in rural areas of the Midwest, which might benefit from increased grain exports as the European Community cut subsidies for its exports, the trade talks have become less and less a topic of conversation. "It just hasn't hit the forefront; we've been more attuned to frost and the lack of rain," said Don Smolek, the grain manager at the Buckeye Ag Center Inc. in Monterey, Ind.
As a result of voter disinterest, there has been no pressure from Mr. Bush's campaign staff for a quick trade deal. And a few campaign officials are even hostile to reaching any pact before the November elections.
"I don't see any upside in doing it and there's no downside in not doing it," one campaign official said. "Is there a downside in doing it? Yes, you could alienate critical constituencies in key states."

HEADLINE: Church's Land Deal Stirs Call for Inquiry

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 11

 BODY:
Elected leaders of the Greek Orthodox Church met here this week to discuss issues like church governance, seminary budgets and youth programs. But the meeting was shadowed by a matter that the leaders voted not to pursue: a real estate deal that went sour, costing the church at least $5.5 million and raising questions about the accountability of the church's chief financial managers.
For several years, a handful of prominent lay members have been trying to open the decision-making process in the church, America's largest and wealthiest body of Eastern Orthodox Christians, to greater scrutiny. In particular, they are asking the church to clear up questions about the role of Chris Demetriades, a Scarsdale, N.Y., builder of luxury homes who for many years has also been the church's unpaid director of economic development. 
 In his church job, Mr. Demetriades raises money and oversees investments, which in the early 1980's included a 51-acre tract in Purchase, N.Y., that the church began to develop with the hope of selling it at a profit.
In 1987 the church did sell the property, to Mr. Demetriades himself. And last January it reduced his obligations by $5.5 million, by deducting $2.3 million from the original price and writing off at least $3.2 million more in deferred payments and interest.
In an interview this week, the 55-year-old Mr. Demetriades said that he had done nothing improper, that he had entered the deal reluctantly and that because of falling real estate prices he was now facing insolvency.
At the meeting here, a biennial congress of elected delegates who oversee the administrative and financial matters of the church in the United States, Canada and Latin America, church officials distributed a report that came to the same broad conclusions.
The delegates soundly rejected appeals for an independent investigation of the real estate transaction. The delegates frequently referred to a 1992 audit of the church by the New York accounting firm Price Waterhouse, which also included a note on the real estate deal and the subsequent losses, as proof that the transaction was beyond reproach.
 
Church Sought a Buyer
 But critics of the deal said that neither the audit nor the report, by a seven-member committee of top church officers, gave a precise reconstruction of the transaction or answered questions about possible conflicts of interest or special treatment for Mr. Demetriades.
The church report says that the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America bought the 51 acres in 1980 and 1983 and began building luxury houses on it. In 1987, seeking to avoid a new tax burden and to limit its risk, the church sought a buyer for the partly completed project.
After finding other bids unsatisfactory, church officials "turned to Chris Demetriades," the report says. The purchase price, according to the report, was $14.3 million, plus deferred interest that would be paid as houses were sold.
Different figures are found in papers submitted by the church in 1987 to the New York State Supreme Court in Westchester County, a step required when not-for-profit religious corporations make major sales of their property. Those papers said the church was to earn $19.9 million, including deferred interest payments of $7.5 million.
Mr. Demetriades's firm, Demetriades Developers Inc., sold 32 new homes in the tract for a total of $48 million. Whether he made a profit is not clear.
In the interview this week he said that if his business turned around, "my fervent hope and wish is to be able to return" at least $2 million to the church.
At the congress here, members of the Orthodox Christian Laity, a five-year-old group striving to increase lay members' role in church decision-making, urged the church to authorize an independent counsel and accounting firm to explore the transaction and report on it.
 
Questions 'Continue to Fester'
 "When we say we've investigated ourselves and we find that we haven't done anything wrong, people won't be convinced," said George D. Karcazes, a lawyer from Glenview, Ill., and a member of the Orthodox Christian Laity. "The questions will continue to fester and hurt the church."
But little sentiment for such an investigation was expressed in a meeting on Monday, when more than a hundred delegates reviewed the church's finances and endorsed its budget. Mr. Demetriades, who led the meeting, apologized for the losses and then was warmly praised by church leaders for his service to the church. As a church officer who has visited hundreds of parishes to raise money, Mr. Demetriades is well known throughout the church.
On Wednesday, when Mr. Karcazes tried to introduce the proposal for an independent investigation to a plenary session of the congress that was voting on budgetary matters, he was angrily ruled out of order.
The critics "should stop all this nonsense when the governing bodies of the church have spoken," said Theodore O. Prounis, a New York lawyer who represented the church in the real estate deal.
In New York, however, Simos Dimas, a lawyer and church member, said on Thursday that he would go ahead with plans to challenge the real estate transaction in court.
 
Membership of Church
 The congress brought together 781 delegates elected from the archdiocese's 10 dioceses -- eight in the United States, one in Canada and one in South America. The archdiocese, which is directly under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople and a synod of 11 Greek Orthodox bishops in Istanbul, Turkey, is headed by Archbishop Iakovos, one of the most influential religious leaders in the United States.
The actual membership of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese is disputed, with estimates ranging from 500,000 to 1.5 million people.
Attended by more than 2,000 people, the congress was distinctly different from many of its 30 predecessors. The delegates extensively revised the regulations for both Archdiocesan-wide governing bodies and local parishes.
Instead of the current Archdiocesan Council in which members are all appointed by the Archbishop, future councils will consist of 10 priests and 20 lay people elected by the dioceses, and of 31 members appointed by the Archbishop, in addition to other bishops. All investment decisions will have to be considered by the full council rather than its nine-member Executive Committee.
Despite his failure to win attention on the real estate transaction, Mr. Karcazes said: "This is the most productive congress in years. The overall impact of the revisions is to support openness."

HEADLINE: Revenge at Exxon Tied to Kidnapping

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 11

 BODY:
Arthur D. Seale, charged with kidnapping and killing Sidney J. Reso, an Exxon executive, may have been motivated by revenge against the company for his firing in 1987, an F.B.I. spokesman said today.
"There may be some basis for saying that Seale wanted some revenge against Exxon," said Bill Tonkin, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Newark. "That's certainly one of the motives we're looking at as to why Exxon was chosen." 
 Until now, authorities portrayed Mr. Seale and his wife, Irene Jacqueline Seale, as desperate fortune-hunters. The Seales were unemployed and living at his parents' home in Lebanon Township when the crime occurred.
Mr. Tonkin cautioned that any theories about the Seales' motivation should be "characterized as speculation at this point."
Mr. Tonkin, however, confirmed an account in early Sunday editions of The Philadelphia Inquirer saying the former Hillside police officer also seemed to strongly resent the F.B.I. because some former agents were promoted over him at Exxon's security division.
Mr. Reso, 57 years old, the president of Exxon International, died May 3 inside a dingy, poorly ventilated storage building in Warren County just four days after he was abducted from his $650,000 home in Morris Township.

HEADLINE: In Profit Search, Postal Service Goes Mailer-Friendly

BYLINE: By BARTH HEALEY

 BODY:
The United States Postal Service, slipping deeper into deficit and concerned over a four-year decline in the volume of business mail, has greatly expanded the marketing of its business services.
Beyond its traditional role of delivering the mail, the Postal Service has started helping companies design envelopes for advertising material and computer-compatible addresses. It even sends employees to private offices to help move the mail. 
 The Postal Service ascribes the decline in business mail -- also called bulk-rate mail, third-class mail or (in a whisper) junk mail -- to three factors: the continually sluggish economy, two sharp increases in the rates for business mail in three years, and the rapid spread of alternative ways to deliver advertising material, like inserts in Sunday newspapers and flyers delivered door to door by contract workers.
There is not much the Postal Service can do about the economy or the rates, so it is offering more services than the small, scattered alternative delivery services provide.
 
Winning an Uphill Fight
 The effort seems to be showing the first slim signs of success. Bulk mail, which accounts for more than a third of total mail volume, rose 2.3 percent in the March-to-May period from the comparable 1991 period.
It has been an uphill fight, says Jeff Martin, the general manager and postmaster for the Long Island division of the Postal Service. On average, he said, it costs $110 to mail 1,000 8 1/2-by-11-inch envelopes; door-to-door delivery of advertising flyers by contract workers costs just $20 for 1,000.
The Long Island division is one of the largest in the postal network, accounting for an estimated $700 million a year in gross revenue of the Postal Service's total of $42.5 billion. It is also the home of one of the 73 centers that have been set up to promote greater use of third-class mail. The centers are high-profile offices, a world away from the neighborhood post office.
The Postal Service has no control over actual mailing costs. The rates are set by the Postal Rate Commission, an independent agency that analyzes costs and revenue. In both 1988 and 1991, the commission increased rates for third-class mail much more sharply than the rates for first-class mail, leaving both mailers and the Postal Service unhappy.
In 1988, rates for third-class mail rose 23 percent and for a first-class letter 13 percent; the comparable figures last year were 25 percent and 16 percent. The clearest result of the shift in mailing costs was an abrupt end to the growth in business mail.
 
Sharing the Work
 But business finally picked up this spring, said Sandra Stewart, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service in Washington. In the three Postal Service accounting periods covering roughly March through May, the volume of third-class mail rose 2.3 percent from the similar period a year earlier, to 14 billion pieces.
An important response to the stagnation of the last four years, said Salvatore A. Sparacino, marketing director for the Long Island division, has been to accelerate work sharing, an idea first developed in the 1970's, just after the Postal Service was set up as a Government-sponsored corporation.
The fine print in the February 1991 rate increase offered the Postal Service the chance to give substantial discounts to mailers who would share its work. A bulk mailer must sort mail at least by region, paying the top rate of 19.8 cents.
But similar pieces sorted by ZIP Code, with a printed bar code of the ZIP Code, cost 14.6 cents each. There are further discounts if the mailer delivers the mail to the post office, bringing the very cheapest rate down to 4.9 cents for some nonprofit groups.
 
Cutting Processing Costs
 "We can do everything for the business mailer," Mr. Sparacino said in a recent interview at his division's new offices in Islandia, L.I., "from designing the mail piece to assuring the hygiene of the address."
The "hygiene" reflects a layout and bar code that can be read by automated sorting machinery, which cuts the Postal Service's processing cost to $3 a thousand, compared with $19 for mechanized sorting (where a human helps a machine) and $41 for manual sorting.
Third-class mail accounted for 37 percent of the volume and 22 percent of the revenue of the Postal Service in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1991, and the erosion over the last four years has hurt the balance sheet.
In 1991, the Postal Service had a loss of $874 million, caused entirely by a Congressional assessment that the service was responsible for $1.9 billion in retroactive health-care costs and cost-of-living wage adjustments.
That loss could have been avoided, said Robert J. Kamerschen, chairman and chief executive of ADVO Inc., the country's largest direct-mail marketer, if the steady gains in third-class mail through 1987 had been maintained. Instead, he said in a recent issue of Mail: The Journal of Commercial Distribution, "Large rate increases have encouraged businesses to seek alternate vehicles for delivery."
While every one of several Postal Service executives interviewed agreed that the rate increases have hurt, they also disputed Mr. Kamerschen's view that a lot of business has gone elsewhere. But Postal Service executives are determined that bulk mail will not go the way of parcel post.
Remember parcel post? At one time the old Post Office Department had a 65 percent share of the market. But "we didn't attend to business," said Thomas F. Rosati, a director of the Long Island division. Now the Postal Service has only 6 percent of the market.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Then and Now;
New York City, a Decade Older, Has a Great Many New Wrinkles

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
The New York City Pat Lehman will find as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention is one that she experienced at the 1980 convention -- only more so.
There are hundreds of thousands more people living here, millions of extra square feet of offices massing along the skyline, new populations of immigrants from more than a hundred countries, surges in crime, drug use and unemployment, health crises, poverty that has grown more extreme and gripping and great examples of defiance, pluck, and exuberance. 
 For Ms. Lehman, a Clinton delegate from Wichita, Kan., the contradictory trends will no doubt produce additions to a scrapbook of New York memories.
But who can say what those additions will be? If there is a constant in New York, it is the swirling change that quickens the municipal heartbeat. In ways uplifting, dispiriting, bemusing, and sometimes numbing, it has altered life in fundamental ways since the Democrats last came.
The changes since 1980, from the terrible effects of AIDS, homelessness and crack to the remarkable boons that have come with new immigration, the rebuilding of burned-out neighborhoods and the improbable improvement of the subways, will alter the visits of conventiongoers in ways incidental and profound.
 
Beleaguered and Resilient
 How will they find the the local spirit?
"It seems as if every possible plague has been hurled upon us, and I think it's got everybody down," said Larry Kramer, the playwright and gay activist. "It's certainly a city where the populace is much more cynical and depressed. This is a war zone."
Glenn Close, who was in "Barnum" when the Democrats were here last and is now starring in "Death and the Maiden," said, "I want to be positive about the city, because I love it, but I think crack is the big difference."
"It is a city that has a great soul and refuses to lay down and die, but it is a little more frightening and a little bit more out of control," she said.
And, yet, said the city's most famous psychotherapist, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, "There is a certain stability in this great city of ours. I would not use the word 'cynical.' People are more sophisticated. They know better. The last time the Democrats were here the attitude was this city is doomed. It's not that I don't see the problems and the homeless and the fact we have the dreadful disease of AIDS, but the city wasn't doomed. People have come through that. They know that they can survive very many terrible things if they have to and they can come out psychologically stronger. I actually feel there are less people saying they have to get out of the city."
Ms. Lehman will likely find the same sorts of attitudes that colored her favorite memories. These include:
Sitting in an Italian restaurant when a diner at an adjacent table looked over her at the spaghetti served to her husband, Leroy, became indignant at the meagerness of his portion, picked up the plate, marched to the kitchen and implored, "Are you gonna serve this guy a meal or what?"
 
Chasing Money
 Flagging down a cab with her husband and two friends and telling the driver she was late for a convention-related meeting, she recalls that "it was the only time in my life that I passed an ambulance on a full emergency run." When the cab screeched to the finish line, Mr. Lehman and a friend each shoved money at the driver. "He took both fares and drove away," she recalled.
Delegates will find that prices have risen all over town. The subway costs $1.25, up from 60 cents, and the average cab ride runs $5.57 compared with $3.96. The top ticket to "Annie" cost $30 in 1980. Today $65 will buy the best seat at "Guys and Dolls." They are advised not to ask the locations of B. Altman, Ohrbach's or Alexander's. And if an operative from another state asks a delegation's leanings on a rules amendment, it would not be savvy to assume a New York air and reply, "Does Macy's tell Gimbels?"
Macy's, albeit under bankruptcy protection, is alive. The others, retail powers during the last convention, are not. Among the corporations that have left: Mobil Oil, American Airlines, Trans World Airlines, Western Union and the J. C. Penney Company. City officials point to the establishment or bolstering of headquarters operations by RJR Nabisco, Sony USA, and the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann A.G.
 
Grimmer Employment Picture
 When the Democrats were last here, the unemployment rate was 9.1 percent. Today it is 11.5 percent. In between, the city experienced its best record of job growth since World War II, gaining 330,000 private-sector jobs before March 1989. It lost all of them -- more than the work force employed in Delaware --- since, according to Samuel M. Ehrenhalt of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The most critical losses have been in manufacturing jobs that have sustained generations of immigrants -- down from 489,000 in August 1980 to 295,000 -- but that hasn't stopped Greek diners from hiring Mexican cooks to serve bagels with schmeers.
Between 1982 and 1989, 685,000 immigrants who became permanent residents in the United States declared their intentions to live in New York City -- more than anywhere else -- and by city estimates an additional 90,000 a year have been coming since. The city population, up from a Census Bureau count of 7,071,000 in 1980 to 7,322,000 in 1990, has tilted from predominantly white to nonwhite.
The city has changed in other ways, too, many of them sobering and heart rending. Three times as many people are in jail -- 21,000 on an average day. More than twice as many children are in foster care, 48,924 compared with 20,953 a decade ago. And more than three times as many families are homeless and living in shelters or hotels -- roughly 5,200. There was no disease called AIDS at the time of the last convention. More than 26,100 people have died of it in New York City since. Tuberculosis, with 1,186 cases in 1980, had stricken 3,672 recorded victims last year.
 
Stalked by Crack
 The 1980 total for homicides was a shocking 1,826. But after years of decreases, the numbers began to rise again in the mid-80's, and although they have dipped slightly since 1990, they totaled 2,245 last year.
Lynn Saunders lives with her two daughters in a section of the South Bronx where six people were shot in one hour July 4th in separate incidents within seven blocks. Crack, which has dominated the lives of two of Ms. Saunders three brothers since arriving in the early to mid-80's, was the culprit, in her opinion.
"It just degraded the neighborhood, and it made people degrade themselves, especially the women," she said. "Now, you don't catch night air. You catch night bullets."
And yet, after years in the same apartment in a housing development, Ms. Saunders's mother, Imani Kummba, fulfilled her dream of moving out last year, to a formerly abandoned building rebuilt by the city.
Hers is one of 27,139 abandoned apartments that have been reborn under a 10-year program started by Mayor Edward I. Koch on which the city has spent $2.4 billion.
The housing plan is financed without federal help, and Richard C. Wade, professor of urban history at the City University of New York, said this is indicative of the most significant change since the last convention: the loss of billions in federal aid during the Reagan and Bush administrations.
Construction was, of course, not limited to poor neighborhoods. According to the Real Estate Board of New York, more than 56 million square feet of office space, or enough to fill more than 20 Empire State Buildings, has been built in Manhattan since the last convention. Add converted space and the sheer growth is greater than the entire office stock of metropolitan Boston or metropolitan Atlanta.
A lot of it, however, is empty. When the Democrats were last here, the vacancy rate was 2.4 percent downtown and 6 percent in midtown. It is 17.5 percent downtown and 22.2 percent in midtown today. One place that is less empty is Broadway, which, as in 1980, is experiencing a banner year.
Is Broadway finally coming back? Will the economy ever revive? Can the city survive, or has it died already? In 1980 and today, as in 1970 and 1960, the questions are the same, even if the discos and clubs -- remember Bond's? -- are different.
In fact, it was in 1927 that the critic Ford Maddox Ford noted in a book titled "New York is Not America," that the city was ever moving in unpredictable ways.
It had the appearance, he said, of "a storming-party hurrying towards an unknown goal."
