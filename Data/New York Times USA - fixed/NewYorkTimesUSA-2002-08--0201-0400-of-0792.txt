HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
The F.C.C. HasVoted: A Digital Tuner for Every TV

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Complaining that market forces alone had not assured the transition to digital television, the Federal Communications Commission voted 3 to 1 today to require television manufacturers to include digital tuners in almost every television sold.
 The requirement is to be phased in over five years, starting with large sets two years from now and smaller televisions by 2007. 
 The vote is certain to raise the cost of televisions, though whether the increase will be small or substantial is the subject of a contentious industry debate.
The commission's decision came amid vehement objections from some television manufacturers, who said they would appeal it in federal court. The industry's lobbying group said the requirement would burden consumers with hundreds of dollars in costs for each new television set. Yet the figures used to support that assertion are the subject of dispute. 
Almost four years after the transition to digital television began, the three commissioners voting in the majority said that market forces had failed to move it along in a timely fashion and that the government had to step in. 
"This is not a market-oriented policy," said Michael K. Powell, the chairman of the commission, of the new order. "This is an industrial policy."
Responding to requests from broadcasters, in 1997 the commission ordered the transition to digital television, which can offer crystal-clear pictures and has the potential to provide interactive services to consumers. To that end, the commission lent each television station an extra channel so the stations could offer digital and traditional analog television programming simultaneously until digital becomes the standard.
Once the switch to digital television is complete, the commission is supposed to reclaim the broadcast spectrum used for traditional television and sell it, most likely for $5 billion to $10 billion, according to Congressional estimates. But under the law, that can happen only after 85 percent of households have digital televisions.
Television manufacturers have been eagerly -- and successfully -- selling digital sets to consumers; about three million have been sold to dealers thus far. But most of them require an external receiver box costing $450 or more to receive digital programming. Consumers have been slow to buy those receivers because of the limited high-definition programming and the need to install an antenna that most homes abandoned years ago.
The commission's order requires manufacturers to include digital tuners, either as part of the set itself or as external units, in all sets 35 inches or larger, phasing them in over a year beginning July 1, 2004. A year later, that rule would extend to all televisions with screens from 25 to 35 inches. By July 1, 2007, all televisions with screens 13 inches and larger would be covered.
Most television manufacturers -- with the exception of Zenith and Thomson Multimedia, maker of RCA-brand televisions, oppose the new commission rule. Zenith, a unit of LG Electronics, and RCA own some of the patents behind the tuners and could earn royalties for every receiver sold.
Most of the manufacturers "don't want to do this," said Alan Stillwell, a senior officer in the commission's Office of Engineering and Technology. In an advertisement that ran this week in national newspapers, the Consumer Electronics Association, the trade group for the TV makers, said that putting a digital tuner in a television would raise its price by $250, doubling or tripling the cost of small sets.
"Their incentive is to make it as high as they can," Mr. Stillwell said of the estimate.
The association came up with its estimate by adding up the current cost of components needed for digital tuners. At least one component the group included, a decoder for standard television signals, is already built into televisions. What is more, according to several experts, the cost of other components is likely to drop significantly by the time all televisions fall under the commission's mandate.
"We believe, based on the economies of scale driven by industry volumes, that the cost of incorporating a digital tuner in 2007 will be about the same as an analog tuner," said John I. Taylor, the spokesman for Zenith. Mr. Taylor said the cost of including a digital tuner in a television set was already less than $200. 
James Harper, a spokesman for Thomson, said licensing fees would contribute less than 5 percent of the tuners' cost.
The Consumer Electronics Association's advertisement asserted that the new tuners would cost consumers $5 billion a year. Gary Shapiro, the president of the Consumer Electronics Association, raised that figure to $7 billion in comments today. 
But in an interview, he also said the cost of the tuners could drop to about $100 by 2007. 
Mr. Shapiro conceded, however, that he was not sure how many people would actually buy televisions in 2007. "No one really knows what will happen," he said. "I'm not smart enough to figure this out, honestly."

HEADLINE: Raises Sought by the Police Appear Increasingly Remote 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
The city's 24,000 police officers and their union, outflanked by a worsening economy and the drain on city resources since the Sept. 11 attack, are facing the prospect that the large pay increases they have sought appear remote.
 It is a galling prospect to an angry and demoralized rank and file who earn significantly less than the police in nearby communities, despite helping to achieve a historic reduction in crime. It comes as the city and the nation are set to mark the anniversary of the attack -- in which 23 city police officers died -- and as officers have new responsibilities, taking the front lines in fighting terrorism. 
 A three-member panel is weighing testimony from the city and the union on pay and is expected to rule in the coming weeks. While Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has often said he hopes the officers get the substantial raise he says they deserve, neither he nor officials from the city or the union would discuss the talks. The decision by the panel, whose members are designated by the State Public Employment Relations Board, is binding. It will be the first time a state panel has sat in judgment on a city police contract. The police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, pushed through legislation in Albany in 1998 to have the contract dispute heard by the state panel and then won a case before the State Court of Appeals last year that upheld the law.
One panel member is selected by the city, another by the union and a third is selected by the state board. 
The city's police officers, who start at an annual salary of $31,305 a year and make $55,268 a year after 20 years, have worked without a contract since their last agreement with the city expired July 31, 2000. That 64-month contract, settled when the city was flush with cash, provided no increase at all for the first 24 months, with two raises of 3 percent and one of 6 percent over the next 41 months.
The so-called double zeroes, which outraged officers and was followed by the election defeat of the union leadership at the time, led officials to renew their efforts to have the contract heard by the state panel.
Union officials said the state panel would help bring New York Police Department salaries in line with suburban departments and the police in Newark, where officers make 20 percent more than their city counterparts. The union initially sought a 39 percent increase when negotiations began and sought a 21.9 percent raise from the state panel. 
But the panel also takes into account the city's ability to pay as it is facing a $5 billion budget deficit for the 2004 fiscal year. The city has said it cannot afford to give officers a raise beyond the contract offered in 2000, which called for a 10 percent raise over 30 months. Union leaders representing other city uniformed services accepted 24-month contracts with raises of 5 percent in the first year and 4 percent in the second.
A person who has been briefed on the state panel's work said it had discussed several options, including a 24-month contract that would provide raises of 5 percent each year, with the additional point beyond the other uniformed services' contracts financed by officers' working 10 additional days. A second option, a 30-month contract, would include 5 percent raises in the first two years, with an additional 1.5 percent kicking in after the 28th month, the person said. Another person who has been briefed on the panel's work played down the significance of the two options, saying negotiations were continuing.
The simmering anger among officers has led to some talk of a wildcat strike, which both city and union officials call unlikely. People on both sides noted that probationary officers could be fired, other officers suspended or docked two days pay for each day on strike and union officials jailed. 
But a combination of many officers' calling in sick and a series of work actions like slowing down summonses could be more likely.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he understood the officers' frustration but doubted it would lead to a strike. "We just have tough fiscal times, and we're going to have to find some ways to do the best we can on it," he said.
Some officers say any contract that would provide the raises that are being discussed would be a blow to a force whose union leaders have led members to believe they are entitled to nearly 22 percent. Whatever the rationale, any such contract would seriously undermine the union stewardship of the P.B.A. president, Patrick J. Lynch, who campaigned on the "double zeroes" that angered officers in the last contract. He declined to be interviewed yesterday.

HEADLINE: What Do Iraqis Think About Life After Saddam? 

BYLINE:  By Michael Rubin; Michael Rubin is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Newspapers are making public possible war plans should the United States decide to attack Iraq while Bush administration strategists consider timing. Aid workers, academics and experts debate what comes after a war. Last week, witnesses testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee estimated that rebuilding a stable Iraq could take a 20-year commitment and cost American taxpayers billions of dollars. In all the debate, however, one thing is forgotten: What the Iraqis themselves say about their post-Saddam Hussein future.
 I taught for nine months last year in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, a region that has been partially protected by American and British aircraft for the past decade and has been outside Saddam Hussein's control. I had 500 students. Some were children of the local elite, others were children of political dissidents. Many were Kurdish, but some were Turkoman, Arab or Assyrian. 
 Many students had families living under Saddam Hussein's control in southern Iraq whom they would visit regularly. Some of my colleagues at the university in Dohuk would even commute from Mosul, a city still under Baghdad's control. One of my housemates was an Arab from Baghdad who said he once helped arrange spontaneous demonstrations for the Iraqi government. Shopping in well-stocked markets in Erbil, a major city of northern Iraq, I met Sunni and Shiite Muslims visiting from all over Iraq. 
The Iraqis I know would shed few tears if Saddam Hussein were to go. As one university professor in Sulaimaniya, in northeast Iraq, asked me, "Why do people in the West think we want to live under Saddam any more than they would?" Others I talked to were suspicious of Washington's ability to match its rhetoric with action.
Nevertheless, the debate in Washington has caused Iraqis to consider their post-Saddam Hussein future. Despite wars and dictatorship, Iraqis remain cosmopolitan, and they do not fear that the country itself will break up. Sunni or Shiite, Arab or Kurd, Iraqis are proud of their heritage. "During the Iran-Iraq War, we didn't flee," one Shiite war veteran at a refugee camp in northeastern Iraq told me. "Why would we stop being Iraqi now?" Most Kurds recognize that independence from Iraq is not an option, and they want a say in Iraq's future -- which is why Iraqi Kurds and Arabs are talking seriously about federalism.
To Iraqis, federalism is not a new concept. Iraq flirted with the idea prior to its independence in 1932. Saddam Hussein himself endorsed federalism in 1970, while serving as vice chairman of the ruling Baath party, though as he consolidated his power he undercut the autonomy accords he had negotiated with the Kurds in the north of the country. In 1995, King Hussein of Jordan described Iraqi federalism as the optimal solution to ensure stability. 
But federalism has many variations. Many Kurds wish federalism to be tripartite: A northern Kurdish state, a central Arab Sunni state and a southern Arab Shiite state. Turkey and Saudi Arabia (Iraq's neighbors to the north and south), many Iraqi Arabs, and minorities like the Turkomans and Assyrians find such a vision unacceptable. Iraqi Arabs say they will endorse federalism so long as it is not configured along sectarian lines, a view voiced as early as 1996 by Ayatollah Muhammad Bakir al-Hakim, head of one of the leading Iraqi Shiite opposition groups, and reiterated just last month by Mudar Shawkat, leader of the predominantly Sunni Arab Iraqi National Movement.
A federalist future could insure against sectarian strife and make post-Saddam Hussein reconstruction less daunting than many policymakers in the West fear. Federalism would not have to devolve into provincialism. A central Baghdad government would still control defense, foreign affairs, oil fields and national infrastructure.
The economic basis for federalism already exists. Under terms of the 1996 United Nations oil-for-food program, the three northern provinces of Iraq together receive 13 percent of Iraq's oil revenue, a figure proportional to their population. The economic progress in that region offers a workable model for post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.
Reconstructing Iraq will not be simple, but if policymakers listen to Iraqis, it will be easier. My Baghdad University-trained translators consistently stumbled over words like debate, tolerance and compromise -- growing up under Saddam Hussein made it harder for them to grasp these concepts as real. But after 34 years of Baath Party dictatorship, Iraqi civilians want freedom and better lives. Helping Iraqis attain freedom will be costly; first America needs to listen to them.

HEADLINE: The Lost Continent 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
On Wednesday the Bush administration, which says that it is for free trade and against bailouts, once again put its money where its mouth isn't. Less than two weeks ago Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill created a diplomatic incident and sent Brazil's currency into free fall with his remark about assistance ending up in "Swiss bank accounts." Now the International Monetary Fund, with Mr. O'Neill's blessing, has agreed to lend Brazil an unprecedented $30 billion.
 I guess it's good news that our leadership finally woke up to two uncomfortable facts: A major threat to U.S. interests is developing in this hemisphere, and doing the opposite of what Bill Clinton did isn't always a wise policy. Indeed, if Brazil hadn't gotten a loan the South American financial crisis, already comparable to the one that struck Asia in 1997, might quickly have turned into something much bigger. 
 And yet I have a bad feeling about this. Let me make the case for the I.M.F. loan, then explain my misgivings.
The good news is that Brazil's current leadership is highly responsible. In the past, I.M.F. loans went to governments that didn't collect taxes (Russia) or were committed to an unsustainable exchange rate (Argentina). By comparison, Brazil is a model of upright behavior.
So why is there a crisis? With an election due in October, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's chosen successor is running far behind two left-of-center candidates. Investors are nervous, and the result has been one of those downward spirals all too familiar from the history of currency crises. Fears that the government will default on its debt have caused the currency to plunge and interest rates to soar; since most of the debt is indexed either to the dollar or to short-term interest rates, this makes default seem even more likely. 
Mr. O'Neill's remark was unforgivable because it reinforced this death spiral; the I.M.F. loan is an attempt to turn that spiral around. The end result of Mr. O'Neill's flub was probably to get Brazil an extra $10 billion. 
So why am I feeling queasy? One reason is that there is some question about who, exactly, is being bailed out. Paul Erdman writes on cbsmarketwatch.com -- in a column praising the administration! -- that "The fact that the Brazilian bailout also gave a big boost to Citigroup and FleetBoston, which combined had close to $20 billion at risk in Brazil, will hardly go unnoticed when it comes time to raise campaign funds among the Wall Street elite." 
More important, if you look beyond the question of short-term financial stabilization you have to wonder where all this is supposed to be leading. Asian economies were doing very well before their crisis, and you could think of bailouts as a way to get them back on track. But there is a reason the left is having a resurgence in Brazil and elsewhere in the region: We promised them a rose garden, but even before this latest crisis too many people got nothing but thorns. 
A decade ago Washington confidently assured Latin American nations that if they opened themselves to foreign goods and capital and privatized their state enterprises they would experience a great surge of economic growth. But it hasn't happened. Argentina is a catastrophe. Both Mexico and Brazil were, a few months ago, regarded as success stories, but in both countries per capita income today is only slightly higher than it was in 1980. And because inequality has increased sharply, most people are probably worse off than they were 20 years ago. Is it any wonder that the public is weary of yet more calls for austerity and market discipline? 
Why hasn't reform worked as promised? That's a difficult and disturbing question. I, too, bought into much though not all of the Washington consensus; but now it's time, as Berkeley's Brad DeLong puts it, to mark my beliefs to market. And my confidence that we've been giving good advice is way down. One has to sympathize with Latin political leaders who want to temper enthusiasm for free markets with more efforts to protect workers and the poor.
What that suggests to me is that the United States should be very cautious about what it expects for its money. Pulling Brazil back from the brink doesn't mean that we are once again in a position to demand that Latin Americans do things our way. The truth is that we've lost a lot of credibility with our southern neighbors. If we overplay our hand, we'll lose whatever is left.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Loan To Brazil Also Shields U.S. Interests 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
To hear the Bush administration tell the story, there is one main reason that Brazil should be rescued with a $30 billion loan while Argentina should get nothing: Brazil has been good; Argentina has been bad.
 In explaining their abrupt reversal in deciding to support a huge bailout for Brazil, something that seemed odious to the White House a few weeks ago, administration officials said today that Brazil had earned support because it had moved courageously to open its markets, fight inflation and put its fiscal house in order. 
 Argentina, by contrast, reacted to its currency crisis by defaulting on most of its public debt, freezing bank accounts and refusing to enact much-needed reforms.
Most international experts would agree with at least part of that analysis. But the American motivations are a good deal more tangled than that. 
For one thing, a Brazilian collapse would be much more frightening. Brazil's economy is several times as big as Argentina's. Its external debt of $264 billion is more than double that of Argentina, and American banks like Citigroup, FleetBoston and J. P. Morgan Chase have much greater exposure to Brazilian loans than to Argentine ones.
Brazil has also been a big magnet for American industrial investment. General Motors and other car companies have sunk billions into factory expansions, and a Brazilian meltdown would turn those into white elephants.
It is unclear how much American banks and manufacturers lobbied for the Brazilian rescue plan, but they will certainly benefit from it. Shares of Citigroup and FleetBoston jumped 6 percent as soon as the markets opened today, long before the rest of the stock market began soaring to a large increase.
The Bush administration also had political and diplomatic reasons to reverse its prior stance of "tough love" when it came to Brazil.
The I.M.F. loan was carefully structured to affect Brazil's upcoming elections, in which two left-wing candidates are in the lead and had been threatening to reverse Brazil's free-market approach to economics and trade.
Most of the loan cannot be tapped until after the elections, and the left-wing candidates strongly implied today that they will continue the current belt-tightening budget policies in order to satisfy the fund.
President Bush's hope to negotiate a giant free-trade agreement that covers all of Latin America, made possible when Congress gave him negotiation authority last week, would have been crippled if Brazil were forced to default on its debt.
Brazilian leaders had already been balking at calls for a free-trade agreement and would probably have refused to embrace the talks if they had been denied aid.
"This was a case in which ideology ran into the wall of reality," said Lawrence Meyer, a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
The real world reacted exuberantly to the news. Stock markets in Brazil, Chile and even Argentina jumped briskly. Brazil's battered currency, the real, strengthened nearly 4 percent against the dollar.
The political strategy seemed to pay off as well. Both of the two left-wing challengers in Brazil's presidential election, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party and Ciro Gomes of the Labor Front, said today that they would support the fund's loan program.
That essentially obliges them to support the current government's austerity program and keep country's primary budget surplus -- the surplus before including external loan repayments -- at 3.75 percent of its gross domestic product.
Supporters of a rescue package for Brazil said the government under President Fernando Henrique Cardoso deserves credit for pursuing bold economic reforms. The central bank's hard-nose monetary policies have brought down Brazilian inflation to some of the lowest levels in its history. The government's budget position is much stronger than before. And its banking system is one of the strongest in Latin America.
"Brazilian economic policy has been brilliant," said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, a policy research group in Washington that focuses on economic issues affecting developing countries.
But it was only a few years ago that experts were showering similar praise on Argentina, which is now in disarray. Argentine leaders won praise for privatizing state-owned industry, opening many of its markets and all but eliminating inflation by pegging their currency to the American dollar.
Today, critics complain that Argentina's spending is out of control because provincial governments run big budget deficits that have undermined the whole country.
But Argentina's biggest handicap may have been its peg to the dollar, which appreciated by nearly one-third against other major currencies in the second half of the 1990's. The high dollar harmed Argentina's exports because it made them far more expensive in many parts of the world.
But Argentina is a far smaller economy with a far smaller impact on other countries. Brazil is the world's 10th-largest economy, with deep financial ties to the United States as well as its neighbors.
American banks have about $25.6 billion in outstanding to loans to Brazilian borrowers. Citigroup, the biggest American lender to Brazil, has $9.7 billion in Brazilian loans.
Robert H. Rubin, who was Treasury secretary under President Clinton and engineered international rescue packages for Mexico, Russia and many Asian countries, is now a Citigroup director.
A representative for Citigroup could not say whether bank executives had lobbied in favor of a rescue package for Brazil. But other banking leaders have spoken out vocally.
"We think Brazil has earned the benefit of the doubt," said Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, an industry association in Washington that represents banks and other financial institutions.
"We have not argued in either Brazil or Argentina that the I.M.F. should step in to protect the banks," Mr. Dallara said. But he added: "There is a broader systemic case to make for supporting Brazil right now. It is the world's tenth largest economy."
Banks are hardly the only institutions with a major stake in Brazil's health. American car companies have invested heavily in expanding factories in both Brazil and Argentina, and the Brazilian market is the biggest market in Latin America.
"The region has been very unstable there, and that affects our operations there," said Toni Simonetti, a spokeswoman for General Motors. "We naturally support efforts such as this that stabilize the economy."

HEADLINE: Everybody Who's Anybody Is Entering Connecticut Politics 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
So far, no dead people have registered to run for governor, but give them some time. A federal judge on Monday opened up Connecticut's September primaries to any of the state's two million registered voters, and he did not explicitly exclude those without a pulse.
 Since then, 17 bright-eyed candidates -- including a newspaper columnist and a man who lives at the Hartford Y.M.C.A. and now wants to be governor -- have registered for primary races. The other candidates have signed up to challenge the endorsed Democratic and Republican candidates for Congress, State Senate and State House of Representatives, said Susan Bysiewicz, the secretary of the state. "We're being deluged," she said this afternoon. 
 The flood of extemporaneous politicians comes courtesy of Judge Peter C. Dorsey of United States District Court here. This week, in a codicil to a ruling he made last month, he ordered Ms. Bysiewicz to open the primary election to all comers as a way of ensuring that no one's right to seek office is trampled this November. 
As a result, Connecticut went from being a state with some of the most onerous ballot barriers to one that will put anyone with a state address and a party affiliation -- and presumably a pulse -- on a primary ballot. 
In his earlier decision, the judge suspended the state law preventing political candidates for statewide office and Congressional seats from appearing on a party's primary ballot unless at least 15 percent of the party's delegates support them. He said that threshold was probably unconstitutional, and urged the Legislature to fix the law. 
In Monday's follow-up ruling, Judge Dorsey chastised state lawmakers for ignoring his advice. 
So now the state has six new candidates for governor in the Sept. 10 primary. Five of them -- including Richard Wirth, 37, who moved to Connecticut two months ago and lives at the downtown Y -- are challenging William E. Curry Jr., the endorsed Democrat for governor, Ms. Bysiewicz said. 
"If I get the support, I will run," Mr. Wirth, an unemployed construction worker, said from his dormitory room this afternoon. "I've got a lot of friends. I'm actually a personal friend of Bill Clinton as well as other high-profile Democrats. I'm a friend of Joe Lieberman's and even Al Gore."
Another out-of-the-woodwork gubernatorial hopeful is Fredrick W. Lewis of Chester, Conn., a Republican challenging Gov. John G. Rowland for the Republican nomination. 
Answering the telephone today, Mr. Lewis's mother, who asked that her name not be printed, said her son had never expressed an interest in politics. But now that he has, she said, she thinks he has a chance to defeat Mr. Rowland. "I think he'll do well," she said. "He's got a lot of confidence." 
His mother said she did not know when Mr. Lewis would be home, and declined to answer any questions about him. 
Nuala Forde, a campaign spokeswoman for Governor Rowland, who had been his party's unchallenged nominee until today, seemed slightly amused at the thought of a primary battle with Fredrick Lewis of Chester. "We've been trying to find out a little bit about him," she said.
A third, far less serious contender for governor is Denis Horgan, a columnist for The Hartford Courant, who in a column Wednesday divulged his reasons for running. "The judge says anybody can run," he wrote. "I am an anybody."
For Ms. Bysiewicz, the no-nonsense secretary of the state, what began as a lawsuit turned into a constitutional question and has now ended up as a dream come true for the frustrated class of political also- and never-rans. "Based on our experience over the last couple of days, we have some questions about who some of these candidates really are," she said. 
The deadline to register for a primary is Aug. 16; until then, anyone -- from anywhere -- could conceivably establish residency in the state and run for governor. "Somebody could drive in from Massachusetts, rent an apartment, go register to vote today and come to our office before 4:30," Ms. Bysiewicz said. 
That is one of several points she said she would make to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on Friday, when she is scheduled to appeal Judge Dorsey's ruling. 
The few candidates with a real chance of winning office want her to win. During a campaign stop in Norwalk today, Mr. Curry said he hoped the appeals court would overturn Judge Dorsey's decision. He said, "I'm sort of getting tired of welcoming people to the race on the hour."

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Seeks to Ban Smoking In Every City Restaurant and Bar 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration will ask the City Council to amend New York City's antismoking law to include all restaurants and bars, making it one of the toughest in the nation. 
 The current law, passed in 1995, forbids smoking in all restaurants with more than 35 seats, and excludes stand-alone bars and the bar areas of all restaurants. The proposed amendment would add roughly 13,000 establishments that would be forced to ban smoking entirely. 
 A state bill banning smoking in all restaurants passed the Assembly this year and had enough support to pass in the Senate. But under pressure from Gov. George E. Pataki, who insisted on exempting small restaurants, and a heavy lobbying campaign by restaurant groups and the tobacco and liquor industries, the Senate's Republican leaders never put the bill to a vote. 
However, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- who, along with his health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, is persistently anti-tobacco -- views bars and restaurants as workplaces before social establishments, and has said that employees within them should have the same option of a smoke-free environment as those who work in offices.
"The mayor will push this," one administration official said, "for all the same reasons he pushed the cigarette tax. He makes changes to things that he thinks are important."
Mr. Bloomberg gained approval from Albany this year to raise the taxes on cigarettes, making the cost of a pack about $7.50 in the city. The administration is expected to announce its plans to amend the antismoking law on Monday. Even cigar bars, if they serve alcohol, are likely to be included in the legislation. 
In the last month, the mayor has quietly lined up support in the Council, where several members are likely to sponsor a bill at his request forcing all smoking New Yorkers to do their puffing outdoors. (Under the 1995 law, smoking was outlawed in public places like theaters and offices.) 
Among those consulted was Councilman James S. Oddo from Staten Island, who came up with his own more modest bill this spring to expand the smoking laws to small restaurants. Hearings were never held on the bill.
"The health commissioner and the mayor make a very compelling argument for legislation that goes well beyond my bill," he said yesterday. "I am seriously considering sponsoring it."
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, would not comment last night.
Timothy Filler, the associate director of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, said the amendment "would be hugely significant."
"New York is a bellwether and a city that many others look toward as a leader," he added. "If New York City were to do something that included restaurants and bars, it would be a great step forward in public health."
The city is bound to meet some resistance from both some restaurants and bars and those that represent them, although the New York State Restaurant Association recently reversed its longstanding opposition to the proposed state law after a survey showed that 76 percent of its 7,000 members favored the law.
"Our position has been that we have some of the strictest rules in the country, and we have learned to live with them, and we think they should be left alone," said E. Charles Hunt, the executive vice president of the restaurant association. 
However, he added: "If a total ban is proposed in all public places, I think people are going to say nobody has an advantage over anyone else and would seriously consider whether or not that might work. The whole thing seems to be boiling down to an employee safety issue at this point."
Lawmakers in Nassau and Suffolk Counties are considering similar measures, officials there said.
If such a law were passed, New York City would join two states -- California and Delaware -- and scores of municipalities that ban smoking in just about every workplace, including bars and restaurants.
Three other states -- Maine, Utah and Vermont -- have statewide bans on smoking in all restaurants. Municipalities have been more aggressive in seeking tough and broad antismoking laws, largely because local legislatures are less vulnerable to the powerful tobacco industry lobby.
New York State law requires that a restaurant have a nonsmoking area that encompasses at least 70 percent of its seats, but the smoking area can be in the same room.
There are 72 municipalities in America that ban smoking in any restaurant or bar, according to Mr. Filler, and hundreds offer some other variation on a law against public smoking, allowing people to light up in stand-alone bars, or permitting smoking in restaurant bars that have separate ventilation systems.
In California, where the Legislature passed a law in 1994 that banned smoking in all workplaces, including bars and restaurants, many tavern and restaurant owners feared dire economic consequences. Some studies, including one by the state's sales tax collection agency in 1998, actually showed an increase in sales after the law was enacted. 
"I don't believe a New Yorker would choose a steakhouse in Weehawken over Ruth's Chris in New York City because of a smoking regulation," Mr. Oddo said yesterday.
Mr. Bloomberg, who has a school of public health named after him, is aggressively antismoking. When he lobbied for his cigarette tax, he insisted that he did not care whether the city made or lost money, but rather that the tax would keep children from smoking. He has been known to chide reporters for their puffing, and has takes slaps at the tobacco industry in speeches.
He has found a kindred spirit in Dr. Frieden, the health commissioner, who said when he was appointed that his main priority would be to combat smoking. Dr. Frieden has even produced a radio advertisement deploring secondhand smoke.

HEADLINE: Palestinians, Meeting Powell, Urge Pullout 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
In the highest-level contacts since President Bush made support for Palestinian statehood contingent on Yasir Arafat's removal, three Palestinian officials appointed by Mr. Arafat met today with senior officials at the White House and State Department.
 They left saying they could make little progress toward peace unless Washington pressed Israel to withdraw from Palestinian areas. 
 The Palestinians met with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. On Saturday, they are expected to see the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, to discuss reshaping a Palestinian security force. All of this left the suggestion that the administration was close to outlining details of a new security plan that could persuade Israel to begin a phased withdrawal from Palestinian towns and cities. 
"The discussions will be continuing over the next couple of days, and then we're anxious to get some specific actions started, especially with respect to security," Secretary Powell said after meeting with Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians' chief negotiator; Abdel Razak Yehiyeh, the interior minister; and Maher Masri, the economic minister.
But Mr. Yehiyeh said that efforts to reorganize Palestinian security forces scattered in months of Israeli occupation would be limited as long as Israeli forces continued to keep Palestinian police officers from moving around or carrying weapons.
"Behind the curtain, we are doing something, slowly, gradually," Mr. Yehiyeh told a group at the Brookings Institution. He expressed doubt that the United States was "going to convince the Israelis, or make that pressure," to withdraw, but said, "I hope that." 
Negotiating with Mr. Arafat's lieutenants when the president has demanded his ouster poses special diplomatic challenges. The tough new policy toward Mr. Arafat grew out of the administration's wider antiterror doctrine, which holds that the world would be safer without leaders like him and Saddam Hussein of Iraq. The United States has accused both men of siding with terrorists.
By now, according to the administration's blueprint of last spring, there was supposed to have been an international conference on the Middle East. A C.I.A.-drafted plan for renewed security cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians was supposed to be operational, perhaps prompting a letup in bombings, occupation and near daily death.
But in the six weeks since Mr. Bush upended that policy by declaring that his administration's campaign against terrorism would require Mr. Arafat's replacement, violence in the region has risen again and killed five American citizens, among many others on both sides. The administration has moved only incrementally to follow up on Mr. Bush's pledge to support creation of a Palestinian state within three years if Palestinians made major reforms in governance and security.
C.I.A. teams have been in Israel helping to train and reorganize Palestinian security forces in the hope that they could gradually resume control over areas that Israel has occupied. Recent efforts of Palestinian and Israeli officials to negotiate a phased withdrawal have foundered, but senior administration officials said there was hope such talks might yet succeed with American help.
Mr. Tenet is expected to dispatch a former Jerusalem C.I.A. station officer to help implement the plan. A visit by a higher-level official, like Mr. Tenet or Secretary Powell, has been put off indefinitely, in part because each would face the tricky question of whether to meet with Mr. Arafat. The current thinking is to send a lower-level official, like David Satterfield, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs.
The meetings this week illustrated how the complications of avoiding Mr. Arafat can seem almost comical. Mr. Erekat is a longtime Arafat friend and confidant and at a news conference here on Wednesday, he demanded: "Where do you think I come from -- Mars? I am part of President Arafat's leadership."
After the meeting with Secretary Powell this afternoon, Mr. Erekat sounded a diplomatic note, saying that the secretary had assured his delegation of Mr. Bush's commitment to Palestinian statehood. "We really hope to see an action plan that will define the time lines, the mechanism for implementation, and the way stations that will take us toward this endgame," he said.
But Mr. Erekat, too, said the Israeli occupation was a barrier to progress. "Palestinian reform is Palestinian reform," he said. "It's done for Palestinian interests by Palestinian will, and it's not being dictated by anybody." He said the Israeli re-occupation of areas that are supposed to be legally under Palestinian control had created "the biggest prison in history."
Secretary Powell said that he and the delegation have also discussed the growing relief crisis in Palestinian areas, where high unemployment, restricted movement and lack of access to sanitation and supplies have reached severe levels.
Shibley Telhami, a Middle East expert at the University of Maryland, said: "At the moment, this is not about a major political breakthrough. It's about intermediate steps that would reduce some of the immediate tensions and relieve Palestinians' humanitarian hardships on the ground."
But there are continuing differences within the administration about how much Washington should press Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians. In remarks in an open meeting at the Pentagon on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld sharply criticized the Palestinian Authority, referred dismissively to disputed lands in the West Bank and Gaza as "the so-called occupied territories." Apparently referring to a Palestinian state, he said only that at some point "there will be some sort of entity that will be established."
Mr. Rumsfeld's comments were hailed in the Israeli press as "an unusual pro-Israeli appearance," as Maariv, a Hebrew-language daily, put it, and denounced by the Palestinian information minister, Yasir Abed Rabbo, as an example of "the position of the extreme right in the American administration."
Mr. Rumsfeld insisted that there was not "a dime's worth of difference" between his views and those of Mr. Bush and Secretary Powell. But in fact, debates endure among Mr. Bush's senior advisers about the relative importance of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the campaign to oust Saddam Hussein in Iraq. 
"The administration is seriously divided in terms of what it needs to do," a senior Arab diplomat said this week. "They're torn on this issue. There are those who understand that America needs to play a serious role and take a clear position, and then there are those who think the U.S. should not touch Sharon and if the Palestinians want their own state, they should move to Jordan."

HEADLINE: Bush's Forum on Economy Is to Feature G.O.P. Donors 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug. 8 

 BODY:
The speakers at a White House economic forum next week near President's Bush ranch will include major corporate donors to the Republican Party and a labor leader whom the administration is courting for support in the 2004 presidential campaign.
 The White House is billing the forum, which President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and at least seven members of the cabinet are to attend, as a diverse policy gathering of more than 200 economists, government officials, small investors, teachers, workers, corporate executives, small-business leaders and professors. White House officials said the participants would discuss the president's "agenda to increase economic growth." 
 Three of eight speakers announced by the White House today are chief executives of companies that have given generously to Republicans, said the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group. 
The three are Charles Schwab, the chairman and chief executive of Charles Schwab Inc., which, with its executives, gave more than $406,000 in unrestricted soft money donations to the Republicans in 2000, and nothing to the Democrats; Glen A. Barton of Caterpillar, which gave $255,000 in soft money to the Republicans in 2000 and nothing to the Democrats; and John T. Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, which gave more than $435,000 in unrestricted party contributions to the Republicans in 2000 and $255,000 to the Democrats. A fourth speaker will be Douglas J. McCarron, the general president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. The union has often backed Democrats, including Al Gore in the 2000 presidential campaign, but Mr. McCarron has developed warm relations with Mr. Bush, and White House advisers are pursuing his support for the president's re-election.
A White House spokesman said this evening that no political considerations were involved in the invitations to speak. "The speakers were selected because of their expertise and knowledge," the spokesman, Scott McClellan, said. "And the attendees and participants represent a diversity of views."
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, also defended Mr. Bush, saying the three executives were invited because of their background in investments, technology and manufacturing.
"I would doubt that the president would know who contributes to his campaign," Mr. Grassley said. "I would imagine he called people from Charles Schwab because of the necessity of increasing confidence in the stock market."
But other Republicans and conservative economists expressed skepticism today about the gathering. They said it appeared to be a show forum and public relations vehicle.
"It's purely political, purely P.R.," said Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist who worked in the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and the president's father, President George Bush. "There are a lot of times when really, quite frankly, there's nothing the president can do. But nobody wants to hear the president get on TV and say, 'I'm sorry, we're just going to have to tough it out.' This was something they planned out, and it looks good."
Mr. Bartlett added, "The people selected for this event are going to be very, very carefully chosen to make sure that nobody gets in there to start ranting and raving about how the Bush tax cut caused the recession. They'll tell the president what he wants to hear, and reaffirm his policies."
The other speakers are Charles M. Vest, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Republican who has contributed to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts; Tom Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a Republican who has donated to Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey; Michael Novak, a Democrat who is the director of social and political studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization; and Karen Kerrigan, a Republican who is the president and founder of the Small Business Survival Committee.
The half-day forum is scheduled on Tuesday at Baylor University in Waco, about a half-hour's drive from the president's 1,600-acre ranch near Crawford, where he is spending a month. White House advisers, concerned about the economy's effect on Mr. Bush's political future, announced the gathering last month.
Much of the forum was planned at the last minute. Some invitations went out as late as last Monday, leaving those invited to decide whether to abandon vacations for a day in Central Texas. 
Many decided to come.
"Are there perhaps P.R. effects that flow from an event like this?" said Dirk Van Dongen, the president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors and a leading Republican lobbyist. "Sure. But that doesn't mean it's not worthwhile. I think it is worthwhile enough that I'm going down myself, and it's not because of Waco's climate."

HEADLINE: New York Is Seeking to Win Supporting Role in the Oscars 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
A group of New York entertainment executives, celebrities and government officials has begun working to persuade the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to move a significant part of the Academy Awards ceremony to New York next year to help the city in its effort to recover from the attacks of Sept. 11. 
 Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films, and James L. Dolan, the president and chief executive of Cablevision Systems, are spearheading the effort to make New York a co-host of the Oscars' 75th anniversary presentations next March. 
 They have enlisted the support of Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, along with New York-based entertainment figures including Spike Lee and Robert De Niro.
"We view this as a one-time-only event, as a nod to 9/11," said Mr. Weinstein, who together with Mr. Dolan produced last year's Concert for New York, which raised more than $30 million for the attack victims. "We will make a full-scale presentation to the board, and demonstrate why this is economically feasible and why we should do this. We are getting our ducks in a row." 
Speaking at Mr. Weinstein's TriBeCa offices seven blocks north of the trade center site, Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Dolan said the city was still reeling emotionally and economically from the attacks. "We want to make a statement that we are alive, we are well -- that this is the most attractive, highest-profile city in the world," Mr. Dolan said. "This is not a damaged city."
While the New York contingent's fondest wish would be to move the entire event to New York, the president of the academy, Frank Pierson, seemed to rule out such a change.
But, he said, the academy was willing to listen to proposals seeking to increase the event's physical presence in New York -- which would complement the ceremony being held at the Oscars' new home, the Kodak Theater in Hollywood.
"Clearly, it is an interesting idea," Mr. Pierson said. "But moving the whole Oscar show to New York presents enormous problems with the contractual obligations we have with the Kodak Theater. Even splitting the show between the two cities would double the cost, while our television licensing fee remains the same."
Still, he suggested, the academy might be willing to find a compromise. "In our 75th year, and in the aftermath of 9/11, the role that New York has played in our industry has got to be recognized," he said. "Where that recognition will emanate from New York is a matter of economics."
New York City tourism officials estimate that playing host to a significant part of the Oscar events could bring tens of millions of dollars into the city. Officials including the governor stressed the symbolic importance of having the event.
"For the Oscars to choose to come here would be a very positive sign that the city is back, not just to where we have been, but that we are moving beyond that," Governor Pataki said. "New York is the media capital of the world, and having the Oscars would an important recognition of that." 
Mr. Pataki suggested that a one-time role might not be sufficient. "Once people do an event in New York," he said, "they want to come back again and again. Why not?"
Mr. Dolan and Mr. Weinstein said that holding at least part of the awards in New York would help television ratings because of the novelty.
And having events at either Radio City Music Hall or Madison Square Garden, both Cablevision properties that are being kept unbooked on Oscar night, March 23, could help alleviate the crowding at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood. The theater holds 3,100 people, many fewer than the cavernous Shrine Auditorium, where the Oscars had been presented and which held 5,600 people. Both Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden are larger than the Kodak Theater.
Losing all or part of the Oscars could have something of a negative effect on one piece of the Los Angeles economy. Phillip Anschutz, a Denver billionaire, built the Hollywood and Highland complex, which houses the Kodak Theater, at a cost of $94 million and is the key part of a $615 million effort to redevelop decaying parts of Hollywood. The Oscars are the signal event there.
An official at his company, the Anschutz Entertainment Group, did not return a call seeking comment. 
Mr. Dolan said he was willing for one night to rename his sites in New York the Kodak Radio City Music Hall and Kodak Madison Square Garden to address the matter of sponsorship. And Mr. Weinstein said, "This is not about taking away from Hollywood; this is about Hollywood helping New York." 
Both Mr. Dolan and Mr. Weinstein think they can build a constituency for the move in both Hollywood and New York. They pointed out that many of the biggest corporations in movie-making, like AOL Time Warner and the News Corporation, have headquarters in New York. Each pointed to last fall's Concert for New York as an example of how quickly a big event can come together.
They also suggested that the TriBeCa Film Festival, held in May, provided a huge boost to the downtown area by welcoming thousands of filmgoers who spent money in hard-pressed businesses near the World Trade Center site.
The founders of the TriBeCa festival, the producer Jane Rosenthal and Mr. De Niro, expressed support for turning the Oscars into a moveable feast. "It's a great idea -- a win-win for the academy, New York City and everyone involved," Mr. De Niro said in a statement.
The move to split the awards show is not without precedent. From 1953 to 1957, the show was simulcast from Los Angeles and New York. The effort came about after the studios jointly declined to finance the show, as they had in the past. NBC stepped in and provided funds, but wanted part of the show to emanate from New York. One of the Oscars' famous moments -- in 1953, when Shirley Booth tumbled to one knee while scrambling to the dais to receive a best actress award for "Come Back, Little Sheba" -- took place at the NBC Century Theater in New York.
"It was glitzy, it was glamorous, it was very New York," said Tom O'Neil, Oscar historian and author of "Movie Awards." "But when the studios started to fund the Oscars again in '58, they pulled the ceremony back to Los Angeles."
The economic value of the event, or a portion of the event, coming to New York is difficult to measure. Jonathan M. Tisch, chairman and chief executive of Loews Hotels and head of NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau, said he estimates that the Grammy Awards are worth $40 million. 
Mr. Tisch has been working with others to bring the national conventions of both the Democratic and Republican Parties to New York in 2004. He said that the city is recovering economically, with current hotel bookings on a par with the comparable period last year, but that room rates are down considerably.
"We look at the value as twofold," Mr. Tisch said. "One is to solidify our reputation as the entertainment capital of the world. And the other is the immediate return in terms of spending."
Mr. Weinstein of Miramax is amply familiar with the Oscars, his studio having been nominated for best picture 11 times in the last 10 years. Still, his influence on where the event is held clearly has limits.
"We don't want to deny New York's role in our industry," Mr. Pierson of the academy said. "But when it comes to the Oscars moving to New York, we have to almost say, 'Hey, hold on a minute, buster. Those awards belong to California.' "

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about efforts to bring part of the Academy Awards ceremony to New York next year misstated the ownership and construction cost of the Hollywood and Highland complex, which houses the Kodak Theater, current home of the Oscars. It was built by the TrizecHahn Company, not the Denver billionaire Phillip Anschutz; Mr. Anschutz's company, AEG, operates the theater. The complex cost $615 million, not $94 million.

HEADLINE: Revival for a Black Enclave in Pittsburgh

BYLINE: By LYNETTE CLEMETSON

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
Most people look puzzled when Steven Radney talks about moving from a quiet town south of Pittsburgh into the Hill District, one of the poorest, most beleaguered areas of the city. When they ask gingerly what he hopes to gain from the move, Mr. Radney answers, ''an experience.''
''When I look around here, I don't see it as it is,'' said Mr. Radney, a 29-year-old designer and engineer standing in front of an abandoned brick row house that he hopes to renovate. ''I see it as it could be, because I know what it was.''
 What it was was one of the nation's most prosperous predominantly black communities, and Mr. Radney is one of a growing group of middle-class blacks returning as part of a slow-brewing residential shift that some researchers call black gentrification. 
 It is a phenomenon playing out in various ways in other historic black enclaves around the country, like Harlem and parts of Washington and Chicago.
 Known to locals as simply The Hill, the 1.4-square-mile cluster of neighborhoods perched here above downtown Pittsburgh was home to jazz greats like Stanley Turrentine and Art Blakey and writers like August Wilson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright who has set many of his plays in the area.
 The Hill housed The Pittsburgh Courier, once the nation's most influential black weekly newspaper. It was home base for the Pittsburgh Crawfords, the Negro National League baseball team that fielded Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and Cool Papa Bell. Referring to The Hill's heyday of 1930 to 1950, the Harlem Renaissance poet Claude McKay called the district ''the crossroads of the world.'' 
 But political and social change pitched The Hill into a downward spiral. Hopping joints where legends like Duke Ellington jammed until dawn deteriorated into crumbling shells. Corners that hummed with commerce descended to the drone of drug addicts and dealers. That more recent image of The Hill was said to inspire Stephen Bochco when he created the police drama ''Hill Street Blues'' in the 1980's.
 Now black professionals like Mr. Radney, who grew up in the suburbs of Cleveland, are part of a push to recapture some of The Hill's colorful past. More than 500 new residents have come into the neighborhood in the last five years: retirees, families, corporate employees, teachers, artists, athletes -- most of them black.
 ''We've diluted our strength moving to far-out places,'' said Justin Laing, 32, a program director at a nonprofit organization, who grew up in Silver Spring, Md., and who recently bought a house in The Hill with his wife, Bonnie, and two children. ''I figure, we're black, we might as well face it and try to rebuild our communities from a position of strength.''
 Whites and other ethnic groups are also looking at the area. Black residents say they welcome the diversity. But for many blacks, who say they have borne the burden of integration -- moving into white neighborhoods only to have whites leave -- rebuilding The Hill on their own terms has special significance.
 ''This is about rewriting the notion of progress and success, of race and space,'' said Monique Taylor, an associate professor of sociology at Occidental College in Los Angeles, who recently completed a book on black gentrification in Harlem. ''It is a statement that some of our ideas about how to make racial progress are stagnant.''
 The process, if hopeful, is far from easy. There are concerns that new development will homogenize the character of the district and squeeze out the poor. Class differences play out daily. Poorer residents complain about stuck-up newcomers. Middle-class residents worry about sending their children to area schools.
 But the cross-section of people is reminiscent of the district at its creative and intellectual height. A critical stopping point in the early 1900's for migrants in search of work on the railroads and in coal and steel mills, The Hill was, at the turn of the last century, a rich ethnic stew of blacks, Jews, Irish, Italians, Lebanese, Syrians and other groups. By 1930, fueled by the rush of black Southern migrants hungry for opportunity in the North, the neighborhood had become predominantly black.
 Black doctors, lawyers and business owners gathered in prestigious social associations and set up social service agencies to help the poor. People from all classes met at neighborhood hot spots. There were haircuts and gossip at Woogie's Crystal Barber Shop, $1.25 steak dinners at The Crawford Grill, sweet potato pie at Nesbitt's Pie Shop, late night jazz at the Savoy Ballroom and weekly salvation at dozens of churches. 
 The atmosphere was chronicled in black and white by Charles Harris, The Courier's renowned photographer who was known as Teenie and shot more than 80,000 pictures of life in the district.
 ''The Hill was a conglomeration of everything and everybody,'' said Robert R. Lavelle, 86, who oiled presses at The Courier as a young man before founding a real estate agency, which has operated in The Hill for more than 50 years. ''It was black people running their own lives, and we loved and cherished it because it was all we had.''
 Much of the neighborhood's spirit was crushed -- literally -- in the mid-1950's when the city demolished the lower part of The Hill as part of an urban renewal project, displacing 8,000 residents. The destruction was carried on by the 1968 riots, the crack epidemic of the 1980's and the steady outflow of middle-class blacks to other neighborhoods.
 By 1990 The Hill's population had plunged to slightly more than 15,000 from more than 50,000 in 1950. Most of the remaining residents were poor and living in public housing.
 Since the mid-1990's, more than $300 million in government and private money has been committed to tear down dilapidated buildings, rebuild public housing and provide upscale housing. The diversity in development reflects a mix of aspirations.
 Margo Roberson, 35, a flight attendant from Kentucky, moved into The Hill last year with her husband, Erik, who has a window-blind cleaning company. The Robersons own a 2,300-square-foot home in Crawford Square, a $34 million development that combines market-rate and subsidized housing.
 Taneika Hillman, 30, born and raised in a Hill District housing project, rents a two-bedroom apartment in the same development, through a low-income housing assistance program, for herself and her 8-year-old son, Michael.
 Crawford Square, which has grown to more than 400 households since the first residents arrived in 1993, provides both families with unique comforts. The Robersons can prepare fancy parties in their stainless-steel kitchen. They can also get home-cooked soul food and old stories from Mrs. Barney Moye, a grandmother figure who lives around the corner.
 For Ms. Hillman, Crawford Square provides a safe environment and positive images for her son. 
 ''We swim in the same pool, use the same fitness room as doctors and lawyers and teachers,'' she said, standing in front of an American flag near her doorway and a picture of Uncle Sam, whose face she and Michael have colored brown. ''Michael thinks it's just natural, like he can be just like them.''
 But Crawford Square, and other new and soon-to-be-built developments like it, are also a source of tension. People complain that the complexes look like the suburbs plopped down in the city. Others fear subsidies for low-income residents will be phased out, and that rising prices will eventually squeeze the poor out of the market. A single-family home in the development recently sold for $310,000, blocks away from homes that would have sold for tens of thousands five years ago.
 Many people also worry that while most residents are black, they are not the primary stakeholders.
 ''A multimillion-dollar development is only going to turn into a multimillion-dollar ghetto if you don't create an economic base and social structure whereby residents can control it on their own,'' said James F. Henry, executive director of The Hill House Association, a social service agency that has operated in the area for more than 30 years.
 The city's Urban Redevelopment Authority, which carried out the 1950's plan that demolished the lower Hill, controls roughly 70 percent of the district's main business corridor. Though it has financed much of the new residential property, its plan to tear down the Ellis Hotel, a once-favorite haunt of musicians that had previously been a Y.W.C.A. for Negro women, has inflamed old resentments.
 ''The character of this neighborhood is what gave Stanley the juice, gave August the juice, gives me the juice,'' said Jorge Myers, 44, a local artist who boards up crack houses and creates sculptures and paintings from their decaying structures. ''The government and these developers are taking away our juice.'' 
 Increasing black ownership, many believe, will ease tensions. The Hill Community Development Corporation is spearheading a project to refurbish the New Granada theater, a 1927 art deco building once known for its 12-cent movies and now a historic landmark. 
 Macedonia Baptist Church, with a growing population of black professionals, has bought 32 properties in the last five years to convert to places of worship, counseling centers and low-income housing.
 ''The Hill is Jericho Road,'' said the Rev. Jason Barr Jr., Macedonia's pastor. ''Every day there is a challenge and opportunity to be a Good Samaritan.''
 Amid the growing sense of optimism, The Hill is still rife with despair. ''Ain't none of this got nothing to do with me,'' said one young man, who declined to give his name, as he walked down one of neighborhood's more tattered streets.
 But plenty of residents say they believe such attitudes can be turned around. Last month, a throng of neighborhood residents turned out for the ribbon-cutting of The Hill's newest office complex, One Hope Square. Irvin E. Williams, the project's developer, was born and raised in The Hill, and he and his wife, Janicee, have filled the building with businesses committed to the neighborhood's success.
 As painters applied finishing touches to shops and offices, patrons streamed into the first store open for business, the Sittin' Pretty Salon and Day Spa. Owned by Fletcher and Shenita Jones, both raised in Hill District housing projects, the spa's walls reflect the tapestry of the neighborhood.
 In the barber's station hangs an old Teenie Harris photo of Woogie's Crystal Barbershop. In the shop's rear room is a painting by Jorge Myers made from the windowpane of a former crack house. Under the picture is a massage table -- for The Hill's newer residents who expect such luxuries and the longtime residents who have dreamed of them.
 ''This is it, our whole story, all right in here,'' said Mr. Jones, 31. The next chapters in The Hill's story remain a work in progress.

HEADLINE: THINK TANK; 
The Ancient Art of Haranguing Has Moved To the Internet, Belligerent as Ever

BYLINE:  By Emily Eakin 

 BODY:
"The pamphlet is a one-man show," observed George Orwell approvingly. "One has complete freedom of expression, including, if one chooses, the freedom to be scurrilous, abusive and seditious; or, on the other hand, to be more detailed, serious and 'highbrow' than is ever possible in a newspaper or in most kinds of periodical."
 But Orwell, who pamphleteered on behalf of unpopular leftist causes, was not optimistic about the genre's prospects in an era dominated by newspapers devoted to what he perceived as an increasingly narrow range of mainstream opinion. "At any given moment there is a sort of all-prevailing orthodoxy, a general tacit agreement not to discuss some large and uncomfortable fact," he lamented in 1948. 
 It seems Orwell may have been underestimating contemporary society. If he had lived to surf the Internet, for example, he might have been cheered to discover a flourishing new breed of pamphleteer: the blogger. Like its ink-and-paper antecedent, blogging is quick and cheap. Anyone with access to a Web site can post a weblog (or blog) linking readers to other online sources and promoting all manner of original opinion -- serious, scurrilous, seditious and otherwise.
Today, according to Cameron Marlow, a doctoral student in electronic publishing at the Media Lab at M.I.T. and the creator of a weblog index, Blogdex, the number of blogs -- liberally defined -- has probably passed the half-million mark. That's up from just a few dozen five years ago, a spike that blog watchers say owes much to the events of Sept. 11, which spawned a whole new subgenre: the war blog. And while most online harangues presumably lack the public profile and scathing eloquence of history's most redoubtable pamphleteers (a typical passage from one of Milton's famous antiprelatical tracts, for example, refers to the Anglican church service as "the new-vomited paganism of sensual idolatry"), some bloggers, including the neoconservative journalist Andrew Sullivan, (Andrewsullivan.com), and Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee (InstaPundit.com), routinely draw more than 20,000 visitors a day and get cited by the mainstream press.
But the surest sign that blogging is no longer just a para-journalistic phenomenon is academic recognition: this fall, the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley is inaugurating a course that uses weblogs to investigate current debates over intellectual property.
"We wanted to explore a serious issue using a novel medium, " said Paul Grabowicz, director of new media programming at the school and a co-teacher of the course. "When you have journalists sitting down to write a weblog, what happens to objectivity? Obviously, a weblog is far more interactive. It starts to mix journalists and their sources together. Then you have those people responding to postings on weblogs: What do you do with those?"
The war on terrorism may be giving new life to the old-fashioned pamphlet as well. This winter, "9-11," a stinging indictment of American foreign policy packed into a 125-page, pocket-size pamphlet by the M.I.T. linguist Noam Chomsky, became a best seller in five countries, setting a new sales record for the Open Media pamphlet series published by Seven Stories Press. Begun during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 by a pair of Rutgers University graduates hawking Xeroxed copies of an antiwar tract on New York City street corners, the Open Media pamphlets now appear as glossy bound little books on hot-button topics -- terrorism, the Middle East, civil liberties -- by scholars like the radical historian Howard Zinn. 
And now Open Media has some competition: the Prickly Paradigm Press, a scholarly pamphlet series begun by a pair of British anthropologists in 1993 as the Prickly Pear Press and recently revived by the American anthropologist Marshall Sahlins. Mr. Sahlins raised money from friends and family to take over the series and convinced the University of Chicago Press to act as its distributor.
To celebrate its new incarnation, the renamed Prickly Paradigm is issuing five 50-page polemics this month on subjects ranging from the West's relationship to war to the unlikely affinities between left-wing cultural studies scholars and libertarian Wall Streeters. In "War of the Worlds: What About Peace?," Bruno Latour, a French theorist, argues that to achieve world peace the West must first acknowledge that it has long been at war, albeit covertly, a war masquerading as the "peaceful extension of Western natural Reason" to "the many Empires of Evil." 
Other pamphlet writers reserve their ammunition for particular academic disciplines. In "Waiting For Foucault, Still," Mr. Sahlins tackles the theoretical excesses of anthropologists. In "New Consensus for Old: Cultural Studies From Left to Right," the critic Thomas Frank does the same for the field of cultural studies. By the 1990's, Mr. Frank contends, facile "cult stud" arguments about the "subversive potential" of a television sitcom or the "counter-hegemonic" impact of shopping malls had come to look uncomfortably like the market populism promoted by the pro-business right: both groups appear to equate consumerism with democratic self-expression.
Then there is Deirdre McCloskey's "Secret Sins of Economics." Ms. McCloskey, a professor of economics, history and English at the University of Illinois at Chicago, accuses her colleagues of producing endless thoerems and statistics that have nothing to do with the real world. "Imagine that instead of doing economic history about English agriculture in the 13th century, you were to do an economic history about an imaginary place," Ms. McCloskey explained in a telephone interview. "What would be the point of that? An economics department ought not to be about speculation and hypothetical worlds."
Of course, in today's media-saturated environment, these latest endeavors can hardly expect to sway opinion the way the pamphlet did in its glory days, the 17th and 18th centuries, when master rhetoricians like Milton, Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift and Thomas Paine regularly swamped the public sphere with two-penny treatises on burning social issues. (Published in January 1776, Paine's "Common Sense" sold half a million copies within a few months and is credited with transforming untold numbers of ambivalent colonists into ardent revolutionaries.) 
Ms. McCloskey said she had jumped at the chance to write a pamphlet for Prickly Paradigm when Mr. Sahlins, an old poker-playing friend, asked her to contribute. "We really need some place between the formal journal article -- mainly used for academic promotion -- and the book,"she said. 
But she confessed that she doubted whether her pamphlet would have much of an impact on her discipline. "I ought to have called myself Cassandra," she said ruefully. "I'm a student of the rhetoric of economics. You'd think that a student of that would realize that people aren't persuaded just because you have the correct argument."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Close Out Vigorous Week In Quiet Fashion

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
After surging sharply in the previous three sessions, the stock market finished its best week since September yesterday with stocks mixed but modestly higher.
 The 33-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial average was enough to push it to its highest level since the market fell to five-year lows last month. Its 5.2 percent rise for the week was the best since September. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 3 points and finished the week up 5.1 percent, also its best performance since September. Although the the Nasdaq composite index slipped 10 points, it ended the week up 4.7 percent, its strongest showing since May. 
 Yesterday's small moves were in sharp contrast to the tumultuous ups and downs of the rest of this week and previous weeks. Daily trading volume was just more than half the average for the last three weeks. After the three main market gauges dropped 3 percent on Monday, they surged on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with the Dow and the S.& P. 500 rising 2 percent or more each day. The Nasdaq had one 4 percent surge.
While investors may have been taking a break after this wild ride, they also had plenty of reminders yesterday of the troubled financial plight of some companies and the accounting manipulations at others. And they also may be looking ahead to next week, when Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Tuesday to consider their next move on interest rates. While most analysts do not expect the Fed to cut rates, no action could rattle investors if they decide to focus again on recent data that indicate a slowing economy.
"The stock market rally is partly a rally on the sense that the Fed will ease" monetary policy, said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.
Conseco, the financial services company, announced before the market opened yesterday that it would stop paying interest on its bonds while it tries to restructure its finances. Gary C. Wendt, Conseco's chief executive, said, "Our judgment is that the continued gradual financial restructuring that was the goal of the turnaround plan is no longer the best course." Shares of Conseco, which closed on Thursday at 34 cents, down more than 98 percent from the Wendt-era peak of $20.24, were not allowed to trade after the announcement.
WorldCom announced late Thursday that it had found an additional $3.3 billion in accounting irregularities, on top of the $3.8 billion in improperly recorded expenses that drove the company into bankruptcy protection last month. Shares of WorldCom fell to 10.9 cents yesterday from 12.4 cents on Thursday.
On the positive side, the government reported yesterday that worker productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the second quarter, a bigger increase than was forecast. That could be a good sign for corporate earnings. Companies have two main options now for improving their profits, cutting costs or increasing productivity.
At the close, the Dow was up 33.43, or 0.4 percent, to 8,745.45, just above the recent high of 8,736.59 reached on July 31. The S.& .P 500 climbed 3.18 points, or 0.4 percent, to 908.64. The Nasdaq was down 10.40 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,306.12.
In the bond market, yields fell and prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 4.26 percent, from 4.40 percent on Thursday, while the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 1 2/32 , to 100 28/32 . The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.11 percent from 5.23 percent; its price rose 1 22/32 , to 103 28/32 .
Despite this week's rally in stocks, individual investors still appear leery about them and continue to take money out of stock mutual funds. According to AMG Data Services, there was a net outflow from equity funds of $1.9 billion in the week ended Wednesday. For the month of July, the net outflow was $40.9 billion, the worst month since AMG began collecting data in 1992.
Since the market hit five-year lows on July 23, stocks have rallied, sold off and rallied again, giving a stronger sign that a bottom for the market has finally been found.
But this second rebound may be challenged by the Fed meeting. Policy makers will consider whether their benchmark short-term interest rate should be lowered because of recent signs that the recovery from last year's recession is slowing. It was fear of a slowing economy -- or even the threat of a recession -- that stopped the first stock rally, which ran from July 24 to July 31.
The signs of a weakening recovery, including anemic second quarter growth and slowdowns in both the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy in July, have led several Wall Street firms to predict that the Fed will cut rates in the months ahead.
But Mr. Berner of Morgan Stanley predicted that the Fed would cut its interest rate target, now at a 40-year low of 1.75 percent, by half a percentage point on Tuesday.
"The reason is that we are dealing with a crisis of confidence," he said. The signs of consumer hesitation on spending, including weak airline bookings and electronic sales, are very worrisome, he said. Referring to Fed policy makers, he said, "I believe they think if they move, they have to move more dramatically than a quarter-point cut."
But most Wall Street analysts think the Fed will wait until September to cut rates. They are predicting that the Fed policy makers will, instead, send a signal in their post-meeting announcement that the central bank is ready to reduce rates in the near future, especially if economic indicators continue to be weak.
Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients, said he thought a Fed rate cut could be interpreted as a sign that policy makers think the economy is even weaker than the current data indicates. If investors believe that, stock prices could be pushed lower.

HEADLINE: A Return to Profitability; 
Big Recall Behind It, Tire Maker Regains Its Footing

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON with MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Japan's major tire maker, the Bridgestone Corporation, was staggering from a huge, embarrassing recall of Firestone tires that threatened to crush its American subsidiary. Today, Bridgestone reported strong profits for the first half of the year, and said for the first time that it expected its American operations to turn a profit for the year.
 Though Bridgestone is still grappling with stiff industry competition and the uncertain economic outlook in its main markets, executives celebrated today a return to stability that few analysts thought possible in 2000. "The recovery has been remarkable," said Michael K. Gorey, chief financial officer of the company's American arm, Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holdings. 
 The positive results came on the second anniversary of the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, most of them installed on Ford Explorers and other sport-utility vehicles, after safety authorities linked the tires to a series of fatal accidents. 
The recall and surrounding recriminations set off a bitter fight by Bridgestone and Ford Motor over responsibility for the crashes.
The dispute destroyed the 94-year relationship of the companies, and it helped spur the removals of chief executives at Ford and at Bridgestone's American arm. Analysts said at the time that Bridgestone would probably have to scrap the Firestone brand and spend years slowly building a new identity in the United States.
The company did neither. Instead, it reorganized its American operations, retaining Firestone as a mass-market brand but putting greater emphasis on Bridgestone as a premium brand. And as its contracts with Ford expire unrenewed this year, Bridgestone is shifting away from sales to carmakers and concentrating on the consumer market, where it can make more on each sale. (Carmakers typically pay about half the retail price for the tires they buy.)
Mr. Gorey said today that Bridgestone's gross margins on American tire sales had jumped by 7 percent, a figure he called "unbelievably large" in the tire market, where margins are generally thin. Sales in America recovered somewhat in the first half of 2002 from the depressed levels of 2001, and the company now expects full-year revenues of $7.6 billion and profits of $50 million in the United States, it said today. 
Mr. Gorey gave credit for the rebound to Bridgestone's dealers and distributors, who praised the company for its candor and vigor in dealing with the Firestone crisis. "They handled everything as professionally as any company that I've ever seen," said Richard P. Johnson, president of American Tire Distributors in Huntersville, N.C. American Tire supplies retail dealers through 62 wholesale outlets and sells about 1.7 million Bridgestone and Firestone tires a year. When the problems with the Firestone tires arose, "they said, 'We'll take care of it, and we'll take care of you,' " Mr. Johnson said of Bridgestone.
The rebound in the United States was, in turn, crucial to Bridgestone's improved results worldwide, executives said.
Bridgestone is dominant in its home market, making two out of every five tires sold in Japan, but growth there has been flattened by the country's extended economic weakness.
The company depends on the United States for 40 percent of its sales; it reported a small net loss there of $14 million for the first half, but nothing like the huge recall-related setbacks of past years, so the company as a whole earned 24.5 billion yen ($203 million) in the period ended June 30. 
With its Ford business falling away, Bridgestone shut a plant in Decatur, Ill., and set a goal of reducing its reliance on sales to carmakers, which accounted for 40 percent of its business before the Firestone recall, to just 30 percent.
But it cannot afford to forsake sales to automakers entirely because when American consumers replace their tires, they buy the same brand that originally came with their car at least one-third of the time, industry figures show. 
Nor can the American carmakers afford to drop Bridgestone. They have much to gain from keeping it in balanced competition with Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Michelin, their other two main suppliers, both to hold prices down and to make substitutions easier if problems develop with tires in the future.
"The car companies want a diverse group of tire suppliers, and Bridgestone tires are viewed as relatively solid," said Stephen Girsky, an auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. "As things have calmed down on the Firestone front, it's an opportunity to rebuild." 
The chief executive of the American unit, John Lampe, and William Clay Ford Jr., chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor, have hinted at a reconciliation in recent months.
Mr. Ford, whose mother is from the Firestone founding family, mentions the tire company's founder, Harvey Firestone, in Ford's current TV ad campaign. But Shigeo Watanabe, chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone, said that though the companies have been in contact, they have made no decisions about their future relationship. 
Its relations with other carmakers are more fruitful. Nissan Motor recently chose Bridgestone tires for its latest ZX sports car, and General Motors uses Bridgestones on cars made by its Saturn division.
But the company has suffered from rising materials costs, from adverse shifts in the yen-dollar exchange rate and from a trend toward smaller cars in Japan, where new car sales have fallen for 11 straight months.
"The Japanese market has turned out to be a basket case," said Chris Redl, who covers the company for UBS Warburg in Tokyo. "This is significant for Bridgestone because they have so much market share here."

HEADLINE: Productivity Rise Is Tied to Agility OfEmployers In Rapid Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
By cutting back the hours of workers without reducing the workload, employers pushed up the nation's annual growth rate of productivity by 1.1 percent in the second quarter, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday.
 Though the gain was not particularly strong, it was higher than most forecasters had expected and appeared to demonstrate how skilled the private sector has become in responding rapidly to a fall-off in demand and a flattening out of production. Rather than keep idle employees on the payroll, companies now lay them off and cut overtime so quickly that output per hour in the second quarter continued to rise despite almost no increase in production. 
 The production of goods and services rose by an almost imperceptible 0.3 percent, while the hours needed to produce such output fell by 1.1 percent, the bureau said. Employees still on the job worked faster. Even so, unit labor costs -- the wages and benefit payments needed to produce, say, a loaf of bread or to launder a shirt -- rose by a mild 2.4 percent after having fallen in the two previous quarters. 
But what distinguished the second quarter, economists said, was the rapid adjustment to falling demand as a nascent recovery from recession showed signs of weakening.
Demand briefly surged in the first quarter, and executives dealt with it by increasing production while cutting back on workers and hours. Because people worked faster and more efficiently to increase production without working more hours, the productivity growth rate shot to 8.6 percent at an annual rate.
"It is easy in the United States," said Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, "to get sharp and sudden declines in hours by laying off workers and eliminating overtime, and this contributes to healthy productivity growth in hard times."
Productivity, which measures how much a worker produces in an hour, matters. The greater the output and the revenue from selling the extra output, the more opportunity workers have to share in their efficiency through raises.
In the past, when times were hard, the raises dried up but companies were more reluctant to shed workers and cut hours. Productivity suffered, and, as a result, so did profit. Profit no longer shrinks as much now that companies are quicker to cut labor costs by shedding workers and hours. That, in fact, is what has happened as the economy struggles to recover from recession.
"You need to generate jobs eventually," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's, "and I think that will happen once demand grows more rapidly than workers can increase their output through greater productivity."
The second-quarter number provided more evidence that the nearly generation-long stagnation in productivity growth had ended. The stagnation lasted from 1973 to 1995, and then, in the late 1990's, productivity surged.
Some economists greeted the improvement as evidence that a new high-technology economy had raised business to a higher level of efficiency. But others wondered whether the improvement was a flash that would fade once the stock market bubble burst and the nation passed through a fresh cycle of recession and recovery, as it has been doing for the last 18 months. 
The message in the productivity report released yesterday was that some of the late 1990's improvement has indeed stuck, even after the numbers were adjusted to account for downward revisions in output and in economic growth in recent quarters. The revisions meant that productivity growth, instead of rising at 3.3 percent in 2000 and 1.9 percent last year, as previously announced, rose 2.9 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, the bureau reported yesterday.
Still, productivity benefited from the rapid spread of computers in the 90's and the introduction of innovative technologies, many economists contend. As a result of the enhanced efficiency, the productivity growth rate will probably settle at an average of 2 percent a year over the next decade, Mr. Wyss says. His 2 percent estimate is becoming the consensus view among economists. 
There are skeptics, of course, among them Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. "My guess is that when the dust settles, you will have seen a pickup in the latter half of the 90's that has continued to this day," he said, "but that does not mean it is sustainable. It simply may reflect a shift from a pre-Internet to a post-Internet world, which implies replacement of one technology with another and, during that transition, higher productivity."
If the consensus view turns out to be correct, a 2 percent growth rate would mean a more rapid rise in living standards than was possible from 1973 to 1995, when the productivity growth averaged only 1.5 percent a year.

PERSON: Edsger Wybe Dijkstra 

HEADLINE: Edsger Dijkstra, 72, Physicist Who Shaped Computer Era 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
Edsger Wybe Dijkstra, whose contributions to the mathematical logic that underlies computer programs and operating systems make him one of the intellectual giants of the field, died on Monday at his home in Nuenen, the Netherlands. He was 72.
 The cause of death was cancer, said officials at the University of Texas, where Dr. Dijkstra held the Schlumberger centennial chair in computer sciences from 1984 to 1999, when he retired. 
 Dr. Dijkstra is best known for his shortest-path algorithm, a method for finding the most direct route on a graph or map, and for his work as the co-designer of the first version of Algol 60, a programming language that represented one of the first compiler programs that translates human instructions.
The shortest-path algorithm, which is now widely used in global positioning systems and travel planning, came to him one morning in 1956 as he sat sipping coffee on the terrace of an Amsterdam cafe.
It took him three years to publish the method, which is now known simply as Dijkstra's algorithm. At the time, he said, algorithms were hardly considered a scientific topic.
Of even greater importance was his solution to what he originally called the dining quintuple problem, but which later became known as the dining philosophers' problem.
He conceived of the problem faced by five philosophers sitting around a table, each with a bowl of rice and a single chopstick. Because eating requires two chopsticks, the challenge was to find an equitable method that would permit all of those at the table to eat without having anyone starve or having the entire table face deadlock. Dijkstra's original solution ensured that each diner took turns using a pair of chopsticks.
The problem has applicability to both computer operating systems and to network design. 
Several years after Dr. Dijkstra solved the problem, he was surprised to learn that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology designers of the pioneering Multics operating system had not grappled successfully with the issue of deadlock. The consequence was that on occasion their system would abruptly halt.
"You can hardly blame M.I.T. for not taking notice of an obscure computer scientist in a small town in the Netherlands," he was quoted as saying in "Out Of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists."
Dr. Dijkstra, an advocate of an approach known as structured programming, wrote a short research note in the March 1968 edition of the journal Communications of the ACM that became legendary. Titled "The GO TO Considered Harmful," it argued against the complexity of a feature in programming languages like Fortran and Basic that permitted programmers to write convoluted programs that jump around haphazardly.
A theoretical physicist by training, early in his career he observed that many problems required extensive calculation and so in the early 1950's he taught himself how to program.
In March 1952 he took a part-time job at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, immersing himself in the challenges of instructing the primitive computers of the era.
When he married in 1957, the Dutch marriage rites required that he state his profession and he attempted to say he was a programmer. The municipal authorities in Amsterdam did not accept his answer on the ground that there was no such profession. As a result, his marriage certificate described his profession as "theoretical physicist."
He was born May 11, 1930, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. His father was a chemist and his mother was a mathematician. In 1942, at 12, Dr. Dijkstra entered an elite high school where he studied classical Greek and Latin, French, German, English, biology, mathematics, physics and chemistry. During the German occupation his parents sent him away for a brief period to the countryside. He earned degrees in mathematics and theoretical physics from the University of Leyden and a Ph.D. in computing science from the University of Amsterdam.
He worked as a programmer at the Mathematical Center from 1952 to 1962, taught mathematics at Eindhoven University of Technology from 1962 to 1984 and was a research fellow at the Burroughs Corporation from 1973 to 1984.
Dr. Dijkstra was the recipient of many awards, notably the Association for Computing Machinery's prestigious Turing Award in 1972.
He is survived by his wife of more than 40 years, Maria C. Debets Dijkstra, who is known as Ria; three children, Marcus, Femke and the computer scientist Rutger M. Dijkstra; and by two grandchildren.
Throughout Dr. Dijkstra's career, his work was characterized by elegance and economy. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether mathematics was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Invoking Corporate Greed

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
 The campaign of Andrew M. Cuomo, the former housing secretary and a Democratic candidate for governor in the Sept. 10 primary, said it planned to broadcast a new commercial beginning today in the New York City region. Another commercial, a negative advertisement in response to what his campaign considers political attacks from his opponent, H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, is also scheduled to be broadcast today.

PRODUCER -- Squier, Knapp and Dunn.

ON THE SCREEN -- A long corporate banquet table. The camera moves past expensive-looking silver candlesticks, china, caviar, half-eaten meals. Shots of place cards with the names of corporations caught up in fraud scandals, including WorldCom, Adelphia and Tyco International. Money is scattered around the table.

THE SCRIPT -- Announcer: The economic devastation of corporate greed. Executives cooked books to get fat bonuses, as employees lost their jobs and life savings. $400 million in state pension funds lost.

Andrew Cuomo: New York can no longer afford business as usual. As a member of President Clinton's cabinet, I stood up to mortgage rip-offs, gun manufacturers -- even the K.K.K. As governor, I won't do business with companies that don't provide full disclosure. We'll protect pensions and put C.E.O.'s who lie in jail. New times need new leadership.

ACCURACY -- The $400 million refers to State Retirement Fund losses from investments in Enron, WorldCom and Global Crossing. All investors in those companies suffered losses, though independent analysts have given the comptroller's office high marks for its financial strategy. The other claims are supported by press releases from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Ku Klux Klan reference derives from the 2000 settlement of a civil suit filed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development against a self-described chaplain of United Klans of America who was accused of harassing a social worker who helped people file housing discrimination complaints.

SCORECARD -- Mr. Cuomo takes a subtle swipe at his opponent with the reference to the state pension fund that Mr. McCall oversees, but it is doubtful that all but the most astute viewers will catch it. But the commercial does provide an effective way to promote one of Mr. Cuomo's main campaign issues, corporate responsibility, which Democrats across the country believe will resonate with voters fed up with the near-daily torrent of news reports about fraud. It remains to be seen, however, if this issue will energize voters and endear them to Mr. Cuomo, who is fighting negative impressions among voters, according to several public opinion polls. Mr. Cuomo also seems to make a play for minority voters, considered Mr. McCall's base, with his reference to fighting the K.K.K. RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

HEADLINE: Shifting Colombia's Aid: U.S. Focuses on Rebels 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
Just as a new president, Alvaro Uribe Velez, begins his term determined to combat Colombia's leftist guerrillas, the Bush administration has delivered a powerful new tool: authorization to use nearly $1.7 billion in American military aid directly against the rebels.
 Under a little-remarked provision in the antiterrorism package President Bush signed last week, President Uribe can now use dozens of American-supplied helicopters as well as Colombian soldiers who were trained by United States troops in operations against the rebels and also right-wing paramilitaries. Previous guidelines limited the use of the helicopters and soldiers to antidrug operations, restricting Colombia's armed forces from using some of its best equipment and troops to fight the rebels. 
 The policy shift, coming at a time of escalating guerrilla violence, represents a significant intensification of United States involvement in the long and intractable conflict in this country. This week the rebels launched a mortar attack here in the capital during Mr. Uribe's inauguration. 
The redirection of aid came after Colombian officials and their American supporters in Congress and the Bush administration argued that the change was part of the global campaign against terrorism. 
American troops will continue to be barred from participating in Colombia's 38-year-old conflict, but the package includes $6 million for an oil pipeline protection program that will involve the training of a new Colombian Army unit by American soldiers. The pipeline, which is crucial to Colombia's economy, is frequently bombed by rebels.
The legislation, part of a broad $28.9 billion supplemental package, says that military aid already provided to Colombia "shall be available" against "activities by organizations designated as terrorist organizations" by the State Department. Those organizations are identified as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest guerrilla group; the National Liberation Army, a smaller left-wing insurgency; and the nemesis of both, the right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, which is financed by landowners to battle the rebels. 
All three groups have drawn much of their financing from protecting or participating in the drug trade. Officials in Washington said the new guidelines take into account the reality that drugs and terrorism are combined in Colombia.
"There has been a mistake in trying to identify those who are in drugs and those that are not," said John Walters, the White House drug policy chief. A State Department official said the legislation "removes an ambiguity in the law." He explained that under previous guidelines American-trained troops using American helicopters could not attack a guerrilla column or stop a rebel attack. 
"That has all changed." Now they can go after guerrillas, he said, although the equipment and troops will still be used against drugs. "The equipment is now available for both," he said.
American congressional aides familiar with the legislation said the authorization goes into effect immediately. But there are requirements for Mr. Uribe, a technocrat who won election in May by promising to bring order to Colombia. Under the terms, which the government has accepted, it must devote more money to the army while establishing comprehensive policies to combat drugs, bring government authority to rural areas and ensure respect for human rights.
Colombian officials say the change greatly enhances the army's combat capability. Most of the benefits come from 53 helicopters, 14 of them high-tech Black Hawks, that Colombia's army has received as part of the $1.1 billion Plan Colombia aid package Washington approved in 2000. Another 19 helicopters, all of them Huey II's, will arrive by mid-fall.
The guidelines also mean that Colombia will be able to use a 3,000-man counterdrug brigade trained by American Special Forces directly against the rebels. The brigade has, until now, focused on securing dangerous, drug-controlled regions to allow crop dusters to fumigate without being attacked by rebel forces.
"It will give us more mobility, much more capacity, much more firepower," Francisco Santos, Mr. Uribe's vice president, said in an interview this week. " It helps to change the military balance, and it helps to contain the violent ones."
Bush administration officials emphasize that the equipment and American-trained troops will still primarily be used for counterdrug operations. Congress will decide if $500 million in military and police aid being proposed in 2003 can also be used directly against the rebels. Since 1999, the United States has provided Colombia with $1.7 billion in military aid, making this nation the third-largest recipient of American assistance.
The shift in policy has concerned human rights groups and some members of Congress, who say escalating violence may become a byproduct of the redirected aid.
But it became clear through spring and early summer that a growing number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill had sided with the Bush administration's call for a shift in tactics for two fundamental reasons. The antidrug fight here has not worked as planned, with coca plantings continuing to rise, and there was a general feeling that something drastic needed to be done to help Colombia battle the surging rebels.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee and a Vermont Democrat who has criticized American policy toward Colombia, said he supported the legislation because the new policy called for the aid to also be directed against the paramilitaries and requires that human rights conditions be met by Colombian units that use the assistance.
"It is what the majority of Congress is willing to support," he said.

HEADLINE: Reflective Mood Stills Breezy Summer Days 

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn., Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Martin Olivieri, a chemistry teacher, frets that America could be on the verge of war with Iraq. His brother-in-law, Ken Ricci, a computer consultant, nervously follows the stock market and wonders if he will find himself out of work when a contract ends in a few months. 
 Mr. Olivieri's companion, Elmar Lipp, worries about his immigration status as a German on a work visa. A cousin, Gina Barone, is saddened that security concerns mean no picnicking on the grounds of West Point. And relatives from Sicily almost canceled a summer holiday with the Olivieris living in the United States because of fear of terrorism. 
 Yet three generations of Olivieris gathered at Compo Beach here this week, coming together from the Bronx, Yonkers, Cross River, N.Y., and Italy. They grilled zucchini and peppers as the sky turned opalescent over the Long Island Sound. They laughed, swam and horsed around with the three Ricci children. They knew that the world was a scarier place than it had been a year ago, before the shock of Sept. 11 and the collapsing economy. But they still found summer sweet, and in some ways even sweeter. 
Mr. Lipp, stoking the grill with fresh charcoal, pondered whether the harrowing events of the past year had cast a pall over this most carefree of seasons. "Maybe it enhanced it," he said. "Private things matter more, the sense of calm and security we have as a family. This summer, we went twice to Tanglewood. Who knows what next year will be? So we must make use of our time, enjoy what there is to enjoy." 
For sure, this is a summer like no other for the Olivieris and others throughout the metropolitan region, where the loss of life in the World Trade Center attack touched so many and the jitters on Wall Street spared so few. People are staying closer to home, taking shorter trips and avoiding air travel. Movie attendance is up, and international travel is down. Whether on vacation or in the office, people are following the stock market and the news more closely -- or avoiding both altogether because it is too much to bear. 
The idea of a carefree summer seems a thing of the past to Sally Silvers, a choreographer who lives in the East Village and went on vacation this summer in Bermuda, where she had a one-week reprieve from the drumbeat of bad news, and in Cape May, N.J., where American flags flew everywhere. "Carefree doesn't seem to be on the horizon," Ms. Silvers said. "There's too much going on. I don't know when that's coming back, if ever."
This summer brought dislocations, major and minor, good and bad. 
Lisa Grenadier, sunbathing here at Compo Beach, in prosperous Fairfield County, said that her inheritance had dwindled to the point that her 13-year-old son's college fund and her own retirement savings were in jeopardy. Her husband, a writer, might have to take a teaching job, she said, and this could be her last summer lazing, jobless, on the beach. A vacation in Santa Barbara, Calif., was shorter than it might have been and was spent in a less expensive hotel than usual.
A canceled European vacation, "mainly because of the economy but also because we were a little skittish because of terrorism," opened new vistas for Deborah Dudley of Brooklyn, an art director for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in Lower Manhattan. Instead, Ms. Dudley, her husband and 2-year-old daughter made short trips to visit the grandparents and attended to family business -- writing wills and discussing powers of attorney, debating the timing of another child -- that felt more pressing after Sept. 11. 
Knowing she would be home all summer, Ms. Dudley also took a plot in a community garden, grew herbs and reawakened her interest in cooking. Planting and harvesting were a far cry from touring Germany and Ireland, her family's original plan. But the results were unexpectedly pleasant. "I would have focused on planning, traveling and recovering," Ms. Dudley said. "So in that sense, my summer was definitely easier and more relaxing."
Rosemary and Steve Halstead, who took early retirement from executive positions at Citibank and I.B.M., stayed home this summer so their college-age son did not turn their Westport home into "party central," Mrs. Halstead said. Still, the lessons of Sept. 11 made a miracle of a quiet day at Compo Beach. "What 9/11 said to me is that simple things are more important," she said. 
Her husband, looking up from a kayaking magazine, agreed. "It's easier now to pause and smell the roses rather than feel compulsive about having to go somewhere and do something," he said. "A lot of people who used to go, go, go all the time now find this more fulfilling." 
Not everyone found the changed contours of summer so pleasing. Teresa Rose Darcy, a florist from Edison, N.J., used to do things like take spontaneous trips to Hawaii with her daughter. Not in this bear market. Instead, she will soon be driving to Saratoga, N.Y., to visit family and go to the track, without betting. Overall, Ms. Darcy said, this season had a "darker feeling" than summers past. "There is all this bad news floating around that really can turn a good day bad," she said.
Several people commented that the patriotic holidays were celebrated with a new sincerity. Gina Barone, a parochial school teacher who is part of the Olivieri clan, said that the most significant difference this summer for her had been the Fourth of July. "People were so much more expressive," she said.
Maureen DeLouise of the Bronx, an administrative assistant for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, said that the annual Independence Day block party on Tomlinson Avenue had never been better attended. "It used to be, 'Oh, it's July Fourth, big deal,' " she said. "Now, to be an American, we're more aware of what those words mean." 
The stock market plunge, and the loss of faith in corporate leadership, seemed to weigh heavier on beachgoers here than fear of new terrorist attacks, perhaps because it was fresher in their minds and so personal in its consequences. But this week, when a spell of oppressive weather gave way to cloudless cobalt skies, it could have been Sept. 11 all over again. 
Ms. Grenadier was walking along the water here, as she had been that terrible morning when smoke blackened the sky between the Norwalk Islands. She felt the similarity between that day and this one before clear thoughts formed: The color of the sky. The slant of the light. The cool air on her skin. 
"You have these sense memories, and that is one that will live with us forever," she said. "We'll never be able to totally enjoy those beautiful cloudless days again."

HEADLINE: Turbulent Times for Airlines 

 BODY:
Last fall's $15 billion aid package for the nation's airline industry was a bold move within days of the Sept. 11 attacks to shore up the nation's transportation system. The $5 billion in grants helped airlines weather their unprecedented grounding, and the $10 billion loan guarantee program, by its mere creation, served as a form of terrorism insurance that helped airlines tap capital markets in subsequent months. 
 Almost a year later, it is important to remember that airlines were facing serious financial troubles well before Sept. 11. The government's extraordinary intervention was meant to address the attacks' aftermath, not to resolve all the industry's pre-existing woes. The Air Transportation Stabilization Board, with representatives from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the Transportation Department, must be guided by this principle as it assesses the applications filed by the June deadline. 
 The board should reject the application of United Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier, for a $1.8 billion guarantee. Though deeply troubled, United still has enough resources to pursue other options, and has not proposed to undertake enough cost-cutting measures to deserve a bailout. Other airlines have shown that it's possible to obtain private financing, and have not sought federal loan guarantees. Taxpayers should not be asked to give United an unfair competitive advantage. 
So far the board has proved a tough guardian of taxpayer interests, and it must now resist heavy Congressional lobbying on United's behalf. It has turned away a number of smaller airlines, and approved America West's request for a $360 million guarantee only after the carrier granted Uncle Sam an option to acquire a third of its stock. 
Last month US Airways, the most beleaguered of the major carriers, became only the second airline to obtain a loan guarantee, for $900 million. It was conditioned on the airline's labor unions' approving painfully deep but needed concessions, without which US Airways might founder. United's unions have not been willing to consider equally significant sacrifices. And unlike United, US Airways lacks unencumbered assets to help it secure private financing. 
United and US Airways also want to enter into a marketing alliance, one that regulators should allow. This page supported the airlines' proposed merger last year, which was blocked by the government. The industry's continuing troubles make the need for consolidation more apparent than ever.
Even after accounting for the federal aid, the airline industry lost a record $11 billion last year, and the tide of red ink is not yet ebbing. Currently, among the eight largest carriers, only low-cost Southwest Airlines is breaking even.
Passenger loads have not returned to their pre-Sept.-11 levels, and the economic slowdown has kept away the most profitable business travelers. But major airlines like United can also blame their unsustainable cost structures, and equally unrealistic pricing models, for their financial troubles. Regardless of the economic climate, the days are ending when airlines can automatically charge passengers not staying over a Saturday night five times more than those who do.
The industry is evolving into two tiers, with fewer coast-to-coast megacarriers and a greater number of nimble niche players, like the increasingly successful JetBlue, that are modeled after Southwest. These airlines are providing travelers with meaningful new choices and competitive fares. The government should not block this evolution.

Saratoga Yearling Sales Fall 44 Percent From '01

BYLINE:  By JASON DIAMOS 

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 9 

 BODY:
With gross sales down 44 percent from last year's record figures, almost everyone involved in this week's Fasig-Tipton Saratoga Selected Yearlings Sale agreed that the market was depressed this year. Not everyone agreed on why.
 "We are missing some stars at the top and missing some people, one in particular," Walt Robertson, the president of Fasig-Tipton, said, referring to the absence of foals from Seattle Slew, who died in early May, and Mr. Prospector, who died in 1999, as well as the death last month of Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, a leading buyer at the upper echelon of thoroughbred sales for years. 
 "And I think the economy is responsible for some people lowering their sights," Robertson added.
This year 140 horses sold for $35,242,000 during the three-day sales. Last year 162 horses sold for $62,412,000. The average price this year was $251,729, off 35 percent from last year's average of $385,259. This year's median price, $180,000, was down more than 23 percent from last year's median price of $235,000.
That continued a trend seen last month at the Keeneland select sales, where the average price, $481,184, was down more than 31 percent from last year's record average, $710,247, and where the median price declined about 29 percent, to $300,000 from $427,500.
"What has happened," the trainer D. Wayne Lukas said, "is that people have become much more sophisticated in their selection process, and have therefore become more critical of what they want to take a run at and what they want to leave alone. This was a great selection of horses. I think it was the best selection of horses they ever had. Having said that, I also think a lot of people zeroed in on 50 to 60 lots and the others suffered because of that."
Lukas purchased 11 yearlings for his owners, including a $950,000 colt by Forestry out of the Conquistador Cielo mare Alexandrina on Thursday night, the final night of the sales. Lukas had underbid on a son of Unbridled's Song that went to Aaron and Marie Jones for $1 million and a son of Grand Slam that went to John Oxley for $900,000.
A Storm Cat filly out of Sacahuista brought this year's highest single price, the $1.3 million paid by John Sikura on Wednesday. Last year a son of Storm Cat brought $3.3 million from Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.
Last year nine yearlings sold for $1 million or more. This year two did. Last year there were eight buyers who spent more than $2 million. This year there was one, Satish and Anne Sanan's Padua Stable of Ocala, Fla. That does not include the $3.8 million buyback of the full brother to Forestry that Robert Evans took back on Wednesday.
Duncan Taylor, whose family's Kentucky firm, Taylor Made, is one of the industry's leading consignors of horses for sale, said he felt the market was depressed this year "mostly at the very top end." Taylor Made had brought the Evans colt to the sale.
"There are not as many million-dollar horses," said Taylor, who pointed to the decline in the stock market, a cutback in Sheik Mohammed's activity and the death of the prince as reasons. "But the two hundred-, three hundred- and four hundred-thousand-dollar horses are still selling. So I think the industry itself is healthy."
Bill Farish, the president of Lane's End farm, one of the premier Kentucky breeding operations, agreed with Taylor.
"I think it is a little bit of a depressed market," Farish said. "The big Arab and Irish buyers have not been as active as they usually are, and that really hurts the top end of the market. But we've been happy with the middle market."
As for the absence of chart-topping purchases by the sheik and the bigger Irish buyers at this year's sale, Farish said, "They've focused in on a few very narrow type horses they look for." Horses, Farish said, with sires like Storm Cat and Sadler's Wells.
"Every sale can't have 15 Storm Cats," Robertson said. "Had we sold two horses for $3 million, what would our average have been then?"
Last year three horses sold for $3 million or more.
The trainer Nick Zito said he felt Fasig-Tipton had slightly compromised the August sales because of its July sales in Kentucky. "You've got 220-something horses in this sale, and out of that there were probably 10 outstanding horses," he said.
About the economy's impact on the sales, Zito said: "What is it that you read about in the papers every day? Criminals. Scandals. Which meant it wasn't real money to begin with."
There was real money here this week. It was just not spent in record numbers.

FINISH LINES

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks to Limit Environmental Law's Reach Over Coastal Waters 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is arguing that a major environmental law does not apply to the vast majority of oceans under United States control, a move that environmentalists say could allow military maneuvers, oil and gas pipelines, commercial fishing, ocean dumping and scores of other activities to escape public environmental review.
 In a federal court case in Los Angeles that involves the testing of a new type of sonar system by the Navy, the Justice Department said that the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 -- landmark legislation that requires federal agencies to review the environmental implications of their projects -- did not apply beyond the nation's territorial waters, which traditionally extend three miles from shore. 
 That view is being challenged by the Natural Resources Defense Council, which asserts that in addition to the territorial waters, the act covers all activity within the nation's "exclusive economic zone," which extends 200 miles from shore.
A decision in the case is expected later in the summer. 
Environmentalists say that barring application of the act in these zones would open up the oceans to unregulated activity that could damage them and destroy marine life.
In addition to the sonar project, which they say could disorient and kill whales and dolphins, they say other unregulated activity would include commercial fishing for depleted species, proposals for liquified natural gas plants and pipelines, and other energy projects.
Offshore oil and gas drilling would not be affected by the administration's position because another law, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, specifically requires that the environmental law apply to such activity.
At issue is the National Environmental Policy Act, often referred to as the Magna Carta of environmental law. Signed by President Richard M. Nixon on Jan. 1, 1970, the act requires all federal governmental actions to be reviewed and analyzed for their effect on the environment.
In an indication of the importance of the matter, the White House Council on Environmental Quality convened with ranking officials from five agencies and departments to discuss the implications of the Justice Department's position both before the department filed its brief and then again this week, administration officials said. They plan to discuss it further in September.
Administration officials said there was little disagreement at the meeting, which was first reported today by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, about the administration's approach. And the Justice Department has argued in the sonar case that federal agencies should decide case by case whether to apply the National Environmental Policy Act in the oceans.
But e-mail messages written before the meeting suggested that officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disagreed with the Navy.
One message written by a Navy official hailed the "good news" that the Justice Department agreed with the Navy, "over NOAA objection," that the environmental law "does NOT extend beyond the limits of our territorial waters."
Administration officials said that the Justice Department position and the meeting did not represent a change of policy, but environmentalists disagreed.
"This is a major policy change," said Andrew Wetzler, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Los Angeles. "For the first time, the White House is considering stepping in and seeking to impose the Navy's restrictive view of the statute on the entire federal government."
The Navy has long believed that the act does not extend to activities conducted within the nation's "exclusive economic zone," which stretches 200 miles off all coastal waters and thus covers more than one million square miles off all American coasts, including those of Alaska and Hawaii. The Navy appears to be the driving force behind the Bush administration's discussion of whether to apply that concept to all federal activity in the zone. 
Administration officials believe that the environmental act is too restrictive, that it spawns nettlesome lawsuits and that most ocean activity is already regulated by an executive order signed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, according to administration officials and internal e-mail correspondence that was obtained by environmental groups opposing the administration's view.
Environmental groups assert that the Carter executive order is too weak to guarantee enforcement. They say it does not provide for lawsuits or public review, meaning that an array of damaging activities could take place far out at sea without public knowledge or recourse.
Michael Jasny, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Los Angeles, said that the National Environmental Policy Act "depends on public comment and public scrutiny and judicial review for its effectiveness, and if you do away with it, all of that would be lost -- we'd have no public accountability" about military and industrial activities in the oceans.
Tim Eichenberg, a lawyer with Oceana, a group in San Francisco dedicated to preserving the oceans, called the executive order "a very poor cousin" to the policy act.
"The executive order doesn't provide for public input or any analysis of alternatives and it doesn't allow for judicial review -- there is no recourse for the public," he argued.
Administration officials said that their position in the California case did not represent a change of policy. They said that the National Environmental Policy Act, signed into law before the United States established its exclusive economic zones, was never intended to apply to the ocean beyond the territorial waters and did not apply now.
But an internal Navy document contradicts that view, noting that the Justice Department and the Council on Environmental Quality in the Clinton administration "pressed to apply N.E.P.A. worldwide."
Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of a subcommittee on oceans and fisheries, issued a statement saying: "I am incredulous that the Bush administration may actually be considering rolling back central environmental protections of our oceans and marine environment. The National Environmental Policy Act is the cornerstone of protection for our citizens and natural resources -- and new limits on the law would have profound impacts on coastal issues from fisheries management to marine protection to ocean dumping."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Mexico: Apple Dumping Duties 

BYLINE:  By Ginger Thompson (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Mexico's economic minister, Luis Ernesto Derbez, said the government would impose a 40 percent tariff on fresh apples imported from the United States because American growers were selling the fruit at unfairly low prices, hurting Mexican growers. Consuming $118 million worth a year, Mexico accounts for about 30 percent of American exports of fresh apples. Mr. Derbez also said that he would ask Congress to pass a law that would give President Vicente Fox a kind of fast-track authority to impose antidumping duties on other products.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Say Sharon Is Trying to Undercut U.S. Talks 

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
Palestinian officials today accused Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of trying to sabotage their talks in Washington with a tough speech on Thursday in which he called the Palestinian Authority "a gang of corrupt terrorists and assassins."
 Lashing back, the Palestinian cabinet secretary, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, called Mr. Sharon's government "a coalition of terror and a gang of killers." 
 "He wanted to intimidate the Americans and to warn them against reaching any agreement with the Palestinian delegation by describing the Palestinian Authority officials as people against peace," Mr. Abdel Rahman said. "If we are like that, why are we in the States, now exerting every possible effort to reach a way out?" 
A delegation appointed by Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader -- with whom President Bush says he will not deal -- met on Thursday with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. 
At the same time, Mr. Sharon went on national television with a speech that his advisers said was meant to prepare Israel for a long struggle.
"We can't hold talks with the gang of terrorists that is the Palestinian Authority," Mr. Sharon said. "Rooting them out is the only way to reach peace."
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a close adviser to Mr. Arafat, said today that Mr. Sharon's "declarations hamper international efforts to come back to the political process."
"Sharon's declarations are suitable to most Israeli officials who are war criminals and who must face international justice and be tried for the crimes they perpetrated against our people," Mr. Abu Rudeineh said.
Mr. Sharon's speech, Israeli political commentators said, was also meant to enhance his popularity, which has fallen recently.
Throughout the spring he was riding high in opinion polls, mainly because of his tough actions against the Palestinians, including the military incursion into West Bank areas ceded to Palestinian control under the Oslo accords of 1993 and 1995.
But polls published today in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot were headlined "Sharon Does Not Know How to Get Rid of Terrorism."
The numbers were grim. Does Sharon know how to eliminate the attacks? Yes, 36 percent; no, 60 percent. Since the Sharon government took office, who has been winning? Israel, 30 percent; Palestinians, 33 percent; neither, 30 percent. How long will the attacks last? A year, 28 percent; two years or more, 53 percent. Will attacks diminish? Diminish, 16 percent; increase, 67 percent.
"We are condemned to live with the terror attacks for years to come," Sever Plotzker wrote in the newspaper, summing up the poll. "Condemned to bleed and fear."
The mutual recriminations continued, too, over a breakdown in talks this week about a possible security plan to ease pressure on the Palestinians, whose economy and very lives have been disrupted by the Israeli takeover of the West Bank.
Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer has put forward what he calls the "Gaza first" plan, in which Palestinians would begin by taking responsibility for stopping attackers from entering Israeli by way of the Gaza Strip. But the Palestinians accuse the Israelis of reneging on an offer to extend the trial to a West Bank city, probably Bethlehem, which has been quiet.
Much of the wrangling is regarded as political posturing on both sides. Indeed, any such initiative would face internal opposition among the fragmented leadership on both sides. 
That is particularly true of the Palestinians. Mr. Arafat's decision to have his aides meet with the Israelis this week -- an apparent effort to reclaim his diminishing relevance -- is being criticized not only by the militants in groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad but also by his own base in Al Fatah.
The elements of a security plan have been endlessly rehashed, including the possibility of C.I.A. training of Palestinian security units or participation by intelligence agencies of Egypt and Jordan, both frowned on by human rights organizations. The difficulty with any such plan would be that it would require the Palestinians to be, in effect, the guarantors of Israel's security. Given the present emotional climate, that is an unlikely role.
On the ground here, today was what is now regarded as relatively quiet, with only one death, that of a 40-year-old Palestinian, Husni Damiri, shot by the Israeli Army in the Tulkarm refugee camp. 
As usual, accounts varied. Palestinians said he had been standing in his doorway when the Israelis imposed a curfew. The Israeli Army spokesman said soldiers had been shooting at a group of armed men when he was hit.
But nerves remained raw. The Israeli newspapers have been filled for days with speculation that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq might supply Palestinian militants with biological weapons, and there have been articles about whether there is a need for smallpox vaccine.
There were also warnings that gas masks from the Persian Gulf war of 1991 were now obsolete.
A settlers' road south of Jerusalem was shut for several hours today after soldiers fired at what were described as suspicious figures. It was later reported that they were shepherds, carrying crooks.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Europeans Try Air Fares Without the Fine Print

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The ads in the Underground are as subtle as the barking of a sideshow huckster. "You won't believe your eyes," they scream. Then come the prices: the equivalent of $107 round-trip to Paris, $154 to Marseilles, $201 to Lisbon.
 Those tickets on British Airways do not have to be bought in advance, do not require a Saturday night stay and are up to 80 percent cheaper than almost comparable fares two months ago. On most of the carrier's domestic and European flights, a traveler can walk up to the counter and buy a discounted ticket until a limited number of seats at those prices sell out. 
 This summer, British Airways, the largest airline in Europe, has done what almost no American full-service carrier has been willing to do, despite the industry's enormous losses: radically simplify its fare structure to keep business travelers from defecting to low-cost competitors. 
Other big European airlines are doing the same. KLM is paring to 8, from 25, the fare classes on 66 European routes, a change that includes replacing the Saturday-night-stay requirement with a two-night minimum stay. Lufthansa has cut off-peak fares on unrestricted, economy-class tickets in Germany up to 63 percent. SAS Scandinavian Airlines and bmi british midland have also retooled their fare structures.
It is too soon to tell whether the changes -- all sharp breaks from 20 years of pricing tradition -- foreshadow savings for business travelers in America. Airlines in the United States have tinkered with prices and minimum-stay rules on a handful of competitive routes. Yet even as they battle for market share with Southwest Airlines and its low-cost counterparts, they have generally been reluctant to make it easy for business people to get cheap fares.
But if an airline like British Airways, which is struggling financially, decides to extend its simplified fare structure to trans-Atlantic routes, that could force the hand of carriers in the United States. Already, domestic airlines are studying the new European pricing systems, as well as other strategies that are being used here.
"We look competitively at every step that's taken," said Leo F. Mullin, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines.
 Delta has also been examining how Europe's full-service airlines run their own low-cost carriers, and on Thursday it made an announcement hinting that it could start up such an operation by next year. 
Many of the giant European carriers still shoulder high costs that limit how aggressively they can compete with upstarts. And the airlines' ultimate goal has not changed: filling the most possible seats at the highest possible prices. 
But industry experts, not to mention passengers, are praising the European airlines for at least trying to fix complex fare structures that have driven many travelers to low-cost carriers or other modes of transportation.
"British Airways is ahead of the curve in recognizing the competitive threat that discount carriers pose to them," said Jonathan Schrader, an analyst at Morningstar. "Domestic carriers here in the U.S. recognize it but are not in long-term crisis mode to fight it. British Airways is attacking it head-on, which is something they should be applauded for."
Low-cost European carriers like Ryanair and easyJet started in the 1990's after studying Southwest's business model. By last year, four low-cost airlines carried 16 million passengers to and from Britain, according to the Civil Aviation Authority here -- up 26 percent from a year earlier. Such carriers will carry a quarter of the passengers in Europe by 2010, a fivefold increase from today, according to Mercer Management Consulting.
That trend has British Airways on the ropes. For the year through March, it lost $348 million on short-haul flights, largely because of low-cost competitors, said Martin George, the airline's director of marketing. 
Faced with such bleak numbers, British Airways decided it had to remake its fare structure. In April, it dropped Saturday-night-stay and advance-purchase requirements on 18 of its 189 routes within Britain and the rest of Europe. By the end of the summer, the new model will be in place for all such flights -- London to Rome and London to Glasgow, for example -- and British Airways will have cut its 26 fare categories to a dozen, all without restrictions.
Only a limited number of seats can be bought at the lowest fares, especially during peak hours. And the cheapest seats are still more expensive than no-frills competitors' prices on the same routes. For example, a London-Frankfurt round trip costs a minimum of $115 on British Airways, compared with $55 on Ryanair.
But Ryanair uses secondary airports, and British Airways' coupling of convenience and lower fares is winning back some travelers. The carrier said the number of passengers on its domestic flights is up 15 percent from a year ago.
"I've gone back to buying tickets on British Airways," said Krishan Arora, an executive at the BBC who has flown throughout Europe on all the major low-cost airlines. "It's more to do with the relaxing conditions. They always had this Saturday-night rule, and now that's gone, and the prices in some cases are closer to the low-cost airlines." 
Like their European counterparts, full-service airlines in the United States -- which lost $1.4 billion in the second quarter -- are finally acknowledging that they need to learn from their no-frills competitors. Last summer, some carriers began offering sales that dropped Saturday-night-stay requirements on selected routes and ticket types. This week, American Airlines and Northwest Airlines cut unrestricted walk-up fares on some routes by as much as 40 percent.
But the only carrier in the United States to really overhaul its fare structure is America West Airlines. In late March, it ended its Saturday-night-stay rule and simplified its fares. Now, walk-up tickets cost about double the lowest-priced ones instead of five times as much, similar to the structure at Southwest. For example, the price range on a flight from Boston to San Diego has narrowed to $364 to $842, from $362 to $1,488 before March.
Full-service competitors have retaliated not by changing their own fare structures, but by cutting prices on flights to Phoenix and Las Vegas, America West's two hubs. 
Jim Sabourin, a spokesman for America West, said there were signs that the new fare structure was working. In the second quarter, the carrier's revenue per available seat mile, a standard industry benchmark, fell 6.7 percent from a year earlier, better than the average industry decline of 10 percent. 
Mr. Sabourin said it was a challenge to maintain the simplified fare structure while still offering frills to customers -- food, for instance -- and operating from major airport hubs. Other airline executives say that teasing out the best way to overhaul fares is far from easy.
"I'm still waiting for someone to come up and tell me how to price my fares efficiently," said Gordon M. Bethune, the chief executive of Continental Airlines, which offers dozens of arcane fare combinations. 
Some analysts wonder whether British Airways can sustain its new fare structure, given the carrier's high costs. It has made some in-roads on cost-cutting, having reduced its fleet size and eliminated 10,000 jobs. Last week, it reported a first-quarter pretax profit of $101 million, up 63 percent from a year earlier.
But British Airways has not renegotiated wages or work rules with its unions, as some analysts say it must. And it intends to maintain its current level of premium services: flying from leading airports, providing lounges for frequent-fliers and offering free drinks and food.
"I see no evidence whatsoever that British Airways has done anything about their cost structure," said Daniel Solon, a senior airline consultant at Avmark International in London. "I happen to believe it's a very important competitive difference."
Besides remaking their fare structures, the big European carriers have turned with varying success to operating no-frills airlines themselves. KLM has Buzz and Basiq, Virgin Atlantic Airways runs Virgin Express, bmi british midland recently set up bmibaby and Lufthansa is considering a similar move. British Airways founded Go in 1998 before selling it two years later.
In the last decade, American carriers like Continental, US Airways and United Airlines have tried and abandoned the strategy. But experts said those efforts generally were tied too closely to the operations of their parent carriers, unlike in Europe. Delta faces similar problems with its stagnant Delta Express, but nonetheless seems to be leaning toward starting another low-cost carrier. 
Whether airlines in the United States will adopt the fare innovations from across the Atlantic is another matter. But industry experts say the carriers need to try something. 
"The airline executives are arrogant," said Joe Brancatelli, an on-line travel columnist who specializes in tracking air fares. "When it comes to business, they don't want to hear anything. But the market has spoken. Those who adjust will profit; those who don't will continue to lose money."

HEADLINE: Candidate for Lieutenant Governor Facing Scrutiny Over Business Dealings 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
H. Carl McCall's choice for lieutenant governor, Dennis Mehiel, has thrived at running companies on the brink, amassing considerable wealth in the process.
The rewards of his success, federal records show, have also included several loans at below-market interest rates, somewith no interest at all, from the companies he controls. 
 The practice is legal, but the recent wave of corporate scandals has made it highly controversial. Congress recently passed, and President Bush signed, a bill that will prohibit such loans for companies whose stock is publicly traded, but that would not apply to Mr. Mehiel's companies, which are privately held. 
 Nonetheless, in the current corporate climate, the business practices of a candidate are considered fair political game. And, indeed, Mr. Mehiel's opponent in the Sept. 10 Democratic primary, Charles King, made an issue this week of Mr. Mehiel's loans and other business dealings, likening Mr. Mehiel's practices to those of corporate bogeymen in companies like Tyco and WorldCom.
Mr. King said Mr. Mehiel should be held accountable for the way he operates his companies, even if they are not affected by the new corporate laws.
"Clearly, the loans have all been legal, but that doesn't mean that they are right," Mr. King said. "Congress and the president have rejected that as a bad business practice, and Dennis has said, 'Judge me on my business record.' "
By his own account, Mr. Mehiel (pronounced MEEL) has grown wealthy in a high-risk corporate field. For decades he has specialized in taking over troubled companies, often from bankruptcy, eventually folding them into his existing companies. His enterprises have grown rapidly, mostly by such acquisitions. Because his companies are privately held, it is very difficult to estimate his personal net worth, and Mr. Mehiel said he did not know it. 
It is his wealth that heightens interest in the race for lieutenant governor, a primary contest that usually draws yawns. But this year, political analysts believe the choice could influence the results in November.
Candidates for governor and lieutenant governor compete separately in primaries, and those who win the primaries run together as a ticket in the general election. Mr. Mehiel is unofficially tied to Mr. McCall, while Mr. King is closely allied with Andrew M. Cuomo, Mr. McCall's primary opponent. Mr. McCall lags far behind the Republican incumbent, Gov. George E. Pataki, in fund-raising, but in the fall campaign, Mr. Mehiel's wealth could partially level the playing field.
Mr. Mehiel entered politics after years of using his wealth to support others. Since the beginning of 1999, Mr. Mehiel and companies he controls have given Democratic campaigns in New York state at least $396,000 in cash or in-kind contributions (services like holding fund-raisers or allowing the use of a corporate jet). He has also lent his own campaign more than $1.1 million.
The full picture of Mr. Mehiel's companies is murky, because their stock is not publicly traded, so most of them do not file financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But as Mr. Mehiel acknowledges, his companies operate on very thin profit margins, they carry significant debts and their bonds are rated as junk.
"The wolf's always been at my door," he said. "I've always run a highly leveraged business."
That explains many of the transactions between his companies, he said -- the credit of his main firms is "too ugly" to borrow the money needed to acquire new property or companies. So he creates a smaller entity with stronger credit to take on the debt. For instance, he said, he created a company solely to buy a jet, putting up the collateral and cash himself, and his bigger companies pay that company to use the jet. This practice has been cast in a negative light, in the case of publicly held companies like Enron, where it was used to funnel cash from one entity to another, inflate profits and hide debts.
But finance experts say there are significant differences between Mr. Mehiel's dealings and those of the foundering corporate giants. Foremost is that his companies are privately held and he is the majority owner -- in some cases the sole owner -- so that the transactions are akin to taking money out of one pants pocket and putting it in another. Mr. Mehiel does not carry the entire risk -- he has thousands of employees, bondholders, and a handful of other shareholders, including some pension funds -- but he bears most of it.
"There's no indication that any of these things were not on the up-and-up, and you frequently have this sort of thing with privately held companies," said Cynthia Werneth, a Standard & Poor's analyst who has studied Mr. Mehiel's holdings. "But when you have these kinds of deals, there's always a risk of things not occurring at arm's length."
Mr. Mehiel says that, in fact, that his companies have taken a number of unusual steps to prevent such abuses, and that the public documents that exist support his claims. "I'm the poster child for doing things 180 degrees opposite" from the companies tainted by scandal, he said.
Mr. Mehiel's best-known property is the Sweetheart Cup Company, bought in 1998 by SF Holdings Group, of which he and his former wife own 72 percent. SF Holdings reported $1.3 billion in sales and just $3.3 million in net income in the fiscal year that ended last September, and well over $500 million in long-term debt.
SF Holdings paid Mr. Mehiel, its chairman and chief executive, $1,075,576 in salary and bonus, and $409,960 for "personal expenses," which were not detailed.
For decades, Mr. Mehiel's main holding was Box USA, a major manufacturer of cardboard boxes of which he was the sole owner, chairman and chief executive. The company has not been required to file with the S.E.C. since 1997. Mr. Mehiel sold 49 percent of the company two years ago, and is no longer involved in its day-to-day operations.
Currently, he has a loan of more than $300,000 from SF Holdings, at 5.06 percent interest. In the mid-1990's, he had zero-interest loans of $1.5 million and $800,000 from Box USA, which he repaid, and there have been other loans, as well. Several times over the years, his companies have bought and sold materials and services from each other.
SF Holdings's board of directors includes prominent people from outside the company. Mr. Mehiel said the board must approve deals involving him or one of his companies. It includes John A. Catsimatidis, whose business empire includes the Red Apple supermarkets, and former Lt. Gov. Alfred B. DelBello. That degree of semi-independent review does not exist at most privately held firms. The company also voluntarily accounts for stock options as an expense. Many companies to not do that, making profits appear larger.

 THE MAN WHO RODE AMPERSAND
By Ferdinand Mount.
245 pp. New York:
Carroll & Graf Publishers. $25.
FERDINAND MOUNT, currently the editor of The Times Literary Supplement, is also the author of nine novels, five of them forming a linked sequence called "A Chronicle of Modern Twilight," which began in 1975 and whose most recent installment, "Fairness," was published just last year. Following the enthusiastic reception of that book, the first volume of the series, "The Man Who Rode Ampersand," is being released in the United States for the first time. A short and remarkably accomplished novel, it will be a treat both for newcomers to Mount's work and for those who are already familiar with it -- though the latter, unfortunately, are a small group, since Mount has always been better known in Britain than he is here.
The novel (like the others in the sequence) is narrated by Gus Cotton, a midlevel civil servant, and the title character is Gus's father, Harry, a jockey who, after one glorious moment on the back of the great racehorse Ampersand, drifts vaguely through the rest of his life: working as a barman in a rackety London club; falling in love with a Jewish woman of Polish-German ancestry and visiting her in Europe as the Nazis rise to power; fighting in North Africa during World War II; getting a rather disreputable government job recruiting Irish workers for English factories. Harry Cotton is an attractive character in spite of his passivity, or possibly because of it. His is a detached, disinterested sensibility in the middle of a greedy and violent age.
Mount's uncle by marriage was Anthony Powell, the author of another chronicle of modern twilight, the brilliant novel sequence "A Dance to the Music of Time," and Powell has clearly exerted a major influence on Mount's work. The two writers' books display a similar, slightly tortured perspective on the past, a combination of nostalgia and dyspepsia. Stylistically, too, Mount and Powell are similar. Neither could ever be called experimental, but they have both stretched the English language (of which they are masters) to its limits, producing a rich, almost clotted prose.
Mount's sheer virtuosity dates him. No one born since World War II could produce such unapologetically mandarin writing without frequent spasms of self-consciousness. But words like "gadoid," "halitotic" and "piscine" trip off Mount's pen quite naturally. Occasionally, the language takes the bit between its teeth and runs away with the narrative, but for the most part the effects are satisfactory. One can only relax and enjoy the exquisite geometry of sentences like the following (in which Gus tries to guess the age of a peculiar-looking barfly): "It was no more possible to preserve an analytical detachment towards him than it would have been to wrench open his jaw and, as with a horse, assess his age by the state of his teeth -- the latter course being in any case futile because in the interests of economy he had had them all removed and replaced by unnervingly regular dentures."
Another writer whose work Mount's often resembles is Angus Wilson, author of dense, baroque books cluttered with grandly grotesque characters. Some of Mount's creations rival Wilson's at their most colorful: Pip (also known as Polly) Parrott, "war hero, antique dealer and last of the Bright Young Things," and C. L., an obscenely rich racehorse owner, a "gargantuan, thyroid-eyed" woman who "had a passion for hard-boiled eggs and delighted to crack them in unexpected places -- on her secretary's head, on the ebony elephant in the hall, on the silver statuette on the bonnet of her Rolls."
Harry and Gus are the novel's only fully developed characters. Each of the others, however vividly depicted, has little more than a walk-on role. It is an obvious setup for a long novel sequence, for these people are too good, too lovingly invented, not to reappear at a later date. "The Man Who Rode Ampersand," then, does not entirely stand on its own; instead, it serves as a first course, a lead-in to the many pleasures of the series as a whole.

 THE RINGER
By Bill Scheft.
248 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $23.95.
 IN his debut as a fiction writer, the humorist Bill Scheft attempts to build an entire novel out of wisecracks. The results are mixed and the book is flawed, but then again so is the Venus de Milo. On the negative side, the characters in "The Ringer" lack depth, and the plot meanders. On the positive side, the jokes are plentiful and very high in quality. Adroitly fusing what he learned from Philip Roth with what he learned from Don Rickles with what he wrote for David Letterman (for whom he has worked as a monologue writer for the last 10 years), Scheft has succeeded where more celebrated cutups like Al Franken and Michael Moore have failed. He has written a book that is actually funny. 
"The Ringer" is the story of a 35-year-old New York neurotic who supports himself and his gambling habit by slaving away as a hired gun (the "Lord of the Ringers") for 13 softball teams. For years, College Boy (ne Harvey Sussman) has been toiling on talent-strapped squads fielded by pizza joints, restaurants and Broadway theaters; he also has a one-day-a-year job on Wall Street enabling him to play for the Morgan Stanley team. Aside from a part-time gig as the designated chuckler on a local radio program, he has no career, no prospects, no social life. He is a self-involved, deeply confused loser "whose idea of planning for the future was deciding whether to set his VCR to tape the Yankees or Mets before he left his apartment." He has a bad job, a bad attitude and very bad legs. Worse still, his psychiatrist has just moved to Teaneck, N.J., and sextupled his rates.
One day College Boy receives a physically catastrophic "full-service muscle call" from two goons in the employ of the Dirt King, a small-time mobster who controls the coveted Central Park replacement soil market. Forced to leave town, College Boy retreats to Massachusetts, where he becomes a full-time nurse for his uncle Mort (ne Morton Martin Spell), a cantankerous old lush who has, among other maladies, Parkinson's disease. Once a revered sportswriter -- the only guy who still wore a hat in the press box" -- he has fallen on hard times ever since Ronald Reagan "deregulated the 10,000-word magazine piece." A cross between Jimmy Cannon and Henny Youngman, Mort is a throwback to an era when sportswriters both drank and knew the history of the Roman Republic, an inconceivable accomplishment today. Here is one of his jokes:
"Julius Caesar walks into a bar. Tells the bartender, 'I'll have a martinus.' Bartender says, 'Don't you mean a martini?' And Caesar says, 'If I wanted a double, I'd ask for it!' " 
The joke also works with "vodkum" and "vodka." 
For years, Uncle Mort has been having weekly sexual encounters with his housekeeper, Sheila, who runs an informal call-girl service out of his apartment when he is out of town. Now, at the ripe age of 75, Mort is merely trying to hang on, "with enough Valium in his system to get Liza Minnelli through a long weekend." This opens things up for College Boy and the Whore With the Heart of Gold, as she is the only female of marriageable age in this remarkably economic novel. Like many prostitutes, Sheila did not set out to become a hooker; she drifted into the profession. As Scheft describes her "date" with a Wall Street guy who is taking her to a movie at the Beekman Theater:
"Sheila could try and tell herself that she was equally surprised by the turn of events, but you don't buy a three-pack of condoms at Tower Chemists across the street from the Beekman because you're worried they might not have them at the concession stand. And you don't bring a strange man back to your apartment 15 minutes before a movie to feed your cat when it isn't your apartment, and it isn't your cat. Even if there is a cat, it ain't yours." 
As often occurs with books and films that start out brash and cynical, "The Ringer" ultimately becomes sweet and sentimental. College Boy must get a new attitude. Sheila must get a new occupation. The Dirt King must get a new lawyer. And Uncle Mort must get a new psychiatrist. Luckily, the merely functional story never gets in the way of the punch lines. In the same way that Prince and Beck can effortlessly produce wonderful new songs that sound a lot like other people's wonderful old songs, Scheft has studied at the feet of the masters, and effortlessly switches voices from Milton Berle to David Letterman to Woody Allen. A few examples:
"If Morton Martin Spell's tie was in a museum, several groups would be out front protesting the exhibit."
"He walked the six blocks north and three blocks east and almost let himself be sucked into the Medea Restaurant as if by some Greek coffee shop undertow." 
"As he disembarked from The Little Elevator That Might, the two J.V. goons stood up and simultaneously flicked away their cigarettes, as if they were there for a casting call of his building's production of 'West Side Story.' "
"There is no rejection in life quite like a canceled shrink appointment, even if that appointment never existed. Or especially if it never existed."
Readers under the age of 20 -- that is, folks who prefer Conan O'Brien to David Letterman -- may be baffled by references to demi-icons of yesteryear like Vada Pinson, Jacques Plante, Barbara Bain and Joe Valachi, or sentences like "The line drive . . . was handled like the editing of 'Heaven's Gate.' " Increasingly, commercial fiction is filled with pop-cultural references that should be accompanied by a time-expiration code. Let's face it, 20 years from now, how many people are going to remember Lamont Sanford? They're having enough trouble remembering Julius Caesar now. 
But this is nitpicking. Though Scheft seems to have written "The Ringer" with the idea that the guy who writes the most jokes writes the best book, he has indisputably written a lot of good jokes. Less a protege of Frederick Exley than of Freddie Roman, Scheft keeps the material coming at machine-gun pace, adhering to the time-honored comic principle that if you tell enough gags fast enough, no one will remember the bad ones. Here, for example, is College Boy's mother speaking to her son:
"Harvey, is it true? Mort had a seizure?"
"Yeah, Mom."
"I told you not to give him liverwurst."
Cymbal crash, heard in distance.

Peace With Flashlights

BYLINE:  By Patrick Markee 

 BODY:
Street gangs have been part of American urban life for nearly as long as there have been American cities. From the 19th-century Irish gangs of New York City's Five Points district to today's Bloods and Crips and Latin Kings and multiple variations, common themes emerge: young, underemployed men and boys, discarded by labor markets and hampered by racism, join together under bonds of blood loyalty in an underground economy. And scared family members and residents of besieged neighborhoods are caught in the inevitable cross-fire between law enforcement authorities and rival gangs. 
 Barbara Joosse and the illustrator R. Gregory Christie focus on the family turmoil wrought by gang life in STARS IN THE DARKNESS (Chronicle, $14.95; ages 4 to 8), telling a deceptively simple but unusually moving story of a young boy's older brother who is drawn into the orbit of street-corner gangbangers. We are never shown the gang life of Richard, the brother, just the telling details as described by the young narrator: the new basketball bought with unexplained funds, the red bandanna, the lies about nights spent away from home, a bloody, bandaged arm. Richard's increasingly cold demeanor is all the more disturbing because of his closeness to the narrator at the beginning. 
 Christie's most moving illustration, reproduced on the cover, shows Richard hugging his younger brother to shield him from late-night sounds of fighting on the streets. The narrator and his mother, who at first feel helpless in the face of Richard's growing gang ties, finally take action by organizing their neighbors to form "Peace Walks." Theirs is the kind of real-life small victory that plays out in many poor neighborhoods, places abandoned and ignored by local government and the wider society. Most important, though, the narrator realizes something about the gangs through his brother's experience: "Richard's a banger, but he's still good inside. He's good to us," he tells his mother. "So maybe the other bangers are like that too." The narrator sees that Richard, like so many urban youths down the centuries, turns to gangs for brotherhood, for security, for something he can't find anywhere else. Like the flashlights of the peace walkers at the story's end, Richard and his family find ways to be stars in the darkness. Patrick Markee

 BODY:
 (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)

VERSAILLES, by Kathryn Davis. (Houghton Mifflin, $21.) A reflective, mysterious novel about human development; it takes a soul's-eye view of the life of Marie Antoinette from her marriage at 14 to the guillotine at 38; narrated by herself sometime after her death, when she has had a chance to think some about her earthly life and its contents.

YOU ARE NOT A STRANGER HERE, by Adam Haslett. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $21.95.) These nine short stories (Haslett's first collection) exhale a desiccated bleakness, a despair mitigated by the characters' continuing desire to be good, to do the right thing despite hopelessness, loss, disease and mental illness.

PRAGUE, by Arthur Phillips. (Random House, $24.95.) A first novel set in 1990, far beyond the recently fallen Berlin Wall, where young Americans reveal themselves not as travelers but mere tourists, detached from their surroundings, weightless and immaterial among time-battered buildings and people who have survived wars and uprisings.

RACISM: A Short History, by George M. Fredrickson. (Princeton University, $22.95.) A historian proposes that the distinctive ideology of Western racism was made necessary by the growing Enlightenment belief in equality; earlier and elsewhere, men had needed no theories to treat one another ill.

HALF IN LOVE: Stories, by Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $23.) Fourteen stories, set mostly in the author's native Montana, among small-time racetracks and failed oil wells, where brides choose wedding dresses to hide branding-iron scars; no one expects an easy life here, and even the young feel their choices constrained by economics and losing habits.

THE REAL McCOY, by Darin Strauss. (Dutton, $24.95.) An ambitious, thought-infested novel placed at the turn of the last century, in which a boxer who is also a confidence man helps America round the corner to a new world of mass communications, celebrity, product endorsement and the makeover.

SAVAGE REPRISALS: Bleak House, Madame Bovary, Buddenbrooks, by Peter Gay. (Norton, $24.95.) A distinguished cultural historian reads three landmark novels as propelled, respectively, by Dickens's resentment of his mean old mother, Flaubert's of the culture of the bourgeoisie and Mann's of his capitalist father.

CAMOUFLAGE: Stories, by Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) Fourteen stories by an Australian who invests his space in satire, not character; in one story people hold races on the partitions of their office cubicles, while in another a conceptual artist offers to document the existence of everyone alive.

STRAVINSKY AND BALANCHINE: A Journey of Invention, by Charles M. Joseph. (Yale University, $40.) An engaging study, by a professor of music and intrepid researcher, of the remarkable collaboration between two emigres from Russia who revived and re-created, again and again, classical ballet in the 20th century.

Indianapolis

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS WISSING; DOUGLAS WISSING is a writer in Bloomington, Ind.

 BODY:
Long known as the Crossroads of America, Indianapolis has transformed itself over the last 10 years into a vibrant, more international city as its booming economy reaches out to global markets.
 This summer and fall, the world really is coming to Indianapolis. In August dozens of the top international players arrive in this basketball-mad state capital to battle in the World Basketball Championship. The cheers will barely have quieted when 50 of the world's most promising violinists between the ages of 16 and 29 begin the International Violin Competition of Indianapolis, a premier musical event held every four years. And in late September, seven 747's will touch down at Indianapolis International Airport, bringing the cars of the international Formula One auto-racing series to town for the SAP United States Grand Prix. 
 But Indianapolis is still a Hoosier town, ready to crow about joys of Indiana life. The Indiana State Fair, the nation's sixth oldest, began 150 years ago and remains a kaleidoscope of corn dogs, carnival rides, beauty queens and prize bulls. Newer but no less Hoosier, the recently reopened Indiana State Museum offers a panoramic view of Indiana history and living culture. The sprawling museum is an anchor of the White River State Park, a popular urban recreational area.

Events
The men's World Basketball Championship will be held Aug. 29 to Sept. 8, the first time in its 52-year history this event is in the United States. The national teams of 16 countries will play downtown in Conseco Fieldhouse and the RCA Dome. Eight players chosen in the most recent National Basketball Association draft -- including 7-foot-5 Yao Ming of China -- are expected to play. Game tickets cost from $10 to $58 at (866) 849-4922 or www.2002worldbasketball.com.
When the cars and drivers of the SAP Grand Prix begin to wind through the 13-turn, 2.6-mile track at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, West 16th Street and Georgetown Road, Indy joins such storied international racing locales as Monza, Italy, and Monte Carlo. The Formula One race cars practice on Sept. 27, with qualifications the next day. On Sept. 29 -- before a crowd expected to be the biggest in Formula One -- the race begins when more than 20 cars scream toward the first turn in a high-stakes game of chicken. Tickets range from $30 to $150; (800) 822-4639 and www.usgpindy.com.
Aug. 28 through Sept. 2 at Indianapolis Raceway Park, some 10 miles west of downtown in Clermont, rip-roaring funny cars, dragsters, stock cars -- even motorcycles -- thunder down the quarter-mile drag strip at the U.S. Nationals. More than 90,000 spectators are expected over the six days, including on Friday and Saturday nights, when the nitromethane exhaust flames make the roaring 6,000-horsepower dragsters look like Roman candles. Tickets range from $5 to $60, and are available at (800) 884-6472 or www.irponline.com.
You'll want to remove your earplugs at the International Violin Competition, Sept. 6 to 22. The event consists of four juried rounds of performances, with the finals in the Hilbert Circle Theatre, 45 Monument Circle. Violinists in the final stages are accompanied by the Suzuki and Friends Chamber Orchestra and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. Previous laureates include Kyoko Takezawa, Leonidas Kavakos and David Chan. Tickets: $12 to $50 at (317) 638-4824 or www.violin.org.
Through next Sunday, the venerable Indiana State Fair on East 38th Street bustles with farmers exhibiting prize produce and livestock, and cooks displaying a cornucopia of pickles, pies and casseroles. The midway rides entice all ages ($1 to $5 each). On Wednesday, the country singer Kenny Chesney appears at 7:30 p.m. ($29 to $31). Gate admission is $6; (317) 927-7500 or www .indianastatefair.com.

Sightseeing
The Indiana State Museum, (317) 232-1637 or www.indianamuseum .com, which opened in May in White River State Park just east of downtown, celebrates the state's rich history and culture. It is an enveloping universe of fossils, prehistoric peoples, frontier pioneers and industrial innovators. Indiana heroes such as the Revolutionary War leader George Rogers Clark and villains like the historically powerful state Ku Klux Klan both populate the cases. Open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 11 to 6 p.m. General admission, $7.
The museum is an ideal departure point to explore White River State Park, 801 West Washington Street, (317) 233-2434. Within walking distance, the park includes such attractions as the Indianapolis Zoo, White River Gardens, the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association Hall of Champions -- all tied together by elegant promenades and green spaces.
The Eiteljorg Museum, 500 West Washington Street, (317) 636-9378, www.eiteljorg.org, includes the work of artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe and Frederic Remington. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $7.
The N.C.A.A. Hall of Champions, 700 West Washington Street, (800) 735-6222, www.ncaahallofchampions.org, is a Michael Graves-designed paean to the student-athletes of 22 collegiate sports, from football to lacrosse. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $7.
With the growth of galleries, antique shops, studios and lofts, the Fountain Square area continues its quirky renaissance. The Murphy Art Center, 1043 Virginia Avenue, (317) 686-0895, houses 22 artists' studios and four galleries. Six times a year the entire building stages a free open house, including one Sept. 6 from 6 to 11 p.m. The ornate Fountain Square Theatre, 1105 Prospect Street, (317) 686-6010, built in 1928, offers swing dancing under the ballroom's faux stars the second Friday of each month ($8).

HEADLINE: Q. & A.; 
Tenant Who Needs to Break a Lease

 BODY:
 Q. I will be moving out of my apartment before my lease expires. What is the legal procedure for breaking one's lease? . . . Khalika Eodumegwuhu-Sanchez, Brooklyn.

A. Lucas A. Ferrara, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that neither a landlord nor a tenant is permitted to break a lease unless the right to do so is in the lease agreement or given to the parties by a statute or regulation. For example, he said, a rent-regulated tenant who does not occupy an apartment as a primary residence could forfeit the right to the apartment.
 Otherwise, Mr. Ferrara said, "a landlord must permit a tenant to remain in an apartment for the balance of the lease, while a tenant, in turn, is usually responsible for the payment of all rent."
Exceptions, however, could exist. For example, Mr. Ferrara said, when a tenant is forced to leave an apartment because all or part of the space is unusable, that could be a justification for breaking the lease. "If a tenant leaves because of issues relating to the apartment's livability, that could excuse a tenant from having to pay the rent for the time remaining on the lease," he said.
Otherwise, Mr. Ferrara said, market forces will play a critical role in a tenant's ability to break a lease without being held liable for damages.
"If the rent being paid is under market, and a landlord can increase income by leasing to a new tenant, a vacancy may be welcome news," he said. He added, however, that problems may arise when the owner has a difficult time finding a new tenant at the existing rent or is forced to rent the apartment for less money.
In such situations, Mr. Ferrara said, a tenant about to break a lease would be better off informing the landlord immediately.
"In my experience, in the interest of avoiding litigation, many landlords will work with their tenants to find a mutually acceptable solution," he said, such as releasing the tenant from the remainder of the lease in exchange for a waiver of the return of the security deposit and/or pre-payment of several months' rent. 
Mr. Ferrara said that in situations where an agreement cannot be reached, and the tenant breaks the lease, the legal question of whether the landlord is required to try to rerent the apartment -- and minimize damages for which the tenant is responsible -- depends in large part on where the building is situated.
As far as New York City is concerned, in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, a landlord is usually required to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to find a new tenant. In Manhattan and the Bronx, however, an appeals court ruled in 1997 that the owner has no such obligation.

Making Entrances Accessible

Q. The co-op in which I live has a doorman-monitored main entrance that has a few steps leading down into the lobby. A side entrance that leads directly to the street has two doors that can be opened only from the inside, making it impossible for someone in a wheelchair to enter the building without assistance. There are plans to renovate the lobby and build a ramp parallel with the existing main entrance, cutting through what is now a garden. Is this ramp mandated by the Americans With Disabilities Act if we renovate? . . . Christine Santoro, Manhattan.

A. Stuart M. Saft, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said the Americans With Disabilities Act has only limited applicability to residential buildings. He added, however, that the New York City Human Rights Law bars discrimination against individuals because of their disabilities. And the city's Handicapped Accessibility Law, he said, requires buildings that make major capital improvements to be certain the areas under improvement are made accessible to people with disabilities, unless doing so would be physically or legally impossible or would create an undue economic burden on the building.
"The city's Human Rights Commission has been very proactive in taking cases involving disabled individuals," Mr. Saft said. If the lobby is being renovated, he said, it is likely the commission would insist on the installation of a ramp if the ramp can be put in without imposing an undue economic burden on the building. So, Mr. Saft said, it appears that the letter writer's board is acting prudently by installing the ramp.

Birth of a Genre: The Black Hero Who Talks Back

BYLINE:  By HAL HINSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
IN the beginning, there was "Sweetback." As Melvin Van Peebles explains in "Baadasssss Cinema," Isaac Julien's definitive new documentary about the history of blaxploitation films, the idea for "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song" rose up in him out of a long-festering sense of frustration over what he was seeing on the screen.
 "The cause I had," Mr. Van Peebles proclaims between puffs on a cigar just slightly smaller than a Louisville Slugger, "was giving black folks a sense of self that had been stolen from us. And that's how I made 'Sweetback.' " 
 The film, about a pimp who stays one step ahead of a racist gang of cops, opened first in Detroit, on March 31, 1971, at the Grand Circus Theater, then two days later at the Coronet Theater in Atlanta -- the only theaters in the country that would show it. At the time, there were no black-owned theater chains. Also, the Motion Picture Association of America had given the film an "X" rating, which meant that most theater chains wouldn't book it, primarily because most newspapers wouldn't sell advertising space to an X-rated film. 
However, once Mr. Van Peebles discovered that the ratings committee was made up entirely of white men, he immediately began marketing the film as "Rated 'X' by an All-White Jury."
Those first audiences probably didn't know that they were watching a movie that would launch countless imitations, spark a revolution in the motion-picture business, and open the floor for a cultural debate that rages to this day.
But that's what happened, and in his documentary, Mr. Julien traces the development of the genre, using archival footage and interviews with directors, actors, critics and academics (including Elvis Mitchell, a film critic for The New York Times). The film, which has its premiere on the Independent Film Channel on Wednesday, kicks off a month-long blaxploitation festival on IFC. It will include three of the major blaxploitation films of the 1970's: "Foxy Brown," "Superfly" and "Shaft's Big Score!"
"Sweetback" was shot in only 19 days with a crew of veteran porno filmmakers and a shoestring budget of $500,000 -- $50,000 of which came from Bill Cosby. But it quickly became one of the highest-grossing independent films ever made. 
Julian Bond, chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., remembers watching the movie at the Coronet Theater. "It was just like, 'Wow!' " Mr. Bond said in a telephone interview. "You'd just never seen anything like it before. You'd never seen sex like that. You'd never seen a black guy beat up the police and get away."
What happened after that, Mr. Van Peebles said, was simple economics: "When Hollywood saw these huge returns from 'Sweetback,' they became aware that there was an enormous black audience that could be exploited."
Mr. Julien, a writer, artist and social critic, says the IFC documentary grew directly out of a course he taught at Harvard called "Black Film as Genre? Blaxploitation Cinema to Quentin Tarantino." In his research, he said, he realized that there was a story to be told.
As a teenager growing up in London's East End in the 70's, Mr. Julien said, the first film he ever saw in a theater was "Cleopatra Jones." And the other blaxploitation films -- "Shaft," "Superfly" and anything with the actress Pam Grier -- were formative experiences for him. But, he said, "my critical examination of these films didn't begin, really, until I began doing the research for my course." 
The timing of the documentary couldn't be more perfect. The genre's influence can be seen everywhere in pop music and film, in movies like "The Ladies Man," "Undercover Brother" and "Austin Powers in Goldmember." But in the 70's, to many audiences, black and white, these movies were troubling, especially because Sweetback and so many of the other heroes were pimps and drug dealers.
"Some of us want only the best depiction, that is the upright, the triumphant, law-abiding hero," said Mr. Bond. "And at that time, films that glamorized dope dealers and women with low bodices didn't conform to what we thought our image ought to be."
But, Mr. Bond said, the movies stirred something in audiences. "If you were sitting in the theater with a group of people, then you understood that they had enormous popular appeal," he said. "I guess in some ways it's like rap music today, and rhythm and blues years ago."
For Fred Williamson, the professional football player who starred in several of the films, it was all about heroes. "Black society needed these films," he said in an interview. "The blacks in most movies were still porters and bus boys. There were no black equivalents to the characters played by Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart and Jimmy Cagney."
These heroes were vastly different from the figures that Sidney Poitier played in 1960's films like "Lilies of the Field" or "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." "Most black people were tired of the noble Negro," said Ed Guerrero, a professor of Afro-American studies at New York University who is also interviewed in the documentary. "These films represented the first time that black people really got on the screen more or less on their own terms."
The success of "Sweetback" made Hollywood aware of the enormous black audience, in much the same way that the success of "Easy Rider" had made Hollywood aware of the youth audience. But in the documentary, Mr. Van Peebles claims that when Hollywood produced its knock-offs of his film, it also surpressed the political content, added caricature, and "blaxploitation" was born.
"Did my film get the whole thing started? Yes," Mr. Van Peebles asserts. "But it doesn't really belong in there with the others." 
In October 1972, Newsweek ran a cover story on the new black movie boom, claiming that "talented black actors, directors and writers were suddenly plucked out of studio back rooms, modeling agencies and ghetto theaters, and turned loose on new black projects." 
The article even suggested that the black films were paying off so much better than their white counterparts, that the new black cinema deserved credit for keeping Hollywood from possible extinction. While this may have been a slight exaggeration of the facts, it is true that by the end of 1971, one out of every four films in production was designed to appeal to the black audience. 
And it's also true that the original "Shaft" went through preproduction as a film with a white director and a white cast, then was quickly retooled for a black cast, with Richard Roundtree in the lead, a black director, Gordon Parks, and a hot-buttered soul score by Isaac Hayes. The film grossed $12 million and rescued MGM at a time when the studio had literally pawned Judy Garland's ruby slippers to stay in business. 
Mr. Williamson, who starred in "Hell Up in Harlem" and "Black Caesar," among other films, questions whether the movies of the blaxploitation period are "black films" in the same sense that, say, the movies of Spike Lee are. 
"First of all," he said, "the movies were being financed by whites, so once the whites were in control, then they also controlled the subject matter. It is up to the actors themselves to portray the characters that they want to portray and the things that they want to see done."
Even at the height of their appeal, the movies usually followed a simple and predictable formula, with warring drug dealers and corrupt white cops. The one consistant ingredient underneath it all was the brilliant music, which, whether coming from James Brown or Marvin Gaye or Curtis Mayfield or Issac Hayes, added an element of depth and sophistication.
The blaxploitation era came to an end for precisely the same reason it started: money. Instead of diversifying and developing their audience, the studios kept churning out the same film over and over. "Shaft" was followed by "Shaft's Big Score!" and "Shaft in Africa." "Slaughter" gave birth to "Slaughter's Big Rip-Off," and eventually it was the audience that started to feel ripped off. 
"In the end, the films of the blaxploitation era didn't make that much money for black people," Mr. Guerrero explains in the documentary. "Ultimately, it was just a moment, an interlude." 
When the party was over, the morning after was grim for those who had relied on the industry to make a living. 
"It was a vicious time," recalls the actress Gloria Hendry in perhaps the documentary's most poignant moment. "When you start falling, you put your hands out and try to hold onto anything you can. And I was grabbing, but I couldn't get a hold of anything. There was nothing. Black films saved Hollywood, and when they were through with us, they dropped us. The door slammed."

HEADLINE: Guard to Add a Canine Unit in Newtown 

BYLINE:  By NANCY DONIGER 

 BODY:
HOMELAND security is about to come closer to home for residents in western Connecticut. 
 Maj. Gen. William A. Cugno, adjutant general of the state Military Department, is honing plans to expand the Army National Guard presence at Fairfield Hills in Newtown with the formation of a military canine unit, new training and administrative facilities and a recruiting center. 
 The dogs and their handlers will be available for deployment anywhere in the world to respond to terrorist acts and will also protect the region, General Cugno said. The dogs will be trained to detect explosives and drugs and perform search-and-rescue operations. The unit will accommodate six dogs to start with an 18-dog capacity. 
With $2 million in federal funding, General Cugno plans to renovate a half-dozen dilapidated buildings at Fairfield Hills, the former Connecticut psychiatric hospital that closed in 1995. 
He plans to use the former storehouse, at the foot of Trades Lane, for an armory, which will be used to train guardsmen, not to store weapons, he said. The former machine shop will be converted into administrative offices. The former piggery, on seven acres of state Agriculture Department land, deeded for animal and agricultural use, will become a military working dog unit. 
The training facilities may contain a chemical decontamination unit to prepare guardsmen to respond to a chemical or biological attack, General Cugno said. But, he added, "No chemicals will be stored anywhere at Fairfield Hills."
"The guardsmen in this unit will be specialists in clean up and rapid response if, God forbid, there were ever an event of chemical warfare," General Cugno said. "If an adversary used chemical weapons against us in a war environment, the soldiers would know how to detect and minimize the effects, based on knowledge and training in decontamination."
Another building will become an indoor training center for the Second Company Governor's Horse Guard, military dogs and soldiers. The Second Company, already headquartered in the former hospital dairy barn, occupies 65 adjacent acres. The former slaughterhouse will be used as a feeding and comfort station for soldiers.
General Cugno is the only adjutant general in the country who commands two cavalry militias, the First Company Governor's Horse Guard in Avon plus the Second Company in Newtown.
"We are fortunate to have such a facility, co-located with the horse guard, and sandwiched between New York and Boston," General Cugno said. "It will be an asset to other law enforcement agencies, to the governor, and to the region, in the war against terrorism. It will contribute to the local economy with the creation of six full-time jobs."
It also will be the first Defense Department military canine unit under National Guard command, General Cugno said. The United States Military Department's main dog facility has its headquarters at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Dog units also are located at military bases across the country, but none is under the reserves, he said.
Plans for a heightened national guard presence at Fairfield Hills have been under way for more than a year, but have grown in importance "based on lessons we learned Sept. 11," General Cugno said. He intends to maintain the farm ambience and to preserve the original design elements in buildings he converts to military use, including the piggery's gambrel roof. 
"This man is a mover," said Julia Wasserman, a state representative who represents Newtown. "He has done nothing but good things at Fairfield Hills. The canine unit will be far enough away from habitation that I don't envision any problems. Whatever he does here, he does with precision and good judgment. It's all positive and good for the town and the state."
Fairfield Hills State Hospital opened in 1932 on 800 acres and housed more than 3,000 patients during the 1950's. Designed to resemble a college campus rather than an institution, the hospital included a fully-working farm that supplied food to patients and staff.
Representative Wasserman has been actively negotiating with the state for redevelopment since 1992. Ms. Wasserman initiated legislation that deeded 300 acres to the State Department of Agriculture in perpetuity. Two years ago, Ms. Wasserman secured $650,000 in state funding to refurbish the horse guard facilities, when General Cugno first took over. 
During the 1980's, the state allocated 120 acres to the Department of Correction for the Ward A. Garner Correctional Institution, a high security prison, which opened in 1992, over the protests of residents and town leaders who did not want it in Newtown. The objections have receded, as the town annually collects more than $1 million in payment in lieu of taxes from the state. Ms Wasserman objected when the D.O.C. wanted to convert one of the hospital buildings into an arsenal to store weapons, but said she supports the general's plans to build an armory for training. 
Newtown has a $3.9 million contract with the state to purchase 186 acres and the buildings on the main campus. Ms. Wasserman also has negotiated the transfer of almost 200 additional acres to Newtown, for a total of about 370 acres under town control. The state still controls more than 400 acres.
The purchase by the town was part of an overall $48.7 million bonding package, approved by taxpayers in June 2001 that included two related propositions. The first, for $21.7 million, included the campus purchase price, plus funding for a master plan, playing-field construction, asbestos removal, building renovation and demolition and environmental insurance.
Another $27 million was approved for a Grades 5 and 6 school at Fairfield Hills, under construction and expected to open in January, in close proximity to the buildings intended for military use.
First Selectman Herb Rosenthal has hired Harrall-Michalowski Associates of Hamden to design a long-term reuse plan. He plans to schedule a public meeting in September, with three alternative proposals, incorporating economic development, recreation, municipal use and open space. Mr. Rosenthal said he generally is aware of the anti-terrorism initiatives General Cugno is planning, but does not know all the details. Although not required, he said he would like the general to inform the town of his intentions.
"The general has a lot of freedom to do what he wants," said Mr. Rosenthal. "I can't see why there would be any objections as long as there are no harmful effects to the town. Improving and upgrading the buildings will make them tie-in better with the town's reuse plans."
Elaine McGuire, the board of education chairwoman, was not aware of the extent of the Military Department's pending presence in such close proximity to the new school, but said she would like to see it lead to a positive partnership.
"The presence of military personnel near the campus will only add to the already secure feeling of our school system," she said. "I am certain the state will work closely with our school administrators to enact the necessary safeguards and make sure the activities of the armory will not interfere with the activities of our student population."
Dr. Karin Harter lives and works at the Berkshire Veterinary Hospital, less than a half-mile from Fairfield Hills. "Well-trained dogs are a pleasure to watch," she said. "This sounds like marvelous opportunity for Newtown and an appropriate use of state lands." 
Mary Maki, president of the Friends of the Library and a member of the Friends of Fairfield Hills Committee, was surprised to hear about the military plans, but also reacted positively to them.
"I can't think of any down-side to the National Guard plans," she said. "On the positive side, it will act as a deterrent to crime around the school and the whole area."
Ms. Maki said the injection of federal money will bring more awareness to Fairfield Hills and may encourage investment of private money into re-development. "Dog shows, horse shows and antique shows are the kind of thing we want to encourage," she said. "This way people come to the campus, spend their money and leave. It's nice to see the property renovated for a good purpose."

BERGAMO FABRICS, a high-end international textile distributor, has moved its world headquarters from the Flatiron district of New York City to a complex of derelict 100-year-old industrial buildings here. The buildings, which housed Consumers Union from 1954 to 1991, have been mostly empty since the nonprofit testing and information organization moved to larger and more modern quarters in Yonkers.
 Bergamo, which sells only to designers and architects, was "desperate for space and suffocating" in 7,500 square feet at 7 West 22nd Street, said Rosencrans Baldwin, the company's president and chief executive. He said the company -- owned by Lorenzo Rubelli, the Italian textile company, and Sahco Hesslein, the German fabric house -- needed to expand but did not want to continue paying $17 a square foot for space in New York City. 
 "In a recession, we felt it was important to work on a budget," Mr. Baldwin said. Bergamo will keep its 4,100-square-foot showroom in the Designers and Decorators building at 979 Third Avenue. But it will also have a showroom here, along with its corporate offices and a warehouse from which designer samples are shipped. 
Mr. Baldwin and Peter Conant, an architect, looked at more than 20 buildings throughout Westchester before making a final decision on the complex of three connected brick structures here. They had considered moving to Long Island City as well as to other locations in Manhattan but ruled them out because rents were too high.
"Actually, we could go any place FedEx and a high-speed transmission line could go," said Mr. Baldwin, who commutes from Darien, Conn., "but we finally focused on Westchester, both because we found space we could afford and because it's within comfortable commuting distance for the employees who moved with us.
"As for choosing the building itself, we just kept coming back again and again to this one. It had the brick walls, the wood floors and the 16-foot ceilings we were looking for."
There were drawbacks, though, that made Mr. Baldwin hesitate at first. "People kept saying, 'Do you really want to be in Mount Vernon? It's dangerous,' " he recalled. In the end, though, Bergamo took 25,000 square feet at $6 a square foot a year on the top two floors of the 85,000-square-foot complex at 256 Washington Street formerly occupied by Consumers.
"In more ways than one, it was a gutsy move," Mr. Conant said. "The space itself before it was renovated was pitiful."
HE said there was much work to do before Bergamo could occupy the building, including shooing off the pigeons that had squatted in unoccupied offices. Old and rotting windows, many stuck shut, were replaced with aluminum double-hung windows and screens, and new heating and air-conditioning were installed, along with wiring for high-speed computer connections.
Also, the warren of small offices and testing labs used by Consumers Union was ripped out, and the entire space was painted white to maximize the new feeling of openness and light.
"The great features of the space were kept to expose the intrinsic beauty of the building," Mr. Conant said. Second-hand furnishings, many of them designer chairs and tables, were bought and covered in Bergamo fabrics.
The complex was built around 1900 and used as a factory until Consumers Union bought the building for its corporate headquarters and testing labs from the General Optical Company late in 1953 for $235,000. The publisher of Consumer Reports sold it in 1991 for $325,000 after it had languished on the market for more than a year, said Dan Franklin, now director of labor relations and employee communications for Consumers Union and formerly its facilities planning manager. 
"It wasn't what you'd call an ideal property," Mr. Franklin, a 23-year employee of Consumers Union, said, explaining that the building was not even suitable for a storage company, because it did not offer large blocks of unbroken space. "I'm glad to see it being put to good use again." 
When Consumers Union moved to a 250,000-square-foot building on Truman Avenue in Yonkers, for which it paid $40 million, the next owner of the Mount Vernon property, Anthony Carpenito of White Plains, spent $500,000 to renovate it. Mr. Carpenito said that for the first few years he owned it, it was empty; at most, it was less than half occupied.
"To really do justice to the building, I would have had to invest even more money," said Mr. Carpenito, who sold it two years ago for $1 million to the present owner, a corporation called 256 Washington Street.
Moshe Altmark and Paul Holand, the two principals of the corporation, own about a million square feet of industrial real estate in the South Bronx. Mr. Holand said the family business, an offshoot of a company started 40 years ago by his father, David Holand, specialized in "diamond-in-the-rough-type buildings with lots of potential." The company also owns a contracting and building supply company, which helps it to keep renovation costs down. 
IN addition to replacing windows, rewiring and renovating space to suit tenants, the company has replaced the roof and upgraded the elevators. 
"When we first saw these buildings, we saw a large potential but also a lot of work, which is what we specialize in," said Mr. Altmark, the elder Mr. Holand's son-in-law. "We go into troubled neighborhoods and restore buildings and, in turn, restore the neighborhood."
Lawrence Talt, the broker for the property, said he was marketing the space to high-end design companies like Bergamo that "may need to maintain a Manhattan address for a showroom or corporate presence, but want to relocate the bulk of their business in an outlying and less expensive place within commuting distance to the city." The building is an eight-minute walk to the Metro-North train station in Mount Vernon.
Also, Mr. Talt noted that the state announced in June that it had designated a two-square-mile Empire Zone in an area of Mount Vernon that includes 256 Washington Street. To encourage private sector investment, job creation and economic growth for the local community, the state provides a wide array of tax benefits for eligible businesses in designated zones.
Businesses operating inside a zone are eligible for tax benefits on new capital investments. Those benefits -- including tax reduction credits, real property tax credits, sales tax exemptions, wage tax credits and utility rate reductions -- can cut a company's tax liability to zero.
For Mount Vernon, the designation will help the city realize its Downtown Revitalization Plan, which includes a $210 million investment for a sports arena project, a 300-room hotel, an office building complex, a convention center and a retail mall. It will also help several manufacturers expand, including any businesses locating at 256 Washington Street that apply for benefits.
Since the designation, the 10-year property tax abatement and sales tax breaks have already helped line up $282.2 million in new investment and nearly 2,000 new jobs for the city, said Mount Vernon's mayor, Ernest D. Davis.
Mount Vernon is the second Westchester community, after Yonkers, to get an Empire Zone designation since the business-incentive program began in 1987.
Mayor Davis said the city would plant cherry trees along Washington Street and install new street lighting "to send a signal that we want to improve the area and welcome new businesses." The timing of the building's renovation, Bergamo's arrival and the Empire Zone designation, he said, "couldn't be better."

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
"IT'S music to my ears!" exclaimed Mayor Joseph M. Delfino one recent morning as he raised the windows in his City Hall office here and listened to the noise outside.
 As he often does these days, Mr. Delfino was monitoring the beeps and chugs of construction equipment coming from several different quarters of the city in recent months. "Even when the noise wakes me before 7, I still love it," said Mayor Delfino, who lives in an apartment close to the central business district, where most of the construction is taking place. 
 Never has the mayor, who was born at St. Agnes Hospital here 69 years ago, witnessed such activity in his hometown. The city, as he says, is undergoing a metamorphosis. In almost any direction one turns this summer, new buildings are rising, and cranes and bulldozers are everywhere. 
By contrast, as recently as the end of 1998, White Plains was a city in decline. The tax base had been falling for more than a decade. And at a time when the availability rate for office space in the county as a whole was 18 percent, this central Westchester city, which was slow to recover from the recession of the early 1990's when many large corporations downsized, was struggling with 30.2 percent of its offices empty.
Now along Mamaroneck Avenue -- the main street of the city where many retail outlets and office buildings have languished in recent years -- Louis R. Cappelli, the Valhalla-based builder, is building a $300 million City Center. In place of an abandoned Macy's department store and other small shops, there are plans for a 15-screen movie theater, a four-star Westin Hotel, stores like Target and Circuit City and six restaurants, some of them national chains, and 600 rental units, all taking up 1.2 million square feet.
Cappelli Enterprises, which built New Roc City, the family entertainment center, in New Rochelle, bought the White Plains site two years ago from Tishman Speyer Properties of Manhattan. The former developer, who planned a similar although smaller mixed-use development, bailed out, in part because of financial problems.
About six blocks from the City Center project, more development is taking place, on the corner of Bloomingdale and Maple Avenues, where Fortunoff, the jewelry and home furnishings retailer, is building a 260,000-square-foot store. The latest Fortunoff project -- where a 128,000-square-foot Saks Fifth Avenue store formerly stood -- will be Fortunoff's first full-size department store in Westchester and its fifth in the New York area suburbs. (Fortunoff has a store in Scarsdale that sells outdoor furniture only and is open from March through Sept. 1.)
Near the Metro-North train station in White Plains, LCOR, a construction firm based in Berwyn, Pa., is building a $137 million apartment complex on a 2.6-acre site that had been considered at different times for an office building, movie theater and hotel. Those proposals failed to move forward, in part because of adverse market conditions in the early 1990's. The site, for decades an empty dirt lot, was often referred to as the city's "hole in the ground." LCOR is building 500 rental units in two towers, which are expected to be ready for occupancy next spring.
IN addition, a $6 million, 70,000-square-foot Stop & Shop is under construction on Westchester Avenue. "We've been a city without a major supermarket, without a movie theater and without any real entertainment to speak of," said George D. Gretsas, the city's executive officer. "Up until recently, there was nada in White Plains."
New apartments had not been built in the city in more than a decade. Now more than 1,700 are under construction. Besides those at City Center, the Seltzer Group, a Manhattan-based development company, is planning to put up the Hamilton, a 106-unit luxury rental apartment building, at the corner of Church Street and Barker Avenue. 
Also planned are 260 apartments on Canfield Avenue by Clayton Park Development of White Plains and Stamford; 281 rental units on Mamaroneck Avenue by the Houston-based JPI Corporation; and 106 units on Church Street by Pappas Development of Boston. 
When they are occupied, all of these new buildings will mean a heftier tax base for the city, with Mr. Cappelli's project expected to generate up to $3.5 million a year in sales tax revenues for the city, according to a study commissioned by the city and Cappelli Enterprises, by the accounting firm Ernst & Young. Fortunoff predicts $60 million in annual sales tax revenues. And that's not to mention a still undetermined amount of revenue from property taxes that the store will pay, said Paul S. Wood, the city's coordinator of economic development. The city's current budget is about $94 million.
The big businesses in White Plains are AT&T, I.B.M., Heineken U.S.A. and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Currently, 53,000 residents call White Plains home. On weekdays, during business hours, 250,000 people fill buildings and parking lots in the business district. But as Mr. Delfino has observed, when the workers go home at the end of the day, the city becomes a ghost town. "You could fire a cannon in the downtown area at night and not hit anybody," he said shortly after taking office four years ago.
The city, which has been the seat of Westchester County government since 1778, underwent a huge urban renewal in the 1970's and 80's, when large sections of the downtown area were bulldozed and residents were moved out to make way for office towers.
Leon Silverman, president of the Silverman Realty Group in White Plains, which owns 300,000 square feet of retail and office space in 11 buildings in the business area, is pleased to see White Plains finally focusing on the downtown residential component. "The city is finally seeing the light -- that the only way it can survive is to bring people back," he said.
Studies have shown that employees spend an average of $5,000 annually in the area where they work, compared with residents, who spend about $19,000 a year, said Kathleen Gunn, executive director of the nonprofit White Plains Downtown District Management Association. 
At the time it undertook the urban renewal project, White Plains also built its first major enclosed mall, the 889,000-square-foot Galleria. But the presence of the new mall forced the existing retail outlets on the city's streets to eke out a living in its shadow. Then in 1995, the shops lining the streets downtown, which was known in more prosperous times as the City of 1,000 Stores, suffered even more when the 1.1-million-square-foot mall, The Westchester, opened with high-end retailers like Neiman Marcus and Tiffany's.
Why has the city taken so long "to see the light," as Mr. Silverman said? Why is it only now luring the kind of development calculated to generate more activity on the streets of downtown and provide a larger pool of workers to fill some of the vacant space that persists in the office towers? (As of the second quarter of this year, the availability rate for offices in the central business district was 21.6 percent, compared with the rate for the county, which was 15.5 percent, according to Insignia/ESG, a commercial real estate firm.)
Some people, including Mr. Silverman, credit Mr. Delfino with turning the city around. Others, like William M. King, a member of the city's Common Council, said he and a fellow board member, Ben Boykin, campaigned two-and-a-half years ago for change, and voters responded. Their election, in addition to the mayor's efforts, he said, sent a signal to developers that White Plains was encouraging development and wanted results soon. 
"There was all the built-up frustration with projects that never got off the ground," Mr. King said. As an example, he cited the infamous "hole in the ground," over which many battles were fought by developers and the Common Council before LCOR won city approval to build apartments there.
Some have pointed fingers at the city's often-fractious Common Council, whose six elected members reviewed and often fought over development proposals. But a former councilwoman, Mary Ann Keenan, said in large part, the successes now are a result of luck and timing.
"The Common Council was never antidevelopment," she said. "When we objected to a project, it was for a good reason. It's coincidence that everything is happening all at once." 
She speculated that the economy and the current low interest rates are also playing major roles in the development now. Mr. Cappelli agreed, saying that the current recession is providing an ideal business climate in which to invest in White Plains, because construction costs are low.
But also, the city initiated a coordinated review four years ago to simplify procedures for developers. Builders now sit down at a table with all of the city officials needed to approve a proposal, instead of being forced to go from office to office. "That process has streamlined what was a long, arduous task," said Salvatore Campofranco, senior vice president of Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, which owns property in both Westchester and Fairfield Counties. 
Mr. Cappelli said he experienced no problems working with the city on his proposal. But the negotiations with Tishman Speyer, the previous developer, were reportedly frequently contentious, according to news reports of Common Council meetings at the time. 
There have always been compelling reasons for a builder to persist in White Plains despite the earlier economic problems that plagued the city and its alleged reputation for being against development, Mr. Cappelli said. The city's strongest selling point, he said, is its location in the center of the county, with a number of major north-south highways making it accessible.
"To me, building in White Plains is equivalent to building at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue in New York City," he said. "They're both prime locations."
Roads in the city were already in place when Mr. Cappelli first proposed his development, an advantage for any developer, he said. White Plains also offered an abundance of Class A office space and two major shopping centers. What it lacked was a large number of people living in the downtown. Thus, the need for apartments. 
Mr. Cappelli describes himself as a catalyst in White Plains, one of the first developers to break ground here in recent years. But, he said, "It hasn't taken much to stir up the others waiting in the wings."
David Seltzer, president of the Seltzer Group, agreed that Mr. Cappelli has played a critical role, especially by building a movie theater downtown. "White Plains is finally about to become a 24-hour city," he said, "and now people will want to live here." 
The Seltzer Group is marketing the Hamilton's luxury apartments -- a two-bedroom unit will rent for about $3,500 a month -- to empty-nesters who no longer want to maintain their large Westchester homes, divorced people, younger working couples who are not ready to buy a house and business people in White Plains on a one- or two-year assignment. For the most part, they will be affluent renters who would not want to move to a city where the sidewalks are rolled up at night, Mr. Seltzer said.
THE new demographics evolving in White Plains are a draw for retailers like Louis Fortunoff. In addition to its Fifth Avenue store, the chain has suburban stores in Westbury on Long Island, and in Wayne, Woodbridge and Paramus in New Jersey. Mr. Fortunoff, the grandson of Max and Clara Fortunoff who opened their first store in Brooklyn in 1922, said that Fortunoff today chooses areas where there are at least 200,000 households with an average income of $75,000 or more within a 15-mile radius.
As of 1999, the median household income for White Plains was $58,545, said Mr. Wood, the city's economic development coordinator. That is expected to go up when the new apartments -- most of them high-end rentals -- are rented out. White Plains also draws affluent shoppers from other Westchester communities like Scarsdale and Purchase. The Westchester mall is a particular magnet. 
Looking ahead, the goal will be to maintain the small-town feeling that has always characterized White Plains, even as the city grows and becomes more prosperous, Mr. King said.
"It has to continue to be a livable city," he said. "We can't just build something and say, 'O.K., that's all done.' We have to keep improving on what we have."
Dean J. Shapiro, the executive director of Insignia/ESG's Westchester and Fairfield office, predicted that the construction taking place now would generate more growth in the city.
"Low-end retail will become high-end, which will in turn generate more restaurants, a stronger tax base and more residents who will push for more and better schools," Mr. Shapiro said. "The city has sown a lot of seeds, but it has to make sure that these new developments don't become self-contained, like the malls. With them, people drive into White Plains, do their shopping and go home, without using the city's other amenities. Any new development must be pedestrian-oriented and spread outward."
Mr. Boykin, the president of the Common Council, said that some residents have expressed concerns about added traffic and worried that the city may be developing too fast. "You always get those who have some objections," he said, "but the council is carefully managing what is taking place. We're not anticipating problems."

Still Standing: A Landmark Skyscraper
THE cityscape is changing rapidly in downtown White Plains, but at least one building along Mamaroneck Avenue is staying the same. Except for its occupants, little has changed over the years at the People's National Bank and Trust Company building, which was built in the late 1920's on the eve of the Great Depression.
The first skyscraper in the city, the nine-story bank building with its bronze front doors is now the home of the Westchester Arts Council. No longer the tallest building in the city -- it is dwarfed by the Westchester County Courthouse, which is more than twice its height -- it remains a a rare example of early 20th-century neo-Classical-style architecture in White Plains. 
When Janet T. Langsam, the executive director of the Arts Council, first learned that the building was for sale several years ago, she decided that it deserved a future as distinguished as its past. 
When the group moved to its new headquarters in 1999, it became one of the first concerns to commit itself to the future of the city's central business district.
"An arts council should be in the heart of a downtown, accessible to the people," Ms. Langsam said, "no matter what the profile of that downtown is at a particular moment." 
The city razed many of its older structures in the 1970's as part of an urban renewal project, but the bank is now on both the National and State Registers of Historic Places. That status guarantees that all changes must be in keeping with the character of the building and must be approved by the State Historic Preservation Office. The Arts Exchange, as the building is now called, is next door to the construction site for the $300 million City Center.
The Arts Exchange, which has galvanized metal windows, decorative details on the facade, distinctive brickwork and a copper pitched roof, was designed by Harold P. Zoller, a White Plains resident. It has a penthouse, which was used as a boardroom and features a Palladian-style window overlooking the city. 
The building houses a performance and gallery space in the lobby, 21 studios for artists and offices for the Arts Council and several other cultural organizations. 
The Arts Council has raised $3.2 million toward its goal of $5 million to restore and renovate the headquarters and to establish an endowment of $1 million to support services to Westchester-based artists and cultural organizations.
The Arts Council, a nonprofit group, provides financial and technical support to artists, cultural organizations and education programs. 
J. P. Morgan Chase & Company, which held the $1.35 million mortgage on the 57,000-square-foot structure, donated the building last year to the organization on the condition that it continue its mission to take the arts to underserved populations throughout Westchester. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: Keeping Wide Open Spaces Wide Open 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
WHITE pine are tenaciously rooted in the craggy rocks of a spit of land jutting into Sterling Lake.
 The lake is a centerpiece of Sterling Forest in Orange County, N.Y., where -- from the top of its 65-foot fire tower -- an undulating horizon of treetops is barely perceptibly pierced by the highest slivers of the Manhattan skyline, 35 miles to the south. 
 Were it not for the coming together of the federal government and two state governments, New York and New Jersey, at the cajoling of a coalition of nonprofit land trusts and private foundations, 15,000 homes might have been built on the forest's 20,000 acres, right up to the lake's shoreline.
In western Connecticut, where for more than a century one water company had closely managed 18,000 acres of woodlands and reservoirs with an eye toward ensuring the quality of its product, the uproar sparked by members of one local land trust over plans to sell 740 acres for homes and a golf course led to the completion of a deal, on March 28, to protect all of the forest in perpetuity. 
From the wetlands of Barnegat Bay on the Jersey coast, where tract development has nosed toward the shoreline, to a drug smuggler's government-seized hideaway overlooking Lake George, to dozens of community gardens dotting the five boroughs of New York City, land trusts have made remarkable strides in preserving open space during the last 10 or 12 years.
Some developers are distressed; some, despite serious philosophical differences with the preservationists, seek compromise, a balance of interests.
The Land Trust Alliance, as its name implies, is a coalition of 950 of the 1,263 land preservation organizations in the nation. According to the alliance, the total number of acres protected in New York State through the efforts of local and regional land trusts (not including acreage held by federal, state and local governments) catapulted from 70,938 in 1990 to 552,220 acres in 2000 -- a 678 percent increase.
In New Jersey, the number of acres protected by land trusts rose 122 percent, from 62,347 to 138,249 over the decade. In Connecticut, there was a 95 percent increase, from 36,034 to 70,361. (An acre is 91 percent of a football field.)
And the pattern held across the country. The total acreage in the nation protected by land trusts rose 226 percent, from 1,908,547 in 1990 to 6,225,225 in 2000 -- an area twice the size of Connecticut. At the same time, the number of land trusts increased from 887 to 1,263.
The Land Trust Alliance also calculated the combined acreage protected in each state through actions taken by the federal government, state or local governments and the land trusts. Of New York State's total of 30,220,000 acres, 5,608,431 acres -- or 19 percent -- had been protected as of Dec. 31, 2000. Of the 3,101,000 acres in Connecticut, 438,754 -- or 14 percent -- were protected by the end of the decade. And of New Jersey's 4,747,000 acres, 1,314,554 -- or 28 percent -- had been protected.
"The growth in land conservation has been tremendous," said Andrew Zepp, the alliance's vice president for programs. "Local conservation groups flourished, particularly in the 90's, whether they were professionally staffed, like the Peconic Land Trust on Long Island, or all-volunteer groups like we see all over New Jersey."
"These represent increased efforts on the part of communities to shape their futures," Mr. Zepp continued. "So we're seeing stronger partnerships between land trusts and government."
Martin Ginsburg, a developer who has cooperated with preservationists, is concerned. Mr. Ginsburg is president of GDC, which has built about 3,000 homes, most of them town houses in Westchester, Rockland and Fairfield Counties. "There are tensions between developers and preservationists," he said, "because open-space advocates are totally focused on preservation, and it's not possible to have preservation of everything and also have development. Development, by its nature, requires that you disturb some segment of the environment."
These days, Mr. Ginsburg contends, every community perceives every potential development site as potential preservable space. "There used to be a perception that there were zoned rights, that if the property was zoned a certain way the property owner had rights to develop," Mr. Ginsburg said. 
"Well," he said, referring particularly to Westchester, "that perception is no longer valid in most communities."
These days, just about every project must go through an environmental review "that can throw out the project," he said. "If the community doesn't want the project, the environmental review becomes a tremendously time-consuming and expensive process that can cost millions with the end result that the community can say they don't want it, on environmental grounds. And then, of course, you go to court."
MANY communities think they are preserving space by upzoning -- allowing fewer homes on larger lots. "That actually plays into and contributes to sprawl, which everybody is against," Mr. Ginsburg said. "Their responses are contributing to exactly what they think is anathema."
Ezra Milchman, the northeast regional director of the Land Trust Alliance, concurs with that assessment. "We call that sort of development, 'loving it to death,' " Mr. Milchman said.
What is needed is "smart growth," Mr. Ginsburg said. "You have to say these are the spaces we want to preserve and these are the areas that are located appropriately for denser development."
Mr. Ginsburg pointed to Wildwood, 62 acres in Greenburgh, N.Y., where his company sold 42 acres to the town for open space for $2.5 million, then built 86 homes on just 10 of the remaining 20 acres.
With a particular eye toward the towns and villages that necklace the Hudson River, Mr. Ginsburg said, "Development should be in proximity to mass transit, such as railroad stations, ferries." 
And there is a difference between preservation and redevelopment, he said: "Where the river was the driver of the local economy and the economy went bad, the whole village suffered. If you take the potential resource for revitalization and waste it by just making it greenfields and ball fields, you don't benefit the local economy."
The Sterling Forest deal, however, had nothing to do with redevelopment.
The 20,000 acres of highland woods have been wild since dinosaurs roamed what was then a tropical forest 65 million years ago, and certainly since retreating glaciers carved out the Ramapo River and regional lakes 14,000 years ago.
In the early 1700's, the Earl of Stirling purchased the land from the Iroquois. And in 1776, Gen. George Washington and his battered brigades fled north through the forest after barely escaping the British occupation of New York City.
In the words of its manager, Jim Gell, Sterling Forest State Park remains "a keystone in a greenbelt of nearly unfragmented forest -- not even farmlands -- that stretches from the Delaware Water Gap across northern New Jersey, across the Hudson into Connecticut, on into Massachusetts."
"We have bobcats, black bear -- not just a few," Mr. Gell continued, "numerous rare and endangered species, including the timber rattlesnake, red-shouldered hawks. We have a tremendous variety of butterflies; people drive across the country to look at butterflies in the park."
"It's amazing that it's so close to New York City, less than 35 miles to the Empire State Building," he said, "and yet so wild."
Eric Kulleseid, the New York State director of the Trust for Public Land, began fighting to keep it wild in the mid-90's when, four decades and several ownership shifts after the Harriman family first sold the property, a subsidiary of the Swiss-owned Zurich Insurance Group sought to turn the forest "into a huge residential area for 35,000 people, about 15,000 homes."
A coalition comprising the Trust for Public Land, the Open Space Institute, the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Foundation and the Victoria Foundation lobbied government officials at all levels and raised private funds to protect the forest forever.
The would-be developer had not yet filed plans when, in 1997, the land trusts negotiated an option to purchase the first 17,000 acres for $55 million, with a year to raise the money. (Later, $9 million would be raised to buy another 1,000 acres.) The Zurich Insurance Group "chose to take cash rather than go through the vicissitudes of the development market," Mr. Kulleseid said. 
No single entity was willing to take on the $55 million price tag. "So, with the encouragement of Governor Pataki, New York State stepped in and pledged $16 million," Mr. Kulleseid said. "Then we secured an additional $10 million from New Jersey, even though it wasn't in New Jersey." 
Mr. Gell, the park manager, explained that more than two million people in New Jersey drink water from Sterling Forest. "It feeds the Wanaque Reservoir and the Ramapo Watershed," he said.
Mr. Kulleseid continued, "Then we secured $17 million from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, and an additional $12 million in private funding from both the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Foundation -- those are the founders of Reader's Digest -- and the Victoria Foundation in New Jersey." 
In February 1998, the property was transferred to New York State, guaranteed as open public parkland. "That was a huge, huge deal; that much land so close to the city," Mr. Kulleseid said.
Forty miles farther from the city, the Lundy estate -- 5,400 acres that connect a stretch of cliff called the Shawangunk Ridge to the Catskill Forest Preserve -- is another of those places where leaves whisper in the wind without even a hum from a highway.
The property had been the weekend retreat of Frederick Lundy, founder of the famous restaurant in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, who first began accumulating its 95 tax lots in the 1920's. 
Two weeks ago, picnickers from several land trusts and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation gathered at a spot on the Lundy property along Vernooys Kill (kill is Dutch for brook) where rock sculptures are carved by the swirling stream just before it cascades.
The picnic at the swimming hole celebrated the transfer of the property to New York State in a $4 million deal that came about only after plans for a theme park on the Lundy land collapsed. "It's pristine woodlands," said Jennifer Grossman, vice president for land acquisition for the Open Space Institute. "This piece provides us with a key link to the Catskill Forest, and it is becoming public."
Andy Burgher, the land surveyor and title historian on the project for the state conservation agency, said: "Originally, the land was made up of patents granted by Queen Anne and King George in the 1700's to a few families, including the Vernooys." Over the next three centuries, descendants of those settlers, Mr. Burgher said, "worked mostly as millers -- grist mills for flour -- and blacksmiths; they made axes, and ax handles from the ash trees." 
By the 1950's, Mr. Lundy had bought all 5,400 acres. "It was his place to escape to from Brooklyn," Mr. Burgher said. Mr. Lundy died in 1977 and, eventually, the executor of his estate sold the property to the Litas Investment Corporation.
"They were planning a kind of Euro Disney -- a theme park about the size of Disney World, but like the Black Forest," Mr. Burgher said. "But Litas never could get all the money together." In January 2000, the land was purchased by the Open Space Institute and the Trust for Public Land for transfer to the state.
THE Sterling Forest and Lundy deals were both what preservationists refer to as fee acquisitions, direct purchases of property by a land trust or a government agency, as opposed to easement transactions in which the owner retains title to the property but agrees to bar development in perpetuity.
"Easements are always much more complicated than outright purchases," Mr. Kulleseid of the Trust for Public Land said, "because you need to negotiate how the owners will be able to use the property, how the easement is going to be enforced, how it will be monitored."
Typically, under an easement, the land trust will negotiate the price and conditions, then hold the contract until a government agency completes its due diligence and "brings the check to the table," Mr. Kulleseid said. "The attractive thing to landowners is that they get cash to add to their reserves or to make improvements, but still own that property."
The protection of what have come to be called the Kelda lands -- 15,340 acres of watershed in western Connecticut -- involved both types of transactions, said David Sutherland, government relations director for the Connecticut chapter of the Nature Conservancy.
"It used to be the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company, the major supplier of water in Fairfield County," Mr. Sutherland said. "They've been around for a century and always managed the land with the goal of preserving water quality." In January 2001, Bridgeport Hydraulic and its major subsidiary, Aquarion, were acquired by the Kelda Group, a British utility company.
But the idea of preserving all the Kelda lands got its start five years ago when Aquarion announced plans to sell 740 acres in the towns of Weston and Easton for $14 million to National Fairways Inc. "They planned to build about 130 houses -- little bitty 6,000-square-foot shacks -- and a golf course," Mr. Sutherland said.
"But in Connecticut," he continued, "there's a state law that says that if a water company is selling land, once they've signed a contract there's a 100-day period within which government or land trusts can take over the contract."
With 45 minutes to go before the deadline of 5 p.m. on June 5, 1998, a local preservation group, the Aspetuck Land Trust, with backing from the Nature Conservancy, declared its commitment to raise $8 million, which, along with $6 million from the state, covered the $14 million cost of the purchase.
"The controversy over that land was very visible," Mr. Sutherland said. "When the state, the conservancy and the Aspetuck Land Trust agreed to do that deal, it really laid the groundwork to acquire the entire Kelda property."
A regional group, the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, built a coalition of local land trusts calling for the preservation of all the Kelda lands, with the idea that the state would create a regional water authority. At the same time, Mr. Sutherland said, his group was "pursuing what you might call a traditional land-acquisition deal, both fee and easement."
"Even though ours is the one that ended up happening," he said, "the organizing they did certainly helped garner political support for the deal that eventually happened." The Kelda lands were appraised at $193 million, but the company agreed to sell parcels or easements in 24 different Connecticut municipalities for a total of $90 million. The state allocated $80 million; the Nature Conservancy donated $10 million.
"We had identified eight areas around Connecticut as our best opportunities to preserve large, primarily contiguous blocks of forest land," Mr. Sutherland said. "Over half of Kelda's land fell right in the heart of two of those areas." The deal closed on March 28.
Sometimes preservation is not a big deal. In New York City, about 120 community gardens that former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wanted to auction off for housing have been purchased by the Trust for Public Land and New York Restoration, a group financed by Bette Midler. 
Along with its missions to provide technical assistance and foster cooperation between local land trusts, particularly for large-scale preservation projects, the Land Trust Alliance, based in Washington, also promotes legislation aimed at, among other things, creating tax incentives for owners who agree to preserve their property.
"We're pushing a new federal tax deduction that would make a 50 percent cut in your capital gains tax if you sell land to a nonprofit or a government agency for conservation," said Mr. Milchman, the northeast director for the alliance. And on a state level in New York, for example, Mr. Milchman said, the alliance has successfully lobbied for legislation to complement that federal initiative -- a Conservation Donor Tax Credit recently passed by the Legislature.
"Very simply, land owners who donate property or easements could claim half of the value of the gift on their state income tax return as a credit," Mr. Milchman said. "Let's say you owe $5,000 in state income tax and you donated a $10,000 easement -- you would get a credit of 50 percent of the value of the gift, or $5,000, which you can spread out over 11 years." Gov. George E. Pataki -- whom Mr. Milchman commended as having "demonstrated a strong commitment to public-private partnership in land conservation" -- now has the bill on his desk. The governor had proposed a 25 percent tax credit spread over six years.
IT was another sort of government action that led to the preservation of Pilot's Knob Ridge, a lookout point 2,000 feet above the south end of Lake George from which, on a clear day, the jagged peaks of the Adirondacks are visible.
Perhaps the owner of those 223 acres should have been looking down, not out, that day in November 1984, when, as Lynn Schumann, director of the Lake George Land Conservancy, put it, "federal agents in their black suits came from all directions to arrest him while he was drinking bourbon with a neighbor."
"This gentleman was running from the law, a marijuana smuggler," Ms. Schumann said. "He had built a road and a very unimposing home on the property. This was his hideaway."
All around the south basin of the 32-mile-long lake, Ms. Schumann continued, "people considered the house an eyesore for its clear-cut in the mountainside and bright lights at night."
The property was seized by the government and resold to a local family who held it for 10 years. In August 2000, the family sold the land to the Lake George conservancy for $575,000 -- $220,000 less than the $795,000 bid by a developer who planned to clear timber for several building lots.
And on a Friday in September 2001, "with dozens of spectators down below on their lawns and numerous boats anchored in the lake," Ms. Schumann said, "cheers went up as we razed the house, piece by piece."
In the last 14 years, using $14 million in private donations and state funds, the lake conservancy has protected 7,275 acres, including 26,500 feet of shoreline. And since its acquisition, Pilot's Knob Ridge has been opened to the public, with a two-mile loop for hiking and a gazebo overlooking Dome Island, just offshore, a nearly perfect cakelike isle of hemlock, beech and oak.
The ridge also looks down on two parallel peninsulas, Cleverdale and Assembly Point, stretching a mile or so into the lake -- each dotted by large homes.

HEADLINE: Mr. Nice Guy With the State's Toughest Job 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
HERE, as in most political centers, you can eventually find someone with something bad to say about almost anyone. The more visible the person, the easier it is to find detractors. John E. McCormac, the state treasurer, might be the exception.
 Talk to power players lurking throughout the State House about the 44-year-old Mr. McCormac, and the conversation eventually gets around to the same point. 
 "He is a nice guy," says Senate John O. Bennett, the Republican who share's the chamber's presidency with his Democratic counterpart, Richard J. Codey. 
As Senator Robert E. Littell, a Republican who is cochairman of the Budget Committee, put it: "He is fine to work with. He is a very regular guy."
And that is the word from the opposition party.
What is even more impressive is that Mr. McCormac -- who was chosen by his longtime friend and colleague Governor McGreevey to be the state treasurer at a particularly perilous time for New Jersey -- seems to have pulled off a difficult political feat: helping to produce one of the most controversial and hard-fought state budgets in recent memory without making any visible enemies across the legislative aisle.
In the past several months, Mr. McCormac has faced a $6 billion deficit for fiscal 2003, a $3 billion shortfall for the fiscal year 2002 and a loss of $22 billion in state investments.
But perhaps he became best known early on his watch when he found himself at the center of a public relations battle during which the governor's press office refused to allow reporters to quote him during a question-and-answer session about the proposed budget. Mr. McCormac retreated from the room without speaking a word after the meeting degenerated into a shouting match. The session effectively ended when the roomful of reporters walked out soon afterward.
Even the people who opposed the governor's plan to raise revenue most vigorously -- particularly by increasing the taxes paid by corporations -- go out of their way to speak kindly about the tall, stocky bear of a man.
"I might not have liked his answers, but he always gave me answers," said Arthur Maurice, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the state's largest business organization. "It would have been easier to fight him if he wasn't so likable."
Normally, people cannot remember -- and don't particularly care -- who the state treasurer is, much less whether he is likable. But Mr. McCormac finds himself in the odd position of being a civil servant thrust into a harsh spotlight. Like a volunteer fire chief during a nationally televised rescue or a health commissioner during the outbreak of a virulent disease, Mr. McCormac accepted a $137,000-a-year job -- far less than he was earning in his own accounting firm -- that was supposed to be about the routine and was suddenly given the very public responsibility of fending off impending fiscal disaster.
It might be a good match, considering that the governor -- who has worked with Mr. McCormac for more than 10 years -- described him as a man who "is envigorated by challenges." So far that seems to be true.
"I enjoy this job tremendously," Mr. McCormac said during a recent interview in his State House office. 
And it is an unusual office for a state treasurer, reflective of Mr. McCormac's reputation as a die-hard baseball fan. The walls are covered with posters of players, and tiny models of stadiums crowd a table near the entrance. A photograph of Joe DiMaggio hangs in a spot of honor in the middle of the room's most prominent wall.
He said, "DiMaggio went up before my treasurer's plaque."
Mr. McCormac has been a baseball fan ever since his father and a group of friends traveled to Yankee Stadium when Mr. McCormac was 6. "I got a Tom Tresh bat," he said.
He doesn't recall who won the game, but he does remember almost catching a foul ball. "My friend's father got it," he said.
He still plays catcher for the Knights of Columbus softball team with friends from elementary school. The way Governor McGreevey puts it, Mr. McCormac considers softball "a combat sport."
"Slow pitch," Mr. McCormac said. "We're too old for fast pitch" -- not that his new job has left much time for batting practice. "I think I have missed more games this year than I have in the past years combined."
Born in Irvington and reared in Woodbridge, Mr. McCormac grew up in a boisterous house filled with three boys and two girls. As the eldest, he helped his father, the foreman of a steel plant, and his mother, a housewife, keep the mayhem to a minimum. He went on to marry his high school sweetheart, Tammy, and today they have a 12-year-old daughter. He received his bachelor's degree from Rutgers University in 1980, and then attended night school at St. John's on Staten Island, where he earned a master's degree. After working for a large accounting firm for eight years, he founded McCormac & Company in Woodbridge, specializing in government finance.
He received his introduction to politics 12 years ago when he met Mr. McGreevey -- also a resident of Woodbridge and a member of the Assembly, on St. Patrick's Day at the Knights of Columbus in Iselin. At the time, Mr. McCormac was the chapter's grand knight and Mr. McGreevey was an ambitious politician with a plan to change the system in their hometown. The two men talked briefly at a reception after the parade and agreed to meet for breakfast at the Landmark Inn in Woodbridge.
Mr. McCormac liked Mr. McGreevey's plan to streamline the town's financial management, and when Mr. McGreevey said he wanted to run for mayor, Mr. McCormac agreed to help with the campaign. After Mr. McGreevey won, he asked Mr. McCormac to become the town's chief financial officer. "It was a monumental task" to reorganize the town's finances, Mr. McCormac said.
He added: "It was, on a smaller scale, the same type of problems we faced this year in the state. There was a $24 million shortfall on a $60 million budget."
He took the job, and today he cites construction of the Woodbridge Community Center as his proudest moment in government. The 110,000-square-foot center, which includes a gym and a skating rink, was financed with corporate gifts and user fees.
"It was one of Mayor McGreevey's biggest achievements in 10 years in Woodbridge," he said.
He likes to explain that period this way: After Mr. McGreevey took office, the state audited the town's books and found more than 100 areas that needed improvement. "When we left office, the state only found one," he said. "We were issuing dog licenses out of sequence."
When Mayor McGreevey finally became governor after losing to Christie Whitman his first time around, he again turned to Mr. McCormac to handle the books, this time as the state treasurer. When some people balked, questioning whether Mr. McCormac had the experience to manage a budget as large and complex as New Jersey's, the new governor said he was confident in the selection.
"I needed a strong, competent fiscal officer," Governor McGreevey said in a recent interview. He said Mr. McCormac's experience in municipal finance, as well as his background operating an accounting firm, gave him the necessary experience.
Equally important, Mr. McCormac's loyalty to Mr. McGreevey was beyond question.
When he took on the job, Mr. McCormac sold his interest in his accounting firm. He said he was not worried about assuming responsibility for the state's finances because the principals of the state budget and the Woodbridge town budget were essentially the same. 
"It is the same way to manage the operations," he said. "I just had to get used to saying billions instead of millions."
But with the economy retracting and a crisis looming, Mr. McCormac was soon deep in negotiations with legislative leaders over how best to balance the budget. It is difficult to say how much independence Mr. McCormac had over decisions that the governor was constantly monitoring.
For his part, Governor McGreevey insists that Mr. McCormac has never been shy about voicing his opinion on -- or his opposition to -- the governor's ideas. But he said that cornerstone of the new budget, like the tightening of loopholes in the corporate business tax, were hammered out by a team of financial advisers rather than one person.
Unlike states like New York, where the chief financial officer is independently elected, New Jersey's treasurer -- like every other official in the state other than the legislative leaders -- serves at the pleasure of the governor.
And in this administration, there seems to be an exclamation point at the end of that.
"This administration likes to discuss budgetary matters from the front office," said Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican from Flemington who sits on the Finance Committee. Mr. McCormac, he said, "implements the policies of the governor."
Other legislators involved in the budget negotiations agreed that most of the crucial decisions were referred to the governor, although Mr. McCormac had the authority to negotiate many areas.
"He handles his own domain, but he takes orders from outside," said Senator Bennett.
Still, Senator Bernard F. Kenney Jr., a Democratic from Hoboken who is on the Budget Committee, said people underestimated how much influence Mr. McCormac had over the negotiations. Although the governor made the policy decisions, Mr. Kenney said, Mr. McCormac mastered the technical intricacies of the financial plan.
"He is able to grasp difficult material and to articulate it in terms that legislators can understand, and that is a skill that is rare," Mr. Kenney said.
More than that, Senator Kenney -- who sponsored the legislation to toughen the corporate business tax -- said Mr. McCormac "made it clear that he was not just a figurehead."
"He was in fact the top dog in terms of understanding the material and defending it," he said.
Mr. Kenney recalled one heated moment during negotiations over changes to the corporate business tax -- it was well after midnight and committee members from both sides were still closeted in a meeting room near the Senate chamber -- when "a senior official" called Mr. McCormac on his cellphone and told him that questions were being raised about the treasurer's budget calculations. Mr. McCormac, turning stern in an instant, made his position unmistakably clear.
"He is always very agreeable, but he is also very competitive and very sure of himself," Mr. Kenney said. "He got red in the face and said, 'Nobody knows numbers like I know numbers.' And that was that."

HEADLINE: DOWN THE SHORE; 
One Hot Season

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: NORTH WILDWOOD 

 BODY:
THE Ramirez family was in from Puerto Rico for the week, the three young children splashing up a storm at the Packard Hotel pool, chattering and giggling under the plastic palms.
 Lounging nearby were the LeClerqs, in from Quebec, trying to decide when to wander up to the Boardwalk. 
 On the Boardwalk at Morey's Pier, Sean O'Malley, a student from Ireland, had brought "The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr." to his post, where he operated a kiddy slide, but was too busy to read it.
While it might be a stretch to say that the Jersey Shore has become an international hot spot for vacationers, the presence of the LeClerqs and the Ramirezes is proof enough of boom times at the beach even though -- or perhaps because -- the stock market's breathtaking plunge makes Sean's sliding board look more like a curb. 
"Merchants may always like to grumble, but I really don't know anyone who is doing badly this summer," said Laurie Sullivan, an associate in the Wildwood Information Bureau. "It has been hot, so people are at the beach or in the pool in the daytime. But at night, oh my gosh, I've never seen it so busy. You just can't move."
Nor is it simply the summer surfer or sunshine patron looking for a little slice of heaven for a day or a weekend or a week somewhere along the 127-mile-long New Jersey coastline. Buyers are flocking to Wildwood in numbers that haven't been seen in decades. Last month, the city put up a property a block from the bay for auction. Swollen with optimism because of recent good times, the city hoped it would get $150,000. The property sold for $308,000, and it is hoped the buyer will build upscale condominiums there.
"I would have never thought I would see a $300,000 property in my lifetime here, but the shore boom is hitting all over, I hear," Ms. Sullivan said.
She hears right. In Stone Harbor, where the price of admission is considerably steeper, of the 41 single-family houses sold in the first half of 2002, none went for less than $300,000. In fact, the average selling price for those properties was $1,102,981. 
And in Sea Isle City, two towns north of Stone Harbor and long known as a middle-class resort, the average house sold for $499,631 this year, about three times what it was just six years ago.
"There has been no letup in the sales of shore properties," said Gwen Pastorelli, a real estate saleswoman with the Mary Holder Agency in Sea Girt. "People are taking money out of the stock market, and with interest rates so low, they have just kept buying."
What's more, Ms. Pastorelli said, the buying also makes things more attractive for renters. Even in Asbury Park, a city torn down but not even close to being rebuilt, properties have been gobbled up by those willing to stay, or at least to renovate.
"Eventually, that will mean more places for people to go at the shore, so that is good for everyone," Ms. Pastorelli said.
As with Asbury Park, Atlantic City -- another shore town trying to recapture its lost luster -- is showing evidence of better times this summer. The Trump Organization, for instance, which operates three casinos in Atlantic City and derives most of its revenue from them, realized its first second-quarter profit in seven years.
Gary Israel, a spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which oversees the Atlantic City Expressway, said that so far this year, the number of vehicles to pass through the toll booths was up 12.8 percent over the same period last year -- 29.1 million versus 25.8 million.
"The Jersey Shore certainly benefits from whatever fallout there is over 9/11," said Mr. Israel. "But these numbers don't even count July 4, which was by far a record."
What's more, said Mr. Israel, people are not only driving to the Shore, but flying. The authority, which also oversees Atlantic City International Airport, has seen the number of commercial passengers increase 3.6 percent so far this year.
Still, there may be a bit of a cloud on the horizon for the rest of the summer, warned John Atwood, whose family has owned the Sun N Sand Motel in Stone Harbor for 50 years.
The weekends of Memorial Day and July Fourth were as busy as he has ever seen, said Mr. Atwood, but some of the air has escaped from the balloon since then.
"When the stock market went down again, I think people said, 'Hey, Martha, we just lost another $8,000, maybe we won't go to the shore this month,' " he said.
While that might not be apparent to weekend renters who book in the winter and spring, he said, motel owners make much of their money from last-minute business.
"I'm sitting on an empty room tonight," Mr. Atwood said last week. "That shouldn't happen this time of year. But I hear things are good in Wildwood and Ocean City, so, you know, everyone has slower times and other people have it good. I just hope this doesn't say anything about next year."
If the LeClerqs -- visiting North Wildwood for the fourth time in six years -- are any indication, it will not.
"It is still less expensive than going to Europe or California," said Rene LeClerq.

How to Find a Job? Try Hiring a Sleuth

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
SO here's a little mystery. The New York State Department of Labor says that roughly 232,000 people in the state have collected unemployment benefits under the special program adopted by the federal government after Sept. 11. The program gives up to 13 weeks of benefits to anyone who uses up the traditional six months of unemployment insurance and still hasn't found a job.
 But of those 232,000 -- and that by no means represents all unemployed workers -- only 72,000 were still getting benefits in mid-July. So what happened to the other 160,000? Did they find jobs? Or did they just run out of benefits and luck? 
 The Labor Department says it hasn't a clue. "The official short answer is, we actually don't have that information," said Robert M. Lillpopp, a department spokesman.
But, he added, the department thinks at least some people have found work. The state's most recent job fair in New York City drew more than 3,000 people, he said; they could apply for 1,500 jobs with 70 employers, including airlines, department stores and the New York City Police Department.
Less optimistic clues to the mystery can be found in a new series of job-related data put together by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Known as JOLTS, for job openings and labor turnover, the series is rather limited, covering only one year so far, and doesn't include details on individual states. But the picture it paints is none too pretty, especially in the Northeast. 
Start with the number of job openings, which are jobs that employers are actively seeking to fill within 30 days. 
In May, the most recent month for which there is data, 3.46 million jobs were open across the country, which sounds all right until you discover that last year at the same time there were 4.34 million openings. That works out to a drop of about 884,000, or 20 percent.
And in the Northeast, things were even worse. Even in 2001, this area of the country had fewer job openings than in the South, the Midwest or the West. And by May 2002, the number of openings had fallen by 29 percent, or about 250,000, to 604,000.
But it could be worse. In the Midwest, job openings plunged by 313,000, or 31 percent. Best off was the South, which had the most openings to begin with (about 1.5 million) and lost the fewest (122,000, or about 8 percent). Grits, anyone?
The big drops in job openings, nationally, came in two economically sensitive areas: construction and retailing.
The Labor Department also estimates the number of people hired in a month. In May, nationally, almost 4.9 million people got jobs (or got called back to their old ones, if they had been laid off). That's another figure that sounds pretty good, until you find out that in May 2001, almost 5.7 million people were hired. So hiring fell by 14 percent compared with last year. 
Once again, the situation was bleakest in the Northeast and the Midwest, and best in the South. The Midwest suffered a greater drop in the number of new hires, which fell by 283,000, versus 218,000 in the Northeast. But the Northeast experienced a bigger percentage decline (21 percent, versus 19 percent in the Midwest). In the South, hiring declined by less than 9 percent.
One bright note in all this dark data is that fewer people lost their jobs in May 2002 than in the same month a year earlier. 
Nationally, layoffs and discharges edged down from 1.6 million to 1.35 million; in the Northeast, they fell to 222,000 from 244,000. The declines were even sharper in the Midwest and the West, but in the South, layoffs actually rose (so much for those grits).
The statistics bureau also calculates something called the quits rate, which measures the number of people who leave their jobs voluntarily as a percentage of total employment. 
The quits rate, which according to the bureau "can serve as a barometer of workers' ability to change jobs," dropped sharply over the last year, to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent. ( That may not seem like a sharp drop, but to economists, it's major.)
The Northeast already had the lowest percentage of quitters, at 1.5 percent, but it actually edged downward over the past year to 1.4 percent. Which suggests that people who have jobs aren't going anywhere.
None of these data answer conclusively the mystery of the missing 160,000 unemployed people. But, Dr. Watson, how many of them do you think found work?

A New Way to Cut Payments on Your Old Car

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
WHEN James E. Adsley bought his 1999 Cadillac Eldorado late last year, the best financing plan he was able to find was a three-year, 8.25 percent loan through the dealer. After a down payment, he needed to borrow nearly $24,000.
 He assumed the rate was the lowest he could get at the time. Used-car loan rates generally run a half to a full percentage point higher than those for new cars, and the average new-car rate at the time was hovering above 7 percent. 
 But listening to ads all winter for interest-free financing and other discount loan deals on new cars, Mr. Adsley, 61, a medical consultant who lives in Whidbey Island, Wash., near Seattle, wondered if he could have done better. Then a friend suggested that he investigate auto loan refinancing, something he never knew existed. 
Initially, Mr. Adsley was wary. "I was hesitant to get involved with turning over a loan," he said. But after researching the various deals on the Internet, Mr. Adsley wound up with a 6.9 percent loan, lasting 72 months, or twice the length of his original loan, from PeopleFirst.com, a San Diego-based online lender that is a division of CapitalOne. He expects to save around $2,000 in interest expenses over the life of the loan.
The transaction, which included a small title-transfer fee, was conducted entirely by e-mail and telephone. Within two days of completing his application, a check arrived, which Mr. Adsley signed over to his previous lender, GMAC, the financing arm of the General Motors Corporation. "The transfer went very smoothly," he said.
Mr. Adsley is part of a small, yet growing number of people who are deciding to refinance the loans on their cars, trucks and minivans, much as consumers have long refinanced the mortgages on their houses. As yet, the auto loan refinancing market is but a fraction of the annual $1.63 trillion that banks and lending companies do in new and used car financing. About 1.1 million loans were refinanced last year, according to CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore.
Lenders contend the market will grow, especially as auto companies continue to advertise interest-free loans and other discount financing plans on new vehicles. Already, at LendingTree.com, one of a number of Internet lenders that offer the plans, auto loan refinancing requests have jumped 26 percent in the first six months of 2002.
"It's one of the best-kept secrets" for saving money, said Brian Reed, chief executive at PeopleFirst.com.
IT also seems to be a market that the Internet sites, a few banks and credit unions have to themselves. While financing companies owned by the automakers provide more than 60 percent of all auto loans, they have shown little interest in refinancing existing loans. The companies' primary focus is to help dealers arrange loans for new vehicles, not make it cheaper for consumers to own their current vehicles.
"I don't know of any of us that want to do refinancing," said George Borst, president of Toyota Financial Services, the credit arm of Toyota, based in Torrance, Calif.
Indeed, 25 years ago, when the average car or truck cost $10,000, auto loan refinancing was almost unheard of, even as mortgage refinancing became popular, said Joseph Kennedy, president of Eloan.com, which provides auto refinancing, and the former head of sales and marketing for the Saturn Corporation.
The reasons were simple. Consumers were eager to refinance mortgages, because the amounts borrowed were large, and even a half-point interest rate reduction could yield significant savings. Also, homes grew in value, especially if improvements were made.
But, with rare exceptions, cars and trucks were worth less the older they got. Loan amounts were much smaller than for homes, and there didn't seem to be a need to refinance a loan on something that might not be around when the payments were finished.
Now, however, vehicles are costing more and lasting longer than ever. The average life of a vehicle is around 13 years, and the average amount of time people keep their cars and trucks is around 7 years. The average sticker is more than $25,000, thanks to the growing popularity of high-priced sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. 
Today's typical car loan is longer than 60 months. (The average length of a refinanced loan is 49 months, though most people refinance a year into their initial loan.) The potential savings on refinanced vehicle loans have become attractive: each one-point drop in interest on a $25,000, 60-month loan can save nearly $1,000 over the life of the loan, according to calculations from PeopleFirst.com.
Convenience is another drawing card. PeopleFirst.com, for instance, promises an answer within 15 minutes and no inspection of an automobile is required, because the financial institutions are buying the loan, not the vehicle, Mr. Reed said.
Even though the number of people who have refinanced their auto loans is small, the potential audience seems to be huge. Auto loan rates now are two to three points cheaper than they were in 2000, when sales of cars and trucks hit a record 17.6 million in the United States.
Back then, "you were doing pretty well to get a number in the 8.5 percent to 9 percent range," said Mr. Kennedy of Eloan.com, which is based in Dublin, Calif.
This summer, Eloan.com's auto loan refinancing plans average 6.5 percent, while PeopleFirst.com is offering refinancing plans for as low as 5.79 percent, which are comparable to the prevailing rates on conventional new-car loans. But consumers need to know that, as with the interest-free plans available from auto companies, the best refinancing rates are available on the shortest-length loans, and to consumers with spotless payment histories.
"These are really for people with good credit," Mr. Kennedy said. "If you are struggling with your payments, this is not a way to hitch onto another lender." 
CNW's president, Art Spinella, is also skeptical of the idea. He thinks consumers may be better off selling their vehicles, buying new ones and negotiating more attractive interest rates from scratch rather than stretching out payments on an existing loan. "Refinancing is a terrible idea, because you don't want the vehicle around that long," he said.
STILL, refinancing can lower payments and extend them, which many people may find helpful during these tough economic times. At the same time, the wide variety of financing options available right now is giving car buyers even more flexibility in negotiating deals. 
Many auto companies are now offering consumers a choice between interest-free or discount loan rates and rebates, but don't allow them to take both. Because he was able to find cheaper financing on his own, Phillip Michael Brunetti, 46, a social worker from Columbus, Ohio, chose to take a rebate on a 2002 Chrysler Town and Country minivan instead of an interest-free financing offer. The rebate, plus some tough negotiating, brought the price down to $27,000, versus the $31,000 Mr. Brunetti would have paid for a vehicle with interest-free financing. 
Mr. Brunetti subsequently was able to find a 66-month loan for 6 percent. Even with interest payments, and the cost of an extended warranty, he still expects to pay less over the life of the loan than he would have paid had he bought the more expensive vehicle. He is glad to have such options. "There's a difference out there than there was two years ago," he said.
Lenders admit that a lot of people still are unaware of refinancing. "We have a lot of work to do to build consumer awareness and understanding of how it works and what to do," Mr. Kennedy said.

HEADLINE: What 80 Warren Street Knows 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
MARVIN GOLDSTEIN, a retired art professor, has lived for 22 years at 80 Warren Street, a brick and stone building on the southern fringe of TriBeCa in which co-ops fetch $1.5 million apiece.
 Even after the attack on the World Trade Center, whose falling towers Mr. Goldstein could see from the building's front door, a survey of real estate costs showed that TriBeCa was the city's highest-priced residential neighborhood last year, surpassing the Upper East Side. 
 But every now and then, Mr. Goldstein steps outside of his high-ceilinged loft and is reminded of the old days: "A guy looking like he just got out of the hoosegow will wander by and say, 'Is this where the employment agencies are?' " 
It was, some 30 years ago. Back then, the building was occupied by dozens of low-end employment agencies offering a day or two of unappetizing work -- washing dishes, shoveling snow -- for rock-bottom wages. Men who were down and out crowded the halls, vestibule and nearby sidewalks, pushing, smoking, fighting with fists and knives -- and waiting. 
The scene was so dismal, and so indicative of larger social problems, that Michael Harrington used it to help dramatize the ravages of urban woes in his groundbreaking book "The Other America," published 40 years ago. "Some of my friends call 80 Warren Street 'the slave market,' " Harrington wrote. 
The transformation, from a center of blue-collar desperation to shelter for the moneyed, is just one chapter in the life of 80 Warren Street. The building, directly south of Chambers Street and three blocks west of City Hall, is actually the consolidation of five structures erected in the mid-18th century. It has housed New York's legendary butter-and-egg men; the job agencies described by Harrington; impoverished artists; and, more recently, co-op dwellers willing to pay a fortune for a one-bedroom with a sauna. 
Old buildings retain memories of former lives, labors, sufferings and pleasures in their walls and moldings. Eighty Warren Street, with its 32 co-op apartments, is no exception. Its big windows with low sills evoke the days when workmen passed crates of dairy products through them. It is easy to envision grizzled drifters puffing away in the grayish, unornamented lobby. A row of windows in some of the first-floor apartments face a brick wall, a reminder that butter-and-egg men didn't care about good views.
Still, few current residents know about the building's colorful past. Boxy and unremarkable, like many of its neighbors, 80 Warren is easy to overlook. Quiet and unassuming, it merits not a single mention in the files of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. It is an old New York story: a plain facade behind which lurks a rich history.

The Butter and Egg Era
Three centuries ago, when Colonial New York was a small but thriving city, the future Warren Street stood at its northern edge. 
Even then, New Yorkers longed to get out of town, largely to escape the noise and claustrophobia of Wall Street, then the city's commercial hub. Many escapees made their way to Vauxhall Garden, built in 1765 on a hill overlooking the Hudson in the vicinity of Greenwich and Warren Streets. Its attractions included afternoon teas, a wax museum and fireworks. The property was owned by Trinity Church. 
Soon, members of the gentry built brick houses near the pleasure spot, creating one of Manhattan's first upscale residential neighborhoods. Commerce moved north, too. By the mid-19th century, the brick houses had been demolished and replaced by commercial buildings: elegant "skyscrapers," five or six stories high, featuring stone and marble facades, oversize windows and steam elevators big enough to transport a horse-drawn wagon laden with goods to the dizzying upper reaches. 
Among these structures were five five- and six-story brick buildings on the north side of Warren Street between West Broadway and Greenwich Street: Nos. 76 through 84. The exact date of construction is fuzzy, but by 1885 one of the five was already having a $1,600 face-lift to repair damage from a fire. 
The neighborhood evolved into the city's dairy wholesaling district, where warehouse laborers unloaded crates of butter, milk, cream and eggs. At least one of the five Warren Street buildings was home to a butter-and-egg wholesaler, the firm of Droste & Snyder.
During this period, a curious blocklong forerunner of the subway was built nine feet beneath Broadway from Warren to Murray Street: a pneumatic tube with giant rotary blowers pushed an upholstered car carrying 22 people. The first year of operation, 1870, 400,000 people rode the newfangled contraption, paying 25 cents a ride. The plan failed and was soon abandoned.
Meanwhile, the small companies in the five Warren Street buildings expanded, renovated, changed hands. An enterprising dairy wholesaler installed a basement refrigerator for eggs, and a hardware company spruced up its first floor with plate-glass windows, a mezzanine walkway and a marquee. In 1926, the company also caught an embezzler in its midst: a 27-year-old employee named Murray Septon was accused of collecting $160 from a dealer and, according to the police, "appropriated it to his own use."
The neighborhood was thriving. By the late 1930's, the wholesale markets of the Lower West Side had become the world's largest. "Caviar from Siberia," reported the New York City Guide (a W.P.A. publication) in describing Washington Market and other nearby wholesalers and grocers. "Sardines from Norway. Venison and bear steaks. 7,500,000 cases of eggs and 4,500,000 tubs of butter." This was not to mention radios, pets, garden seeds, sporting goods and church supplies.

Jobs of Last Resort
But by the late 1930's, the heyday of the area's dairy industry was coming to a close. Trucks, not horse-drawn wagons, were hauling food, and bottlenecks were occurring at the slow-moving steam elevators. Gradually but inexorably, the companies occupying the warehouses began to leave for less congested and more efficient quarters. Eventually the wholesale markets followed.
At this point, the story of 80 Warren Street took a darker turn. The Sixth Avenue Association, a merchants' group, had long sought to get rid of the crowds of scruffy job seekers who congregated outside the many storefront agencies along Sixth Avenue in the 30's. The relatively remote ranges of Warren Street seemed a more suitable setting for such an enterprise.
Trinity Church consolidated Nos. 76-84 Warren Street into a single building and subdivided the lofts to create small offices. The place was given a fine title -- the Employment Agency Center Building -- and in 1942 The New York Times described the new exterior as featuring "fine ruddy brick, dazzling white stone and gleaming glass blocks in the best modern style." 
More than 40 agencies moved in. A sign advised job seekers to "take the express elevator to the fourth floor and see all the agencies on the way down." Christopher Gray, the architectural historian, writing in 1993 in The New York Times, described the first day: "Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia opened the center in March 1942 to 5,000 applicants, handing papers for a chauffeur's job in Brooklyn to a Bronx man, 43-year-old Charles Glener, the first to apply."
The names of many of these agencies were upscale: Admiral, Cadillac, Ardor, Century, Colony, Eagle, Majestic, Paris, Vivaldi, Yale. The reality soon became quite different.
"Some of these places list good-paying and highly skilled jobs," Harrington wrote in his book, which was published almost exactly 20 years after the building opened. "But many of them provide the work force for the economic underworld in the big city: the dishwashers and day workers, the fly-by-night jobs."
He described the press of humanity: mostly blacks and Puerto Ricans, and often alcoholics, drifters and the mentally ill, who paid the agencies perhaps 50 cents for a $5-a-day job. The scene after lunch struck him as especially dispiriting. Although all the jobs had been handed out, men still milled around, eternally, pointlessly hopeful.
"Most of the people at 80 Warren Street were born poor," Harrington concluded. "They are incompetent as far as American society is concerned, lacking the education and the skills to get decent work."
Harrington's book provided powerful ammunition for President John F. Kennedy's war on poverty. In the late 60's, a group of students from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, moved by Harrington's vivid words, brought their cameras to 80 Warren Street to film a documentary about the place. What they found was, if anything, worse than what Harrington had described.
One part of the film focused on a knife fight over a bottle of red wine. "Blood from a slashed artery splattered the floor," said the script. "The owner of the bottle pinned his friend to the floor and held the blade against his neck."
Two days later, "A white man in his mid-60's was found dead on the steps of a dingy office building directly across the street from 80 Warren. A knife lay in a pool of blood underneath him." The man had been getting work as a waiter through 80 Warren since the year it had opened.

Artists, Followed by Cachet
In the late 60's, another development transformed 80 Warren Street. 
Hundreds of painters and sculptors were illegally moving into empty industrial lofts in the blocks below Houston Street, to a neighborhood soon to acquire the catchy name SoHo. Landlords were happy to receive even modest rents. Artists, especially those working in large-scale formats, were drawn not only by the prices but also by the oversize windows, generous natural light, raw open spaces and high ceilings.
By the mid-70's, galleries and boutiques had followed the artists, sometimes displacing their work and causing real estate prices to rise. In response, many artists headed south once more, to the trapezoidal district south of Canal Street. An enterprising realtor quickly labeled the neighborhood TriBeCa, in the hope that the new name would do for these blocks what SoHo had done for the neighborhood to the north. The artists moved illegally into lofts and lived as they had in SoHo. When a building inspector showed up, a tenant would ask for a few extra minutes to let the nude model dress, and quickly stash the pillows, pots and pans, and other evidence of habitation.
Like SoHo in its early days, TriBeCa was a desolate place.
That is how Mr. Goldstein, a lean man with a wry smile who was teaching at the Fairleigh Dickinson University branch in Teaneck, N.J., remembers the neighborhood when he moved into 80 Warren Street in 1980. The employment agencies had gradually departed, and the year he arrived, 80 Warren became one of the first TriBeCa warehouses to be legally converted for residential use. Although his new neighbors included many well-known figures, among them the writers Jonathan Schell and Judith Thurman and the painter Mark Tansey, the surroundings were dreary.
"Lots of parking lots," Mr. Goldstein remembered of the neighborhood. "A hot-dog cart fill-up place. Probably some murders. You cannot imagine what a dump it was."
On moving day, he sloshed through puddles on his new floor, a result of a leaky ceiling. "It was just awful," he said. "But, oh, it was magnificent! The very high ceilings. The old-fashioned skylight. And cheap."
He paid $25,000 for 3,000 square feet of raw space. He lived by himself beneath his 14-foot ceilings. The space was all his. 
At first, it was lonely. "Come 5 o'clock, no one was here," he said. "No schools. No conveniences. I brought food in from New Jersey."
But the first glimmers of TriBeCa's future cachet were emerging. In that year, 1980, Odeon opened in a former cafeteria on West Broadway, featuring what a writer described in The New York Times as "sparkling vegetables, delicate fish and beautifully cooked meat." Other additions to the neighborhood included outposts of avant-garde art like Franklin Furnace and residents who epitomized urban cool: Laurie Anderson, Bette Midler, Cyndi Lauper, Martin Scorsese, Meryl Streep.
In keeping with TriBeCa's new money and glitter, 80 Warren Street even surfaced in articles about a celebrity scandal. The affair involved John J. McLaughlin, a lawyer who ran the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, and a washing-machine heiress named Ann Maytag.
Miss Maytag, as she was fetchingly identified in the newspapers, collected American Indian art and exhibited it at the Foundations Gallery, the space she operated in the lobby of 80 Warren Street. In 1986, Mr. McLaughlin was convicted of several felonies, including grand larceny and forgery, in connection with his handling of Ms. Maytag's multimillion-dollar personal trust.
Through this period, the building at 80 Warren remained much as it had been, sturdy and plain. Occasionally, new owners tried to persuade the board to decorate the lobby and hire a doorman, but they were always voted down. But private spaces were frequently made elegant; one tenant, for example, added a patio and lush gardens with grapevines to the two-tiered roof, a legacy of the days when 80 Warren was a cluster of buildings of different heights.
Still, the cost of apartments at 80 Warren Street continued to rise steadily. In the mid-90's, as the economy started to boom, they began to skyrocket. Newspaper reports of local real estate sales tracked the dizzying climb. In 1990, a 4,000-square-foot loft at 80 Warren fetched $560,000. In 1997, a buyer paid nearly that much for a space less than half that size. 
"Between Warren and Murray, the prices shot up to the multimillions," said James Sanders, who lives on nearby Duane Street and was a co-author of the PBS series "New York: A Documentary Film."
"Not only can artists not afford them," Mr. Sanders said, "hardly anybody can afford them."
The prices have stayed high. According to the Insignia Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, the average price for a residential apartment in TriBeCa last year, $1.6 million, was twice as high as the average on the Upper East Side, the city's next-costliest neighborhood. 
The area's cachet has withstood even the trade center attacks, the stock market's plunge and a sputtering economy. Howie Krakow, a retired advertising executive who moved to 80 Warren Street in 1994, paid $500,000 for his 3,000-square-foot loft, which includes such additions as custom-designed stained glass obscuring a view of a brick wall. When he put his place on the market in May, he thought his timing was poor.
The apartment was gone in a week.
It sold for $1.5 million. The buyer was Michelle Dell, the owner of Hogs and Heifers, the Washington Street saloon where Julia Roberts once took off her bra and danced on the bar.

No Fair This Year, but Plans Aplenty for an Avenue

BYLINE:  By CHRIS ERIKSON 

 BODY:
The Atlantic Antic, one of the city's most popular street fairs and a harbinger of fall for Brooklynites for 26 years, will be a no-show again this year. Canceled last fall after Sept. 11, it has now fallen victim to a city regulation.
 The city has denied a permit for the event, which draws up to a million people to Atlantic Avenue's westernmost stretch on the last weekend of September. A given group can host only one street fair each year, the city said. 
 That is a problem this year because the group behind the Antic, the Atlantic Avenue Local Development Corporation, held a fair in the spring to try to plug the gap in its finances that resulted when last year's Antic was canceled. "It's sad," said Candace P. Damon, the president of the group, which had petitioned the city to bend the rule, citing the unique circumstances of 2001 and the economic boost the fair brings the local community. "We were hoping they'd make an exception."
But a spokeswoman for the mayor's office, Megan Sheekey, said that nearly 70 street-fair permits were canceled last fall, and that most of the affected groups also asked to double up this year, a load the city can't handle. 
"Everybody got hit hard," she said. "We had to be consistent." 
But there is good news for Atlantic Avenue, too. Long-held plans to revamp it took a step forward last month, when the development group and a coalition of local leaders commissioned a Denver firm, Civitas, to develop a master plan for the 1.25-mile segment between Fourth Avenue and the East River.
In the works since early last year, the effort represents the latest bid to spruce up a strip that has long fallen short of aspirations. Among the goals is to make the avenue more pedestrian friendly and to link the retail strips to the east and west, which are currently separated by a dead zone inhabited by a jail, two gas stations, vacant lots, and a steady flow of Brooklyn Bridge traffic along Boerum Place.
"That stretch has effectively served as a dividing line," Ms. Damon said. "All over the place, the avenue just divides the communities where it could unite."
The planners will consider a number of improvements, including pedestrian medians, new lighting, benches, planters and trolleys.
The master plan is moving forward as a wealth of public projects, like the planned Brooklyn Bridge Park and the proposed cultural district around the Brooklyn Academy of Music, are in the works along the avenue.
The goal of the master plan is to capitalize on this buzz of activity, and tap the street's potential to be a hub of culture and commerce. 
"We have a vision of a great urban boulevard," Ms. Damon said. CHRIS ERIKSON

A Latina Eyes the Fad For Flounces

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
SOMETHING strange happened to me the other day when I looked in the mirror: I felt I was impersonating a Latina. 
 I am no prisoner of fashion, but this season it has been impossible to go into stores and not pick up a few items from the latest fad -- a turquoise bracelet here, a matching necklace there, a ruffled blouse, a three-tiered skirt. The look tends to Latina in the extreme, almost folkloric, straight out of the closet of a Mexican ranchera singer or a Puerto Rican plena dancer. It is not one I remember ever wearing when I was growing up in Puerto Rico, except for school plays or Halloween. It can verge on the tarty side, resembling the get-ups the sultry cantina girls wear in Western movies. 
 So one day this summer I absent-mindedly dressed for work with a flowing, bright-colored skirt and some turquoise jewelry and -- Orale! -- I was suddenly as self-conscious as if I had put a basket of fruit on my head a la Carmen Miranda. 
The truth is, despite what J.Lo and the fashion magazines suggest, there is no single Latina look. I myself lean toward businesslike clothes. But that has not kept me from putting on dangling earrings or loud colors or other staples of my Latina sense of style. Of course, by my mother's standards, I have been hopelessly Americanized. "Put on some blush, at least!" she commands during my visits to San Juan, finding me way too pale and natural-looking and too much like the tourists who walk around the city in sneakers, T-shirts, shorts and no eye makeup.
The trick for me since I moved to the mainland more than 20 years ago has been to use these elements as accents, not throw on all of them at once and risk looking like "la puerca de Juan Bobo," the pig in a Puerto Rican folk tale that is overdressed and overperfumed by her owner, Juan Bobo.
But these days, it seems, I am out of touch.
Wanda Negron, editor in chief of Cristina, the Miami-based magazine published by the talk show host Cristina Saralegui, said that Latina styles tend toward overadornment, toward the provocative look of Shakira, the Colombian pop star -- long earrings, leather, beads, bandana -- and that's just for starters. (Shakira also dyes her hair blond and belly-dances on her videos.) 
It is a mix of trends, Ms. Negron said, in much the same way that Latino culture represents different races, ethnic groups and nationalities. 
And it's just like music, mixing it up, blending hip-hop with rock and Caribbean and South American rhythms. "There are no rules," Ms. Negron said. "You're fashionable when you have 20,000 things on. We want to have a little bit of each thing that reminds us of our ancestors."
But can you tell a real Latina underneath all the clothes as easily as, say, you can tell who learned to do the salsa in a studio?
A true Latina look, it seems to me, must also come from such intangibles as self-image and attitude. Sandra Guzman, author of "The Latina's Bible: The Nueva Latina's Guide to Love, Spirituality, Family and La Vida" (Three Rivers Press, 2002), said Latinas are partial to tight rather than loose clothing because the idea of hiding your curves is anathema to their idea of femininity. This is a reflection, Ms. Guzman said, of how comfortable Latinas feel about their bodies -- no matter what their size.
"The genuine Latina look is this sense of comfort in your own skin, whether you're wearing very tight jeans or a beautiful ruffled, flowing skirt," she said. Ms. Guzman wore leather pants well into her seventh month of pregnancy. 
But in their sensuality and femininity, she said, the latest fashions remind her of her mother and grandmother.
The fashions, she said, "are a reminder of this classy, feminine past."
"They feel much better than the midriff jeans that were in last year," she continued. "I've seen it referred to in magazines as the peasant look, too, but a lot of us came from the tropics, and that loose cotton blouse that allows you to survive the heat is the kind of dress women of all economic strata wore." 
Not every Latina is about to dress herself in ruffles and flourishes. In places like Stamford, Conn., casual wear geared to the urban chick -- low-rise pants and tank tops -- still rules with the high-school set. Many girls own big, chunky turquoise necklaces and bracelets, but wear the jewelry only with black or white clothing -- nothing much more colorful than that.
Karla Chavez, 15, who was born in Ecuador, said a flowing skirt makes her look bigger. "I'd like to wear it because it looks comfortable," she said, "but personally I don't think I have the body for something like that."
Elena Jetto, 16, a Puerto Rican Italian-American, said the Latina look had not caught on with her. "Gap is forever over here," she said.
Miss Jetto's mother, Celia Bosch, 45, said she was reminded of what she wore as a college student in the 1970's -- empire waists, embroidery on shirt collars or sleeves. But neither she nor her friends have re-embraced the look.
"I'd love to wear it, but where would I go?" she said. "The look here is Ann Taylor."
Ms. Bosch and I have known each other since kindergarten. When we lived in Puerto Rico, we did not wear anything resembling the Latina look. Instead, we followed the fad of the moment. Sometimes we were Twiggy in miniskirts and boots (in 85-degree weather!). At other times we were high-fashion models in the ankle-length skirt called the midi or hippies in hip-hugger pants. Ruffles? Only if our mothers made us, usually for First Communions and weddings.
But with age comes nostalgia, and I now embrace what I once found corny and overdone. That is why I bought ruffles this summer, even at the risk of becoming a walking stereotype. I draw the line, however, at anything off the shoulder with red lipstick.
Some Latinas did not have to shell out any money to look fashionable this season. Lys Mendez, 20, a student at the University of California at Santa Cruz, who was born in Mexico City and brought up in Riverside, Calif., said she had always loved and worn shawls and other indigenous Mexican styles. But she isn't sure the popularity these fashions are now enjoying is more than one season deep.
"What worries me is that they're not integrating it into the mainstream, but that it's a trendy thing that's going to be dropped," she said.
Betty Cortina, the editorial director of Latina magazine, also wonders if the Latina look will fall by the wayside as another look takes over. But, on the other hand, she noted that the Latino population in this country is now 35 million and a powerful influence not just in fashion but in popular music, entertainment and food.
"Latinas are saying, 'This is great,' " Ms. Cortina said. "The world is paying attention to us."
Si, but please don't call us cuchi-cuchi.

HEADLINE: Dot-Commers on a Mom and Pop Track 

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN 

 BODY:
ON a cold weekday afternoon last January, 34- year-old Brian Benavidez plopped down with his girlfriend on a big white shabby-chic sofa in his loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to watch a documentary about hot dogs. Mr. Benavidez, an M.B.A. and former investment banker, had been out of work since October, when he was laid off from his six-figure job at Bolt, a Manhattan Internet company.
 After a couple months of reading and sleeping until noon, he had begun to interview for jobs, but things weren't looking so good. Mr. Benavidez described himself as "just professionally depressed." 
 But something about that hot dog documentary caught his attention. 
"I noticed that everybody who was being interviewed was happy," Mr. Benavidez said. "The people who worked behind the counters, the owners, the customers, they were all smiling. I told my girlfriend, 'I want to make people that happy.' "
A few hours later, Mr. Benavidez said, he had an epiphany: "I'll do hot dogs."
Selling hot dogs and cheese fries was hardly the career Mr. Benavidez imagined for himself when he earned his degree from Columbia Business School in 1996, in the early days of the Internet boom. 
Back then, everyone had a business plan in his knapsack and venture capital flowed like Evian on a corporate charge card. But these are times of adjusted -- if not diminished -- expectations, especially for those young ambitious professionals who were swept up in the technology bubble of the late 1990's only to be unceremoniously disgorged a few years later.
A few like Mr. Benavidez are refusing to let go of the entrepreneurial spirit and the dream of self-made riches that fueled start-up mania. 
Instead of spending billions to build a global brand, these recalibrated entrepreneurs are spending a few thousand dollars to make it big, or at least medium, in their own neighborhoods. They are opening concession stands, spas and bakeries, many with a post-millennial twist. Mr. Benavidez, for example, spent weeks searching for the perfect hot dog before settling on a hormone-free beef frank from grass-fed cattle on a California ranch. 
If the Internet economy was built on vapor, these new ventures are all too real. "I buy eggs, flour and cheese and turn it into things people like and will pay more for than I did," said Assaf Tarnopolsky, 31, a Wharton School of Business graduate who is now the proud owner of two crepe stands in San Francisco, under the self-bestowed title of the West Coast Crepe King. Mr. Tarnopolsky lost his $125,000-a-year job last September when his employer went bankrupt, so he turned to an earlier love. 
He had grown up eating crepes in Geneva, and as a hobby slopped batter on a hot iron at a San Francisco farmer's market on weekends. After a couple of "miserable" interviews, he said, "I decided, if it works on Saturday and Sunday, why not Monday through Friday?"
The lifestyle change has not been easy. "Despite what people think," he said, "it's more stressful and more work than my corporate job." Mr. Tarnopolsky frequently wakes up at night worrying about crepes, and he and his wife now live with "a Depression-era mentality." 
"We're pinching pennies, cooking at home and not going to weddings we'd love to go to because they're too expensive." 
Ari Ginsberg, director of the entrepreneurship program at New York University's Stern School of Business, says that's what it takes. Mr. Ginsberg said that in every generation of professionals there are some who seek the stability of corporate jobs and others who are driven to go it alone. 
The current wave of scaled-down start-ups, Mr. Ginsberg said, is being run by "a breed of people who came of entrepreneurial age when there was a gold rush."
"They were in a fantasy world. Now we're in a back-to-basics mode," he said. "Hot dog stands are about handling real merchandise and interacting with real customers. It takes hard work and time to see results when you build a business the old-fashioned way."
Alas, few choose the old-fashioned way voluntarily. Most are like Andrew Reback, a 32-year-old M.B.A. from Boston University who was a director of product management at Excite@Home until he was laid off last Sept. 25. 
Mr. Reback said he had received no severance pay and his final paycheck bounced. He liked baking, so as he looked for a job in technology, he started selling desserts like chocolate mousse cake. The technology job never materialized -- Mr. Reback said everyone in his six-unit Burlingame, Calif., apartment building is unemployed -- so he kept on baking.
Technology was all entree and no dessert, Mr. Reback said. With mousse cake, he said, "You get a sense of 'It tastes good, and I like it.' I never got that at Excite." 
Mr. Reback grosses only "hundreds of dollars a week," he said, not exactly New Economy wages. But he said it did not bother him. 
"In the brief period of time I've been in business," he said, "I've already been more profitable than Excite@Home ever was." 
And while life in technology seemed like one long strategy meeting, his current job is much simpler. "I don't need a team of M.B.A.'s to tell me what to do next," he said. "The strategy is: make more desserts."
For H. Joseph Ehrmann, a Thunderbird Business School graduate, it's soup. Mr. Ehrmann was laid off from his job at a California software company in July last year. Like many dot-com refugees, he took a monthlong soul-searching trip, to Indonesia. When he got back to San Francisco, he said, "There was a longer line at Starbucks than at any time in the boom." 
Mr. Ehrmann got the picture. He needed income, he said, so he joined a friend who had recently started an organic soup business called Heartland Soups. 
Where once a sales call meant driving to a mirrored glass building in Silicon Valley to pitch clients on $250,000 software packages, Mr. Ehrmann's pitches now involve handing out little plastic cups of soup to people on the street.
"People love soup," Mr. Ehrmann said. "I say I'm building a soup company and people say, 'Soup -- that's cool.' It's satisfying. You're giving people something that affects them right away."
After quitting their jobs at a rapidly failing technology company in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Scott, 31, and Jamie McKeough, 33, spent some time in local spas and noticed "this overriding seriousness, like, 'We're going to save your soul,' " Mr. Scott said. Their idea: a laid-back spa with no New Age pretense. As for music, Mr. Scott said, "No Enya."
For all the touchy-feely talk about life on five figures, there is one thing about these young professionals that has not changed. They still want to get rich. 
"The way to be really successful is through ownership, not through being the 5,000th hire at a company," Mr. Tarnopolsky, the crepe maker, said. 
In the middle of the dot-com boom, Mr. Tarnopolsky said he aspired to be like Sky Dayton, the prototypical dot-com whiz kid and founder of EarthLink, the second-largest Internet provider in the United States. His new heroes? Debbi Fields, who started Mrs. Fields Cookies from a counter in Palo Alto, Calif., and Howard Schultz, chairman of Starbucks.
"He successfully marketed and branded something that's been around for a long time," Mr. Tarnopolsky said. "I think the same thing can happen with crepes."
According to Po Bronson, an author who chronicled the technology boom and who profiled 75 people contemplating their careers for his upcoming book, "What Should I Do With My Life?" (Random House), for all the talk of scaling back, today's entrepreneurs have not given up entirely on the dot-com ethos.
"They come to it with the notion that the Internet may be dead but a lot of the values they believe in are the same," Mr. Bronson said. "They believe they can become an expert in something quickly, that brains might be better than experience, that most companies don't push hard enough. But the biggest is, 'Life had meaning, and I was juiced when I took risk.'
"I've seen a lot people say, 'I'm going to find that same thing somewhere else, maybe not in the Internet but with a hot dog stand.' "
If there's a thrill to be found in staring failure in the face, then small-business owners will have no shortage of excitement. According to the Small Business Administration, less than half of new businesses survive more than four years. 
For this reason, perhaps, the budding capitalists have encountered plenty of skepticism from family and friends. Mr. Benavidez approached several business school classmates about investing in his hot dog stand, for example, and was turned down by all of them.
"They said they had got so burned investing in their friends' tech companies that they were tapped out or just too hesitant," he said.
And the new business owners aren't past having their own doubts.
"I've vacillated between thinking I was an absolute genius and the village idiot," Mr. Tarnopolsky said. "I feel a lot of pressure to succeed. This business is all wrapped up in me and my identity."
When that pressure builds, new entrepreneurs seem to fall back on the same M.B.A. training they used to fuel growth in the dot-com sector. After a few days of feeling good about his hot dog epiphany, Mr. Benavidez "went into business-school mode," he said. 
He researched the margins of the hot dog market and analyzed neighborhood foot-traffic patterns, going so far as to count the number of customers going into local restaurants at certain hours. 
He used unwitting friends as market testers, serving them homemade relishes and mustards at a Super Bowl party and noting their preferences.
And he dashed off a four- page business plan -- about 75 pages shorter than the average business plan he toted around during the boom -- that led to a $50,000 investment by family and friends. 
Mr. Benavidez added $40,000 of his own money ("Everything I have," he said) and early next month he will open his stand on North Fifth Street and Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg. He named the place after his dog: "Sparky's American Food." 
"I'm going to be the one slopping chili on hot dogs and cooking burgers," Mr. Benavidez said. "The sky's the limit if we do things right. But my main goal, is, Please make this little shop work."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOWER EAST SIDE; 
A Tenement Owner Gets a Reprieve As a Museum Peers Over His Shoulder

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
The hopes of a tenement's owners remain alive, in spite of a museum's effort to replace them with ghosts.
 Louis Holtzman and his wife, Mimi, live at 99 Orchard Street, a 138-year-old tenement with a dozen apartments, that his grandfather bought in 1910. But for the last year, his next-door neighbor, the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, has been trying to take over his building through the powers of eminent domain. 
 The paradoxical situation -- a museum devoted to tenement museum seeking to displace residents of a tenement -- has not been lost on observers. 
The issue became less immediate when the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency entrusted with weighing condemnation against the public good, allowed the application to lapse on May 8 without any comment. But Mr. Holtzman labeled that development a "shallow victory," giving him and his tenants only a reprieve from condemnation.
He wants more. Last month, he wrote Gov. George E. Pataki, asking for a "memorandum of understanding" stating that no future proceedings will be brought against his property. 
"I want to get on with my life," said Mr. Holtzman, who runs a jazz recording studio.
Officials at the development corporation said the case was still active. 
"Our review of all the issues wasn't complete," said an agency spokesman, in explaining why a decision had not been reached. "Condemnation is not an action that we take lightly."
A new hearing, which would reactive the case, will probably be held, the official added.
The building is a virtual twin of the six-story museum, a national landmark, which is at 97 Orchard Street and dates to 1863. Expanding next door would allow the museum to install an elevator for the handicapped, double its annual capacity to 200,000 visitors, and recreate more apartments as they looked around 1900, when the Lower East Side was a singular gateway to the New World.
"The economic and cultural and educational impact is tremendous with this expansion," said Ruth J. Abram, the museum president.
The tussle over condemnation is just the latest chapter in the story of the Holtzmans and the museum. 
A few years ago, the museum made a $1.35 million offer for the Holtzmans' building, which the couple rejected. They then formed a partnership with their other neighbor, Peter Liang, whose company owns a Chinese restaurant with a back entrance at 101 Orchard Street. The deal gave Mr. Liang room to expand his restaurant into 99 Orchard Street and gave the Holtzmans money to refurbish and rent out their apartments, at $1,600 a month each.
During the renovation, a feud erupted between the museum and the Holtzmans. The museum says that the construction created cracks along the shared wall, something the Holtzmans deny. 
"We were looking for anything to stave off destruction of our building," Ms. Abram said. "We reached out to every government office and the state responded." That is when the condemnation proceedings began.
Now, it is Mr. Holtzman who is asking the governor for help in saving his building. DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Options Do Not Raise Performance, Study Finds

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
THE downside to stock options has become spectacularly evident in the last year or so. They can give executives an incentive to inflate their company's earnings or make irresponsibly optimistic forecasts to keep their stock prices high and their paychecks lavish.
 With executive indictments continuing, the benefits of options are easily forgotten. Enron and its brethren aside, however, isn't the economic rationale for awarding managers stock to align their interests with those of shareholders as solid as it has always been? 
 No -- and it was never really as solid as it seemed, says a new paper that will be presented tomorrow at an academic conference in Denver. Combining more than 200 studies over 30 years to create the largest possible sample, the paper finds that the amount of equity executives own does not affect their company's performance.
"There's no relationship whatsoever," said Dan R. Dalton, the dean of Indiana University's Kelley School of Business and one of the paper's four authors.
The conclusion is hardly intuitive, coming after years in which investors and executives hailed stock ownership as a solution to the age-old problem of how to ensure that people who run but do not own a business act in the best interests of the owners. Adam Smith noted the problem in 1776, writing, "negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company."
The recent stock market bubble has shown that negligence and profusion can prevail, and investors can turn a blind eye to them, even when executives own large stakes in their company. Now that some investors want to reform executive pay, the new findings deserve a place in the debate. 
When scientists talk about the relationship between two variables, they like to use the numbers zero and one. Measuring the relationship between the height from which a ball is dropped and its speed when it hits the ground, for instance, will yield a number very close to one, showing a nearly perfect correlation. The relationship between the latitude of an American city and its average temperature will fall between zero and one -- a significant correlation but not close to perfect. 
The relationship between executives' stock holdings and their companies' performance is so close to zero that it is zero in statistical terms, the paper says. This means that an alphabetical ranking of companies is as apt to predict their performance as a ranking based on executives' holdings.
A number of explanations are possible. Other incentives, like cash pay and an executive's reputation, may be as strong as stock in motivating executives. Even if stock is a powerful incentive, the strength of the economy and the long-term health of a company may determine its results more than a group of executives can.
"It's possible that we attribute far too much control to executives relative to what they actually possess," Mr. Dalton said.
The researchers looked at a long list of performance measures, and the only one that seemed even slightly related to executives' equity was the easiest for managers to manipulate: earnings per share. Executives can lift that figure by directing the company to buy back shares or cut its dividend payments.
Buying back stock may not be ideal for the company, but it is likely to lift the stock price at least temporarily.
"You have to step back and ask yourself who is attending to the long-term interests of an organization?" said Catherine M. Daily, a professor at Indiana and one of the authors. "No one." The other authors are S. Travis Certo of Texas A&M University and Rungpen Roengpitya of Indiana. The paper will be presented at the annual meeting of the Academy of Management.
THE paper's conclusions are not wholly original and are not likely to be the last word on executives' stock holdings. Many economists believe that equity can affect performance but only when it is part of a more complicated corporate governance strategy, a possibility the authors do not dispute. Ira Kay, a compensation consultant who has read the paper, said the fact that the studies on which the paper is based dated to 1970 gave him hope that a new study would produce different conclusions.
"A lot of the studies are old and were done before there was significant stock ownership, which is what it took to have an effect on performance," Mr. Kay said.
For now, however, skepticism is in order. When executives receive enormous grants of stock or options, they like to say that they are acting in the interests of their investors. The executives might be more credible if they simply said they thought they deserved a lot of money.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
With Dividends, Big Payouts Can Mean Big Gambles

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
WITH yields on United States Treasury securities in the subbasement, investors who are wary of plunging back into growth stocks are scouring the horizon for income opportunities. While buying stocks that pay relatively high dividends can be a fairly conservative and profitable approach, when investors lunge for yield, they often take on inordinate risk. The question with generous dividend payers is, how high is too high? 
 Many investors know that the higher the yield, the more treacherous the stock. Still, many big payers have done well in the past year, as interest rates have plummeted. Some of the best performers have been real estate investment trusts. Though they have lost some ground recently, the yield on the S.& P. 500 REIT index is above 7 percent. 
 But with further significant declines in interest rates unlikely, it becomes more important for investors to check on these companies' ability to keep making the payments shareholders have grown accustomed to.
Comparing a company's dividends to its cash flow can reveal a shaky payout. And an analysis of high-yielding stocks by the RiskMetrics Group, a financial analytics firm in New York, turns up a handful that are paying out more than they are taking in. 
The firm screened the top-yielding stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Among those that paid out more than they took in during the last fiscal year were America First Mortgage Investors, a mortgage real estate investment trust currently yielding almost 13 percent; Star Gas Partners L.P., a distributor of home heating oil that yields 13.25 percent; and Cornerstone Realty Income Trust, which yields 11.8 percent.
Michael Thompson, a global market commentator at RiskMetrics, noted that during the current year, Star Gas's cash flow is exceeding its payout, but its fiscal fourth quarter typically shows a small profit, often less than the dividend. And America First's cash flow appears to be ahead of its payments for the first six months of the year. Cornerstone continues to pay out more than its cash flow this year.
"There might be room for these in a portfolio, but their operations aren't generating enough to cover their payouts," said Mr. Thompson. "As a result they may represent two to three times the risk of a bond." 
Investors who want to analyze a dividend's security can do so by adding depreciation costs to net income, then deducting total dividend payments for the period -- making sure it's a positive number.
An easier way for investors to check on the solidity of their stocks is a new, free service on the Web, called CreditGrades.com, that analyzes how bond investors view the risk of default in a particular company. The service, launched by RiskMetrics in May, looks at the action in the bond market and gleans from it the probabilities of default at most large American companies. Companies with no publicly traded debt are excluded, as are financial institutions and real estate investment trusts, whose balance sheets and operations are too complex.
Input from bond buyers and sellers can be extremely valuable since they typically conduct more due diligence on companies than equity investors do. And unlike the advice given by stock analysts, bond investors provide a view of market participants putting their money on the line. 
Only time will tell if the CreditGrades analysis can identify defaults well before they happen at companies. But the service gives investors who are concerned about the safety of their holdings additional information. The bond market has always been more opaque than the stock market, but now investors can pull back the curtain and see how bond investors view their companies. Not a bad reality check for dicey times.

HEADLINE: This Oil's Domestic, but It'sDeep and It's Risky 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: ABOARD THE BP MARLIN PLATFORM, IN THE GULF OF MEXICO 

 BODY:
ABOUT 100 miles southeast of the tattered Louisiana coastline, Marlin rises like a fortress from the flat sea, a gas flare at the tip of a boom fluttering like its banner.
 Marlin is BP's most profitable deep-water platform in the region, producing enough natural gas and oil to power a city of one million people. But as solid and steady as it looks, Marlin is not rooted to the ocean floor. Instead, the whole platform -- the width of two football fields -- floats in 3,400 feet of water on four thick columns linked by pontoons and tethered to the ocean floor with steel cables. 
 If a storm hits, Marlin can move as much as 300 feet from center, sloshing in a wide figure eight. Even in dead-calm seas, put down a cup of coffee and its surface will shimmer from the gentle bobbing. 
That is the kind of engineering and care needed to get oil from the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which holds some of the most promising oil reserves in the world. BP, the world's third largest oil company and the owner of the biggest reserves in the deep gulf, estimates that the region contains 40 billion barrels of oil equivalents, a unit that includes crude oil and natural gas. In comparison, an estimated 20 billion barrels has been found so far in the North Slope of Alaska.
With politicians calling for a reduction in foreign oil imports, especially from the volatile Middle East, the best source of increased domestic production would be here in waters as deep as 7,000 feet. Already, oil from the deep Gulf of Mexico accounts for 16 percent of domestic oil production and will claim a greater share with time. Turn on a stove in New York, and chances are that the gas that sparks into flame comes from the reserves below Marlin.
But the vast opportunities in the deep-water gulf are accompanied by profound challenges. The process of extracting oil and gas through thousands of feet of water and even more earth costs exponentially more than producing the same resources on land. Yet the projects have to remain competitive with other fields.
For BP, the cost to find, develop, lift and transport a barrel of oil from the deep waters of the gulf is $5 to $6 and declining mainly because of economies of scale. Elsewhere in the world, the industry average is $3 to $4 a barrel. With the price of oil about $25, that difference is minimal. 
THOSE economics, far more than political considerations, have driven oil companies to stake out the Gulf of Mexico, and BP is eager to lead the pack. Ten days ago, the company's chief executive, Lord John Browne, announced that BP planned to spend $15 billion in the deep-water gulf from 2001 to 2010, much of which will go to bringing its reserves on stream. If successful, BP could overtake Royal Dutch/Shell as the largest producer of oil and gas from the area. BP now produces 340,000 barrels of oil equivalents but expects to increase that to 700,000 barrels by 2007.
Analysts have generally been impressed with the kind of deep-water reserves BP has amassed. The challenge, they said, is to bring that oil and gas to market.
"The question is how they will manage the embarrassment of riches they have," said Michael R. Rodgers, a senior director at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm. "They have a bunch of projects and they need to coordinate people and contractors. There is the sheer scale of the facilities and the size of the investment required -- all this before a drop of oil ever comes out of the ground."
Oil production is an inherently difficult and dangerous undertaking anywhere, and water magnifies the hazards. Offshore oil production requires more equipment than onshore production, but everything is confined to a smaller space, which, in turn, has to stay afloat. At its Horn Mountain platform, 15 miles west of Marlin, for example, BP had to figure out how to keep risers that extend 5,400 feet down to the sea floor from being whipped about by the current. 
And, on an offshore platform, anything considered a tough problem on land quickly takes on the dimensions of catastrophe. An accident could mean the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars and a jilting by a stock market that demands high returns from oil companies. 
Safety is an obsession on platforms, from the computers that continuously check 10,000 operational points for problems to the many stashes of life jackets to the platform hands trained to go down sets of stairs with both hands on the railings. 
"People want us to take risks but carefully considered risks," said Lord Browne in a recent interview in Houston. "If we didn't take risks, we wouldn't be in the exploration business."
Since the mid-1980's, BP has spent about $8 billion in the deep-water gulf. Marlin alone has cost $600 million to develop. The company owns or has an equity stake in 25 fields that are in production or are being brought online.
Marlin was BP's first floating platform in the deep waters of the gulf, and it is where the company learned the kind of harrowing lessons that have informed and improved its work on subsequent fields. 
On Nov. 11, 1999, barely into the first month of Marlin's operation, Bob Merchant, the man responsible for running the platform, was called out of his office to look at a casing pressure gauge at a wellhead. He quickly realized he was watching a flame move along a fuse. The gauge, which measured pressure within the first well at Marlin, should have read about 50 pounds per square inch. It showed 4,300 pounds instead. 
Something had gone terribly wrong in the natural gas well, and Mr. Merchant and his crew thought there could be a blowout. Under the tremendous pressure, natural gas could rush from the well at any moment, and the smallest spark nearby could trigger an explosion. Mr. Merchant feared there could be casualties and enormous destruction on the platform. "It could go real bad, real quick," Mr. Merchant recalled thinking.
The crew immediately closed a safety valve deep in the well, shutting it down. But Mr. Merchant called in helicopters from Venice, La., to evacuate most of the crew and five boats to stand by for the remaining workers. Mr. Merchant estimated that the evacuation effort cost the project about $500,000, an expense that would never have been incurred on shore.
But BP had concerns about the design of the other wells in the field, and shut down Marlin until the company could figure out what happened. Six months after the accident, the company found the cause: the temperature in the well shot up and caused pressure to build, collapsing the sides of the well. Oil companies had not monitored wells for such temperature increases because they had never encountered such a problem. A little more than a year after the shutdown and after the addition of new monitoring to the wells, the Marlin field was brought back on stream.
"There is a progressive learning," Lord Browne said. "You go step by step, and the risks come down that way. And you learn from bad practice."
THE risks of working in deep waters were driven home in March 2001, when a series of explosions tore through P-36, at the time the world's largest oil platform, 78 miles off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. Ten people were killed, and the 40-story-tall platform sank. The platform was owned by Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil company. 
Marlin is where workers come to train before being sent to new deep-water platforms. Its decks are now fairly empty of people but jammed with equipment, a byproduct of the project's success. Besides the original oil and gas fields Marlin developed, the platform is the hub of what the company calls "infrastructure-led exploration." 
On the ocean floor, within a 20-mile radius of Marlin, BP is pumping hydrocarbons from newer but smaller fields, including Nile and King. The fields were too small on their own to warrant separate platforms, but with Marlin nearby, BP could use technology to hook those fields to the systems on the platform. Marlin started with 100 million barrels of oil equivalents, and the new fields add another 100 million barrels.
The increased production adds to the challenge of keeping Marlin afloat. As oil companies stepped out into deeper waters, past 1,500 feet, they realized that they could no longer build platforms that rose from the ocean floor like buildings. So much steel would be needed to erect such platforms that they would be uneconomical. So engineers and shipbuilders were faced with the task of building vessels that could support the weight of what amounts to a large factory in the middle of the sea and that could withstand events like hurricanes. 
Every day, the crew on Marlin must tell a barge supervisor like Tommy Lejeune if they are planning to move equipment on the decks, so that he can counterbalance shifts in weight through the platform's ballast system. If, for instance, 10,000 pounds of equipment is moved to one end of Marlin, Mr. Lejeune, from his console at the platform's control center, floods tanks with seawater in the pontoons and column legs on the opposite side to keep Marlin level. 
Sometimes just tweaking a detail ensures survival. As Sammy McDaniel, operations manager for Marlin, showed a visitor around the platform, he pointed out a silver pipe, about 20 feet long, dangling from the deck above the ocean. Ships that come to Marlin are not permitted to tie up to the platform. Instead, they must use the pipe as a marker, moving with the platform like a dance partner. 
"That's because a boat that was tied up broke off once," Mr. McDaniel said, "and almost poked a hole in one of the platform's legs."
BUT the Gulf of Mexico is free of many of the financial risks that bedevil fields in places like deep-water West Africa and Brazil, where some other large new reserves are being developed. The United States government, for starters, takes a smaller portion of income in royalties and taxes than other nations do, and its tax regime and other laws remain fairly constant, in contrast with those of many developing countries. 
The United States also has a well-trained work force on shore, offering every expertise from roustabout to geophysicist. BP can easily turn to contractors in the United States to build components and service its operations. In places like Africa, the company might have to start an industrial yard on land to service its platforms offshore. 
Finally, the cost of transporting oil from the Gulf of Mexico is cheaper because of the existing undersea pipelines built when the shallower waters in the gulf were developed. In the developing world, companies often have to build everything from scratch. 
But the cost of even starting these projects remains staggering. "In 400 feet of water, you can drill a well for $3 million," said Kenny Lang, BP's vice president for Gulf of Mexico deepwater production. "In deep water, it's a factor of 10 higher."
That means the fields must be large to be worthwhile, and the drilling must find reservoirs with pinpoint accuracy. For two years, Judith R. Wagner and her team of engineers and geoscientists have been shuttling in and out of a darkened room at BP's offices in Houston and mapping the Holstein field, estimated to have 350 million barrels of oil equivalents. 
The room is called the HIVE, an acronym for highly immersive visualization environment. The maps on its walls, when seen through a pair of blocky, specially made glasses, come alive in Technicolor three-dimension, floating, turning and revealing the layers of oil and gas pancaked atop one another, 4,300 feet below the sea.
"WITH the kind of investments we're looking at, we have to determine the right spots to drill to get the oil out quicker," said Ms. Wagner, the Holstein project's general manager.
To collect its seismic data, BP hired a ship that runs long streamers behind it that send sound waves through the water and into the earth, gathering data every 40 square feet. But the company may sample a spot up to 90 times, just to corroborate its findings.
It cost $10 million to gather the data for Holstein and $4 million more to process the numbers with supercomputers in Houston. Those numbers are translated into maps that are a striation of red, orange and black, the red and orange showing where oil and gas might be.
The popular conception of drilling for oil is like the opening scene of "The Beverly Hillbillies": poke a hole in the ground and the stuff gushes out. But the reality is more like arthroscopic surgery, as well tubing wends its way down and then laterally through miles of earth, moving toward a pocket of oil.
The maps in the HIVE allow BP to see drilling and production in real time. As things proceed, people can also gauge changes to the surrounding geologic formations. Oil and gas production is disruptive, and the point is not to seal off one reservoir with sediment and rock while exploiting another. Holstein, whose wells cost about $20 million each, should be operating by late 2004, almost five years since it was discovered, a typical lead time for BP.
Although driven by the demands of the bottom line, BP and other oil companies realize that these projects could mitigate the United States' dependence on foreign oil. Much of the oil in the United States has already been developed, and geology has skimped on the country, affording it only 3 percent of the world's known oil reserves, compared with about 60 percent in the Persian Gulf. So it is unlikely that the United States could actually reverse its reliance on foreign oil.
Moreover, domestic production has been declining as oil consumption has ballooned, mainly because of gasoline-hungry vehicles. The United States imports about 60 percent of the 20 million barrels of oil and petroleum products it consumes daily. If production falls by one million barrels more a day over the next decade, that gap would widen to 71 percent, according to BP. 
"To hold our own, to stay at 60 percent, we will have to find an additional two million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons," said James H. Dupree, BP's former vice president for Gulf of Mexico deepwater production. "The only place in the U.S. where we have that chance is in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico."
He added: "This information is a great motivational piece. Right after Sept. 11, people on Marlin wanted to go to New York and dig people out of the rubble, and they wanted me to arrange it. But I told them that the country needed them here."

To the Editor:
 Re "On Camera, Jobless Argentines Vie for a Livelihood" (news article, Aug. 7): 
 At last! A reality TV show with a purpose. 
The ingenuity of the Argentines shows through with their hourlong program "Human Resources." This is a country that has been on top of its game, and surely will be again. 
Perhaps we can take a cue from our neighbors to the south and give our viewing public a chance to feel good about watching a "reality" show. Even though our unemployment rate is not close to that of Argentina, I believe that such a show could work here -- just wish I had the cash to produce it myself.

Japan May Be Worth a Second Look

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
OF all the surprises to hit investors of late, one of the most curious is that Japan is home to the best-performing major stock market this year. While America's benchmark index, the Dow Jones industrial average, has plunged nearly 13 percent, its Japanese counterpart, the Nikkei 225, has held up relatively well, growing 3.9 percent in dollar terms this year. Though slender and partly inflated by the yen's rise against the dollar, these gains suggest that Japan is worth a second look for those willing to venture overseas to broaden their portfolios.
 As in past years, Japan's stock market has taken its cue from a mixture of positive news and relief. This year, a recovery in exports is pulling the country out of recession, lifting shares of electronic, semiconductor, steel and auto companies. Despite high unemployment and falling wages, the Japanese have continued to shop, stabilizing the largest part of the economy, consumer spending. Investors were also encouraged in February when the government took steps to head off a banking crisis. 
 Absent, too, are the accounting scandals and mammoth bankruptcies that have engulfed American and European markets, helping turn the Nikkei, in some small way, into a haven. Indeed, Japan's decade-long bear market has washed away much of its own bubble-era excesses and Internet-driven mania.
While that has pushed the Nikkei index 75 percent below its 1990 peak, it also means prices for some of the world's biggest manufacturers are at their lowest levels in years. "Don't overestimate the weakness in Japan," said Philip Lung, senior fund manager at UAM Investment Trust Management in Tokyo. "People are looking for the downside" but should consider the positives, too.
With $300 million under management, Mr. Lung's funds, sold through two Japanese banks, have returned more than 4 percent each this year. Japanese small-cap funds, too, have performed relatively well. According to a ranking of global offshore investments compiled by Business Week and Standard & Poor's, Japanese funds held 21 of the top 25 spots in the second quarter, with investments managed by Jardine Fleming, Fidelity and Mercury all returning more than 10 percent.
Fund managers in Tokyo, though, all temper their optimism. Domestic banks are still a mess, burdened with bad loans and struggling to eke out profits. With interest rates near zero and the deficit growing, the government and central bank have exhausted most of their fiscal and monetary arsenal.
The upheaval in American markets has also led foreign investors, who were big buyers of Japanese stocks earlier this year, to sell Japanese shares to lock in profits and offset losses back home. That has taken some of the shine off the Nikkei in the last six weeks. Fortunately, Japanese retail investors have picked up some of the slack, keeping a floor under the stock market, at least for now.
As worrisome, figures out last week showed the American economy growing at a slower rate than previously thought. Since one-third of Japan's exports are shipped to America, if the United States dips back into recession, it could take Japan with it.
"Quite frankly, the U.S. economy is crucial to everyone," said Simon Jones, who helps manage $14 billion for J. P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in Japan. "We're not under any illusions; if the U.S. slows, Japan will, too."
Should America's economy and stock prices stabilize, though, pressure on foreign investors to sell their Japanese shares will diminish, said Kathy Matsui, a Goldman, Sachs strategist. In that event, the Topix index, a collection of all first-section shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, could hit 1,100 by year's end, she said, about 11 percent above current levels.
Even if the outlook remains in flux, analysts say there are well-managed companies whose stocks are trading at or slightly above 20 times this year's earnings, a low benchmark in Japan. For example, Toyota Motor, the world's third-largest automaker, is trading at 20 times earnings even though it recently raised its global sales target for 2002 by 3.8 percent and said it would expand production by nearly 8 percent at home.
Two other well-run carmakers, Honda Motor and Nissan Motor, are trading at about 25 times their earnings despite record profits and updated models -- the Accord for Honda and the Z for Nissan -- that are expected to sell well.
While technology shares have fallen out of favor with many investors, Goldman recommends looking at Canon, Japan's largest maker of office equipment, which is getting a lift from strong demand for its digital cameras. Sharp and Fuji Photo Film are two other leaders in the production of digital cameras and liquid crystal displays. Like Japan's three largest car companies, Canon and Fuji also list American depository receipts in New York, so United States investors can buy them in dollars.
ANOTHER company with American depository receipts that consistently reports record profits is the Kao Corporation, Japan's largest maker of household goods. The country's largest drug maker, Takeda Chemical Industries, and Shionogi & Company, which has a cholesterol-lowering drug called Crestor, have good long-term prospects as well.
Not just individual stocks, but the market over all is cheap compared with 1994 and 1999, just before two other rallies. Companies listed on the Topix are trading at 33 times their forecasted earnings for this fiscal year. That is just about half the level of 1994 and about two thirds of what they traded at three years ago. The lower valuation "is not quite the same as claiming that it is cheap, but at least it is not as expensive as before," said Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Barings in Tokyo.
Some of this decline is a natural ratcheting down of expectations about potential growth in Japan. Even so, at these prices, Japanese stocks are approaching levels in America, where the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is trading at 18 times this year's estimated earnings. To trade a basket of Japanese shares without opening a mutual fund, consider one of the two exchange-traded funds listed on the American Stock Exchange.
These funds trade like stocks, so they can be bought and sold quickly, yet still mimic the broader market. Investors can also bet on the market's decline by selling the funds short, borrowing shares and repaying them with those bought later at lower prices. The iShares MSCI Japan fund is the more active of the two such funds and has outperformed the iShares S&P/Topix 150, gaining 2.2 percent this year.

HEADLINE: Pressuring Analysts: Hard Habit To Break 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
SO much for Wall Street's promises.
 In a letter to the nation's top three securities regulators on July 15, Sanford I. Weill, the chief executive of Citigroup, and Michael A. Carpenter, chief executive of its Salomon Smith Barney unit, expressed dismay about the recent loss of investor confidence in stock research done by brokerage firms. 
 The two executives boasted that Salomon, Citigroup's investment bank subsidiary, had been the first to adopt reforms suggested by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, who is investigating Wall Street research. They also proposed additional moves that regulators might take to prevent a firm's investment bankers from exerting improper influence on its research analysts. 
But just a few weeks before, according to one of Salomon's junior analysts, Kenneth A. Boss, two Salomon investment bankers had exerted improper influence on him. The pressure came just weeks after Salomon had adopted rules to keep research independent. 
As Mr. Boss tells the tale, in late June, after spending weeks on a report analyzing three office furniture companies, he was lukewarm about the stocks' prospects and assigned them a neutral and high-risk rating. He argued that until the overall business climate improved, demand for these companies' products would be lackluster. When two Salomon investment bankers and Mr. Boss's immediate supervisor saw the draft report, they demanded that he revise it to be more upbeat. Mr. Boss refused. A few days later, on June 27, he was fired. Mr. Boss, 33, was offered $24,230 in severance from Salomon, which he refused.
"I was stunned," Mr. Boss said. "I just couldn't believe it."
Stories like Mr. Boss's illustrate how entrenched the old and lucrative practice of linking research to investment banking transactions has become at the nation's large brokerage firms and how hard it will be to root out.
"There was no pressure from investment bankers on Mr. Boss's report," said Arda Nazerian, a spokeswoman for Salomon. "He was terminated for performance reasons. He had a clear goal he was supposed to meet, and he failed to meet it." In two performance reviews, she added, Mr. Boss's failure to meet the goal was noted.
Six weeks before Mr. Boss was fired, Mr. Carpenter had announced new rules to "ensure the value and integrity of our research product." To eliminate the opportunity for investment bankers to influence research reports improperly, the firm restricted communications between analysts and bankers or traders.
Beginning on June 3, for example, the firm said that any fact checking by the investment banking division of draft research reports would be limited to the first research written about an initial public offering. Moreover, the rules said that any draft research sent to investment banking for fact checking "must omit the rating and target price as well as the investment thesis and valuation analysis sections."
Ms. Nazerian said the rules were voluntary until September.
According to Mr. Boss, two Salomon investment bankers, Richard Moriarty and Marc Schneider, flouted those rules the week of June 23, demanding to see Mr. Boss's report, which was in draft form on his laptop computer. 
Stephen S. Kim, the analyst covering home-building stocks at Salomon and Mr. Boss's immediate supervisor, told him to put the report on the firm's internal network so it could be reviewed by the investment bankers. Mr. Boss protested, noting the firm's new rules. Nevertheless, Mr. Schneider soon went to the research department and reviewed the report on Mr. Boss's laptop. Two of the three office furnishings stocks that Mr. Boss had advised investors to be cautious of -- Interface and Steelcase -- had recently issued bonds that were underwritten by Salomon. 
"Marc was beside himself based on the content and tone of the report," Mr. Boss recalled. "He wanted to know what kind of positives we could add. He left quite agitated. I began to really worry about my future." Mr. Kim told him to stop working on the report, and three days later Mr. Kim fired Mr. Boss.
Salomon declined to make Mr. Kim, Mr. Schneider or Mr. Moriarty available for comment.
Mr. Boss, who joined Salomon in 2000, is considering legal action against the firm and is represented by Jonathan Sack, a partner at Sack & Sack in New York. Mr. Boss has also discussed his termination from Salomon and the events leading up to it with investigators in Mr. Spitzer's office who are scrutinizing the relationship between Salomon's investment banking department and its research area. "They came out with new rules and it didn't make any difference, did it?" Mr. Boss asked.
Mr. Boss, who received an undergraduate business degree from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, has worked in research departments for nine years at several firms, including Salomon. After college, he became a broker's assistant at a Shearson Lehman office. A year later, he landed a job in the research department.
SALOMON hired him two years ago from Needham & Company, where Mr. Boss was a senior analyst. He took the job as a junior analyst with the understanding that he would eventually get his own stable of stocks to cover. "I was recruited to help Steve get ranked in Institutional Investor and then I'd get the opportunity to cover my own group," Mr. Boss said. Institutional Investor magazine publishes a listing of the most popular analysts in dozens of industries each fall, and investment firms use the rankings to determine salaries and bonuses. 
Mr. Boss said he did his best to help; during his first year at Salomon, Mr. Kim was only a runner-up. In 2001, Mr. Kim rose to the "second team" in the home-builder category.
Last March, Mr. Boss said he went to Jeffrey Waters, associate director of United States equity research, and asked about his promotion. "I received all 10's on my review in 2001," he said, referring to the highest score possible. His bonus for the year was $100,000, almost 100 percent of his salary. Mr. Waters told him to be patient. Salomon was interested in adding coverage in the sector, he said, but spring was the busy marketing season, when analysts spend all their time trying to increase their Institutional Investor ranking by visiting clients who are polled by the magazine. After that effort was over, Mr. Boss would get his chance, he recalled Mr. Waters saying.
In his two years at Salomon, Mr. Boss said, it was standard for investment bankers who pitched securities transactions to clients to promise research coverage, if the companies were not covered already. Until this year, Salomon's research team did not have an analyst covering the three office furniture companies. "We added coverage in the sector because of investment banking deals," he said.
Unlike many other sectors of the stock market, shares of home and office furnishing companies were hot in 2001 and early 2002. After Salomon helped Steelcase and Interface raise money in the bond market, Mr. Boss said, Mr. Kim told him that the firm had promised them research coverage. "I was given a six-week window to do the report," Mr. Boss recalled, adding that he was also told that he would be asked to present his findings to the firm's stock steering committee. Thrilled, he set about researching the industry. 
As he proceeded, Mr. Boss said, he began to believe that the companies' stocks did not merit purchase, at least in the near term. The economic environment had remained slack, and the companies' shares had risen in recent months. "We believe the timing of a new investment in the office furnishings sector is somewhat premature," he wrote.
In a discussion with Mr. Kim about his progress on the report, Mr. Boss made clear his doubts on the sector. He said Mr. Kim began to fret. Mr. Boss, who sat within earshot of Mr. Kim, said his superior called the investment bankers and discussed the report, but was careful to do so on his cellphone. Mr. Boss said that Mr. Kim had told him to be careful to limit conversations with investment banking to cellphones because Mr. Spitzer's release of the now infamous Merrill Lynch e-mail messages had been so damaging to that firm. Furthermore, internal phone lines, which might be taped, were not to be used.
Mr. Boss said he was fired a few days later by Mr. Kim, who told him that because the research report had not been completed on time, the junior analyst was out. Mr. Boss said he was shocked. He collected some personal items and left the office. 
The Salomon spokeswoman said, "Though obligated as an employee, he never raised any complaints or concerns until after his release." Moreover, his complaint came in the context of negotiating a larger severance, she said.
Mr. Boss said he did not appeal his termination because he did not believe his superiors would back him over Mr. Kim. He said that Mr. Waters was not the type of manager to upset the apple cart and that Kevin J. McCaffrey, the department's director, did not deal with problems related to day-to-day operations or junior analysts.
Salomon declined to make Mr. Waters or Mr. McCaffrey available.
Mr. Sack, the lawyer, is negotiating with Salomon to get a better severance for Mr. Boss, and he said that over recent weeks Salomon had provided varying reasons for his client's dismissal. First, the explanation was that he missed the deadline for the report. But, he said, that did not make sense because Mr. Boss was fired on June 27 and the report was not due until July 1. Later, when Mr. Sack discussed the matter with Marcy Engel, general counsel at Salomon, she told him that Mr. Boss was terminated because he was not doing his job. Mr. Sack said she was unable to provide documentation, however, to support her claim.
"Here is a guy who fell out of favor with Salomon Smith Barney managers for all the wrong reasons," Mr. Sack said. "He was fired for failure to compromise his ethics by not supporting the mandate to write a positive research report. Rather than applaud this courageous whistle-blower, he lost his livelihood, and most likely, his career on the sell side."
Salomon declined to comment when asked if Mr. Kim had been placed on administrative leave. "Mr. Kim is an employee of the firm," said Ms. Nazerian. Mr. Kim could not be reached. 
In an affidavit that Mr. Boss submitted to Salomon and the New York attorney general, he said investment bankers at the firm regularly told Mr. Kim of pending banking assignments and merger and acquisition activities involving companies in his sector. "In violation of the rules, Steve issued favorable research reports on the companies involved (homebuilders) after he became knowledgeable of the transactions," Mr. Boss said in his affidavit.
Mr. Boss also said in his statement that shortly after the Masco Corporation, a maker of building products, sold 22 million shares to the public in an underwriting co-managed by Salomon this spring, and after Mr. Kim had raised his estimates for the company, Mr. Kim asked Masco management to help with the installation of a new kitchen in his Westchester home. According to Mr. Boss's affidavit, Masco spent more than $10,000 sending materials and two high-level managers from Michigan to Mr. Kim's home for several days.
Skip Cypert, a Masco spokesman, said, "We gave him the same service we give to any other customer." 
Mr. Sack said he was considering filing a claim against Solomon under the new whistle-blower legislation recently pased by Congress. "Salomon Smith Barney could have simply righted the mistake by reinstating Ken Boss," Mr. Sack said.
But even with the new legislation, Wall Street firms remain an especially difficult place for whistle-blowers to come forward internally, said Jeffrey Liddle, a partner at Liddle & Robinson in New York and an expert on employment law. "It's particularly difficult on Wall Street because the regulatory framework includes an internalized blackballing system for the industry," he said. For instance, regulatory forms outlining employees' work histories are filled out by their firms after they leave and are used, Mr. Liddle said, "for the purpose of informing other firms about problems with the terminated employee, whether true or not."
IF a former employee wants to change what is listed on his regulatory forms, he or she must make a case before an arbitration panel. "Even if you succeed there, by that time, you're old news; you're out of a job for a year or two years," Mr. Liddle said.
The hurdles are high for any employee trying to challenge common practice on Wall Street. And the almost complete control brokerage firms have over their former employees' futures may mean that true reform in the securities industry will be a long time in coming. 
"I think what you're going to see is these firms will escape real reform," Mr. Liddle said. "Where a few criminal prosecutions might throw fear into the hearts of corporate executives in other industries, there have been criminal prosecutions on Wall Street for three to four decades and it doesn't seem to have made things any less dicey there."

The Fleeting Romance of the American Road

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
AMERICANS are falling out of love with cars.
 In a speech last week, none other than William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, proclaimed the end of the affair. 
 "The love affair that people have had with automobiles has in some ways grown stale," he said. "Some would say it's even dying." 
Mr. Ford chalked it up to the long running conflict between carmakers and regulators, particularly in California, where "people used to write songs about T-Birds and Corvettes." 
"Today," he said, "they write regulations."
From his perspective, it will take continued effort on breakthrough environmental technologies and a more cooperative approach with regulators to turn things around. Then, he said, people might not be so offended by what their neighbors are driving. 
This sentiment cheered environmental activists, who think the growth of S.U.V.'s, like those Ford produces, has shifted automobiles from a symbol of American innocence to one of material and environmental excess. 
"He's reflecting the sort of love/hate relationship people have developed with their cars in the last couple of decades," said Dan Lashof, science director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Climate Center. 
"Clearly, people like their individual cars, but they are very concerned with what their cars are doing to their neighborhoods and the planet," Mr. Lashof added.
Indeed, carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles have been rising, despite technological improvements, because of the growth of S.U.V.'s and, to a lesser extent, pickups. 
But it would be hard to argue that Americans feel a deep-seated enviro-guilt, since S.U.V. sales continue to rise.
In fact, Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman of General Motors, said last week that the average car buyer hardly cares about conserving gasoline, because it's so cheap.
"We can't go in the opposite direction of our customers," said Mr. Lutz, the former Chrysler president, who is determined to make G.M. designs as bold as they were in the 1950's. 
"At $1 to $1.20 per gallon, they're to be forgiven for buying Navigators and Hummer H2's," he said.
Further, it's equally hard to argue that people don't love automobiles anymore when sales have held up so well in a balky economy. 
So do Americans feel differently than they used to? For some cultural distance, we asked a Frenchman.
"It's like saying Germans don't want to drink beer anymore or the Japanese don't want to east sushi," said Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, the founder of Archetype Discoveries, a design consulting firm that works with most of the major automakers. He helped design Chrysler's PT Cruiser, one of the few truly distinctive cars on the road.
Dr. Rapaille said that, to the contrary, America's passion for cars is not waning. "The reality," he said, "is that the American carmakers aren't producing the cars people want anymore."
He put the blame on environmental engineering, safety engineering, overemphasis on aerodynamics and all sorts of mechanical factors conspiring to defang automobiles. 
"The automakers have been going too much into the cortex," Dr. Rapailled added.
Why else would some of the most prominent automobiles seen in movies today be from another era? 
In the new action movie "XXX," for instance, the star Vin Diesel drives a Pontiac GTO from the 1960's. 
And if Hollywood can't seem to cast female stars who are past their 30's, it also can't seem to cast Ford Mustangs that are younger than 30, like the one that Nicholas Cage tried to steal in "Gone in 60 Seconds."
Cars with that kind of emotional pull are rare now. Much of the juice of the auto industry has gone into S.U.V.'s, and you can't really love an S.U.V. the same way. 
An old Mustang, for example, was like a quarterback. You expected it to have some swagger, some style.
S.U.V.'s are like offensive linemen. You want them big and able to carry a load. 
"I've never heard anyone call an S.U.V. 'my baby,' " Dr. Rapaille said.
Falling in love with one "is like falling in love with a tank," he said, adding, "You never get the same feeling."

HEADLINE: The World; 
Giving Argentina The Cinderella Treatment

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
BRAZIL came away with a $30 billion bailout, and Uruguay got a much-needed $1.5 billion. But when Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill arrived here this week to survey the wreckage of Argentina's economy, all he had to offer was the same advice Argentina has been getting since its crisis began: tighten your belt even further and eventually a recovery will come.
 While a majority of economists might have endorsed that approach six months ago, when the Argentine economy had just imploded, it appears they no longer do. Upon further reflection, a growing number of independent analysts now maintain that many of Argentina's troubles stem from having followed Washington's advice in the first place and that the formula being insisted upon is only making matters worse. 
 As Mr. O'Neill and the International Monetary Fund see it, Argentina is a victim of its own profligacy and must cut spending until no budget deficit remains. But Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economics professor at Columbia University who has advised several third world governments, compares that prescription to the medieval medical procedure of bleeding sick patients, noting that advanced economies like that of the United States abandoned such practices long ago.
"They are telling Argentina to take a depression as a given and, since tax revenues aren't being collected anymore, to adjust their spending down to that level," Professor Sachs said. "They are not thinking straight at all. That's Herbert Hoover economics."
In fact, the last two times the United States confronted recessions, the Republican administrations then in office did exactly the opposite of what Mr. O'Neill is now telling Argentina to do. When the elder George Bush faced a downturn in 1992 far less severe than Argentina's, the federal deficit rose to nearly 5 percent of gross domestic product; under Ronald Reagan in 1983, deficit spending was more than 5 percent of G.D.P.
At the moment, Argentina's provincial governments are being chastised as especially prodigal. But the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington has calculated that the provincial deficits are relatively minor, amounting to only 0.5 percent of G.D.P. in 2000 and 1 percent last year, and may be providing the only real stimulus to the economy.
"In response to a depression, this is not a lot of spending, especially since the central government is not doing anything to alleviate poverty," said Mark Weisbrot, a director of the center. Since the inflation and growth rates in 2001 were negative, as they have been for several years, "that money was a boost to the economy by definition."
In reality, most of Argentina's deficit is simply the result of arbitrary accounting procedures and not a reflection of wastefulness. By privatizing the social security system in 1994, much in the fashion the Bush administration is now proposing in the United States, the Argentine government could no longer count social security payments as revenues and had to move them outside the budget.
Had Argentina not privatized social security at the urging of the I.M.F., it would actually have shown a budget surplus in recent years. Indeed, according to another study published by the Center for Economic and Policy Research early this year, government spending in Argentina has remained remarkably steady, at about 19 percent of G.D.P. throughout the 1990's.
T HE numbers were artificially distorted by the privatization," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, the author of "Globalization and its Discontents" and a winner of the Nobel Prize in economic science. "They did make enormous amounts of expenditure cuts in a real sense, and that is one of the factors contributing to the downturn."
Jose Ignacio de Mendiguren, a former minister of production and president of the Argentine Industrial Union, agrees. Not only was "the reform of the social security system the principal factor responsible for the fiscal imbalance," he said in an interview here, but "the state ended up having to turn to the private pension funds to finance the deficit caused by the very creation of that system."
Unlike economists, the Bush administration remains unwilling to adjust its initial analysis. Administration officials like Otto J. Reich, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, continue to argue that the problem is Argentina itself, not the policies that have been imposed on it.
"You shouldn't take Argentina as the failure of a particular model," Mr. Reich said during a news conference here last month. The real problem, in his view, is that "in some countries those policies were implemented properly and in others they were not." He offered, in contrast, El Salvador, which is heavily dependent on remittances from citizens living in the United States.
Even more than the Bush administration, the I.M.F. has much at stake here, especially now that Brazil has been loaned an additional $30 billion and the banking system in neighboring Uruguay is teetering. But Dr. Stiglitz, who was chief economist for the World Bank in the late 1990's, sees few signs of flexibility or creativity in the I.M.F.'s decision to send a team of four "wise men," all from central banks, to advise Argentina.
"Central bankers would like to claim that inflation is the most important thing for promoting economic growth," he said. "But there is absolutely no evidence of that," and in any case, Argentina is struggling with deflation, "which we recognize as being every bit as bad as inflation and maybe even worse."
So why does Washington continue to tell Argentina to make even more budget cuts instead of unleashing the spending and investment that could stimulate growth? Many here believe that the arbiters of the global economy want to punish Argentina so that other countries won't be tempted to default on their debts, and George Soros, who made billions of dollars playing the markets but is another with second thoughts about what is happening here, seems to agree. "Sovereign states do not provide any tangible security," he wrote recently. "The only security the lender has is the pain that the borrower will suffer if it defaults. That is why the private sector has been so strenuously opposed to any measure that would reduce the pain" of the 37 million people here who continue to find themselves held hostage to an experiment in economic orthodoxy.

HEADLINE: Every Market Collapse Is Different 

BYLINE:  By Nicholas F. Brady; Nicholas F. Brady was secretary of the Treasury from 1988 to 1993.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This is an extraordinary period for American investors. Caution should be their compass. It would be an error to expect a speedy correction like the one that followed the last major stock market implosion.
 Fifteen years ago President Ronald Reagan asked me to head the commission to examine the market crash of October 1987. From the close of trading on Oct. 13, 1987, to the close of trading on Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 769 points, or 31 percent. In those four days of trading, the value of all outstanding United States stocks decreased by almost $1 trillion. On Oct. 19 alone, the Dow fell by 508 points, or 22.6 percent. Only the Crash of 1929 approaches the 1987 decline in magnitude. 
 The conclusion we reached in the fall of 1987 was that the market was not equipped to handle the volume that arose so suddenly. The recommendations of our report -- improved clearance and settlement procedures, the adoption of circuit breakers and an increase in capacity -- were put into place. The crash was the result of a structural problem. Valuations were not the culprit.
The present market collapse is different; it was caused by vastly overblown valuations. The stock market has been in a colossal bubble, a delusion born in the late 1990's that reached its zenith in 2000. While not common, bubbles have always been a fact of market life, a byproduct of runaway human emotions. They arise when people congregate and talk -- and today market commentary is constant on cable TV and the Internet. Unfortunately, investors are finding that the breathless talking heads and brokers are hardly objective.
We are now experiencing the bursting of a bubble. But there is no textbook that explains how an economy recovers from a bubble. It is clear only that we must work down the excesses in the system in capacity, consumption and debt that were created in the late 90's.
Meanwhile, Americans' investment habits have changed. Now they are as likely to have their assets in the market as in a savings account or invested in their home. But markets change rapidly, and the public is discovering much of their wealth is in someone else's hands. In times like these, assigning blame becomes popular; politicians, especially, are adept at identifying somebody else's mistakes. This is conversation, not wisdom. Take it with a grain of salt.
Now what to do? I have always believed that people make money betting against the end of the world. Certainly anyone who bet against an investment in the United States in the last 50 years has been on the wrong side of the wager. Still, it was easy, even in the 90's, to realize that the market was drastically overpriced. It's difficult to know now where the bottom is. Markets overrun on the downside just as they do on the upside.
There is an old Bahamian expression: "Never mind the noise in the market, pay attention to the price of the fish." But how will we know what the right price is or, perhaps more important, the quality of the fish? Real progress has come from the sorry events of the last year. Accountants and corporate executives must now produce accurate figures that are consistent and clear. Investors will have more reliable information. Our economic and political system has a marvelous capacity for improvement.
But in contrast to 1987, this correction will take time; the president and Congress have already enacted the necessary reforms. Meanwhile, the nerve-racking swings in the market will continue. But the confusion will eventually clear, as it always has, and the market -- and the economy -- will start to make sense again.

HEADLINE: The World: Setting Sun?; 
Japan Anxiously Looks Ahead

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
YEAR in and year out since Japan's financial bubble burst in 1990, American presidents have needled and cajoled the country's leaders to fix their economy and restore Japan to its rightful place in the world.
 Gradually, though, as this country has continued its drift, a more skeptical view has begun to gain ground: Japan is returning to its rightful place in the world, that of a middling country of vastly diminished and still declining importance in world affairs. 
 From the ashes of World War II, Japan enjoyed one of the fastest economic rises ever seen. Its successes made it widely envied by developing nations everywhere, as an example of how much a democratic, capitalistic country could achieve in a short period of time. Now, if its decline continues, it could have profound implications for American diplomatic and military policy in Asia. 
Twelve years after its stock market collapsed, along with its dreams of superpower status, Japan is still frozen in denial about a dysfunctional political system built on institutionalized cronyism. By contrast, the United States is already seeing strong stirrings of reform just weeks into a crisis over business ethics.
Not everyone is ready to turn out the lights on Japan. The Hudson Institute, for example, has just published a book titled "The Re-Emergence of Japan as a Super State." In a recent opinion column in The Wall Street Journal, the institute's president, Herbert London, cited Japan's "100 percent literacy rate, stable leadership, products valued in world markets, mastery of Western management techniques and a belief in purposeful communal action," and concluded "it is not hard to be confident in Japan's future."
But recent signals from Washington suggest much greater skepticism, as diplomats say the Bush administration has increasing doubts that Japan will ever again become a global mover and shaker.
It is not just that Japan is not what it used to be. Some analysts say even its decline matters far less than it might once have, because it failed, when times were still good, to convert some of the immense wealth it had accumulated into more lasting power and influence.
"Looked at objectively, Japan is a rather insignificant power in terms of its contributions to the rest of the world," said Ronald A. Morse, a professor of Japanese studies at the University of California at Los Angeles who is also an executive with a telecommunications firm here. "If the country keeps receding, or even disappeared, there is hardly anything that would have a major negative impact abroad. The reason this sounds shocking is because everybody still remembers the Godzilla image of a Japan not so long ago that was going to swallow up America."
For other observers, however, Japan's long slide has huge implications for the future of Asia and beyond. Japan is a model for few in Asia these days, and with the country's diplomacy in disarray, those who take their cues from Tokyo are a fast dwindling number, leaving a vacuum that may be filled by less closely allied friends of the United States, or by outright rivals.
Indeed, from Central Asia to the Korean peninsula, many analysts believe the coming decades are shaping up to be a competition for diplomatic and economic sway between Russia and China. And if Moscow and Washington draw closer, that would only accelerate Japan's declining influence in Asia, and make Japan less able to serve as a counterweight to China.
I F the Japanese really lost hope, they might start thinking more about acquiescing in Chinese power," said Robyn Lim, an expert in international relations at Nanzan University in Nagoya, "so Japan's return to some semblance of economic health is a vital interest of the U.S. for both security and economic reasons.
"How to influence Japanese policy is the big problem, since the leadership is now completely paralyzed."
Japan's stalemate is especially striking when compared to the energetic diplomacy of Russia, another diminished Asian power, and one with virtually no economic hand to play. Still, by virtue of its nuclear prowess and proximity to central Asia, the Caucasus and eastern Europe, Russia has gone in the blink of an eye from nuclear enemy of the United States to strategic partner, even contemplating cooperation on missile shield development. Over that same stretch, Japan, which was disarmed by the United States in 1945 and remains pacifist, has never overcome its ambivalence about American missile shields, despite its longstanding alliance with Washington.
The rise of China presents Japan with its greatest challenge since the Second World War, but has left Tokyo seeming both intimidated and confused, shifting nervously between appeasement with generous development assistance, and provocations. These include visits by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to a controversial shrine, Japan's imperial army veterans and trade spats.
Japan's discomfort reflects what experts say are the painful choices that loom as its population shrinks and ages dramatically.
Some Japanese may be tempted to rearm and go it alone behind a leader like Tokyo's popular governor Shintaro Ishihara. Mr. Ishihara is a sort of East Asian Jean-Marie Le Pen, who demonizes ethnic minorities and taunts China as well as the West, as in his famous 1989 book, "The Japan That Can Say No." But with low economic growth its best-case outcome, realism will oblige Japan to cling ever more tightly to the United States for its security.
Japan's recent failure of dynamism is of a piece with a pattern seen at least since 1868, when the Meiji Restoration threw off feudalism and two centuries of isolationism to meet the challenge from the West. The country has veered between catastrophes, marshaling its energies fantastically well toward recovery, as after World War II, and then blindly holding on until the next crash.
What's changed is that the world moves far faster now, and squandered moments, even Japan's lost decade, may be irretrievable. The country's moment of truth may have been in the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when, as Yoichi Funabashi, the international affairs commentator of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, wrote, "Japan found itself merely an automatic teller machine, one that needed a kick before dispensing the cash."
AS inadequate as mere checkbook diplomacy is, the Japan that is being written off today is increasingly unable even to play that game the way it once did because of its huge debt and pension woes. But even when Japan had wealth to spare, it was unable to overcome the deep historic wounds left over from its imperial conquests of the 1930's, or to systematically strengthen its political and economic ties with Asian neighbors.
"If you look beyond the United States, the countries that have been able to play a significant role in the world of ideas are all rather second-rate European countries: the British, the French, even the Swedish," said Sheldon M. Garon, a historian of Japan at Princeton University. "Japan has contributed very little to the discussion. They don't really have the vision to become world citizens, and have done a really horrible job of promoting alternatives to American dominance."
Perhaps the most essential element in Japan's relative decline is its insularity. Although familiar, this feature of the country reflects a great irony. With its mastery of the production and marketing of consumer electronics, Japan was an early mover in globalization. And yet here again it has failed to adjust, placing alongside isolated North Korea in international rankings of English-speaking ability. Meanwhile, even Japan's coming population crunch has failed to open the country to immigrants.
As the country's bureaucrats cook up one costly high tech plan after another in hopes of putting Japan back into the driver's seat, few here seem to have realized that money alone doesn't build Silicon Valleys. No, that is a task for open societies that draw on the world's best brains.
"I see only two things Japan can do, and they are inseparable: opening up the country and its institutions," said Jean-Pierre Lehmann, a longtime Japan specialist at I.M.D., a graduate management school in Lausanne, Switzerland. "But I don't see this happening, because Japan just doesn't want foreigners. Meanwhile, you can't rebel in Japan, so the most talented young people are leaving the country or are simply resigned."

HEADLINE: Homicides Rise Again, Threatening Oakland's Renaissance 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Aug. 9 

 BODY:
Killing No. 69 of 2002, a shooting, took place on Thursday night just three blocks from a neighborhood rally to stop the violence in the streets. Killing No. 68, another shooting, happened on Tuesday while 2,000 Oaklanders were rallying all over the city as part of a "National Night Out" against crime.
 This is turning out to be a deadly year in Oakland. Only two years ago, the city was promoting its renaissance and boasting about bringing violent crime to its knees. But after several years of decline in the number of killings, Oakland, like many midsized cities, is finding itself faltering with the national economy, and wrestling anew with rising crime. 
 With 69 killings so far this year, compared with 48 at the same time last year, the anguished fear of getting caught in a bullet's path is back.
July was a particularly bad month -- 15 killings. Many people in this city, especially in East Oakland, are still mourning victim No. 64. In that shooting, Katherine Bagwell, 23, was killed as she sat with her 7-year-old daughter, Jaunnicia Milton, who saw her father shot to death a year ago. 
The memorial to Ms. Bagwell, who witnesses say was shot because she knew the identity of Jaunnicia's father's killer, is as much a memorial to a little girl's lost innocence, with as many teddy bears as candles.
"That was really shocking," said Cassandra Jones, who stopped by the memorial to add a small white teddy bear and a red candle to the growing tribute. "When they start shooting in front of a little girl -- and she was shot too, in the leg -- you know things are out of control."
Mayor Jerry Brown is asking voters to approve tax increases of $63.5 million over five years to add 100 officers to Oakland's force of 750, complaining that the city's force is smaller by far than those of most cities of Oakland's size. But he blames several factors for Oakland's beleaguered streets.
"I don't think anyone can pinpoint any particular cause," Mayor Brown said. "These things cycle. Sometimes there are a lot of parolees hitting the streets. There are some serious violent gangsters coming out of the prisons, and basically they're taking back their corners. As you increase the open-air drug markets, turf becomes more valuable. Most of these murders are executions."
The Oakland Police Department estimates that 60 to 65 percent of the city's violent crimes are committed by an estimated 10,000 people who are either on parole or probation and that about 80 percent of the killings committed are drug-related.
"A large percentage of the homicides are centered around the violence that emanates around the sale of drugs," said George Phillips, a police spokesman. "You have people who for the most part are undereducated, they're from low-income backgrounds, they have low job skills, and they have no hope, unfortunately. And the drug business is a very lucrative business."
Anyone who passes by certain streets of East Oakland would know the drug dealers are back in force. This afternoon, when the temperature was near 90, young men in twos and threes were huddled around the corners of 65th Avenue and International Boulevard wearing the bulky parkas used to stash bundles of drugs.
The scene looked like the bad old days of crack, when the city's homicides peaked at 175 in 1992. But not everyone here believes that adding 100 more officers is the solution. The Oakland Police Department has more than a few critics. It is still recovering from a scandal involving several officers accused of beating and kidnapping suspects, filing false reports and obstructing justice. 
Last week, hundreds of young people gathered in downtown Oakland to protest the plan to hire 100 new officers, saying it would do little to squelch the violence. 
"Locking people up in prison, where they get even more hardened, isn't the answer," said Joliet Rodriguez, a 20-year-old student. "I've seen people locked up for possession and end up killing somebody when they get out." 
Mayor Brown says the city is not just looking for more officers. Oakland is also inventing and expanding programs that deal with the maladies that create drug dealers, he said. 
"When some hard-core drug dealers comes out of prison, where he served 10 years, he has nowhere to go," Mr. Brown said. "That's the great scandal here. The lockup is a quick fix." 
The city is working with inmates in the state prison system before they are released, Mr. Brown said, as well as after. One program makes new parolees attend meetings that address their needs -- education, job training, drug counseling -- and follow them through. "We in Oakland, " Mr. Brown said, "are doing what the state should be doing."

HEADLINE: STAGNANT WAGES POSE ADDED RISKS TO WEAK ECONOMY 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Although the recession has ended, the wages of more than 100 million workers are still stagnant, endangering the consumer spending that sustains the fragile recovery. 
 The stagnation in total wages paid to the nation's employees outside of government is now a year old, according to newly revised government data, which paints a bleak picture of the economy. The rising cost of company-sponsored health insurance is also taking a bite out of take-home pay. Rather than pay the premium increases themselves, companies are deducting much of the additional cost from employee paychecks. 
 The recovery's survival may be riding on how people perceive these constraints on their wages, which they are just beginning to notice, says Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumer Sentiment. "People are telling us about smaller paychecks," he said. Meager raises or no raises at all are a problem for them, he added, "but what they are really noticing is the loss of overtime hours, which effectively lowers their income. And they are beginning to cut back on spending." 
Not everyone accepts the new wage revisions published by the Commerce Department as proof of stagnation. A broader measure of personal income, one that includes items like Social Security benefits and unemployment insurance as well as wages, has risen recently. Some forecasters have seized on this improvement to argue that the economy is generating enough new income to strengthen the recovery by early next year.
But there is an obstacle to optimism. The personal income numbers, while broader than wages, do not include capital gains from the sale of stock. This huge source of income in the late 1990's has shrunk considerably since early last year, judging from the shortfall in expected tax payments last April 15, economists at the Congressional Budget Office say.
The bottom line of the various conflicting numbers is that they seem to cancel each other out, leaving insufficient income growth, for the moment, to convert a weak economy into a strong one. "What we have is a grinding slowdown in the incomes that people have available to spend, from whatever the source," said Lee Price, chief economist for the Senate Budget Committee.
Some workers have resisted the downward pressure on their wages, only reluctantly agreeing, for example, to scale back raises in exchange for company payment of most of the increase in health insurance premiums. That is the concession that 2,700 employees of the Hershey Food Corporation accepted in June, after a six-week strike. In a weak economy, with unemployment rising, the bargaining power of the nation's wage earners has diminished.
"We see two reasons why employers will ask their workers to pay a bigger portion of the health insurance increase this year than in past years," said James Foreman, a managing director of Towers Perrin, a consulting firm that specializes in compensation. "Profits are squeezed so employers have to shift more of the cost to employees, and it is harder and harder to get a job, so companies don't have to worry about employees going somewhere else."
Dan England, chief executive of C. R. England Inc., a long-haul trucking company with headquarters in Salt Lake City, is among those not yet worrying about defections among his 3,200 drivers, although freight traffic is picking up. None of his competitors have raised pay, Mr. England says, and he will not be the first. He has not granted a raise in two years; his drivers earn 25 to 40 cents a mile, and gross $35,000 to $40,000 a year.
"We are just starting to ask our customers to pay higher freight rates," Mr. England said. "Until we get those, we would not even consider raising wages." Meanwhile, he has passed on to his drivers in each of the last two years a larger percentage of the increase in health insurance premiums.
So has Robert Waggoner, chief executive of Burrelle's Information Services, in Livingston, N.J. Its 2,700 employees compile media references for clients, most of them corporations. Mr. Waggoner said that his workers, whose wages average $10 to $12 an hour, are paying as much as 15 percent of this year's increase in health insurance premiums, up from 9 percent last year. The annual raise, however, has been restricted to the 3.5 percent awarded in 2000 and 2001. That is down from 5 percent a year in the booming late 90's.
"As business turns up and the market gets tighter, then we would have to competitively increase the raises," Mr. Waggoner said. But business has not turned up, nor has he seen any sign that an upturn is approaching. So in addition to larger deductions for health insurance premiums, overtime hours have been cut, further reducing take-home pay.
The stagnation in the nation's total wages and salaries, adjusted for inflation, affects 110 million workers, most of them below management ranks. It results not only from meager raises, but also from cutbacks in hours, the disappearance of nearly 1.7 million jobs since March 2001 and the rise in the unemployment rate, which now stands at 5.9 percent. Until these problems developed, the total outlay for private-sector workers had climbed by more than 5 percent a year starting in 1997, reaching a peak annual rate of $4.190 trillion, adjusted for inflation, in the fourth quarter of 2000.
And then, over the next year -- much of it while the economy was in recession -- $94 billion in pay disappeared, with only $9 billion recovered in a mild rebound so far this year.
"It is really amazing how stretched out the wage deceleration has been," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. "It is testimony to how much upward pressure on wages there was in the tight labor markets of the boom years, and how much time it is taking to unwind that pressure."
Translated into production and spending, the wages and salaries lost so far were almost enough to shave a full percentage point off economic growth, which helps to explain why the economy grew at an annual rate of only 1.1 percent from April through June. The $4.1 trillion in wages and salaries represents, after all, almost 40 percent of the nation's economic activity.
But wages and salaries are not the only measure of how income is doing. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes a broader indicator called "personal income." Wages and salaries are the largest single item, of course. But personal income also includes unemployment payments, Social Security benefits, income from self-employment, rental payments to landlords, interest earned from savings accounts and bonds, and employer payments for health insurance and pensions. Although this last outlay does not go directly to employees, the government counts it as income to them on the ground that it is made by their employers on their behalf.
Viewed so broadly, personal income surged in June, the latest month for which numbers are available. Gains in many of the nonwage items have more than offset the stagnation in wages and salaries.
With personal income rising, Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis, sees a robust recovery by early next year. In support of that view, he points not only to the improvement in overall personal income but to what he sees as an end to the stagnation in the wages and salaries component. The stagnation, he says, is giving way to growth.
There is also a boost to income from the Bush administration's tax cut, which lowered income tax deductions this year for millions of wage earners, putting a bit more money in their take-home pay.
"People don't think about their wages," Mr. Varvares said, contradicting Mr. Curtin's latest survey findings. "They go out and buy what they need and because it is cheap relative to their income, they have money left over. They don't look at their wages; they observe their finances over time."
There is guesswork, however, in some of the calculations of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. For example, bonus payments, which companies have increasingly used in lieu of raises, are included in personal income, although the bureau learns the size of the actual payouts only late in the year. In the interim, it makes assumptions.
"We assume that the growth pattern of irregular pay is the same as regular pay," said Carol Moylan, chief of the bureau's personal income division. "If it is not, and it sometimes is not, we have a problem."
Capital gains, which include earnings from the sale of stock, are another black hole in calculating what is happening to people's incomes and therefore to their spending power in these critical early months of the recovery. The bureau does not attempt to include them in its measure of personal income, although capital gains added greatly to income in the boom years but much less over the last 18 months, judging from the sharp fall in tax payments last April. 
Only about half of the $150 billion in tax payments expected that month actually arrived. The shortfall suggests to economists at the Congressional Budget Office that the stock market sell-off wiped out capital gains and the tax revenue they generate. Canceled or shrunken bonuses and worthless stock options might also be factors, they said. Whatever the explanation, the tax payment shortfall indicates a loss in personal income of $200 billion or more, most of it among wealthy Americans.
Just how much they lost is not known yet. Many wealthy people ask for and get postponements in filing their tax returns. But the advance billing is not good. "We have arrived, on balance, at income stagnation," Mr. Bernstein said, "and that is a problem for the economy."

Town Still Struggles Decade After Base Cuts
 When the Pentagon gave the boot to boot camp at Fort Dix in South Jersey 10 years ago this month, Wrightstown, just outside its main entrance, got kicked hard. 
 Today, Wrightstown is still marching uphill in search of economic recovery.
Basic training was eliminated at Fort Dix as part of an effort to cut military spending. The 50-square-mile base had become a major basic-training site during World War II, and in 1990 was still turning 35,000 young civilians a year into soldiers. 
Today the fort houses various activities of all the services, including reservists' training and a civilian federal prison.
But the most important -- and painful -- change for the economies of nearby communities has been that where roughly 11,000 military people were assigned to the base at any given time in the late 1980's, the number today is about 3,000.
Wrightstown has suffered "to the biggest degree" from this change, its mayor, Thomas Harper, said last week. Its population of 748 in 2000 was down from 3,843 in 1990, reflecting plunges in the number of civilian as well as military residents, he said. 
Many restaurants, bars and other businesses closed years ago, and about 15 buildings on or near Fort Dix Street, the main road into the base, are still vacant eyesores, he noted. He said a recent "major setback" was the military's closing of an important road to town because of security concerns after Sept. 11.
"It's a grim scene," the mayor said. But local leaders are working hopefully toward the future, he said. Citing one proposal to build a medical-office complex and another to clean up the vacant sites and offer them to a developer, he said: "We want to become a commercial center and cater to the communities around us. We don't want to rely on the military anymore."

Yeshiva Housing Policy Now Takes In Gay Pairs
In 1998, two lesbian students sued Yeshiva University, charging that it discriminated illegally in denying housing to same-sex couples. The women, Maggie Jones, above, and Sara Levin, were students at the university's Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx and had domestic partners who were not students there.
The university said its policy was not biased against homosexuals because unmarried heterosexual couples were also excluded from the subsidized apartments. Lower courts agreed and dismissed the suit. But in a widely noted ruling, the New York State Court of Appeals reinstated the suit last year, saying a trial was needed to determine if the housing policy had a "disparate impact" on gays and lesbians.
But a trial is no longer required on the issue, lawyers on both sides said last week. They said that the university changed its policy last month, at least for housing at the medical college, so that a student there may now live with any non-student "with whom the student maintains a genuine, close and interdependent relationship that is or is intended to be long-term." 
The university's lawyer, Mark A. Jacoby, said that the old policy would have allowed each plaintiff and her partner to live as roommates if the partner had also been a student at the medical college. Now, he said, a permitted resident may not only be a non-student domestic partner, but "could be your mother."
He said the university had "decided it was preferable to change the policy." But he and James Esseks of the American Civil Liberties Union, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said they did not know if the change affected university housing beyond that at the medical college. A Yeshiva spokeswoman could not clarify this on Friday.

HEADLINE: Longshoremen Accuse Government of Management Bias 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
The longshoremen's union is angrily accusing the Bush administration of siding with management in a contract dispute that threatens to shut down all West Coast ports.
 Officials with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union said a Labor Department official had told them the administration might order an 80-day cooling off period or have the military operate the ports if the union staged a strike or work slowdown. 
 "He made these threats in a meeting with our top officers," Steve Stallone, a union spokesman, said. "He even threatened that the government would use the National Guard. The government said these weren't threats, that they were just giving us information they thought we should know. This is mobster talk." 
Bush administration officials and business executives across the nation fear that a job action at the ports, which handle nearly $300 billion in cargo annually, could wreak havoc on the nation's already wobbly economy.
The longshoremen's contract expired on July 1, and thousands of businesses, including auto dealers and department stores, fear that a work stoppage could come at any time. Union officials said the 10,500 dock workers had not yet been asked to vote on a strike.
Union leaders said the Labor Department official, Andrew Siff, had also told them the administration might seek legislation to put the union under the Railway Labor Act, giving the president greater powers to stop a walkout. Union officials also said that Mr. Siff, a counsel to Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao, had warned that the administration might propose legislation to break up the bargaining unit that covers longshoremen at all major ports from San Diego to Seattle. Such a move would mean that the union could shut down just one West Coast port at a time.
Union officials said that with these warnings, the administration was seeking to tilt the scales in favor of the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents the shipping lines.
At a meeting last week in Chicago, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council adopted a resolution criticizing the administration's approach, saying, "The mere threat of intervention is an unconscionable effort to bolster the Pacific Maritime Association's contract demands."
Kathleen Harrington, a Labor Department spokeswoman, denied that the Bush administration was taking sides. "We've remained neutral and completely accessible to both sides," Ms. Harrington said. "We have remained neutral because we're firmly committed to the collective bargaining process."
She said Labor Department officials would not discuss the options they were considering. "It's too early to speculate," she said. "The administration has not put forward options because the administration wants to remain neutral."
Last week, The Associated Press and The Los Angeles Times quoted Labor Department officials as saying they were considering ordering an 80-day cooling off period under the Taft-Hartley Act and other options, including breaking up the dock workers' bargaining unit.
James Spinosa, the union's president, said the administration believed that "our union is too strong and monopolizes the West Coast" and that "we are controlling too much economy with one union."
Labor Department officials did not make Mr. Siff available for an interview. Management and union negotiators said he had met twice with negotiators from each side in July and was generally in daily contact with them. The contract has been extended on a day-to-day basis.
The negotiations were suspended three weeks ago, with each side accusing the other of making unrealistic proposals. The talks are scheduled to resume on Tuesday.
On Friday, Joseph Miniace, the president of the maritime association, called on the union to agree to have a mediator to help push the talks forward. The union rejected the proposal.
Several business groups have urged the White House to order a cooling off period if the longshoremen stage a job action, but Mr. Miniace said his association objected. "That doesn't settle the problem," he said. "That just postpones the problem."
He said Mr. Siff had told him the administration also did not favor a cooling off period. Mr. Miniace argued that the government was being even-handed, saying that Mr. Siff had urged him to sweeten management's offer on health insurance.
Longshoremen officials said the negotiations had been hindered by the administration's talk of invoking Taft-Hartley.
Management, Mr. Stallone said, "has had no incentive to negotiate seriously, because they know the government is standing by, ready to act against the union."
The main point of contention is a management proposal to introduce more labor-saving technology to speed cargo handling and to cut costs. The maritime association has sought to reassure the union by promising lifetime jobs to the longshoremen, even when technology makes their jobs redundant.
The union's power to paralyze the ports, the employers say, is a major reason for the workers' unusually high pay -- $80,000 to $158,000 a year, including overtime and premiums.
This year, the employers' group has threatened to lock out the workers if they stage a slowdown.

HEADLINE: Pass the Collection Plate and Charge It 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
For millions of parishioners across the country, there is a new way to give to their local church: charge it. 
 From Lutheran congregations in the Middle West to Greek Orthodox parishes in Florida and Manhattan to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago and the Diocese of San Jose, Calif., a rapidly growing number of churches are embracing electronic giving, a fund-raising tool common among charities and nonprofit groups, but, until recently, little used by religious organizations. 
 Instead of sending cash, coins and personal checks up to the altar on a collection plate, parishioners can use special envelopes to charge monthly donations to their credit cards, or they can add their offerings and gifts to God to the list of monthly bills that can be paid online or through automatic bank account transfers.
Those who choose to contribute this way can donate while they are away on vacation, manage their church accounts by computer and earn frequent flier miles. And churches, which draw most of their money from donations, can count on a steady stream of revenue, even when summer vacations or winter snowstorms keep people away. 
"The church needs to keep up," said the Rev. Michael T. Kontogiorgis, assistant chancellor of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, which is based in New York City, and which will test electronic giving at roughly 20 of its 520 parishes around the country in the next few months. "It's the 21st century. We don't pay with chickens and grapes anymore."
Moving donations from wicker baskets and wooden collection plates into cyberspace or onto credit card and banking statements has given rise to a profitable new financial-services industry aimed at churches, one that already has a major player in a Queens company called ParishPay. But it has also fueled a debate about God and money, spirituality and financial reality and whether technology is interfering with the core rituals of worship.
The Southern Baptist Convention, which represents 16 million American Baptists and has been otherwise quick to embrace technology -- its Web site features the slogan "One people, one purpose, one click" -- does not permit electronic giving.
"God says you bring the offering as an act of worship," said Jack Wilkerson, vice president for business and finance for the Baptist group. "My concern is, we're trying to approach a spiritual problem in the heart of people mechanically. One of these days we're going to wake up and say, 'What happened to our churches?' "
ParishPay, a Long Island City company that was founded last year and has already become a driving force behind the growth of electronic giving in churches, has seized on the economic troubles of many churches and is seeking to capture a huge piece of the Catholic market. Company officials say regularly scheduled donations by credit card or through automatic bank withdrawals can only help the churches.
"When people commit to give regularly to the church, they are much more likely to get involved in other activities of the church," said Joe Mohen, a practicing Catholic, who founded ParishPay. "It tends to make people more involved in the sacramental aspects. From the point of the church, the reality is that it's a win-win-win."
Even as many churches move toward electronic giving, credit cards have been slow to catch on until now. The Lutherans are not accepting credit cards, for philosophical reasons, church officials said, but the Greek Orthodox Church will take plastic, including the Discover Card.
ParishPay has also made significant inroads into the Roman Catholic Church, a tantalizing and largely untapped market with 65 million American Catholics.
The Diocese of San Jose is to announce this week that it will offer the electronic and credit card payment service to its 600,000 parishioners through ParishPay. The Archdiocese of Chicago, the country's third-largest Roman Catholic diocese, with 2.3 million Catholics, is expected to sign a contract with ParishPay within a few days and plans to offer the service at about six parishes this fall and throughout the diocese next year, in addition to the option of charging the tuition for parochial schools, officials there said.
In Chicago, participating churches are likely to provide parishioners with a sticker to place on their offering envelopes that says "I'm using ParishPay," so that the ritual of passing the collection plate and sending a financial gift to the altar will not be lost, said Tim Dockery, director of development for the archdiocese. He added that he expected the new program would ultimately increase donations significantly and level out the church's cash flow, which often rises and dips with the seasons.
Churches across the country that have been experimenting with electronic giving say that, on average, it has increased their donations, although it is too early to tell precisely what the financial impact will be.
"We don't want to create the impression that as long as you give money, we don't care if you show up," Mr. Dockery said, "but there's a convenience factor."
"Support for the church shouldn't be arbitrary," he added. "It should be planned and thoughtful."
The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, with 1.2 million parishioners, became one of ParishPay's first clients, and officials there said that if the pilot program is successful, they would offer it to all 520 of the church's parishes early next year.
ParishPay officials said they were close to agreement with several other major dioceses and are holding discussions with many others.
ParishPay, which processes the credit card charges and automatic bank payments for the churches that enroll also offers an online donation service, at www.ParishPay.com. It charges a 1 percent fee plus $1 monthly per donor. 
That money is withheld from the donations that are made through ParishPay before it reaches the churches.
With the company's promise of steady income that will not dip in the summer or during bad winter weather when worshipers do not make it to services, ParishPay promises to sharply increase -- if not double -- a church's contributions, officials said, citing data they collected from test-marketing the service.
Among Catholics, not everyone is buying the underlying concept. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, which serves 1.6 million Catholics in Brooklyn and Queens, has rejected the idea of electronic giving and the services of ParishPay. The Archdiocese of New York, however, which serves 2.4 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven counties north of New York City, is in discussions with ParishPay, company officials said.
The policy of the Brooklyn diocese is not to solicit credit card payments, diocesan officials said, although parishioners who offer to make pledges and donations with credit cards or through automatic transfers may do so. Some churches have said that they do not want to encourage people to incur debt through the use of credit cards.
"We have made a conscious decision not to actively encourage this," said Francis Galligan, the Brooklyn diocese's chief financial officer. "I don't think it's what we want to do from a spiritual perspective." In some churches and synagogues, individual worshipers have made arrangements with their own banks for automatic payments. Electronic giving is not expected to have a major impact on how Jews give, because there are no weekly offerings, but instead annual synagogue membership fees that are required.
The Lutheran church, which introduced electronic giving in 1998 with a fund-raising program called Simply Giving, was the only religious organization offering electronic giving on a national level until ParishPay signed up the Greek Orthodox church and others. Now, 4,500 of its 18,800 Lutheran congregations are enrolled in the service, with the electronic payments processed by Vanco Services, a Minnesota company that has also just enrolled several Methodist churches in a pilot electronic-giving service, officials said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 16, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about churches that accept donations by credit card and other electronic means included an erroneous reference to church policy from an official of the Southern Baptist Convention. The convention's executive committee said it had no official position on electronic donations. It has not barred such donations at member churches, nor does it have the authority to do so.

HEADLINE: GAINS AND LOSSES IN ISRAELI PROJECT 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Five years ago, Israel's decision to build a sprawling housing complex on a pine-covered hilltop in East Jerusalem temporarily brought peace negotiations with the Palestinians to a halt. The plan was condemned by the United Nations, criticized by the United States and bitterly protested by Palestinians and left-wing Israelis.
 But in Jerusalem, the extreme, even the shocking, has a way of becoming as routine as a mortgage payment. 
 Now the project, called Har Homa, is becoming a reality of stark white stone and glass brick, a suburban dream hewn from a tormented landscape. A work still in progress, it is drawing together -- or at least juxtaposing -- the conflict's insiders and outsiders, its winners and losers, in a reluctantly shared enterprise that is as political as it is commercial. Like Jerusalem itself, it is a place that evokes the ache of homes lost, and the balm of homes found. 
The first Israeli families are moving in, driving up the hill past billboards proclaiming "the Heights of Prestige" and listing amenities from Jacuzzis to kitchen cabinets of fine veneer to "prestigious ceramic tile floors."
On a dust-choked construction site overlooking the revered, war-battered town of Bethlehem, which lies still as stone under 24-hour Israeli curfew, Romanians, Chinese and Turks are laboring to build Har Homa, earning some money to send home from the heart of a conflict few of them grasp. 
They work alongside a few Palestinians who -- conscience-stricken but desperate for the wages, understanding the conflict in their bones -- sneak past the Israeli police, defying Israeli law to help Israeli contractors build what the Palestinians regard as an Israeli settlement on stolen land. 
"My heart is bleeding," said Salman Jahalin, 28, his corduroys covered with the hilltop's powdery white dust. "I feel guilty for being here and doing this kind of work. But I have no other choice."
Mr. Jahalin, the father of four, is from the West Bank village of Zaatara. In addition to being a laborer at Har Homa, he has become one of its first -- if illegal -- residents. He sleeps most nights on the stone floor of a newly built storeroom rather than risk being caught and arrested by the Israeli border police while returning home.
In a conflict that revolves around location, location, location, Har Homa is a monument to the shifting political geography. The property here was captured from Jordan by Israel during the 1967 war, then incorporated into Jerusalem's expanded boundaries. 
To the Israeli government, Har Homa is a Jerusalem neighborhood, not a settlement, and it is also a strategically placed buffer against the Palestinians.
To many of those moving in, Har Homa is an affordable home with a stunning view of the khaki Judean hills, planted with olive orchards and spiked with the minarets of mosques. 
Talia Daniel, 32, moved into Har Homa more than a month ago with her husband and three sons. "This is my first house," she said proudly. "It's a beautiful place, very prestigious, even if it's close to the Arabs." 
She expressed no fear that her family's view of Bethlehem or its safety might be compromised by the conflict. "Today, every place is frightening in Jerusalem," she said. "What's special about here?"
Most of the land that is now Har Homa was owned by Jews when the government expropriated it in the early 1990's. But other parts were owned by Arabs, including some owned by the family of Muhammad Abu Tair, 47, an electrician who comes from a nearby Palestinian village, also now incorporated into Jerusalem's limits. 
He now works at Har Homa. "They are good houses," he said sadly of his work. "Good and beautiful houses."
In 1997, in what seems like another age, Yasir Arafat, took his complaints over Har Homa direct to President Bill Clinton; Mr. Arafat's top representative in Jerusalem described the housing project as "a declaration of war against the Palestinians." Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt, warned that the decision to build Har Homa would be "the beginning of a new cycle of violence." The State Department rebuked Israel for its plans.
Now, no one in Israel says much about it. "Politically, I think it's largely faded into the background," said Jeff Halper, the coordinator of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions. "It's sort of a fait accompli, I think."
Mr. Halper described Har Homa as part of Israel's efforts to create "facts on the ground" that would impede concessions of territory in any peace deal. "There are so many fronts that, if you're the peace movement, you can't keep up," he said. 
Israelis may not think much these days about Har Homa, but residents of Palestinian towns like Bethlehem and Beit Sahur have watched the construction with dismay. 
Har Homa, which translates roughly as "mountain wall," looks as forbidding as a fortress. Indeed, among the advantages that residents of Har Homa have over their Israeli and Palestinian neighbors is that they do not have to gaze out at Har Homa, which is not easy on the eyes. But these new residents are also providing an advantage -- a strategic one -- to their fellow Israelis. 
Har Homa is a crucial link in a chain of Israeli developments, settlements and connecting roads that surround an area of dense Palestinian population, centered on Bethlehem, and cut it off from largely Palestinian East Jerusalem. The land for Har Homa was expropriated under a left-leaning Labor government, but its construction also fits the vision of the current prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who speaks of Jerusalem as Israel's eternal, united capital.
The people who are moving here appear to be doing less in pursuit of an ideology than of an affordable home. "Where's Turkish Muhammad?" demanded an Israeli woman, abruptly striding up to Mr. Jahalin and using her nickname for another worker. 
The woman, a 34-year-old accountant who identified herself as Soni, had appeared in a seemingly empty section of Har Homa to survey her new apartment, which she is about to move into. She had paid $150,000 for her three-bedroom, two-bath home, Soni said.
Her apartment's balcony offers a spectacular view over Beit Sahur toward the flat-topped hill of the Herodion, a palace constructed 2,000 years ago by another ambitious builder, Herod the Great.
Soni was not oblivious to the politics of her new home. "If Arafat and Sharon will stay at home, we will run the states and everything will be fine -- the small people," she said. But in the meantime, she explained, "my political point of view is money."
"This was my chance to buy," Soni said. "If I had $300,000, I would buy in Rehavia." That is an upscale Jerusalem neighborhood.
Indeed, prices have been dropping here, both to buy and to rent from buyers, some of whom are already offering up their homes in classified advertising. The government is subsidizing the purchase of homes.
The reason is that during the 22-month conflict, a neighboring development called Gilo, also built on 1967 land and part of the same strategic chain, has repeatedly come under fire from the adjacent West Bank town of Beit Jala. Residents of Gilo have had to bulletproof their apartments, and a cement wall now blocks their West Bank vista. A likeness of the view has been painted on the wall. 
The first phase of construction of Har Homa, 2,500 units, is drawing to a close. The Housing Ministry reports that almost 1,000 homes have been sold, and that several hundred people have already moved in, living in what remains a vast construction site. Israel envisions an eventual complex of 6,500 units housing at least 20,000 Israelis, with schools, parks and shopping. 
A small group of Israeli Arab and Palestinian workers is also living in Har Homa, in a plywood shack. They work and sleep in shifts, guarding the construction materials from theft. They wash outside, from a spigot, and they watch movies in Arabic received on a large satellite dish. 
Under threat of suicide bombers, Israel has seized control of seven of eight Palestinian cities in the West Bank and placed them under curfew. It has dug ditches around cities like Bethlehem and filled them with barbed wire. Still, Israeli security officials say, thousands of Palestinians find ways each day to get into Israel, not, in their case, to kill others and themselves but to find work.
The Palestinian workers said they could make up to 100 shekels daily here -- about $21 dollars -- compared with nothing at all in the West Bank. As the conflict has ground on and Israel has sealed off Palestinian areas, the Palestinian economy has collapsed.
The men said other Palestinians did not criticize them. "Everybody knows that it's a settlement, but nobody asks you not to work," said one man, who gave his name only as Hassan, 30, the father of five. "They know the alternative: not to eat." Hassan lives half an hour away, but he stays at Har Homa for two weeks at a stretch to avoid getting caught. 
Toward dusk one evening this week, a dozen Palestinian men were seen dashing from Har Homa, through a break in the construction fence, down the rocky hillside and toward the olive groves of the West Bank. 
"It's painful to see the Israeli police come here and arrest these people," said one of the guards, Salem Alkuran, 18, an Israeli Arab from Beersheba.
The Palestinian workers said they had been hired by Israeli Arabs serving as middlemen to Israeli Jewish bosses. Most said they spoke enough Hebrew to get by. Among themselves, the workers speak Arabic, and they talk politics.
Mr. Jahalin, the Palestinian laborer, said the only solution to the conflict was to establish a Palestinian state side by side with Israel. But Mr. Abu Tair, the electrician, differed. "These people are strangers," he said. "This is Muslim land, and an Islamic state should be established."
Mr. Alkuran, the Israeli Arab, spoke up. "We can live together," he said. "It's impossible to move the whole country."

BYLINE:  By Richard A. Oppel Jr.

 BODY:
 The Bush administration backed a $30 billion International Monetary Fund rescue loan for Brazil and a $1.5 billion U.S.-financed short-term loan for Uruguay, as the economic crisis in neighboring Argentina continues to spread turmoil across South America. The support, announced as Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill toured the continent, comes just two weeks after his comments that such nations needed policies to ensure that aid is not diverted to Swiss bank accounts. Richard A. Oppel Jr.

LESS MONEY = FEWER GUNS

BYLINE:  By Thom Shanker

 BODY:
 The global economic downturn forced developing nations to curtail weapons purchases strikingly last year, the Congressional Research Service found. 
Weapons ordered by developing nations dropped to about $16 billion, the lowest in eight years. Sales of weapons to both developed and developing nations also dropped significantly in 2001, to $26.4 billion, the lowest total since 1997. The United States maintained its dominance as the world's leading weapons seller, followed by Russia. Thom Shanker

Fuji Flirts With Connecticut But Chooses Valhalla

BYLINE:  By Corey Kilgannon 

 BODY:
Fuji Photo Film U.S.A. announced this week that it would move its national corporate headquarters to Valhalla from Elmsford.
 Officials at the company, the United States sales and marketing subsidiary of Fuji Photo Film, in Tokyo, said that they considered moving to Connecticut but were persuaded to stay in Westchester in part by a tax-break package offered by the state and county, totaling $2.65 million. 
Another factor, said Thomas H. Shay, a company spokesman, was that many of the 425 employees in Elmsford live in Westchester and "it was important that we not disrupt the personal lives of our employees." 
 Mr. Shay said that staying in Westchester would keep millions of dollars circulating in the county economy. Fuji plans to spend $18.3 million in real estate costs and equipment during the next five years, he estimated, and will likely create about 252 more jobs in the next five years at the headquarters.

HEADLINE: Player-Capitalists Can Foot the Bill 

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 I have been a baseball fan for at least 53 years. Unfortunately, I threw in with the Boston Red Sox, thanks to Ted Williams. Over the decades of my plight, I have come to understand why baseball is so great. 
 You don't have to be 6-foot-10 or 280 pounds to excel. This sport has achieved true integration and is not dominated by any racial or ethnic persuasion. In many ways, it has achieved the ideal of America. As such, it reflects the trials and tribulations of the traditional battles between labor and capital that have marked this nation since the turn of the 20th century.
Through the process of achieving free agency after obtaining binding arbitration, the players achieved economic freedom. But with that freedom comes the recognition of its excesses: greed and avarice. The era of free agency has been accompanied by successful agents seducing unwitting owners to pay outlandish sums of money to very talented players. The net result of this dynamic has been to further accelerate the disparity between the large markets and the small.
The battle is not between the owners and the players; it is a split between the wealthy owners and players, and owners and players of a more modest bent. It has created a conflict of interest in both the owners' camp and the players' union. How can one union properly represent the interests of a player earning a modest salary playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Jason Giambi playing for the Yankees? How can the owners' association reach a solid front or position when within its ranks reside the Yankees and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays?
It cannot be reconciled. Hence, the entire mechanism cannot correct the problem in the face of this irreconcilable conflict of interest. Calls for a real salary cap or for revenue sharing cannot be worked out without alteration of the engine of power and wealth.
The solution requires effective leaders who are willing to take a chance to obtain a fair reconciliation. Perhaps it is time for a new capitalist like Giambi, Alex Rodriguez or Barry Bonds to exercise such leadership by offering to create a fund to assist some ailing teams by assigning 25 percent of his contract salary. Perhaps players with multiyear contracts ought to provide a trust, which, once the owners seeking assistance open their books, would create a pool to attract or pay players, so as to allow a competitive balance to be restored. Perhaps the union could accept a simple limit of two years on the length of multiyear contracts and accept a limit on the emoluments to be offered in such contracts.
Just as our stock market has demonstrated the necessity to correct after greed and avarice took it beyond reason, baseball ought to correct before its fans simply walk away.

HEADLINE: Executive Life; 
Corporations Turn to Older Executives

BYLINE:  By WELD ROYAL 

 BODY:
BACK when Erle Nye, the 65-year-old chief executive of the TXU Corporation, started his career, plastic was the new lightweight component of cars, not a credit card; cells were the building blocks of the body, not portable phones, and PC meant past commander, not personal computer or politically correct.
 When Marion O. Sandler, 71, and her husband Herbert acquired the Golden West Financial Corporation in Oakland in 1963, where she serves as chief executive, most women wore hats and gloves to their low-level administrative positions in the office. 
 And when Robert J. McLaughlin, a top executive at the Imperial Sugar Company, was born in December 1932 at the nadir of the Great Depression, a third of the workforce was idle. "I remember the food rationing," he said. "We couldn't get meat. We had to get coupons to buy gas." 
Old folks all, and maybe the future face of American business. For more than 15 years, the chief executives of America were getting younger and younger. Now, that trend has ended. And, some corporate-governance experts say, it will soon be reversed.
In 1980, half of the C.E.O.'s of Fortune 100 companies were over 60, according to an annual study by recruiting firm Spencer Stuart and Chief Executive magazine. That number dropped steadily until 1997, when just a quarter of chief executives of the nation's 100 largest companies were older than 60.
Since then, that figure has hovered around 25 percent, where it was last year. And demographers believe the numbers of older executives will continue to creep up until the millions of baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 retire, which may be later than most people think. "The average life expectancy is increasing every year, and people are asking themselves, 'Do I have enough money to retire now?' " said Robert K. Critchley, an executive at the human-resources firm Drake Beam Morin and the author of "Rehired, Rewired or Retired?" (Jossey-Bass, 2002).
In fact, demographers say, the same baby-boomer dynamic that drove the average age down for so long is likely to drive it back up. In 1980, the oldest of the Americans born in the years following World War II were just turning 35 and beginning to penetrate the ranks of upper management; now, they are turning 57.
"We're talking about a lot of people moving into their 50's and 60's," said William Frey, a census data specialist and a senior fellow at the Milken Institute, an economic research group in Santa Monica, Calif. "That's going to mean further aging of the work force, particularly among upper white-collar workers."
ALL this could have broad ramifications for older workers in general, work force experts say, as aging corporate bosses show greater sympathy than their younger peers to demands for more flexible hours and telecommuting.
Executive recruiters say that not only are there more older executives to choose from right now, but they are in greater demand. At the height of the Internet boom, youth was in. Now, as corporate America struggles with a weak economy and spreading accounting scandals, experience matters more, and directors are practically begging people with good records and reputations to stay in leadership positions.
"You see three reasons that boards turn to older executives," said John Thompson, vice chairman of executive recruiting at Heidrick & Struggles, the big recruiting firm. "Financial or legal difficulties, or situations where succession plans have not worked out."
At TXU, a utility giant in Dallas, it was the sudden retirement of the president that prompted the board to ask Mr. Nye to renew his contract in May. It allows him to remain in office as late as 2006. "Today, credibility is important, and people who have been around a while -- we're just a known quantity," said Mr. Nye, who recently marked his 42nd year at the corporation.
An increasing number of big companies, among them Honeywell International, Corning Inc. and Symbol Technologies, are also luring their retired C.E.O.'s back to help set things right. Why do they do it? Well, you can only play so much golf. Indeed, in the spring of 2001, the board of the Imperial Sugar Company, the country's largest sugar maker, reached Mr. McLaughlin, 69, on the golf course with an invitation to join its board as it prepared to emerge from bankruptcy.
He agreed, and a few months later, it asked him to serve as temporary C.E.O. to deal with Imperial's 25 creditors, sell off assets and find a permanent replacement. Though the job would require 12-hour days and travel on Sundays, Mr. McLaughlin, who started his career at PPG Industries in 1957 and has turned around two other companies, decided to give it a try.
"I like dealing with the unknown," he said.
By last April, Mr. McLaughlin had helped install a new C.E.O. and had been named chairman. Meantime, his services remain in demand; calls come about every other week from lawyers or lenders representing other troubled companies in need of a seasoned turnaround specialist.
To be sure, negative stereotypes about older executives persist. Mr. Critchley, the author, named some: They resist technology; they are suspicious of change; they want to be rewarded more for loyalty than performance.
None of which is true, says Ms. Sandler, the 71-year-old who runs Golden West Financial and who is believed to be the longest-running female chief executive of a major corporation in America. "I use a cellphone, and a laptop at home, and I like to spend time on the Net looking at other companies' Web sites," she said.
Better yet, the years have brought a wisdom younger executives have a hard time learning: There is more to life than your job. One of Ms. Sandler's rules is never to discuss business with her husband, the co-C.E.O., after 10 p.m. When he tries to break that rule, she says, "I tell him, it's not my time of day."

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 8-11-02; 
Rustic Romance

BYLINE:  By A. O. Scott; A. O. Scott is a film critic for The New York Times.

 BODY:
On Deer Isle, Me., where my family vacations for a few weeks every August, the car radio picks up only two signals on the FM dial. One is affiliated with the Pacifica community-radio network, its musical playlist devoted mainly to the earnest sounds of the latter-day folk revival. The other, broadcasting along the coast from Belfast to Mount Desert, features the confident suavity of pre-rock 'n' roll American pop music -- Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Peggy Lee. The stations would seem to occupy opposite cultural poles, the one presided over by the spirit of Ralph Nader, the other by the ghost of Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
 Turn-of-the-century anticorporate agitation versus midcentury Rotarian complacency; the food co-op versus the golf course; the Subaru versus the Buick; Birkenstocks and hemp drawstring trousers versus white bucks and duck pants. 
 But for me, at least -- and perhaps for the other fleeing metropolites who crawl north on Route 1 every summer Saturday as the weekly leases on vacation rentals turn over -- the two frequencies are not so much opposite as complementary. They conjure oddly compatible aural landscapes, the one of a vanished, chummy world of 5 o'clock martinis and after-dinner bridge games, the other of an alternative world in which everyone thinks globally and buys organic produce locally. Their coexistence evokes a vision of earthly paradise, though not necessarily a place I would want to live. Travel, as the name of this paper's newest section reminds you every Friday, is a form of escape -- not only from the routines of work and domesticity or the ennui of familiar weather and topography, but also from the busyness and stress of the late-capitalist social order itself. Of course, the guidebooks and real-estate brochures rarely put it in quite those terms, but every summer thousands of suburbanites and city dwellers load up their station wagons and S.U.V.'s and set off in search of the temporary fantasy of a simpler life.
Their destinations are judged not just by natural beauty, proximity to beaches and hiking trails or historical interest, but also by the more elusive criterion of authenticity. It is no accident that at the height of the boom years, the best-seller lists were clogged with paeans to the exquisite rusticity of places like Provence and Tuscany, books that bespoke the deep desire of the American upper middle class to buy, rent or time-share its way into the European peasantry. Closer to home, the Eastern Seaboard from Long Island to Nova Scotia has offered ever-receding vistas of the bygone America of town meetings, white clapboard churches and fishing boats at anchor, lapped by the cold North Atlantic tides.
The attraction is obvious enough. As Americans have become ever more mobile, and as the social and physical environments we inhabit have become increasingly standardized and interchangeable, the longing for the local, the special, the unique becomes ever more acute. These abstract qualities are available as commodities in the marketplace, luxury goods whose value is determined by their scarcity. The development of vacation spots follows the logic of urban gentrification. A cosmopolitan vanguard arrives -- artists, fishing enthusiasts, Volvo drivers -- and settles quietly among the farmers and lobstermen. Slowly, they introduce their accustomed amenities -- coffee beans, olive oil, The New York Times -- or open businesses designed to provide them. And before long, seeing too many people like themselves around, they begin to long for the old days, before the outsiders ruined everything. The latecomers, meanwhile, arrive from the ruins of previous vacations and marvel at how unspoiled this new place is.
And so the search for simple pleasures becomes an exercise in snobbery disguised, in exemplary American fashion, as virtue. The Hamptons are impossible, but parts of the North Fork are still quite charming. The Vineyard is a mob scene, but you can find peace and quiet on Nantucket or Block Island. Those of us who alight along Penobscot Bay -- Deer Isle, Castine, the Blue Hill Peninsula -- disdain the lower coast, with its outlet stores and tourist kitsch. But no one's status is ever secure. A friend with a place farther up the coast, near Machias, invited me for a visit, "if you want to see what the real Maine is like."
Of course, the real Maine has been a magnet for tourists for almost as long as it has been a state, and this, paradoxically, may be why it has retained a feeling of authenticity that other parts of northern New England have lost. The leisure industry did not displace other forms of economic activity so much as develop alongside them, and the notorious coolness of the local inhabitants to interlopers is thus an ancient tradition. It is also part of the appeal. To feel awkward and slightly unwelcome when you arrive at the lobster pound in your Honda Accord with out-of-state plates is a very comforting form of discomfort. Your chilly reception means the place is not yet spoiled, and neither are you.
The state's license plates used to say "Vacationland," and I've always half-suspected that it was out-of-staters who agitated most vocally for its removal. We come here in search of an illusion, and we don't want every local vehicle rubbing our face in it. We want both to blend in and to be resisted, to pass for natives and to be snubbed as strangers. Last year, at the end of our stay, my wife bought me a lobster-colored T-shirt (made in El Salvador) that says, "Maine: The Way Life Should Be." Which, of course, may just be an ironic, Yankee way of saying "The Way Life Isn't." 

GRAPHIC: Photo (Russell Kaye/Getty Images) Chart: "LEARN THE LINGO""Summercater, n., a summer resident of Maine. Also called sport.REGIONAL NOTE: Since the Civil War, Maine has been a favorite vacation spot for New Englanders and tourists from farther away. Predictably, certain words in the lexicon of Maine betray a wry Yankee impatience with these outsiders and city folks who come up to Maine only for summer relaxation. Along the coast, the summer resident is called a summercater ; inland, the word for a nonresident is sport. Or the Maine native may merely refer collectively to folks "from away." Much Maine real estate is designated nonresident -that is, it is set aside for those summer residents on whom Maine's economy is so dependent." American Heritage Dictionary, 3rd edition

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
CorporateChicanery With a Page-Turning Plot

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
WHEN the thought of one more dreary-sounding tome on managerial capitalism or triumph over tragedy seems too much to bear, an engaging new business thriller by Christopher Reich has come along as the antidote. Called "The First Billion," (Delacorte Press, $26.95), it is just the item to toss in the beach bag this summer. 
 With fortunes made and lost in recent years as capitalism has gone global, there has been no shortage of writers aspiring to be the John Grisham of Wall Street, everyone from old-timers like Michael Thomas to newcomers like Scott Lasser. Drawing on their own years in pinstripes, they have tried to paint a world they believe just as thrilling as any imagined by John le Carre or Tom Clancy. 
 Yet, novels by former Wall Streeters often feel overheated. Prospectuses do not make light reading and computer screens are anything but cinematic. Too often, readers are expected to believe that a failed merger or deal could bring down the free world, and characters have a tendency to come off as caricatures. 
Mr. Reich, who worked as a Swiss banker before turning to writing, deserves the Grisham mantle. He conjures up a rich, evocative world of working class stiffs who one day find themselves far from their desktop Bloombergs and teeny bid-ask spreads. As the title implies, they are looking a little too hard for their first big score and so are blind to the shortcomings of the deals and business partners that might get them there.
And yet, as this book veers dizzily from Pacific Heights townhouses to the pleasure palaces of Moscow to the hideaways of Lake Geneva, with cameos by F.B.I. agents, Russian oligarchs and aspiring K.G.B. operatives, it keeps its bearings. If anything, recent headlines about corporate chicanery and the travails of Western fortune hunters who head East only make the action more topical.
The action takes place the week before the initial public offering of Mercury Broadband, which describes itself as the leading provider of high-speed Internet service in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and the Czech Republic. A Matt Drudge-like reporter is making terrible accusations about the company. 
Now it is up to John "Jett" Gavallan, head of the San Francisco investment house that is taking Mercury public, to figure out how much is true and whether to call off the deal. 
Much is at stake for Mr. Gavallan, a 38-year-old Texan who founded Black Jet Securities shortly after graduating from Stanford Business School. Turns out Mr. Gavallan has some baggage of his own, mostly from his days as a pilot in the gulf war, a stint that included 26 missions in a stealth bomber. As readers would be crazy not to suspect, this portion of his resume comes in handy, almost as much as the American Express platinum card with the sky's-the-limit credit line he earns later.
BUT it has been years since Mr. Gavallan has pulled planes out of nose dives. And as the book opens, he bemoans the fact that the most "daredevilish" thing about his current life is revving up his Mercedes 300SL for the eight-minute commute to his office in San Francisco's financial district. That is about to change.
For one, to get to the bottom of Mercury, he must confront Konstantin Kirov, the urbane oligarch who has nurtured Mercury from the cradle. For all his ferocity and success, Mr. Kirov has an insecurity complex as big as Siberia. He bruises when someone calls his plane a "small" jet and balks when Mr. Gavallan tries to steer Mercury to the new money at Nasdaq when nothing less than a New York Stock Exchange listing will do. More important, Mr. Kirov sees the billions he hopes to raise through the Mercury offering as a way for his country to buy "a new beginning." 
He chides someone who dares criticize him with the observation that "if we'd kept to the letter of the law, Mercury would consist of two cans and a string." What is a little cheating when a whole country's future is at stake? Whether Mr. Kirov is also capable of using murder as a business-getting and nation-building tool is something Mr. Gavallan needs to learn.
"Sandbagging's one thing," Mr. Gavallan lectures him, referring to a common tactic in which companies dole good news out over time. "Lying about your customers and your revenues is another." Further, Mr. Gavallan says, "It's my experience that investors prefer to see C.E.O.'s of newly listed companies in the boardroom, not in jail." 
(That is the one line in the book that seems overtaken by recent events. Judging from the market's behavior late last month, investors, it now seems, like seeing their executives led away in handcuffs.) 
LIKE it or not, in his search for the truth, Mr. Gavallan must enlist an ex-girlfriend, Catherine Elizabeth Magnus, a financial writer who chronicles Silicon Valley's comers and goners. She had never been easy to deal with or understand. Back copies of The Economist and The National Enquirer litter her bedroom. She has studied self-defense, but when awakened by intruders, she realizes only halfway downstairs that she remembered her pistol, but managed to "forget" her clothes.
Mr. Gavallan soon wonders whether he miscalculated in bringing her along. "She could talk XML with code pounders from Sun, deliver an address on the future of the Net to an auditorium of grade-schoolers or bandy about internal rates of return," Mr. Reich writes. "When they were dating, he'd often found himself amazed at her social dexterity. Today it made him nervous. He wasn't certain who it was driving the car." 
The author deftly splices technical information into his characters' dialogue or thoughts so that readers never gag on military jargon or business buzzwords. In describing the "bake-off," or competition for which underwriters are hired, the author compares it to a "a diamond-crusted striptease." The "due diligence" that the underwriter then conducts on the client is reduced to "a strip search, really. With rubber gloves and all." 
And with the fewest of words, the author often speaks volumes. An unhelpful consular officer in Moscow is imagined wearing a "permanent-press smile." 
This is a world where huge amounts of money zip "around the world in 80 seconds," as one character demonstrates. A world where you are what you buy, and brands are comforting totems. So the author makes sure to inform us that Black Jet's coarse-talking syndicate head favors Brioni suits. That Mr. Gavallan's aide-de-camp drinks Ozarka water. Even a hit man is described as "a Sub-Zero refrigerator." 
Taking stock of his life, our hero, Mr. Gavallan, knows something is missing even though he has the requisite "house in Pacific Heights with the roomfuls of Kreiss furniture and Pratesi bedding. He wore whatever clothes he liked. Music came via the firm of Bang and Olufsen, stereo makers to the King of Denmark; television courtesy of a sleek Sony Plasma screen. He owned two Remington bronzes, some lithographs by Branham Rendlen, a local artist he thought was dynamite, and of course, the Mercedes." 
A small warning. This is a book by a man for men. The female characters are less plausible and are often reduced to the details Mr. Reich assumes readers want to know. One femme fatale has "the kind of pouty lips" some call "bee-stung." Ms. Magnus, whose lips we're told are "pillowed," is a Choate graduate supposedly weaned on Chekhov and Tchaikovsky. Yet, when taken hostage and about to meet her captor, she regrets not having gotten a manicure before her big adventure. And she cajoles an editor into publishing an article he has already nixed as "a favor." Don't try that in this newsroom.
Other characters behave oddly, too. Accountants do not stonewall. They hand over the goods, in duplicate. Gangsters flinch before pulling the trigger. 
Most unfathomable of all, Howell Ames Dodson IV, an F.B.I. boss who is missing two fingers because of a previous run-in with Georgian mobsters, postpones visiting a Florida man who might need protection. Whoops.
All that is easily forgiven, however, when the plot is so suspenseful, the dialogue so believable, and the other characters so finely drawn. From the coquettish opening line, "You are millionaire?," to the bombshell dropped three-quarters through the 435-page book, the result is so much fun, you can already envision "The First Billion: The Movie." The only question is whether David Duchovny or Tom Cruise wins the bake-off.

HEADLINE: Cheney Stays in the Picture 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
One could hear the exhale of relief from the conservative multitudes -- and the "Ruffles and Flourishes" playing in the gladdened hearts of Republican graybeards.
 For Cheney, Mighty Cheney was advancing to the bat. 
 A question mark had been quivering over the White House. There had been a frenzy of speculation and an outpouring of analysis among the capital cognoscenti. 
Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution was teetering on the brink of observing that the Bush presidency was "teetering on the brink." Ibid., Norman Ornstein.
So Republicans were thrilled to hear the vice president tell a worshipful crowd of white, wealthy people at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco last week that he would be willing to run with the president in 2004.
He called his White House tenure -- incognito, undisclosed, classified and unavailable -- "the high point of my professional life." The humility in his tone was unmistakable.
Republicans had been worrying about the health factor -- not that Mr. Cheney's was getting worse but that Mr. Bush's was getting better.
The more buff the president grew, the more party solons fretted that he was frittering away time in the gym that could be better used formulating clear policies in a roiling time.
Last week, the president had his best checkup ever, with doctors swooning over his lissome lipoprotein, taut triglycerides, sleek homocysteine, A-plus C-reactive protein levels and thin body fat. 
In a city where being a grind is better than being a glamourpuss, suspicion falls on those who are too modish or too toned. Are they spending more hours cross-training than studying the Law of the Sea Treaty?
So it is with the president. He looks too good.
Even Republicans have begun privately admitting what Democrats have been whispering: Mr. Cheney is running the country. He can't get off the ticket because Mr. Bush won't get off the treadmill.
While hobnobbing near Nob Hill, Mr. Cheney waved off inquiries about accounting irregularities at Halliburton during the time he was paid over $45 million as chief executive.
He referred the curious to the Halliburton Web site, where nearly all traces of his existence at the company have been inexplicably scrubbed. In a master stroke that easily threw the press off the scent, Mr. Cheney said that a transcript available at www.halliburton.com would satisfy all remaining questions.
But there is no transcript on the Web site, only a link to a conference-call recording that lets those with audio software listen to barely audible, tinny voices proclaiming that Dick Cheney did nothing wrong.
Republicans are most grateful to Mr. Cheney. With the time he saved by not explaining administration policy to the president and the country, and the time he saved refusing to answer reporters' nitpicking questions about his past business schemes, he has been able to fly around raising more than $12 million for Republican candidates.
On Tuesday, he'll interrupt his monthlong break in Wyoming to preside over the president's Waco economic forum, which is designed to present Mr. Bush as a leader who is engaged with the country's economic fears, rather than one who is on a monthlong vacation from them.
Like a buoyant Dr. Evil holding a napping Bush Mini-Me in a Snugli, Mr. Cheney seems to relish running the world alone. Consider how primary the secondary man is.
Without Mr. Cheney, America would not be planning to invade Iraq. Who else understands why the U.S. is starting a war without provocation for the first time in its history?
Without Mr. Cheney, and his reverence for oil and the House of Saud, wouldn't Foggy Bottom demand that the Saudis, like other allies, nurture democracy and women's rights and stop coddling terrorists?
Without Mr. Cheney, might there be a real economic policy, not just all-tax-cuts-all-the-time?
Without Mr. Cheney, who in the West Wing would have resisted tougher corporate responsibility laws? 
Without Mr. Cheney, who would have had the secret contacts in the energy industry to help formulate federal energy policies?
Only one question remains: Will the vice keep the president?

HEADLINE: Ex-New Yorker Takes Senate Hopes to Idaho 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
From Pocatello to Bonners Ferry, people in Idaho say you are more likely to find a river running uphill than a Democrat with a real chance of being elected United States senator in what by some measures is the most Republican state in the nation.
 So who is the Democrats' nominee in their quest to defeat Larry E. Craig, the two-term Republican senator from Idaho? 
 Alan Blinken is who -- long a resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a former investment banker and President Bill Clinton's ambassador to Belgium. Mr. Blinken lists among his credentials membership on the Council on Foreign Relations and the Harvard Club of New York. For good measure, he is a liberal and Jewish in a state that has been a home for neo-Nazi groups. His wife, Melinda, is the daughter of Howard W. Koch, a Hollywood producer. 
The newspapers here leave most of the New York background behind and call Mr. Blinken "the Sun Valley millionaire," referring to his new permanent home in the Idaho resort. It is meant as a neutral description, though it carries a wallop of negative energy in a state that lags far behind the national average in wages and household income.
How does a first-time politician with such a pedigree campaign in a state where the license plates proclaim "Famous Potatoes"?
In Mr. Blinken's case, he has shed (at times) his cuff links, put a Blinken for Senate button over the monogram on his shirt and traveled the state talking about guns and jobs.
"I'm a gun nut," Mr. Blinken said. "I own eight pistols, eight rifles, eight shotguns, and I use them all." On his campaign car is a bumper sticker that says, "I'm a gun-totin' Idaho Democrat." Mr. Blinken has challenged Mr. Craig to a shooting match -- the sporting kind, of course.
Mr. Blinken brags of winning an Alaska big game trophy, and when asked for details, he jumps at the chance to give them.
"I killed this bear, skinned it out and sent the skull away to the Boone and Crockett Club," he said. "Lo and behold, it came back as one of the bigger bears killed that year."
As if to make his run for office a perfect long-shot fantasy, Mr. Blinken has drawn Bob Beckel out of semiretirement to run his campaign. Walter F. Mondale lost every state but one when Mr. Beckel ran his 1984 presidential campaign.
Full of data about Idaho's changing demographics, Mr. Beckel says that conventional wisdom places the odds of Mr. Blinken winning at 30-1, but that it should be closer to 3-1.
Mr. Blinken's supporters look to history. They note that Idaho elected the nation's first Jewish governor, Moses Alexander, a prohibitionist who served two terms beginning in 1914. They also mention that Cecil Andrus, a Democrat, is the only person elected governor four times in this state.
Mr. Beckel recalls how he was drawn into his quixotic quest.
"I walk into this dinner party in Washington last year, and there's Alan Blinken and this other guy talking about guns," he said. "He told me he was going to run for Senate. I said, 'Alan, New York already has two Democratic senators, Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer.' He said, 'Not New York, Idaho.' I just about spit my food out. Idaho!"
All of this has Republicans licking their chops and sending out press releases about out-of-staters and liberals, while sitting on a lead that polls indicate is about 20 points.
"With that sort of background, Idahoans view it kind of the same way that Midwesterners view Californians -- as flaky people," said Jason Bohrer, policy director for the Idaho Republican Party.
But Republicans concede that Mr. Blinken, who has pledged to spend much of his fortune on this race, has revitalized the Democratic Party.
"It's not the strongest lineup, but it's the richest, and that has given Democrats hope and made us pay attention," Mr. Bohrer said. In Idaho's small media market, Mr. Blinken has already spent more than $500,000 of his own money -- and the campaign has barely begun.
In the last presidential campaign, George W. Bush carried the state by 40 points. Al Gore won only one county, Blaine, the location of wealthy, liberal Sun Valley. The Legislature is nearly 90 percent Republican.
But the domination of one party has led to arrogance and several decisions that could haunt Republicans, some say. The Legislature threw out a term-limits law that voters had backed twice. Last year, taxes were cut, which contributed to a budget problem and less money for education. High-wage jobs have left many parts of the state, replaced by minimum-wage service jobs. The rural economy is in bad shape.
"There's a lot of anger, and some real openings for Democrats because of the arrogance issue," said James B. Weatherby, chairman of the Department of Public Policy at Boise State University.
Polls show at least 30 percent of Idaho residents call themselves independents. Mr. Beckel says his research shows about 100,000 potential Democrats who have never registered to vote but who would increase the electorate about 14 percent if they were signed up.
A former Democratic state legislator, Roger Chase, who was recently elected mayor of Pocatello by a wide margin, said, "I think Idahoans are starting to realize the weakness of having a one-party state. But this state will only elect a certain kind of Democrat."
Democrats are dreaming, say Mr. Craig's supporters.
"Our surveys show that if anything, this state is becoming more conservative," said Dan Goicoechea, a spokesman for Senator Craig's campaign.
Mr. Blinken has not tried to run away from his background. In announcing his candidacy, he tried to pre-empt criticism, saying Republicans would call him a New Yorker, a liberal, a Clinton appointee and a rich investment banker, in that order. 
"I'm proud of all of it," Mr. Blinken said. "My father came to this country from Russia in 1904, and we have lived the American dream." When he was ambassador, he says, he helped create 85,000 American jobs by expanding trade and business with Belgium. He says he moved to Idaho because he wanted to fish and hunt.
At a beet sugar refinery in Nampa, workers leaving after their shift expressed mixed emotions about meeting Mr. Blinken. Many said they voted Republican and turned up their noses at the idea of a former New Yorker representing them. But some said his focus on economics made sense.
"Most people don't really like Democrats here," said Floyd Foye, a factory worker. "But I make $9.57 an hour, and that's considered a good job in this state. When he talks about getting better paying jobs here, a lot of people will listen."
Since Mr. Blinken has been campaigning, he has been heckled once. At a parade in Twin Falls, someone told him to go back to New York.
"I heard far worse things when I tried to run for Assembly in New York," he said. "People here are so nice, and polite and tolerant."

HEADLINE: Decade After Health Care Crisis, Soaring Costs Bring New Strains 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Milt Freudenheim, Reed Abelson and Irene Wielawski contributed to this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Ten years after a health care crisis threw American politics into turmoil, many experts see another one on the horizon.
 The cost of health care, which had stabilized in the mid-1990's with the advent of managed care, is climbing rapidly again, putting new strains on employers, workers and government health programs. In a struggling economy, many employers say they can no longer simply absorb these higher costs and must pass more of them on to employees. 
 It is not just a problem of rising costs. The troubled economy is expected to cause an increase in the number of Americans without insurance, which stood at 39 million even at the end of the booming 1990's. Families USA, a consumer advocacy group, has estimated that more than two million Americans lost their insurance last year because of layoffs. 
If the cost of coverage keeps rising, experts warn, even more Americans will join the ranks of the uninsured because they will be priced out of the market. Many health care analysts, their faith shaken in managed care, see no easy fixes.
Politicians in both parties are beginning to respond, but they are profoundly divided on the issue, a deadlock underscored last month by the Senate's inability to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. As a result, the issue is expected to permeate the fall elections.
Behind the numbers are people like Paul McGonnigal, 36, of Portsmouth, N.H., who lost a six-figure salary and his health benefits when his dot-com startup faltered. "I look at this situation as extraordinarily high risk," said Mr. McGonnigal, now trying to start a consulting business with his wife, Shelley. "We would be financially wiped out if either one of us got seriously ill."
Maryanne McMillan of Richmond, Calif., a city planner disabled by lupus, an autoimmune disease, knows the risk too well. 
"My credit has gone from good to hell," said Ms. McMillan, who has struggled to piece together affordable coverage. "I feel like I'm on a high wire act when you're the sickest that you could ever imagine being in your life."
The soaring costs are driven, in part, by the biomedical revolution of the past decade, which has produced an array of expensive new treatments for an aging population, from drugs to fight osteoporosis to high-tech heart pumps. What results is a health care system filled with great promise and inequity, symbolized by wonder drugs that many of the elderly can barely afford. 
Dr. Janelle Walhout sees the paradox every day at the community clinic in Seattle where she works. "I've been thinking lately about the mismatch," Dr. Walhout said, "between how very high-tech medicine has become, with all these genetic tests for everything, mixing your medications like fine cocktails, and our patients, who can't afford them, can't understand it, can't get interpreters to explain it and are just not accessing those things."
After the failure of President Bill Clinton's effort to create universal health insurance in 1994, many experts thought that the private sector -- health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care -- would deliver cost-efficient, high-quality medical care. But managed care's success in controlling costs proved short-lived, in part because patients and doctors bristled against its hard bargaining and restrictions on care.
Now, many experts agree with Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group, who said: "No one has a big new answer on what to do about health care costs. And it's all made worse because health costs are rising in bad economic times."
The strains in the system are increasingly apparent.
Spending on health care rose 6.9 percent in 2000, the largest one-year percentage increase since 1993, federal researchers reported this year. Spending on prescription drugs and hospital care grew particularly fast, largely because of advances in technology and "the retreat from tightly managed care," said Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a research organization.
Health insurance premiums rose an average of 11 percent last year and are expected to rise an additional 13 percent this year after several years of very modest growth. Premiums for many small businesses will rise even higher, many experts say. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, reported that its premiums would rise an average of 25 percent next year. 
Employers are beginning to pass on those higher costs to their workers, in the form of higher co-payments and deductibles. According to new studies by the Kaiser Foundation, the amounts that employees pay for deductibles in typical health plans rose by more than 30 percent in 2002 from 2001 after little or no growth in recent years. 
"Employers are really trying to get back on track in the current economy," said Kate Sullivan, director of health policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "But they are seeing their costs just explode." 
Denise Mitchell, director of communications for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "In the last six to nine months, health care has become the biggest issue in collective bargaining."
States are struggling with soaring costs in their Medicaid programs, which cover more than 40 million low-income Americans. Governors, squeezed by declining tax revenues, are pleading for more money from Washington. State legislatures are coping by reducing benefits, like dental coverage for adults, capping enrollments and requiring poor people to pay more for their care.
Bruce C. Vladeck, who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under Mr. Clinton, describes the situation like this: "The air has gone out of the bubble. We're back into a cycle of cost inflation and an unwillingness, as opposed to the 90's, of employers and to some extent governments to absorb those costs." He added, "They are out of magic bullets."
The picture is not entirely grim. Unemployment is still well below the level it was in the aftermath of the the 1991 recession, when middle-class people, frightened that they would lose their health insurance, pushed the issue to the top of the political agenda and helped defeat the first President Bush. 
Nor are health care costs rising as rapidly as they did a decade ago -- at least so far. Employers' premiums rose an average of 18 percent in 1989, for example, compared with the 13 percent expected this year. At the same time, government actuaries predict that growth in health spending will begin to moderate in a few years. 
Moreover, the number of uninsured children has dropped by more than two million since Congress began the Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997. The program helped reduce the percentage of children without health insurance to 10.8 percent from 13.9. 
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, describes that program as "a genuine success story." But even Mr. Thompson says the cost squeeze has left the health care system "stretched and stressed." Many health experts now agree with Joel E. Miller, an analyst at the National Coalition on Health Care, made up of business, labor, consumer and other groups. Mr. Miller has been warning that a "perfect storm" could be brewing.

The Politics
A Clamor for Action But No Consensus
Mindful of the political power of the health care issue in the past, Democrats and Republicans are scrambling to claim it as their own. 
But the spectacular failure of the Clinton universal care initiative left politicians unwilling to propose another comprehensive plan. Mr. Clinton's effort to restructure health care, which became a target for an army of interest groups, failed to pass either the House or the Senate, and is widely considered a major reason that his party lost Congress in the 1994 election.
For the rest of the 1990's, both parties pushed step-by-step efforts to expand health coverage and control costs, an approach known as incrementalism. In that time, the number of uninsured grew slowly, dipping only in 1999 and 2000. Most analysts expect the number to rise again when the Census Bureau issues new figures for 2001 in September. 
Critics, citing these trends, increasingly say incrementalism has failed.
Among them is the Democratic majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota. Asked if he believed there was a health care crisis, he replied, "Absolutely." Mr. Daschle said he was not wedded to any particular plan but believed that the incremental approach was not enough. "We've got to revisit the issue at a national level," he said.
Mark McClellan, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and senior policy director for health care in the White House, acknowledged, "It is harder for people to get care, the best care, at prices they can afford." 
But Dr. McClellan refuses to write off the step-by-step approach. "People who are waiting for the day of a big universal coverage system coming in and taking over all aspects of our health care system are going to be waiting for a long time," he said, "because there's no consensus in this country to do that now."
Indeed, the lack of consensus has bedeviled those trying to tackle health care, and the narrowly divided Congress has consistently deadlocked on the issue in recent years. Lawmakers have spent much of the last three years trying -- and failing -- to pass legislation giving the 40 million elderly and disabled Americans on Medicare some basic relief for the cost of prescription drugs. The two parties also deadlocked on an economic stimulus package that would have helped laid-off workers trying to keep their health insurance.
The Bush administration has proposed a number of initiatives, including tax credits to help the uninsured buy private coverage, which the White House estimates could result in covering six million to eight million Americans. The administration also backs legislation to limit the amount of damages in medical malpractice verdicts -- a step the White House says is necessary to control health costs, including doctors' malpractice premiums.
"What we would like to do is find ways to keep health care affordable while at the same time preserving the U.S. leadership in delivering high quality health care, Dr. McClellan said. "And that is a difficult challenge."
But Mr. Daschle describes the Bush administration as "AWOL" on health care. Democrats in general argue that the administration's tax credits for buying insurance are not nearly enough to reduce the ranks of the uninsured. They tend to support expanding the existing government programs -- anathema to many Republicans. 
The increase in health costs and the sudden disappearance of the federal budget surplus make it all the harder to undertake a major program.
As Washington fails to act and the public clamors for relief, some political strategists see a widening gap between politicians and voters. Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, says that in many ways the prescription drug issue is a proxy for the rising concern among voters over the cost of health care generally. 
"We keep postponing a larger national debate about a health care system that's far from perfect," Mr. McInturff said, "because it's hard."
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York acknowledges as much. "People are saying we've got to go back and take a look at this, and I think it needs to be done," Senator Clinton said. But the woman who, as the first lady, produced a 1,342-page plan to restructure the health care system in 1994 now says, "I don't have any road map on how to get there."

The Families
Coverage Climbing Beyond Reach
From factory workers to business executives, Americans are trying to cope with higher health costs. Those who feel it most acutely are people who do not have subsidized group insurance from their employers.
In Nacogdoches, Tex., David and Nicole Alders, who own a small poultry farm and are the parents of seven, have tried to keep their insurance costs down by buying a policy with a $15,000 deductible. Even so, their premiums, now $268 a month, have doubled over the last five years. 
"I'm concerned about what will happen five years from now if it doubles again," Mr. Alders said. "A 20 percent annual increase when I'm 40 years old is going to be unaffordable when I'm 60."
In Leesburg, Va., Dale Gardner, who became an independent consultant when he lost his software marketing job, pays $953 a month to cover his family under the federal Cobra program, which allows laid-off workers to keep their benefits for up to 18 months. But as that period comes to a close, Mr. Gardner's wife is considering going back to work -- not for the money, he said, but for the insurance.
In Massapequa, N.Y., Trish Patafio, a homemaker, and her husband, Bob, who is self-employed and moves boats for a living, had their family premiums raised to $759 from $559 a month. So the Patafios enrolled their three children in the federally subsidized Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, generally available to families that earn up to twice the federal poverty level, or about $36,000 a year for a family of four.
Even so, Mrs. Patafio said, the couple must pay $514 a month to insure themselves. "We're eating pancakes some nights as it is," she said. "I said to my husband, 'What are we going to do, sell the house so we can pay health insurance?' "
For many, any coverage is out of reach. Dolores Stanfield, 50, a waitress in Columbia, S.C., has not had health insurance for 15 years. Ms. Stanfield suffers from high cholesterol and a spine ailment that requires regular medication and sees a doctor at a government-subsidized clinic, which charges patients based on their incomes. Ms. Stanfield pays $15 to $20 a visit and says she tries to minimize medical tests because "it costs more." Even so, she has $3,000 in outstanding bills at the local emergency room. 
About 14 percent of Americans, the vast majority in working families, lack health coverage either because their employers do not offer it or it costs too much. They may earn too much to qualify for government health assistance, or they may be childless adults, and as a result ineligible for many programs.
Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, says that in 42 states a person without children can be penniless and still not qualify for federally subsidized health coverage. Mr. Pollack argues eligibility for public programs should be based on income, not family status.
"This is a political pecking order," Mr. Pollack said, "that somehow children are more popular than parents and parents are more popular than nonparental adults."
That pecking order plays out significantly in the lives of the Everett family of Arlington, Tex.: Corrine Everett, who has multiple sclerosis; her husband, Cliff, who works for a company that offers insurance the family cannot afford; and their two children, ages 12 and 18.
The entire family went without health coverage until two years ago, when the children were enrolled in CHIP. But the parents do not qualify for government help. "He makes too much money for us to get on Medicaid," Mrs. Everett said, "but he doesn't make enough money for us to be able to afford insurance."
Mrs. Everett turned up in the emergency room on a Saturday night three years ago, her arm so numb she could not lift it. It had been bothering her for months, and doctors would later recognize the numbness as a symptom of her multiple sclerosis. But she said she had put off seeking care because she was worried about the cost.
Delaying treatment is typical of the uninsured, according to the Institute of Medicine, an independent research organization. In a recent report, the institute concluded that as many as 18,000 Americans die prematurely each year as a result of not having health coverage. Many wait too long to receive treatment.
In Mrs. Everett's case, she was referred to a neurologist, Dr. Rizwan Shah. Dr. Shah admitted her to the hospital, diagnosed multiple sclerosis and prescribed medicine that costs $1,000 a month. Then the doctor helped enroll her in a charity program sponsored by the drug's maker, which charges her $20 a month for the medication. 
If Mrs. Everett's disease flares up, Dr. Shah admits her to the hospital, he said, but always through the emergency room, because emergency rooms are required by law to treat people regardless of whether they can afford to pay. This strategy is more costly for the hospital, he said, "but I have no other choice."
With tears in her eyes, Mrs. Everett told how Dr. Shah charges her only what she can afford. "If he moves on or retires, I'm without a doctor," she said. "I'm not going to find another doctor to do what he does for me."

The Employers
Caught Between Costs And Their Workers
The rising cost of health care has created a complicated blame game among the main players in the system. Patients are blamed for wanting too much care and being heedless of the costs. Managed care companies are blamed for not delivering what they promised: high quality, tightly managed medicine.
Doctors and other health care providers are blamed for "provider pushback" -- resisting limits on treatment and asserting their bargaining power for higher reimbursements. Politicians are blamed for undermining these limits by mandating certain benefits and rights of appeal.
In the middle of it all are the employers, who provide health insurance to two-thirds of all Americans under 65. Sears Roebuck & Company provides a glimpse into how businesses are coping.
Sears has always prided itself on offering what Liz Rossman, vice president for benefits, calls "a high level of coverage" under which many treatments and services were available. 
When managed care arrived in the early 1990's, promising affordable quality care by focusing on prevention and close management of medical services, the company bought into the idea. It joined an employer group that negotiated with different insurance companies offering a variety of plans. 
Health maintenance organizations became the insurance providers of choice at Sears. By the end of the decade, the company was offering about 500 H.M.O. plans, about a half-dozen for each of its locations. Ms. Rossman said 87 percent of the company's 275,000 employees were enrolled.
"Our employees were very, very happy," she said. "It was obviously something that worked."
The company will not provide specific details about what it pays for each plan and what it requires employees to pay, saying it is impossible to generalize. 
But about two years ago, Sears officials noticed costs were creeping up again. This year, Ms. Rossman said, some plans asked for as much as a 50 percent increase. The company dropped the most expensive plans, and at the same time began offering what is known as a preferred provider plan under which employees pay a percentage of the cost of their care but have more leeway in choosing their doctors. So far, Ms. Rossman said, the plan is more cost-efficient. Enrollment in traditional H.M.O.'s is now down to 44 percent of the Sears work force.
Ms. Rossman blames insurance companies for the higher costs, saying "most plans didn't have the computer systems or real controls" to manage care and keep costs down.
But Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, which represents managed care companies, says the rise in health premiums results from a complex tangle of factors, including the increased health care needs of an aging population and advances in medical technology.
Ms. Ignagni resists the argument that managed care has been a failure. She said the system could have succeeded in keeping costs down, had it not been for the rebellion by doctors and other advocates, who fought restrictions on care by lobbying elected officials to require insurers to cover certain tests and procedures, regardless of the cost or whether there is scientific evidence to justify them. 
A recent report by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, prepared for Ms. Ignagni's group, says government mandates and regulations are responsible for 15 percent of the recent rise in health care costs. 
"There is a political dynamic here," Ms. Ignagni said. She added, "It's all about lobbying."
Not surprisingly, doctors disagree. Dr. Richard Corlin, a former president of the American Medical Association, cited "advancing technology and an aging population," along with the rapid increases in the cost of malpractice insurance, as the primary reasons for the rising cost of care. The A.M.A. also notes that insurance companies are reaping higher profits.
Companies like Sears have been coping with the price increases by asking employees to pay a larger share of the cost of their coverage, in the form of higher deductibles and co-payments. Health care economists call this tactic cost-shifting.
Ms. Sullivan, the health policy expert for the Chamber of Commerce, argues that cost-shifting is not necessarily bad, because it forces patients to take responsibility for what they spend on care. "The patient starts acting like a consumer," Ms. Sullivan said.
Maybe so, says Dr. Ginsburg, of the Center for Studying Health System Change, but sometimes they make bad health care choices in the interest of saving money. "What I worry about," he said, "is cost-sharing becoming a barrier to people getting the care they need."
Even Ms. Sullivan says that if employees are asked to pay too much of the cost, they and their families will simply drop out of employer-sponsored plans, "voluntarily uninsuring themselves."
That is how Adela Velasquez, a part-time housekeeper in San Rafael, Calif., became the only member of her family without health insurance.
Her husband, Francisco Guillen, works for a construction company that offers health benefits to its employees, and pays part of the cost for their families. But the policy is a so-called tiered plan, one that assigns different costs to different family members.
Insuring their four children was a bargain, only $138 per year. But adding Ms. Velasquez to the policy would have cost $3,250 a year.
So Ms. Velasquez roams the pharmacy aisles looking for low-cost over-the-counter remedies when she is sick and visits the doctor only rarely. A year ago, she noticed a painful lump in her groin, but she waited six months before seeking treatment at a public clinic.
For $60 cash, a doctor examined her and diagnosed a hernia, a tear of the groin muscle wall. But the surgery to repair it would cost $7,000, which Ms. Velasquez did not have. Eventually, a surgeon volunteering his service to a private charity performed the operation free.
"We are all healthy, thank God," Ms. Velasquez said, speaking in Spanish through an interpreter. But she added, "For me, there is no insurance."

The States
Struggling to Control Medicaid Spending
For decades, the federal and state governments have been the insurer of last resort for the youngest, oldest and sickest Americans. But the government's safety net programs are under increasing strain, in part because of recent efforts to cover more of the needy.
Nowhere is that strain more apparent than in the states.
Medicaid, the state-administered health insurance program for low-income people, covers one in seven Americans. It pays for 40 percent of the births in the nation and 50 percent of the nursing home care. It is already the second largest item in most state budgets, behind education -- and it is growing fast -- with state spending on Medicaid up 13 percent last year, according to the National Governors Association.
Even in good times, Medicaid costs would be a burden, and these are not good times. Governors in both parties have been making panicky appeals for more help from the federal government, which pays an average of 57 percent of the Medicaid costs. 
But the Bush administration, citing its own budget problems, has rejected their appeals to raise the federal contribution, offering instead to grant states additional flexibility in how they spend Medicaid money. Utah, for example, recently received a federal waiver to reduce benefits to some poor people currently on the rolls so that more low-income people could be offered a bare-bones health package. Mr. Thompson said he had approved 1,950 waivers in his less than two years as secretary of health and human services.
Almost every state is tinkering with Medicaid benefits in an effort to control costs. Some are raising co-payments and requiring the use of generic drugs. Some are freezing payments to doctors and hospitals at current levels. 
Fourteen states are reducing benefits, like dental care for adults. Most are looking at how to contain spending for prescription drugs, which rose at an average annual rate of 19.7 percent in the last two years.
Washington State, for example, prided itself on expanding -- not contracting -- coverage throughout the 1990's. Nearly one in three children in the state are now served by Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance program.
But the days of expansion are over. With health costs soaring, Dennis Braddock, secretary of the state's Department of Social and Health Services, has proposed a variety of controls on Medicaid that have prompted a wrenching debate.
People on Medicaid would be charged a $5 co-payment if they wanted certain brand-name drugs instead of the generic versions, for example, or a $10 co-payment if they used an emergency room for nonemergency care. The state would also like to freeze enrollment in part of its program when costs exceed budget forecasts, although the poorest would continue to receive health care as an entitlement.
"In general, nobody liked any of the strategies," said Doug Porter, the state's director of Medicaid, after a round of public hearings. "They got very quickly to the human costs."
Already, many doctors in Washington State are declining to accept Medicaid patients because they say the payments are too low. At the Rainier Park Medical Clinic in Seattle, family doctors say that they must sometimes scramble to find specialists who will see their Medicaid patients. Dr. Colin Romero was so grateful to one ophthalmologist who regularly takes his referrals that he said he was thinking of writing a thank-you note.

The Future
Costs May Dictate Change in Approach
On a sticky, rainy afternoon in late July, President Bush took the lectern at a university gymnasium in North Carolina and greeted about 1,700 health care professionals. Mr. Bush had come to propose changing the medical malpractice system. But the backdrop behind him, which read "Strengthening Health Care: Access, Affordability, Accountability," suggested that the White House had a broader message.
"Right now, rising health care costs are undermining the availability of health care, of medical care not only here in North Carolina, but throughout our country," the president said. "And the rising costs were forcing too many people to go without, and that's not right, that is a problem."
The scene was eerily evocative of 1992, when Bill Clinton campaigned by promising every American the right to affordable care. The Bush administration is proposing nothing so bold, but its officials, keenly aware of how this issue hurt the president's father, are careful to voice their concern.
As Mr. Thompson said in a recent interview, "Health care is costing so much, along with prescription drugs, that Congress and this administration have got to address it."
But the question of how to address it is very hard for a society with an insatiable appetite for the newest and most expensive drugs and treatments and a deep resentment of any limits on their health care choices. 
That resentment was largely responsible for the death of the Clinton plan, which was brought down, in part, by the fear of government rationing -- having elected officials (or their bureaucrats) decide which tests and procedures are covered and which are not. A few years later, the fear of rationing by private corporations -- H.M.O.'s and other insurance companies -- ignited a patient rebellion against managed care.
Many health policy experts argue that tackling health care costs will require a fundamental cultural shift in the American approach to medicine. They say doctors and patients must begin taking cost into account. They say Americans must limit themselves to treatments that are proven to work and accept the premise that more care does not necessarily mean better care.
"As a society, sooner or later we will have to determine whether there are some benefits that are just too small to justify the cost," said Dr. David Eddy, an independent analyst who advises health care organizations, including the managed care industry. Americans, Dr. Eddy said, "have an enormous tendency to use treatments if we think they work or if we hope they work, even if there is no evidence that they do work."
In the 1990's, for instance, bone marrow transplants were widely used to treat aggressive breast cancer. Then studies showed that the transplants were no better than standard therapy. Hormone replacement therapy, prescribed to millions of American women, has now been discredited as a way to prevent heart disease and stroke. 
Dr. Eddy says he believes that a new government agency should be set up to take this kind of scientific literature into account, and then make recommendations about whether new treatments are worth the cost. But while health experts agree there is a critical need for independent evaluations of new technologies, they doubt such an agency will ever come into existence.
"It would be killed by all the lobbying groups," said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University.
Because Americans cannot agree as a society on what is worth covering -- or even whether health care is a basic right -- individual families have been left to make their own decisions about what kind of health care they can afford. Those decisions, in the end, are framed by the family's economic situation, Mr. Reinhardt said, creating a system with too little care for families near the bottom and often too much for families near the top.
Mr. Reinhardt is one of many experts who argue that such a system is neither efficient nor just.
No one sees this more clearly than the nation's doctors, among them Dr. Bartolo Barone, a neurosurgeon in Charleston, S.C. When he is in the hospital's emergency room, Dr. Barone said, he sees a system that simply does not make sense.
"We're seeing the consequences of people who are going without their medications for diabetes or high blood pressure," Dr. Barone said. "They are paying the rent, they are buying what the kids need, and they skimp on the medicine. I see the stroke, the heart disease, the expensive consequence of disease that hasn't been properly controlled. If you're worried about controlling costs in health care, this is a foolish way to do it."
But health experts say they are not sure about what comes next.
"We're not going to go back and repeat what we did in the 1990's," said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid for the first President Bush. "We're not going to go back to a la carte fee for service of the 1980's."
"We will do something else," Ms. Wilensky said, "and the really interesting question is, 'What will that something else look like?' "

HEADLINE: Brazilians Find Political Cost for Help From I.M.F. 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Brazil and other Latin American governments have followed Washington down the free-market path, only to find they are now losing control over their economies.
 The immediate consequences are most visible here in Brazil, which is in the midst of an important national election. Brazil, Latin America's largest country, has just engaged a $30 billion lifeline from the International Monetary Fund, but one that imposes strict policies on the next government. There is a strong chance that it will be a left-leaning one that promises to improve the lives of the poor who were left behind in the economic experimentation. 
 "Don't try to strangle us," President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who leaves office in January, told market speculators who have sent Brazil's currency plummeting in recent weeks on fears of a government default. He said the loan gave Brazil vital oxygen, and showed that the monetary fund played an important role in developing economies. 
But to some Brazilians, it is the fund that could do the strangling. The bailout announced this week is described as the most far-reaching package since the Clinton administration and the I.M.F. came to the rescue of Mexico in 1995, a successful intervention that was paid out almost all at once. But Brazil's comes with unusual strings, and it thrusts the lending agency into the uncomfortable position of being in the middle of Brazil's democratic decisions.
That is because $24 billion of the loan would be delivered next year only if the new government met certain budgetary targets.
"This agreement is an extremely shrewd and subtle piece of political engineering," said Gilberto Dupas, director of the international studies program at the University of Sao Paulo. "No candidate is going to want to be responsible for a brutal reversal of expectations" that would come from not receiving financing from the fund.
After eight years of free-market orthodoxy that has produced only modest growth, Brazil has a strong chance of turning in another direction. A poll released Thursday shows the government's candidate slipping and two leftist opposition candidates -- Luiz Inacio da Silva, known as Lula, of the Workers' Party and Ciro Gomes of the Popular Socialist Party -- with more than 30 percent each. They are possibly heading for a second-round runoff in October. 
With so large an amount of money at stake, both Mr. da Silva and Mr. Gomes have reluctantly endorsed the loan deal.
The bailout was intended to stanch a sudden crisis of confidence, manifested by a plummeting currency, investor flight and the prospect of a new government defaulting on $250 billion in public debt.
Such fears have vastly increased the regional tumult that began with Argentina's financial crisis late last year. The crisis propelled the monetary fund to act, with the reluctant backing of the Bush administration, which had earlier opposed new money for Latin American countries.
In the extreme circumstances, the I.M.F. promised the $30 billion, nearly twice the amount that market analysts had expected.
"This is going to contribute to reducing the financial panic that was threatening to make the crisis worse," Jose Antonio Ocampo, director of the United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America, said of the monetary fund's package. But he said the effects might be short- lived, and the "consequences for economic growth are limited."
Brazil's new money is to be doled out over 15 months and requires whatever government takes power on Jan. 1 to maintain a budget surplus of 3.75 percent through 2005.
But both of the leading candidates are chafing at what they perceive as an intrusion on Brazil's sovereignty and on their ability to fulfill campaign promises. Guido Mantega, Mr. da Silva's chief economic adviser, complained that the I.M.F. was trying to confine a Workers' Party government "in a plaster cast."
"This limits the capacity for social investment we plan to make," Mr. Mantega said. "If we reduce interest rates and the primary surplus is maintained until 2005, the effort to reheat the economy will be in vain."
The penalties for noncompliance are equally clear. Brazilians need only look next door at Argentina, which has been bogged down for months in futile negotiations to restore its line of credit with the fund.
"When it comes time for the rest of the money to be dispersed in Brazil, because they have quarterly targets and reviews, the first time that Lula misses they can tell him he's not getting any more money," said Walter Molano, a market analyst with BCP Securities. "That's what they did to Argentina last year, saying there would be no waiver, and they will do the same to the next administration in Brazil."
As goes Brazil, so goes the rest of the continent. The slide of the currency here, which lost nearly 20 percent of its value last month, was reflected in similar dips in Colombia and Chile and helped fuel a banking crisis in Uruguay. That was resolved only when the Bush administration agreed to an emergency $1.5 billion bridge loan last weekend.
The standard advice of the fund to clients facing crises has been to insist on increased austerity, arguing that fiscal discipline is a necessary precondition to prosperity. But that translates into enormous suffering for millions of people, strengthens the appeal of left-wing critics of free-market economies and weakens governments that have made the changes Washington is urging.
"It's easy at the top to say cut back on expenditures, but it is hard when you are a politician and the unemployment rate is 18 percent," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001.
Latin America "is not like the United States where you have a social safety net," he added. "Firing a worker has enormous economic and social consequences."
From 1980 to 2000, per capita incomes in Latin America grew at only one-tenth the rate of the previous two decades, when governments followed more interventionist and protectionist policies.
In a report that came out early this month, the Economic Commission for Latin America forecast no immediate improvement, saying that Latin America's economy will actually contract nearly 1 percent this year, largely because of the implosion of Argentina's economy.
Despite its reluctant approval of bailouts in Brazil and Uruguay this month, the Bush administration continues to be baffled as to a long-term solution to that problem.
Asked during a news conference in Argentina this week why Latin Americans were increasingly rejecting the magic recipe of privatization, lower tariffs and increased foreign investment, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill replied, "I have no idea." When it was suggested to him that such policies were not yielding the expected results, he said, "I don't know of another plausible answer, do you?"
Mr. O'Neill appeared to offer free trade as the panacea for the region's current difficulties, referring repeatedly to Mr. Bush's approval of trade promotion legislation this week and the opportunities that offers. But Latin American officials consider that formula as simplistic as many of Mr. O'Neill's earlier declarations about the region.
"We're in so extreme a situation here right now that the banks won't even give us export credits," even when the banks are not at risk, a senior Argentine official said after Mr. O'Neill's departure.
"If all of our economies fall apart and have to rely on an I.M.F. life support system to survive," he said, "there's not going to be anyone around for you to trade with."

HEADLINE: With Eye to 2004, Democratic Party Chief Reproaches Bush 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Democratic National Committee issued a broad assault today on the leadership of President Bush, declaring that he had squandered "an extraordinary opportunity" to take the nation through difficult times. 
 The chairman, Terry McAuliffe, said that Mr. Bush had mismanaged the economy, tilted the White House to help corporate interests and "cynically made 9/11 the cornerstone of the Republican 2002 election strategy." 
 Mr. McAuliffe spoke at the closing session of the Democrats' summer meeting here. Although his remarks were made with an eye to helping Democratic candidates in the Congressional elections this fall, they also were an aggressive effort to lay out a potential plan of attack for the Democratic presidential candidates who are already preparing for 2004. 
"All this trust, all this support -- what an opportunity to lead," Mr. McAuliffe said. "But in the end, to what end?
"A White House that even Republicans call the most political ever," Mr. McAuliffe continued. "An administration adrift, with polling numbers as their only compass and high approval ratings as their only destination. George Bush squandered our trust, he ignored the mandate and he wasted the opportunity."
Mr. McAuliffe's speech was among the toughest any Democrat -- including possible presidential contenders -- has made about Mr. Bush since last September.
Historically, leaders of political parties have more flexibility in making these kinds of attacks, and Mr. McAuliffe is known as a particularly hard-driving party chairman. Mr. McAuliffe's aides said he viewed this, after a long period in which attacks on Mr. Bush were largely muted, as an effort to usher in a new political season.
He spoke as Democratic leaders closed a meeting in which they seemed increasingly confident that Mr. Bush can be defeated in 2004 because of problems in the economy and on Wall Street. They also expressed confidence that they would maintain or increase their numbers in the Senate this fall, and might win control of the House.
Mr. McAuliffe was promptly attacked by his counterpart at the Republican National Committee, Marc Racicot, who described the speech as "reckless political rhetoric."
"Such attacks, as those made today in Las Vegas, are a disservice to our political system and our president's efforts to bring all Americans together to deal with our nation's most serious issues," Mr. Racicot said. "Americans deserve a more thoughtful and sincere debate between the parties."
Mr. McAuliffe said he reviewed the speech with former President Bill Clinton; the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt; and Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader.
Over the last two days, Democratic leaders have repeatedly said they believed concerns about corporate malfeasance would hurt Republicans in the elections.
In his speech today, Mr. McAuliffe argued that Mr. Bush was not in a position to crack down on questionable corporate practices because of his own business background. He again raised questions about financial dealings at the Harken Energy Corporation when Mr. Bush was on its board.
"President Bush was unwilling to spend political capital to make the necessary corporate reforms," Mr. McAuliffe said. "But even worse, his own past leaves him unable to lead on this issue. How can he restore confidence to Wall Street when he has engaged in the same practices he condemns today?"
Mr. McAuliffe even invoked the name of one of the players in the corporate scandals as he criticized Mr. Bush's handling of the economy.
"Americans trusted that George Bush would be straight with us about the state of the federal budget, but he used the same accounting gimmicks that destroyed Enron to hide his descent into deficit spending," Mr. McAuliffe said to whistles and boos from a partisan crowd gathered in a ballroom just a hallway away from the slot machines and rows of gambling tables at the Las Vegas Hilton.

Bush Administration Intent On Democracy for Iraq
In their second day of high-level talks in Washington, Iraqi opposition leaders were told by Vice President Dick Cheney that the Bush administration is determined to oust Saddam Hussein from power and replace him with a democratic government. 1

Saddam Hussein issued a presidential order last year to reinforce a policy that has forced many Kurds out of their homes and into the semi-autonomous Kurdish area that is under Western air protection. 4

Brazil Chafes at Loan Policies
Some Latin American countries are finding that they are losing control of their economies as they agree to take the free market path. Brazil, for example, has just been given a $30 billion lifeline from the International Monetary Fund, but one that imposes strict policies on its future government, which has a strong chance of being a left-leaning one. 3

Turkmenistan's Personal Cult
The first and only leader of Turkmenistan, whose portrait is everywhere in the country he rules, has proposed renaming the months of the year with reference to himself. 7

Asian Militant Network
A militant preacher, Akbar Bashir, who returned to Indonesia after years in exile, became the fulcrum for a radical network that wanted to establish a pan-Islamic state of several South Asian countries, according to a new report by a private research group. 13

HEADLINE: Linux Is Gaining a Place at Sun, In Both Strategy and New Server 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Trying to blunt a growing challenge to the low end of its business, Sun Microsystems plans on Monday to introduce its first computers running the Linux operating system.
 Linux, the freely distributed version of the Unix operating system, developed originally by the Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds, has become a growing headache for major computer companies that have championed more costly proprietary systems. 
 The momentum of Linux, which until the last two years had largely ridden on the explosion of the dot-com Internet phenomenon, has now reached the corporate computing world.
Linux is finding new acceptance based largely on an endorsement of the technology by I.B.M. and the growing acceptance of corporate computing managers, who are trying to limit spending and gain more control over their computing systems. 
"Obviously Sun has to come to grips with Linux," said Tim O'Reilly, president of O'Reilly & Associates, a technical publishing company based in Sebastopol, Calif. "There is no question that in this down economy people are realizing there is a big cost advantage."
Sun executives are seeking to position their product announcement as a new opportunity, especially as Sun's revenue has declined because of a deep recession in the Internet and telecommunications industries. 
Until now Sun has focused on its Solaris operating system, a version of Unix developed by Sun that has a reputation for both reliability and the ability to control clusters of large numbers of powerful computers. The Solaris software, which runs on computers made by Sun, has become a standard in the telecommunications, investment banking and scientific markets. But these days, Sun, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is confronted with more competition at the high end of the corporate computing market and an increasing willingness among corporate computing managers to build systems out of clusters of inexpensive computers running Linux.
The company will introduce its LX50 server on the opening day of the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, which starts on Monday in San Francisco. The price of the server, which is based on a standard 1.4-gigahertz Intel microprocessor, will begin at $2,795. The pricing is aggressive, analysts said, making Sun quite competitive with vendors like Dell Computer. A similarly configured system from Dell running the Red Hat version of Linux costs about $3,700.
Sun will still be able to make a profit on the new line, despite moving to a personal-computer style of business, Mr. Knox asserted. 
"We practice all of the same tactics as the PC world," he said. 
For some time Sun has pursued a strategy of "thin clients," using very inexpensive terminal devices on the desktop and centralizing computing on its powerful servers. Now, however, the company has begun to sketch out a strategy based on Linux and its inexpensive StarOffice software suite, which provides typical business functions like word processing and spreadsheeets.
Sun's new executive vice president for software, Jonathan Schwartz, says that with this new strategy, Sun will approach large corporate computing installations and try to persuade them to break away from Microsoft and its Office applications.
"Our target is the telephone-call center that wants to put software on 10,000 desktops," he said.
The attention to lower-cost systems is necessary for Sun, analysts said.
"A number of their important customers, in particular on the financial services side, have begun replacing low-end Sun systems with Linux systems," said Laura Conigliaro, a financial analyst at Goldman, Sachs. 
She added that despite the head start that I.B.M. and Hewlett Packard had in the Linux world, Sun was not too late. The Linux market is still in its infancy, with most corporate computing departments just beginning their moves from traditional operating systems to Linux.
Indeed, although Linux may be a headache for Sun, the company's bigger and more immediate problem is the remarkable erosion of its two strongest markets: telecommunications and Internet service providers. The Unix marketplace declined 17 percent in terms of revenue in the last year and 24 percent in shipments, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research firm. 
For Sun that has meant a calamitous decline in revenue, to $12.49 billion in 2002, from $18.25 billion in 2001. The company has tried to make its way through the downturn by laying off only a relatively small number of employees and trying to focus on new markets like health sciences, where it believes there is untapped demand for its computers.
What is still not clear about Sun's strategic shift is how far the company will go in pushing the Linux operating system into its products. One view is that it will try to protect its large, centralized systems, which realize the best margins, while surrounding them with lower-cost Linux-based computers at the edge of the network and in desktop applications.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 13, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about Sun Microsystems' introduction of computers that run the Linux operating system misstated the company's experience with Linux. Sun already sells a Linux-based system, under the Cobalt brand; the new computers are not the first.

HEADLINE: Immigrant Workers 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
That "Immigration Cut Into Income in New York, Census Finds" (front page, Aug. 6) should not puzzle demographers. In any model of capitalism, one finds that when production is up and the costs associated with labor rise, capitalists favor a surplus of labor to keep capital's costs down. 
The floodgates of immigration are opened up enough to make a labor surplus so labor costs can recede to an acceptable level.
 The 2000 census merely reflects the influx of immigrant surplus labor to neighborhoods that will absorb them. The hard part is to chronicle these neighborhoods during the period in which economic expansion ends and capitalism no longer needs the reserve army of poor. 
 Resentment of immigrants usually follows, and our system attempts to denigrate or discard those it once needed to fill lower-paying jobs.

HEADLINE: Market Volatility and Budget Uncertainty 

BYLINE:  By Ronnie Lowenstein; Ronnie Lowenstein is director of the New York City Independent Budget Office.

 BODY:
A collapse in stock prices is roiling America. But nowhere are the effects likely to be felt as deeply as in New York City, where even residents who do not own a single share of stock may well suffer from a thrashing of the municipal budget brought on by the bear market. The current slump should serve as a reminder that the city needs to budget and plan for the long term, taking steps during the boom years to cushion its budget from the inevitable busts.
 New York is certainly not a one-industry town, but it is heavily reliant on the tax revenue generated by the financial sector, and securities firms in particular. The securities industry directly generates 15 percent of the city's revenue from major business and personal taxes. With the industry responsible for such a significant share of city tax revenues -- about $3.4 billion annually -- rumblings on Wall Street can cause an already fragile city budget to teeter ever more precariously. 
 Securities firms employ a relatively small share of the work force -- in 2001, they accounted for 5 percent of the city's 3.6 million jobs. But they are well-paying jobs, and this is one reason Wall Street is so critical to the city's tax base. The average compensation for a Wall Street worker was $248,500 in 2000, according to State Department of Labor statistics -- 10 times more than the average pay of someone employed in the retail industry. In fact, workers in the securities industry account for 21 percent of total pay in the city. These well-paid workers generate additional jobs and tax revenue with their spending on housing, cars, clothes, restaurants and other services. There is a similar spillover effect from the securities firms themselves.
The slide in stock prices is also taking a toll on how much revenue the city garners from its richest residents in all lines of work. While millionaires are less than 0.5 percent of the city's tax filers, they are expected to account for nearly 30 percent of the personal income tax revenues the city will collect this year. A large share of that revenue comes from taxing the capital gains from the sale of stocks. As their capital gains shrink because of the declining market, the city's income tax receipts will also fall.
At the same time Wall Street's troubles are threatening to crimp New York's tax receipts, the fall in stock prices is creating a significant new expenditure for the city: the city's pension funds for the municipal work force and retirees are heavily invested in the market. How much the city must directly contribute to the pension funds each year is based on the funds' investment returns. By law, the city anticipates an 8 percent return. In fact, last fiscal year the funds lost more than 8 percent. The city will make up the difference between the expected gain and the actual loss over five years -- at a cost of $4.6 billion.
While there is not much the city can do to ensure that Wall Street generates expected profits for pension funds or investors, it can take steps to minimize the effects of the bear market on the city's ability to provide essential services. As others have suggested, when Wall Street-related tax revenues are strong, the city can pay upfront for some of its capital needs rather than taking on costly new long-term debt. New York City also could establish a true rainy-day fund, requiring that a share of any surplus be saved -- instead of the city's current practice of using surpluses to prepay some of the next year's expenses. The fund could be tapped only to address a short-term emergency, like a recession, that would be defined by law.
Another way of protecting the city is to take a careful look at our largest and most stable revenue source: the property tax. Some of the limits built into the city's property tax structure have contributed to our growing dependence on volatile personal and business income taxes. We need to consider why the property tax system fails to keep pace when property values grow.
Even more so than most cities, New York cannot avoid the effects of a volatile market. But it can, and should, take steps to be better prepared to weather future Wall Street storms.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Web-based peer-reviewprograms are reducing turnaround time, postage bills and workload at many scholarly journals.

BYLINE:  By Sarah Milstein

 BODY:
PET food stores weren't the killer app for the Web, but peer-reviewed scholarly journals might be.
 Internationally, about 25,000 science, technical and medical journals are peer-reviewed, meaning they are vetted by two or three specialists, plus the journals' editors. 
 The authors and reviewers, who work as volunteers, can be anywhere in the world, and many journals' editors work off site. With such far-flung participants, the submission and assessment process for peer-reviewed articles has traditionally involved lengthy mail delays, high postage costs and cumbersome administration. 
But over the last few years, about a dozen companies have developed Web-based peer-review programs that aim to reduce turnaround time, postage bills and workload by automating and tracking the process. Industry observers estimate that 30 percent of scholarly publishers -- which include commercial houses, academic presses and nonprofit associations -- have adopted the online systems. Software makers and publishers themselves say that nearly all will do so within the next several years.
Although electronic systems can be costly to install, and people sometimes resist learning to use them, publishers may have to adopt them to stay competitive. For most journals, rapid review is critical to attract leading authors who value being the first to publish research in their specialty. In addition, publishing the best papers helps journals secure a good reputation and ensure a large subscription base, which can also draw advertisers.
"Journals sink or swim based on whether they attract the top authors," said Rick Johnson, enterprise director of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington. "Journals that don't embrace electronic tools to speed their processes will ultimately be at a competitive disadvantage."
Creators of the software say e-mail and sophisticated databases, accessible anywhere via the Web, can help publishers gain an edge without changing the nature of the peer-review system. "It's not revolutionary," said Julian McNamara, chief operating officer of B-Wild, which makes XpressTrack, a peer-review program. "It's just making use of the tools that are available. Nobody is being asked to review things any faster, we're just making distribution more efficient."
The Journal of the American College of Cardiology, in San Diego, began using an electronic peer-review system in January. Glenn Collins, the journal's managing editor, said he and his staff of four had shaved its submission and review cycle to five weeks, down from six to eight.
Moreover, because manuscripts must be sent to editors and several reviewers, then back to publishers and on to authors for revision, and then on to presses, journals' express mail bills easily reach $100 for each accepted article. Add in international reviewers, and the bills can double. Many journals receive thousands of submissions a year and publish hundreds of articles, making electronic systems attractive for postage savings alone.
This year, Mr. Collins expects to eliminate 80 percent of his mailing costs, which had typically run between $60,000 and $70,000. 
"It gives us more time and freedom to add more features and keep better track of things like editorials, images, letters to the editor and news items," Mr. Collins said. "All of that keeps us closer to the big guns."
There are as many pricing schemes as there are peer-review programs. Some publishers license software and run it themselves, others hire software companies to run it for them. In one common model, there is a set-up charge, typically $5,000 to $20,000, and sometimes processing fees, generally $12 to $50 a manuscript.
Even when the cost savings are minimal, publishers often install electronic systems for convenience. "The reason you do it is so that the authors can track the status of their manuscripts," said Catherine D. DeAngelis, editor in chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association, which plans to have an electronic peer-review system in place by January.
Anxious authors now call or e-mail her staff to learn about the progress of a review. But once the Web-based system is installed, authors will be able to look up that information much the way U.P.S. and FedEx customers can track their packages online.
Because most systems track the amount of time an article stays at each stage, electronic peer review also allows publishers to identify bottlenecks. In addition, the systems can automatically generate alerts when an article is delayed. And they let publishers create a record of how often each reviewer has been invited, which articles each accepted, and how each performed.
Reviewers are divided on the electronic systems. "To send the reviews in is very easy," said Daniel Simberloff, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Tennessee. "But I don't like to screen-read a whole paper, especially tables and graphs. So I have to print it out, and I feel a little cheated. But I have to be sympathetic to saving postage."
Ruth Wilson, editorial project manager for the Nature Publishing Group, which is based in London and has electronic review for 18 of its 40 journals, has found that 80 to 90 percent of reviewers have adopted the system, a rate she said surprised her.
Publishers say that in disciplines with younger constituents, there is little resistance. But medical journals often work with doctors who are older and used to dictating to secretaries.
"Our system is very user-friendly, but a large number of our submitting authors are in their 50's and 60's and they get frustrated submitting online," Mr. Collins said. Many publishers said they would maintain a paper-based submission and review system for those who could not adapt to technology.
In fact, publishers, known for their entrenched ways, often find the switch difficult themselves. "The internal change process is not to be underestimated," Ms. Wilson said. "You don't just click your fingers and it happens. You're changing lots of people's working processes."
Despite the barriers, there is consensus among publishers that electronic peer review will soon be universal as demand for speedier publication increases. But many publishers point out that while technology can ease the process, the bulk of time from submission to publication is simply the weeks or months that a reviewer holds a paper.
"All authors want their papers considered quickly, and all reviewers don't want to be bugged," said Mr. Collins of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. "But authors and reviewers are the same people. It's really the guy two doors down that's slowed it up. Even with electronic systems, it's still really in their own hands how fast these things can come out."

HEADLINE: Linux Is Gaining a Place at Sun, In Both Strategy and New Server 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Trying to blunt a growing challenge to the low end of its business, Sun Microsystems plans on Monday to introduce its first computers running the Linux operating system.
 Linux, the freely distributed version of the Unix operating system, developed originally by the Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds, has become a growing headache for major computer companies that have championed more costly proprietary systems. 
 The momentum of Linux, which until the last two years had largely ridden on the explosion of the dot-com Internet phenomenon, has now reached the corporate computing world.
Linux is finding new acceptance based largely on an endorsement of the technology by I.B.M. and the growing acceptance of corporate computing managers, who are trying to limit spending and gain more control over their computing systems. 
"Obviously Sun has to come to grips with Linux," said Tim O'Reilly, president of O'Reilly & Associates, a technical publishing company based in Sebastopol, Calif. "There is no question that in this down economy people are realizing there is a big cost advantage."
Sun executives are seeking to position their product announcement as a new opportunity, especially as Sun's revenue has declined because of a deep recession in the Internet and telecommunications industries. 
Until now Sun has focused on its Solaris operating system, a version of Unix developed by Sun that has a reputation for both reliability and the ability to control clusters of large numbers of powerful computers. The Solaris software, which runs on computers made by Sun, has become a standard in the telecommunications, investment banking and scientific markets. But these days, Sun, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is confronted with more competition at the high end of the corporate computing market and an increasing willingness among corporate computing managers to build systems out of clusters of inexpensive computers running Linux.
The company will introduce its LX50 server on the opening day of the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, which starts on Monday in San Francisco. The price of the server, which is based on a standard 1.4-gigahertz Intel microprocessor, will begin at $2,795. The pricing is aggressive, analysts said, making Sun quite competitive with vendors like Dell Computer. A similarly configured system from Dell running the Red Hat version of Linux costs about $3,700.
Sun will still be able to make a profit on the new line, despite moving to a personal-computer style of business, Mr. Knox asserted. 
"We practice all of the same tactics as the PC world," he said. 
For some time Sun has pursued a strategy of "thin clients," using very inexpensive terminal devices on the desktop and centralizing computing on its powerful servers. Now, however, the company has begun to sketch out a strategy based on Linux and its inexpensive StarOffice software suite, which provides typical business functions like word processing and spreadsheeets.
Sun's new executive vice president for software, Jonathan Schwartz, says that with this new strategy, Sun will approach large corporate computing installations and try to persuade them to break away from Microsoft and its Office applications.
"Our target is the telephone-call center that wants to put software on 10,000 desktops," he said.
The attention to lower-cost systems is necessary for Sun, analysts said.
"A number of their important customers, in particular on the financial services side, have begun replacing low-end Sun systems with Linux systems," said Laura Conigliaro, a financial analyst at Goldman, Sachs. 
She added that despite the head start that I.B.M. and Hewlett Packard had in the Linux world, Sun was not too late. The Linux market is still in its infancy, with most corporate computing departments just beginning their moves from traditional operating systems to Linux.
Indeed, although Linux may be a headache for Sun, the company's bigger and more immediate problem is the remarkable erosion of its two strongest markets: telecommunications and Internet service providers. The Unix marketplace declined 17 percent in terms of revenue in the last year and 24 percent in shipments, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research firm. 
For Sun that has meant a calamitous decline in revenue, to $12.49 billion in 2002, from $18.25 billion in 2001. The company has tried to make its way through the downturn by laying off only a relatively small number of employees and trying to focus on new markets like health sciences, where it believes there is untapped demand for its computers.
What is still not clear about Sun's strategic shift is how far the company will go in pushing the Linux operating system into its products. One view is that it will try to protect its large, centralized systems, which realize the best margins, while surrounding them with lower-cost Linux-based computers at the edge of the network and in desktop applications.

Latin Alternative: Bouncing From Rap to Ska but Passionate About Rock

BYLINE:  By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
At a songwriters' showcase presented by the Latin Alternative Music Conference at Joe's Pub on Wednesday night, Joselo, the guitarist from the Mexican band Cafe Tacuba, sang a rustic-flavored song called "Guacamaya," backed by a traditional Mexican fiddle. In the song a tropical bird is captured and taken to a new place, where it only longs to go home. But when it does, it no longer belongs there either, because its song has changed. At that point, the narrator tells the bird, "Don't cry -- come with me." 
 As he explained the lyrics, Joselo laughed. "I wrote it," he said, "and then I realized it was about me." 
 It could also be about the Latin alternative music that the conference, now in its third year, seeks to bring to a wider audience. With big concerts at Celebrate Brooklyn! on Friday and Central Park SummerStage on Saturday, along with shows at S.O.B.'s, Joe's Pub and La Noche, the conference presented musicians from Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Uruguay, Spain and the United States. It also had daytime discussions on strategies to market music that defies both radio formats and retail categories. Its hope lies in demographic inevitabilities: the increasing Hispanic population in the United States and its bilingual, bicultural younger generation. 
As usual, no one agreed about exactly what constitutes Latin alternative music. It is easier to define by what it is not: neatly categorized tropical music (salsa), regional music (Mexican accordion and brass-band styles) or Latin pop. At its best, said Josh Kun, a journalist who was one of the conference's organizers, it's music that is "entering into a global conversation, with global music that comes from a very local place." 
It also includes music that has been developing across Latin America for decades, using Spanish or Portuguese lyrics in songs modeled on American and British rock, and taking seriously the idea of rock as rebellion. Lately it has also included ska, punk and hip-hop, all recombining with homegrown styles. By coincidence, Santana performed at Jones Beach during the weekend of the conference, a reminder that Latin rock is hardly a newfangled idea. 
Skank, a Brazilian band whose fans were shouting along with every song during its jubilant show at SummerStage, had songs that took up serious topics: racial discrimination, the plight of Brazilian street children. But like much Latin rock, it was multitasking music; the songs sounded like party tunes, bouncing amid ska, 1950's rock, bossa nova and the Beatles. 
Los de Abajo, a Mexican band, performed at both Joe's Pub and Webster Hall on Thursday night. (The Webster Hall show was the 10th annual Latin-alternative awards presentation by La Band Elastica, a magazine dedicated to Latin alternatives.) In their songs Los de Abajo praised the Zapatista movement and denounced corruption in songs that tossed together salsa, Mexican banda (brass band) music, son jarocho from Veracruz, Balkan brass-band music, rapping, ska and rock. "The story of the music is the mix between everything," said Liber Teran, the band's lead singer. 
Ely Guerra, a Mexican singer whose passionate, volatile rock brought the audience at Celebrate Brooklyn! to its feet on Friday night, said: "It's not so much a movement as a posse. I like the word alternative because it means I don't have to explain myself." Ms. Guerra's album "Lotofire" (Higher Octave) has just been released in the United States, three years after it appeared in Mexico, a sign of both the hurdles facing Latin alternative music and the perseverance of its aficionados.
Economic turmoil in Latin America and in the music business took a toll on this year's conference. Financial crises in Colombia and Argentina limited participation from those countries; the slack was taken up by Mexican groups. Recording-company executives bewailed declining sales and rising piracy. But Esteban Apraez, manager of worldwide marketing at BMG Entertainment, insisted that Latin alternative music had promise: "The best thing going on in an industry that's dying is the alternatives." 
Clubs have been picking up the music: the Village Underground in Manhattan has a Friday night series, and a club in Astoria, Queens, La Kueva, is dedicated to Latin rock. "The New Sound of Latin Music," a collection endorsed by the conference, has been released on EMI Records. The music is also getting discovered in unlikely places. Control Machete, whose rapper Fermin IV performed at La Noche, had one of its songs, "Si Senor," used in a Levi's commercial. 
While much Latin alternative music remains commercially marginal, its ideas have had an increasing impact on Latin pop. The two Colombian songwriters who dominated the first Latin Grammy awards, Shakira and Juanes, incorporate the eclecticism of Latin alternative music. 
Although many of the bands at the the conference merely imitated Anglo rock, there were also discoveries. Fangoria, a band from Spain with a campy lead singer named Alaska, has been playing 1980's-style electro-pop for so long that it's now back in style, awaiting discovery by the trendy so-called "electroclash" movement. Jorge Drexler, from Uruguay, played intricately syncopated guitar and sang thoughtful, quietly intense songs. La Barranca, from Mexico, hinted at a traditional beat behind its rock melodies. And Kelvis, a Cuban guitarist and singer who now lives in Spain, turned himself into a one-man rumba band, one more promising merger of Latin roots and alternative ambitions.

Owner to Make Changes at Natural History

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Steven Spielberg is not the only one who thinks there is a durable franchise in making dinosaurs come to life. 
 Earlier this month, several longtime executives in the science publishing community, with the backing of Exeter Capital Partners, purchased Natural History, the 100-year-old magazine of the American Museum of Natural History. 
 Charles Harris, the former publisher of Physics Today and The Industrial Physicist, will serve as president of a newly formed company. Peter Brown, editor in chief of The Sciences magazine until the New York Academy of Sciences closed it last year, will become editor. The purchase price was not disclosed. 
"This began as a conversation about how we could help the museum with the magazine," Mr. Harris said. "That conversation grew to a place where we decided that the best thing we could do for the magazine was to take full control of it."
The group that is buying the magazine said the circulation has dropped significantly in the past five years. And the costs to the museum were rising more than museum executives desired.
"It was not part of our core mission," said Sigmund G. Ginsburg, the senior vice president for finance and business development at the museum. "To ensure the longevity of the magazine, especially in such a difficult economic environment, we felt it was important that we make this change."
The magazine will still be given as a perk to members of the 132-year-old museum, which is located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But Mr. Harris, the new president, believes that with additional marketing to the more than 350 science centers and museums around the country, the magazine will again reach a circulation of half a million.
"There are a lot of technologically sophisticated people out there who have a high curiosity in scientific matters," Mr. Harris said. 
With its emphasis on the natural sciences and unadorned shots of animals in their natural state, Natural History has never had as high as profile as some of the other scientific magazines, like Scientific American. But it served as the editorial home of Stephen Jay Gould, the nation's most prominent evolutionary biologist, until his death earlier this summer. 
And the new management is committed to boosting the magazine's prominence, partly by building a stronger relationship with the museum's scientists. "It is a small community of people involved in scientific publishing; we all pretty much know each other," said Mr. Harris. "We decided this was something worthwhile we could do with that experience." DAVID CARR

HEADLINE: 352 Artists and 135 Arts Groups Sharing $4.6 Million From Sept. 11 Fund 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Derrick Damions is an actor who has performed, he said, in commercials for Hershey's almond chocolate bars, won awards for his funky pop songs and been cut out of two major motion pictures. He lives two and a half blocks south of the World Trade Center site, and in between acting jobs and work as a mixed-media artist, he used to do temp work in the Twin Towers to get by. After Sept. 11, he said, his income dropped "98 percent." 
 Mr. Damions, 33, is one of 352 people who received money, along with 135 organizations, from the $4.6 million recovery fund raised to help artists and cultural groups in New York City after the terrorist attack. The New York Foundation for the Arts, which led the fund-raising effort, is to announce the grants today. 
 "This is a lot of money, and it was money that was raised very quickly," said Theodore S. Berger, executive director of the fund. "But the needs are not over."
Cutbacks caused by Sept. 11 and the economy have forced artists to lose their day jobs, struggle in their artistic pursuits and encounter more difficulty selling their work. 
The recovery money was awarded on the basis of demonstrable financial need, Mr. Berger said, including physical damage to property or health, relocation costs or other specific economic harm. Artists who lived or worked in Lower Manhattan were given special consideration. 
Mr. Berger said the fund received 590 applications from individuals and 191 from organizations. The grants were capped at $10,000 for artists and small businesses and at $50,000 for nonprofit arts organizations. The average grant for individuals was $5,500; for organizations $20,000. 
The recovery fund began last November with gifts from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, and grew with a $2.65 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which also made grants to the American Music Center and the Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York. The pool of money also includes some of the $1 million in an emergency city grant that the Broadway theaters returned to the city after many shows recovered their audiences more quickly than anticipated. 
While the Alliance of Resident Theaters distributed aid to theaters and the Music Center helped music groups, the Arts Recovery Fund focused on artists and organizations in other disciplines, like dance, visual arts and media.
To continue its support the Foundation for the Arts is planning an "arts rebound" program that would emphasize professional training and additional grants to help arts organizations.
Mr. Damions, who said he suffered some respiratory problems and still had difficulty sleeping, would not say how much he received from the fund. But he said it was enough to enable him to hang on for another nine months and try to rebuild his career. 
"I just focus on the now," he said. "I'm a survivor, I'm a New Yorker, and I'm an American is the bottom line."

As Tokyo Loses Luster, Foreign Media Move On

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
As bygone correspondents grinned from the black and white photographs on the walls, Jonathan Watts of The Guardian of Britain toasted the departing reporter on Thursday with a ritual farewell: "We all look forward to reading great dispatches from you." 
 In reply, Ilene Prusher, of The Christian Science Monitor, raised her glass of ginger ale, and urged friends to drop in and visit her in Istanbul and Kabul. 
 So began another sayonara party at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, marking the closing of another news bureau in Tokyo. After 12 years of Japan's economy going sideways, stagnation fatigue is rippling through newsrooms. In the last few months, newspapers closing their Tokyo bureaus included The Chicago Tribune, The Christian Science Monitor, The Independent of London, Dagens Nyheter of Sweden and Corriere della Sera of Italy. Meanwhile, reporters from other newspapers are increasingly using the bureaus as pit stops as they race around the world to tell stories their editors find more interesting. 
"In Stockholm, editors feel the story has moved from 'Is Japan going to beat the U.S.?' to 'Will Japan break or not?' " Pahl Ruin, correspondent for Dagens Nyheter, said earlier this summer before his sayonara party and the closing of the bureau for the Swedish newspaper. "Once there were eight Swedes here," he added. "Then, one after the other, all but one has left."
Japan is still the world's second-largest economy and undoubtedly will be for several decades. But headlines from Thursday's Kyodo news service are not bound to put readers on the edge of their seats: "Bank lending falls 4.6% in July, down for 55th month;" "July wholesale prices fall 1.2%, down for 22nd month"; and "Japanese economy to shrink 0.5% this year: IMF."
"Once the Japan conquering story broke apart, the Japan stumbling story was less interesting," said Roger H. Schreffler, automotive correspondent for Ward's Communications, who will start splitting time between Japan and the United States next month. "It's a shame because Japan is doing a lot of things in technology that are not being covered."
Today's editorial ennui with Japan partly revolves around the definition of news. Given the choice between covering a stalled Japan and a developing China that will probably overtake Japan economically by the middle of the century, editors choose the more dynamic country. In a typicial move, The Chicago Tribune closed its Tokyo bureau last year and moved its correspondent to China.
"We will be bringing in our guy from Beijing," Dave Scott, foreign editor of The Christian Science Monitor, said of its coverage of Japan. "I just feel it might be better served by doing more project-oriented pieces. It is not a day-to-day story as it once was."
Many newspapers have started to use stringers, or reporters paid by the article. Both The Independent of London and the Corriere della Sera took that route this year.
"When they sent me to Japan two years ago, they were going to set up a big office, blah, blah, blah -- then three months ago they pulled back," said Raffaela Scaglietta, who came to write for Corriere. Speaking the day before she left on a freelance reporting trip to China, she added: "Now, they say they have a person who is doing articles on China and Japan -- from Milan."
For old Japan hands who have seen the ups and downs of world interest in Japan, the latest move has a ring of familiarity.
"It's like the 60's, when Tokyo was really an R & R spot for Vietnam," said Henry Scott Stokes, a former bureau chief here for The New York Times who arrived in 1964. "Only the duds stayed behind in Tokyo."
Ms. Prusher, of The Christian Science Monitor, who moved here from Jerusalem two years ago, said Japan had caused her to develop "Page 1 withdrawal." 
In the five months since Jim E. Sciutto moved here as a correspondent for ABC News, he has spent three and a half months on the road, first in Afghanistan and now in Israel. In May, the Tokyo bureau chiefs of The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post could be found in Israel. Their New York Times colleague was in Pakistan. 
"Japan may still the No. 2 economy, but it is completely forgotten," said Mr. Sciutto, who has not been able to get on the air in his fleeting trips here. "Americans tend to notice countries when they become a threat. Japan became a story when they threatened to eat us up economically."
Bruce Dunning, Asia bureau chief for CBS, who has worked in Japan off and on since 1972, agreed, saying that Japan was a hard story to sell. With change in Japan generally minute, incremental, and occurring without visible social friction, Mr. Dunning said, "It is very hard to make pictures of economic trends here." 
Over lunch at the press club, where most of the diners were nonjournalist associate members, Naoyuki Shinohara, the spokesman of the finance ministry, said he was startled by the change. Returning to Tokyo recently after several years in Manila, he concluded: "I guess we are not the rising sun anymore."

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Getting Used To Recycling A Little Less 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Aaron Levy, a rabbinical student, hauls in his glass and plastic each week for a classmate to take home to New Jersey. Adrian DeLucca puts his in an unmarked can outside his Fort Greene brownstone to give easier access to those who collect and redeem as part of an informal economy. And Andy Young has given up his favored brown bottles of microbrew for cold cans of Budweiser and Coors Light, just to get that special recycling feeling.
 Across the boroughs, New Yorkers are slowly adapting to a new law that made metal and paper the only items worth a second shot at life. Some people are still finding ways to fulfill a deep need, nurtured over years of sorting and bundling, to help their discarded empties meet a more exalted fate. Others, perhaps numbed by the kaleidoscope of color-coded bins and the schedule of collection days, are simply giving up altogether. 
 "I don't know if it's because people have thrown in the towel, or if it's confusion or both, I guess, but the majority of people are not into recycling any more," said Sean Mannion, the superintendent of a 70-unit co-op in Riverdale, in the Bronx. "People who used to be careful are now saying the heck with it and just mixing garbage, paper and cans in what used to be the recycling containers. It just seems to be out of control." 
The new rules, drawn up in a controversial compromise in the city's budget agreement, seem simple enough. New Yorkers are now to recycle paper and metal as they have for more than a decade, but are to discard plastic for one year and glass for two. During that time, a task force is to find ways to make recycling those materials economically feasible.
"From a management perspective and trying to reduce the cost, I think we're doing good," said John J. Doherty, the sanitation commissioner. "We're getting the metal in and we're going to get revenue. I think the downside is if you look at it strictly from an environmental perspective," because less is being recycled. "I get the e-mails that come in: 'I'm very upset about recycling,' " Mr. Doherty said, adding that he does not hear from those he suspects may be a silent majority, "people who are like, 'Thank God I don't have to do that anymore.' "
"When you get a change like this you always get your ups and downs," he added.
Some of those downs have begun to surface. In larger buildings, the volume of metal is so small compared with the general trash that residents appear to have lost the will to separate. Then, too, said Michael E. McMahon, a Staten Island councilman who is chairman of the City Council's Sanitation and Solid Waste Management Committee, litter has increased on the sidewalks because of bottle and can collectors' breaking into the trash. 
Compounding this problem, said William Colton, an assemblyman who represents Gravesend and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, the Sanitation Department has not been picking up improperly sorted trash, leaving it on the street for a longer period of time.
In Mr. Colton's district, complaints about rats, even during the day, have escalated. "We're getting the impression that similar things are happening in other neighborhoods, and it's happening because the Sanitation Department does very well what they were intended to do, which is pick up garbage and dump it someplace," Mr. Colton said. "But their focus is not on recycling. It's not on educating people."
Mr. Doherty conceded that in the beginning, mixed trash might have sat out longer, but he said that that was abating as more people learned what to do. In his own neighborhood in Staten Island, he said, at first he saw "all kinds of junk" in the recycling cans, and "now I see mostly metal."
The Sanitation Department updated its phone line on June 27, (212) 219-8090, with recorded information about the recycling changes; a spokeswoman said it had received well over 2,000 calls. By now, Mr. Doherty said, everyone should have gotten a mailing about the new rules, and the department plans to start issuing warnings where they find violations this month.
Actual summonses can begin after a 60-day grace period from July 1, when the law took effect, but Mr. Doherty said he would play that by ear.
But the changes are also threatening the complex relationships among neighborhood residents and those who collect and return the nickel deposit containers. Guy Polhemus, who founded We Can, a nonprofit redemption center on Manhattan's West Side that works with the poor and the homeless, said that the fragile social hierarchy among the collectors was being ripped apart like so many blue plastic bags, transforming redeemers (those who cull carefully and symbiotically) into scavengers (those who strew trash as they hunt).
"Basically these are decent people," Mr. Colton said. "They are earning a few extra dollars and they're doing a service to the city because the city doesn't have to deal with it. Now some of these people are being forced to scrounge in the bags, and when that bag is ripped open, the garbage is being spread around and is attracting rodents."
Indeed, a maintenance worker at the Walt Whitman Houses near the Brooklyn Navy Yard said that her job had become much more difficult because of the many bags ripped open by people looking for the containers. "It makes a lot of mess," she said, declining to give her name. "When they go through the bags, they don't clean up and they don't tie it. Then I have to do double work."
Marcos Antunez, a self-described mole person, one of the many who live in underground tunnels, said that it had become harder for many collectors of nickel-deposit containers, but that after years of combing the Upper West Side, he still knew where to go. "Restaurants, they still put everything out," he said, adding that because the Bloomberg administration had not been cracking down on public partying as much as its predecessor, plenty of bottles were still out there to be found. "People hang out, you know, drinking beer, and so there is still a source."
But it is more difficult, even though in some neighborhoods, residents have been leaving out the redeemables for easier access.
"The quality of the product that you can find is such that you have to travel further to get what you are looking for," said a bottle redeemer who gave his name only as K. S. 
For those who would recycle, the pyschodrama continues to play out in bottles and jars. Laura Haight, a recycling advocate at the New York Public Interest Research Group in Albany who nearly took up residence at City Hall during the budget negotiations, said in an e-mail message that she personally maintains a "carry-in/carry-out" policy when she comes to the city.
"It feels wrong to just dump beer bottles and stuff in your trash can," said Andy Young, a magazine researcher who found an upside in buying beer in cans instead of bottles. "I was so excited by taking out my recycling," he said, "because you can squish the cans into something so tiny that you don't have to go out so frequently. It was just a delight."
Even the man in charge of the whole recycling operation admits to the occasional pang of guilt many New Yorkers say they feel about flinging away those seltzer bottles.
"I can understand that," Mr. Doherty said. "I feel it myself sometimes."
But then there are the legions for whom it is just not that big a deal. Christopher Bisgaard, a corporate lawyer, said that he found it very easy to comply with the new rules in his 24-unit building. As long as there is a plan in place for disposing of the materials, he said, he does not see the need to recycle them.
Or Paul L., who lives in Queens and sells books on the sidewalks of Manhattan. "I had no idea that there had been any changes," he said. Upon hearing that he would no longer have to separate out glass and plastic, he exclaimed with gusto, "Phew! I feel much better."

HEADLINE: RUMSFELD WEIGHS NEW COVERT ACTS BY MILITARY UNITS 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER and JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is considering ways to expand broadly the role of American Special Operations forces in the global campaign against terrorism, including sending them worldwide to capture or kill Al Qaeda leaders far from the battlefields of Afghanistan, according to Pentagon and intelligence officials.
 Proposals now being discussed by Mr. Rumsfeld and senior military officers could ultimately lead Special Operations units to get more deeply involved in long-term covert operations in countries where the United States is not at open war and, in some cases, where the local government is not informed of their presence. This expansion of the military's involvement in clandestine activities could be justified, Pentagon officials believe, by defining it as "preparation of the battlefield" in a campaign against terrorism that knows no boundaries. 
 Some officials outside the Pentagon express concerns that the proposals ultimately could lead the military into covert operations that have traditionally been conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency under tightly controlled legal conditions; these are set out by the president in secret "findings," which are then closely monitored by Congress. 
The discussion whether to give Special Operations forces missions to capture or kill individual Qaeda leaders may at some point conflict with the executive order prohibiting assassinations.
In past administrations, there was a clear effort to distinguish between the combat activities conducted by Special Operations forces and missions handled by the C.I.A. But the line has gradually blurred as the campaign against terrorism required greater cooperation among United States law enforcement, intelligence and military officials.
Indeed, some senior advisers to Mr. Rumsfeld say a legal finding allowing lethal force to be used as part of a mission against a terrorist leader may not be necessary to send Special Operations forces to hunt, capture or kill Al Qaeda leaders in any country -- especially since the terror network attacked the United States on Sept. 11, creating a state of armed conflict.
"We're at war with Al Qaeda," a senior adviser to Mr. Rumsfeld said. "If we find an enemy combatant, then we should be able to use military forces to take military action against them."
No formal plans have yet been written for Mr. Rumsfeld, and the discussions remain far from any form that might be presented to President Bush for his approval.
Mr. Rumsfeld is described by aides as frustrated that military operations in and around Afghanistan have reached a plateau without the elimination of Al Qaeda.
A classified directive issued recently by the Pentagon to the Special Operations Command ordered it to come up with fresh thinking on how elite counterterrorism units could be sent to "disrupt and destroy enemy assets," according to three Pentagon and administration officials who have seen the document.
The directive made clear that proposals for increased funds, new equipment and more personnel would be considered if Special Operations forces were cleared by the president and Mr. Rumsfeld to take the lead in attacking terrorist leaders far beyond the Afghan theater, those officials said.
More broadly, officials outside the Pentagon say that as Mr. Rumsfeld tries to stretch the limits on Special Operations activities, he may be moving them into areas of political intelligence-gathering and related clandestine operations traditionally conducted by C.I.A. case officers.
Mr. Rumsfeld was said to be dissatisfied that it was the C.I.A. that first developed ties to Afghan warlords as early as two years before Sept. 11, which put them in a position to introduce those warlords to American military personnel after the war in Afghanistan began. And it was the C.I.A. that paid off local warlords in order to obtain their cooperation with the American-led military campaign against Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
In some cases, efforts by American Special forces working with anti-Taliban commanders in Afghanistan to buy back Stinger missiles were slowed by the fact that they had to await payments to those Afghan fighters by C.I.A. field officers, because the American soldiers were not allowed to hand out cash.
George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, is described as not opposing the proposals, and at least one Pentagon official said discussions were under way with the intelligence sector on how to work out new arrangements between Special Operations forces and American intelligence. This would "optimize each other's capabilities" in ways that have not been possible up to now, the official said.
In fact, American troops have over the years been assigned to C.I.A.-led operations, with Vietnam being an often-cited example. Likewise, a traditional unconventional warfare mission for Army Special Forces, the Green Berets, has been to develop relationships and train foreign armies or guerrilla groups sharing goals with the United States. 
In Afghanistan, a senior Defense Department official said, there was "an ad hoc relationship that was operationally driven" and that forced Special Operations forces and C.I.A. officers to cooperate and work together more closely, but with bumps and glitches in the process. Now, the official said, the idea is to formalize a closer relationship, with Special Operations forces playing a greater role in intelligence and "direct action" operations -- that is, those that use lethal force.
A number of Pentagon and administration officials said a central goal of stepping up Special Operations missions would be to seek out terrorist leaders themselves in their safe houses or as they travel the world to coordinate attacks or seek havens.
In the United States military, two highly secretive groups are designated for counterterrorism missions: the Army Special Operations unit known as Delta Force, also called the Combat Applications Group; and the Naval Special Warfare unit known as SEAL Team 6, also called the Development Group, senior Pentagon and military officials said.
Those two units have a second specialized mission -- counter-proliferation -- that is important to a Bush administration that has given greater emphasis in its national security policy to combating biological, chemical and nuclear weapons that may fall into the hands of terrorists or their state sponsors.
While the American military does not deny the existence of those units, it also does not officially confirm their existence or provide details on their operations.
"The people in these units are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, anywhere around the world," a military officer said. "They are very highly trained, with specialized skills for dealing with close-quarters combat and unique situations posed by weapons of mass destruction."
According to a definition supplied by one former senior lawyer for the C.I.A., a covert action is "an activity or activities of the United States government to influence the political, economic or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly."
Some years ago, a State Department counsel issued an opinion that stated that the president, as commander in chief, had the power to order Delta Force to capture terrorists overseas and then bring them back to the United States, the former C.I.A. lawyer recalled.
"So there are legal theories that would support the president simply doing this on his own, as commander in chief," the lawyer observed. "Frankly, it is a question of what Congress will accept."
Mr. Bush, like President Clinton before him, authorized "lethal" covert action findings against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, allowing the use of deadly force in the C.I.A.'s covert operations intended to destroy the terrorist network.
A senior administration official argued that having vowed war on Al Qaeda, on terrorists with global reach and nations that assist them, "If we find a high-value target somewhere, anywhere, in the world, and if we have the forces to get there and get to them, we should get there and get to them."
With a stealthy, mercurial adversary like Al Qaeda, which learns quickly and adapts its tactics to the American response, the military has to be allowed to react just as quickly, this official said.
"Right now, there are 18 food chains, 20 levels of paperwork and 22 hoops we have to jump through before we can take action," the official said. "Our enemy moves faster than that."
The head of the United States Special Operations Command, Gen. Charles R. Holland, has briefed Mr. Rumsfeld and a very small group of senior Defense Department and military officers on initial thinking. While some of the missions could be conducted under the direction of regional war-fighting commanders, others could be the sole mission of the Special Operations Command working independently around the world, which also would break new ground in the military, officials said.
Special Operations forces played a central and highly celebrated role in toppling the Taliban government in Afghanistan and routing Al Qaeda.
But today, a number of Defense Department and military officials say some of those elite units have been deployed for too long in the more traditional of their unconventional roles, especially in support of the time-consuming, if still important, sweeps for pockets of enemy fighters and arms caches.
"They've become distracted by conventional uses," a Pentagon official said.

HEADLINE: A Kinder, Gentler Kennedy Runs for Governor 

BYLINE:  By Steven R. Weisman 

DATELINE: DISTRICT HEIGHTS, Md. 

 BODY:
On a languid evening last week, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend brought her campaign for governor to southeast Baltimore. She wanted to tout an anticrime initiative she launched as lieutenant governor to create community policing programs in 62 "hot spots" in Maryland.
 But reporters hammered Ms. Townsend instead with questions about the latest bad news in her faltering campaign: her Republican rival, Representative Robert Ehrlich, had pulled nearly even in polls, and what once looked like an easy victory would now require tough political combat by the eldest daughter of Robert F. Kennedy. 
 In a clipped cadence, Ms. Townsend declared that the only important numbers were the number of elderly unable to buy prescription drugs, the number of people without jobs and the number of children needing good schools. "I've got a plan," she asserted each time, with a tight jab of her fist eerily reminiscent of a gesture used by her father.
But not everyone thinks "Clean Kathleen" -- the only woman in the family to pursue high-level elective politics -- is up to the challenge she faces. She does come across as smart, driven and caring. A reporter for the conservative Weekly Standard, while dismissing her as light, wrote that she was the nicest politician he'd ever met. She has brought money, Hollywood glamour and idealism to the campaign. But what she has not brought is excitement.
It is certainly strange for a Kennedy to be considered boring. Ms. Townsend's advisers are urging her to sharpen her message on issues like crime, suburban sprawl and schools, and to attack Mr. Ehrlich more aggressively. They want her to reveal more about herself and her family. They worry that she may not be nasty enough. Without saying so, they seem to want her to be more like a Kennedy.
Bobby Kennedy, the prince of toughness, was murdered in 1968, when Ms. Townsend was 16. In later years, a popular political game was guessing which member of the next generation of Kennedys would seize the family mantle. One after another, Ms. Townsend's brothers and male cousins passed up the chance or flamed out. (The latest male contender is also in Maryland. Ms. Townsend's cousin, Mark Shriver, is seeking the Democratic nomination for a Congressional race in the Washington suburbs.)
Bad male behavior has always been part of the Kennedy family lore. Young Joe, Bobby's oldest son, had his marriage annulled and then abandoned his try for Massachusetts governor in 1997. Patrick, Teddy's son, overcame drug problems and won a House seat from Rhode Island in 1994. But he is in a difficult re-election bid because of a tendency to get into fights with girlfriends, airport security guards and owners of charter sailboats.
Over a quick hamburger dinner at McDonald's following her campaign appearances, Ms. Townsend said that before the women's movement of the 1970's, she accepted the notion of politics being "just for guys." Left unstated is that by contrast with the Kennedy guys, she is a scandal-free mother of four whose onetime ambition to join a convent has given her a nickname among some of "the nun."
It is almost as hard to imagine a Kennedy campaign without rough edges as it would be to imagine a scandal-free Clinton presidency. The great Kennedy campaigns of old always mixed edginess and even danger with their poetic appeals. Ms. Townsend has yet to find her own idiom in that regard, and comparisons are always difficult. But the rest of the nation may find the most interesting aspect of this governor's race is the question of whether a virtuous Kennedy is really a Kennedy at all.
Other supporters turn the proposition around and argue that while Ms. Townsend is her father's daughter, her father was not really the person everyone remembers. "Because she is a Kennedy, it is almost impossible for her to meet expectations," says Lanny Davis, the former Clinton operative who has run (unsuccessfully) for Congress in Maryland. "The memory of a legend is harder to live up to than the memory of a real person."
Part of Ms. Townsend's tendency to shy away from rough campaigning may be reflected in her desire to be seen as a centrist. Her choice of a running mate -- Charles Larson, a retired Navy admiral and former Republican -- alienated blacks, who had their own candidate and felt ignored.
"That was a shocker," said Jack Sims, the mayor of this largely black Washington suburb, where Ms. Townsend was campaigning. "She has something to learn about consulting people. You don't want to keep making the same mistake over and over again."
A few steps away, Ms. Townsend was busily shaking hands, hugging friends, chatting up children and celebrating her anticrime program. Occasionally, she stooped down and picked up a paper tossed onto the street by others in the entourage.
Clean Kathleen was at it again. But before long, the campaign is bound to get dirtier.

HEADLINE: College Savings Plans Are a Growing Draw 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Despite the plummeting stock market, millions of Americans are opening college savings accounts. They are drawn by new federal tax breaks, a growing array of options and an uneasy awareness of the ever-higher cost of college.
 Americans created more than two million tax-protected college savings accounts in the last two and a half years, including half a million accounts in the first three months of this year. By the end of March, assets totaled $19 billion, more than three times the $6 billion in December 1999. 
 "There has been an explosion," said Diana Cantor, executive director of the Virginia College Savings Plan and chairwoman of the state treasurers' College Savings Plans Network. "Even in the last two years -- even this year -- money is still pouring in." 
Most people are still choosing accounts that automatically move them into less risky investments as children approach college age, an approach that means the recent market losses have not been disastrous for families in such plans with children heading to college soon. But a growing number are opting either for aggressive stock investments, in hopes of buying at low prices, or for guaranteed returns, to avoid the swooning market entirely.
The investment choices -- and tax breaks -- vary greatly from state to state, for these savings accounts, called 529 plans for the section of the Internal Revenue Service code that created them. But they all now shelter gains from federal taxes, and some shelter gains from state and local taxes, too. In some states, like New York, even the contributions are deductible from taxable income for state tax purposes. But if the earnings are not used for college, they will be subject to penalties.
The tax benefits have drawn people like Arthur H. Krulewitz, a doctor in Granby, Mass. Although he was already saving for his three children's college educations, he decided to move to 529 plans last year after Congress freed their gains from federal taxes. He said he found the tax-free earnings attractive, "given what the markets are doing and what money market funds are paying." 
He set up one account with the help of a broker but has held off on the other two because of market volatility and because he wanted more time to compare plans. He is now spending hours on the Savingforcollege .com site, one of the Web sites devoted to 529 plans.
While tax breaks are worth more to people with high incomes, the plans are also attracting people of modest means, like Shannon Thompson of Indianapolis, who attends college part time and works in Indiana's college plan office. She set up accounts this year for all four of her grandchildren, ages 6 to 13.
"The market concerned me," she said. "But I thought, 'None of us are going to live forever, and who knows what tomorrow will bring.' " 
The programs have a special allure at a time when colleges and universities are posting sizable, sometimes double-digit, tuition increases. Some private colleges already charge $25,000 a year or more in tuition. While tuition at public colleges is far lower -- it averaged $3,754 at four-year colleges, according to the College Board -- room, board, books and other fees can easily add $10,000 more a year for a student who lives on campus.
Seven or eight years ago, government officials expressed outrage at tuition increases that were outrunning inflation, but in recent years they have created tax incentives for college savings rather than trying to control college prices. With the development of the 529 plans in the past few years, Congress and the I.R.S. have created a whole industry.
Investment managers have begun to compete both to manage the money and to sell the accounts. They include industry giants like TIAA-CREF, the teacher pension-fund management organization, which manages New York's plan.
One investment counselor, Joel Beck, a financial adviser at RBC Dain Rauscher in Racine, Wis., has created 529 accounts for his children -- ages 3, 5, 8 and 15 -- and he urges his clients to do the same. "My first concern is always, Am I going to have enough money to send my children to college?" Mr. Beck said.
College plans began springing up in the late 1980's as Michigan, Florida and other states established prepaid tuition plans to help residents hedge against rising tuition costs. The big drawback for many people was that the funds could not be easily transferred to private colleges or to colleges out of state. The I.R.S. also challenged whether the programs' earnings could be protected from federal taxes, but it ultimately lost. In 1996, the tax agency cleared the way for the other kind of programs, savings accounts that are not specific to a school or a state, and gave tax protection to the prepaid plans.
Congress's action last year to do more than just defer taxes on the gains until withdrawal -- to free earnings from federal taxes -- sent the college savings market soaring.
All 50 states have created 529 plans or are developing them. When the stock market was spiraling upward, many people chose investment accounts, rather than prepaid tuition plans. But with the market's sharp decline, states are introducing more conservative options into their 529 plans, and prepaid tuition plans are drawing attention again. 
A broad group of 280 private colleges and universities -- including most of the Ivy League, Stanford, Duke, Fairfield University in Connecticut and Texas Christian University -- is working with TIAA-CREF to create a prepaid tuition account to compete with the public universities that offer such plans.
"It will be complex, not unlike mortgages," said Timothy E. Lane, a vice president for tuition financing at TIAA-CREF. "But we'll have tools to help you figure out what you want."
Yet another choice is the education I.R.A., or Coverdell account. Unlike the 529's, this account can be used to pay for private schools for kindergarten through 12th grade as well as for college and graduate work. But it sets income limits on who can get the tax break and a low limit for contributions and is not being promoted aggressively by brokers.
Comparing 529 programs is difficult because rules vary by state. But families in states that offer little or no state relief on the accounts are increasingly shopping for plans that offer more variety, the best performance or the lowest fees. 
"The fees can eat heavily into investment returns, so you have to be careful," said Dr. Krulewitz, of Massachusetts. "You have to do your homework."
Whatever the choice, the plans do not necessarily protect families against investment losses, as Kenneth Fine, a photographer on Long Island, discovered after he set up an account for his baby daughter's college education a few years ago.
"I thought it would be well managed," he said, "not a speculative fund. The little tax break you got up front was some added incentive."
At the time, the New York plan was structured so that accounts for young children were automatically invested almost entirely in stocks, while those of children near college age were placed almost entirely in fixed-income assets. The mix shifted year by year, depending on a child's age. And at that time, contributors had no say in the allocation and could not move their money. Regulatory changes now allow investors to choose an investment approach and to shift their assets once a year.
For a while, Mr. Fine's account grew. When the stock market plummeted, the account lost about a fifth of its value. Mr. Fine was dismayed that he could not shift the money into a more conservative approach. By the time he could move the money, he had already lost a substantial amount.
"The plan's slogan is 'Imagine the Returns,' " Mr. Fine said last week. "That is unfortunate because all you can do is imagine them -- they don't exist in reality."
Losses like Mr. Fine's have been common. Joseph F. Hurley, an accountant who has written a guide to investing in 529 plans, and who is the creator of the Savingforcollege.com site, said that most state equity accounts plans had lost money -- many of them losing 15 percent to 20 percent -- but that their fixed-income plans had generally fared better. 
"Many younger beneficiaries have seen their accounts lose value," he said. "But I don't think any programs forced you to invest in stocks for children close to college age."
Contributors now have more flexibility to put money for older children into stocks if they wish -- or money for younger children into fixed-income investments.
Some investors are moving money into more conservative investments, like New York's guaranteed investment contract, introduced in late 2000, which guarantees no loss of principal and is paying 5.2 percent interest this year.
Other investors are putting money into stocks. Mr. Lane, of TIAA-CREF, said that last year, about 70 percent of investments had been directed to age-based accounts, 15 percent to guaranteed-income accounts and 15 percent to equity accounts. This year, only 55 percent is going into the age-based accounts, while the amounts going into the more aggressive option and the less aggressive option have risen: about a quarter went into guaranteed income accounts, and 20 percent into equity accounts. 
He said he was not surprised to see money flowing into stocks. "People are doing what they should do," he said, "buying at the depths."

Union Expected to Set Strike Date Today

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Officials in baseball's players union took off for Chicago without a new labor agreement yesterday, leaving little doubt that their executive board will set a strike date today.
 None of the negotiators on either side were available for comment after their three hours of bargaining in New York, but one person who was briefed on the meeting said the clubs made a new proposal on a luxury tax on payrolls. 
 Rob Manfred, the clubs' chief labor lawyer, opted not to have his daily conference call with reporters to update them on the talks. Union officials did not return calls. 
The two sides were very close to agreement on debt regulation, said another person who had been briefed, but that issue had no impact on an overall agreement, which people familiar with the union's thinking said last week was necessary to keep the board from setting a strike date.
A spokesman for Manfred said the two sides discussed the core economic issues yesterday, but he did not acknowledge that a new tax proposal was made. Manfred had indicated to the union that he would put the proposal on the table in a second session Saturday. The second session was not held after the first meeting became heated over elements of the drug programs the two sides had proposed.
In the new tax proposal, the clubs were believed to have offered to make a change in the proposed tax rate of 50 percent for some levels of payrolls and raise the threshold of $98 million over which the tax would take effect.
The other core economic issue is revenue sharing, but the two sides have gone about as far as they can on that topic without wading into the luxury tax.
Although the clubs say the tax and the sharing of local revenue serve different purposes, the players believe the same teams will be hit by the biggest bills on both, a development that they feel would decrease the teams' desire to sign players to lucrative contracts.
Without agreement on those two issues, the board will be left with little choice but to set a strike date. Players have said repeatedly that they do not want to strike, but they also do not want to go into the off-season without an agreement.
Although the clubs have said they would not lock out the players or unilaterally put new work rules into effect through the season and postseason, they have not made that same pledge about the off-season. Players, familiar with tactics used by the National Basketball Association in that league's off-season, expect the owners would act immediately after the World Series.
Player representatives, who make up the executive board, and union officials also know from experience that if they do not set a strike date, at least some people on the owners' side will see that as a sign of weakness and negotiate accordingly, meaning they could take a more hard-line position.
The board is expected to select a date sometime in the last 10 days of August. In 1994, the board met on July 28 and set Aug. 12 as the target for a strike. That turned out to be the day the players walked out, beginning a strike that lasted into the following April.
Setting a strike date, on the other hand, would not mean that the players would automatically strike. The date would initially serve as a bargaining deadline, giving the negotiators a real date by which they would need to work out an agreement. The old agreement expired Nov. 7, but the two sides have not faced any real deadline.
The pending union board meeting served as an impetus for the two sides to try to make a deal, but they fell well short. They plan to resume bargaining tomorrow.

Server Market Still Suffers

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Corporate reluctance to invest in new technology continues to dampen the market for computer servers, according to preliminary data gathered by Dataquest Inc., a unit of the Gartner research company.
 Worldwide server shipments totaled 1.08 million units in the second quarter of 2002, an increase of 0.5 percent over the second quarter of 2001, but a decline of 3 percent from the first quarter of this year, according to Dataquest. 
 But the United States server market experienced its second consecu-tive quarter of positive growth, with server shipments up 10 percent in the second quarter of this year versus the similar period in 2001.
 With the merger of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, the combined company is now the top server vendor worldwide, with nearly 31 percent of the market, according to Dataquest. Dell ranks second, with an 18 percent market share. SUSAN STELLIN

HEADLINE: Chapter 11 Aid Is Being Sought By US Airways 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
US Airways, crippled by the attacks on Sept. 11 and burdened by high costs, filed yesterday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the first major carrier to do so since the events last fall.
 The nation's sixth-largest airline, US Airways said that it had arranged financing to allow it to continue operating while it reorganized, but indicated that its routes and flights would be affected. 
 The airline said that it was reviewing its schedules and that it might eventually reroute passengers with connecting flights to make better use of its hub cities, potentially causing confusion on the East Coast, where US Airways is a dominant carrier. Page A12. 
The company had recently won concessions from two major labor unions; it had also deferred some debt payments and received conditional approval of its request for a $900 million federal loan guarantee. But it said bankruptcy was needed because it would be unable to renegotiate agreements in a timely manner with certain vendors, aircraft leasers and financiers. 
The airline will shrink considerably, industry analysts predicted. The carrier, based in Arlington, Va., will almost certainly retool its inefficient hub operations, trim the size of its fleet and eliminate more jobs. Its extensive route network in the Eastern states is built around hubs in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C.
The overall United States airline industry is under economic pressure, having lost $1.4 billion last quarter and $11 billion last year. A small carrier, Vanguard Airlines, recently filed for bankruptcy protection, and Midway Airlines, of Raleigh, N.C., suspended service after filing for bankruptcy protection a year ago.
Some industry analysts said US Airways' filing could portend such a move from the second-largest carrier, United Airlines, which has said that it needs federal loan backing to obtain crucial financing before it runs out of cash.
But United is thought to have greater access to the capital markets than US Airways, and so far it has not said it will seek bankruptcy protection.
Still, before US Airways made its filing last night in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, it had lined up financing to operate in bankruptcy. The filing listed assets of about $7.81 billion and liabilities of $7.83 billion. The carrier said it expected to move out of bankruptcy in the first three months of 2003.
"Ultimately, this effort is about our customers, employees and the communities we serve, as we seek to fix the airline's finances and return to profitability," David N. Siegel, the chief executive, said in a written statement. "US Airways will continue to operate while we complete our financial restructuring, and our customers should be confident that we will continue service to the more than 200 communities in our network."
Mr. Siegel, who was hired in March to lead an overhaul of the carrier, said that members of its frequent-flier club would continue to accrue and use miles and that consumer marketing agreements with other companies, like credit card issuers, would be honored.
Last month, US Airways posted a net loss of $248 million for the second quarter, its eighth-consecutive losing quarter. It lost $2 billion last year and was among the carriers most affected by the September attacks because its business is so concentrated on the East Coast. The government's shutdown of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport for more than three weeks severely damaged the carrier because many of its passengers use the airport.
The company's labor unions had mixed reactions last night, having heard management's threats of a bankruptcy filing in recent months. In the last week, the carrier had worked out agreements with its pilots and flight attendants for significant wage cuts and other concessions. Those agreements prevent US Airways from asking a bankruptcy court judge to demand further concessions, but they leave room for job cuts and other reductions.
For example, the pilots' agreement allows the airline to trim its fleet size to 245 planes from 311 under bankruptcy court protection.
In any trimming of the work force, the carrier is expected to seek employee buyouts before resorting to layoffs. "The pilots are understandably disappointed," said Roy Freundlich, a spokesman for the pilots' union, which represents 4,800 workers at US Airways. More than 1,000 pilots remain on furlough because of cuts after Sept. 11.
Jeff Zack, a spokesman for the flight attendants' union, which represents 7,500 workers, said: "We knew it was coming. They had been saying it for months. We've locked in a new contract that we've ratified so we're not giving any more concessions."
The airline had not reached an agreement with its machinists' union, which represents more than 12,000 mechanics and fleet service workers and has been the most reluctant to make concessions. But yesterday morning, the carrier made a proposal to the mechanics, and they intend to vote on its terms before the end of August.
"The announcement of a bankruptcy filing does not change our position regarding the company's restructuring plan," said Robert Roach Jr., general vice president of the union.
There is speculation that the carrier might have made its filing yesterday to put additional pressure on the machinists' union to give in on concessions the government is requiring for the loan guarantee.
US Airways had been working feverishly over the last month to win labor concessions as part of the effort to secure financing. The carrier had applied for the $900 million federal loan guarantee on a $1 billion private loan as part of the government's $10 billion loan guarantee program it set up after Sept. 11.
On July 10, the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which administers the program, granted the carrier the loan guarantee on the condition that executives wring concessions from labor and that they in turn give more generous stock warrants to the government.
The air stabilization board said yesterday that those terms remained in effect with the further condition of an approved reorganization plan by the bankruptcy court. "The board will review the reorganization plan when presented and will determine whether it meets the conditions for issuance of a guarantee," it said.
The loan guarantee program has been the subject of much debate, with critics arguing that it distorts market forces. US Airways' bankruptcy filing will undoubtedly raise more questions, with critics wondering why the government is planning to back a company coming out of bankruptcy protection.
But some industry specialists say the filing will probably strengthen the airline's application because it will include the cost cuts that the government has been seeking. "Now, it will be slimmer and trimmer," said Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute of George Washington University in Ashburn, Va. "Now, they'll probably look more like Continental Airlines. If they didn't file for Chapter 11 now, their debtors could force them into involuntary bankruptcy. Right now, they have control."
The carrier's outstanding debt consists mostly of aircraft lease financing, and creditors will receive whatever the market dictates those leases to be worth, said Richard P. Schifter, a partner at the Texas Pacific Group, a private equity firm that invests in troubled companies. Texas Pacific is among a group of lenders, led by Credit Suisse First Boston and Bank of America, that has given US Airways $500 million of what is known as debtor-in-possession financing to continue operations. Texas Pacific will buy $200 million worth of stock in the carrier when it emerges from bankruptcy, for a 38 percent stake, and will have 5 of the 13 board seats.
Texas Pacific's partners -- led by David Bonderman, James G. Coulter and William S. Price -- have a strong record investing in troubled airlines. A decade ago, they invested in Continental Airlines and America West, both of which had filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Siegel of US Airways knows the group because he was working as an executive at Continental at the time. The partners made 11 times their investment in Continental. 
Passengers are likely to scramble to use frequent-flier miles or to book trips on other carriers. But September is expected to be dismal, so a slight capacity reduction might not hurt the airline's revenue much.
Still, there could be an exodus to East Coast rivals like Delta Air Lines and JetBlue.
"The answer really lies in how they restructure, how it's communicated and how it affects people," said Kevin P. Mitchell, president of the Business Travel Coalition. "If you're sitting here today with a vacation package in September, you're going to be very anxious about what all this means."

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Blockbuster dips its toe into DVD subscriptions, driving down Netflix stock. But the threat may lie elsewhere.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
WHEN Netflix, which lets viewers rent DVD's online and receive them by mail, went public in May with a $94 million stock offering, the event was hailed by some as a sign that dot-com shares might again be worth more than a good laugh.
 But when Netflix shares nose-dived early this month on word that Blockbuster, a subsidiary of Viacom, had begun testing a competing subscription service through its stores, the potential Netflix story line began to sound familiar: a popular Internet debutante meets traditional company in dark alley; emerges with no friends and a balance sheet in serious need of medical attention. 
 The truth is, Blockbuster's nascent subscription service has yet to affect Netflix's finances, according to its executives and analysts who follow the company. And given Blockbuster's conservative approach to e-commerce -- a strategy that looks brilliant in hindsight -- Netflix might emerge from this particular scuffle unscathed. But, analysts said, both companies would do well to keep their guard up against other digital predators. 
Blockbuster's subscription service is in the early stages, although company executives said last week that the effort was proceeding nicely. The service, tentatively called DVD Freedom Pass, allows store customers to rent an unlimited number of titles each month for between $20 and $25 a month, depending on the city. Customers may have up to three titles out at any time, and are not assessed late fees.
Investment analysts view that service partly as a buffer against the growth of Netflix's mail order service. Netflix allows subscribers to rent an unlimited number of titles each month for $20, and customers can hold three DVD's at a time. The company, which began operations in 1998, has more than 670,000 subscribers, and expects 2002 revenue of $150 million.
As news of Blockbuster's service spread among investors in the last month, Netflix shares slumped to a low of $9.89 on Aug. 2, from a high of $18.19 on July 5. The shares rallied slightly late last week, closing at $11.02 on Friday.
Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said he anticipated the possibility of competition from Blockbuster in December, but speculated then that Blockbuster would not risk losing revenue from late fees -- estimated at 16 percent of the company's $5.2 billion in sales last year -- by offering a service that effectively eliminated such fees.
The competition between the two companies remains limited, of course, since Blockbuster is unlikely in the near future to move into the mail order rental business. But if the Netflix service takes off, that strategy could shift quickly, since Blockbuster has acquired a business that specializes in mail-order rentals, according to one person close to the company. (A Blockbuster spokesman declined to comment, and because the acquisition was not considered material to Blockbuster's business, it has not been publicly disclosed.)
Allen Klose, Blockbuster's senior vice president of marketing, would not say how many Freedom Pass subscribers the company had signed up in its four test markets, but he said, "It's clear we're onto something." Blockbuster would not identify the markets, but Netflix says they are New York City, Phoenix, Seattle and Houston.
As Blockbuster refines its test of the service, Mr. Klose said the company was closely watching the monthly rental habits of new subscribers. If a customer had been renting four movies and accruing another 15 percent in late fees every month, Blockbuster would do itself little good by converting them to a subscription. "But for anyone who was doing less than that per month, it's incremental revenue for us," he said.
Mr. Klose said he was not concerned about losing money on the customers who would have otherwise rented numerous movies each month. Rather, he said the new service would help Blockbuster compete against HBO, Showtime and other premium movie channels, which together cost about the same as Blockbuster's subscription, and which offer the same movies six months later than Blockbuster. (That timing is dictated by movie studios.)
Josh Bernoff, an analyst with Forrester Research, said Blockbuster should be more concerned with television competitors than online competitors. In particular, Mr. Bernoff sees competition from cable companies, who are increasingly offering video-on-demand services.
It has been more than 20 years since cable operators started talking about offering a broad menu of movies that would be available at the click of a button, and many observers had written off as meaningless the cable companies' plans for widespread digital movie distribution. "But the prospects now are different," Mr. Bernoff said, since "cable companies last year began rolling out digital cable systems at a very fast pace."
The number of homes with digital cable -- which is necessary for transmitting movies on demand -- will reach 38 million in five years, Mr. Bernoff said. "Since all of them will be able to get access to any movie they want at any time, that's a pretty serious threat to Blockbuster, and it won't be very encouraging to Netflix."
Other analysts remain nonbelievers. Kavir Dhar, an analyst with Jefferies & Company, an investment firm, said movie studios made about $16.8 billion last year by selling and renting their movies through companies like Blockbuster or Hollywood Entertainment -- much more than they could by distributing them through cable services.
As a result, Mr. Dhar said, studios are unlikely to risk depleting their rental revenues by giving cable companies earlier access to movies-on-demand. If movies continue to be available much later through cable companies, consumer demand is unlikely to rise substantially.
Mr. Klose of Blockbuster agreed, and said he had even tested video-on-demand, with distribution provided by Enron through high-speed Internet connections and other means. The testing ended early last year, several months before Enron's unraveling, when Blockbuster deemed the service economically unsound.
Blockbuster also tested a service allowing consumers to go online and rent videos from their local stores, for in-store pick up. That service, too, was not profitable enough to roll out widely. "The same goes for the online subscription model," Mr. Klose said. "We've been looking at this stuff for a couple of years, and we're constantly watching that to see if something breaks loose there."
Mr. Hastings of Netflix says he is likewise watching Blockbuster closely, but is perhaps more vigilant of Wal-Mart Stores, which he said, "is actively working on" a competing online rental service. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman declined to acknowledge such an effort.
"To compete with the world's largest corporation, that's concerning," Mr. Hastings said. "And it's always worse before they've actually launched, because there are no holes I can poke at them."
While he waits for that shoe to drop, and while he watches Blockbuster target his audience and his stock price slide, Mr. Hastings is maintaining his perspective -- at least outwardly. "Until a company has faced competition and won, its mettle is uncertain with investors," Mr. Hastings said. "We're properly not given that credit yet, because we haven't been tested. Hopefully, as we keep making our numbers, investors will be more comfortable."

HEADLINE: Korea Fears Spillover From U.S. Economy 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK

 BODY:
South Korea is beginning to feel the fallout of the bear market in the United States in an area where many economists had expected it to hurt the most, consumer spending.
 While Korean government agencies and private organizations still forecast economic growth of 6 percent for the year, the commerce ministry said last weekend that department stores had reported that sales had slipped from double- to single-digit percentages for two consecutive months, June and July. 
 The increase of 3.9 percent in July over the same month a year ago contrasts with a 10.3 percent year-on-year increase in May at the crest of 13 consecutive months of growing sales. Sales rose 4.2 percent in June. 
Such numbers might seem great when compared with figures from elsewhere, but Koreans view with concern any signs of reversal in a sometimes volatile economy noteworthy for sudden, disturbing fluctuations. Against that backdrop, a commerce ministry official told reporters that the figures showed "weakening consumer confidence," reflecting "uncertainties in the domestic and global economy fueled by instability in U.S. financial markets."
Department stores are still crowded and credit cards are increasingly in vogue in South Korea, but signs that consumers may be pulling back are worrisome in an economy that has been relying increasingly on consumer spending. Commercial banks, which once extended loans mainly to corporate clients, have been focusing on consumers since the country began restructuring its economy after the financial crisis of 1997 and 1998.
Koreans are also showing signs of reverting to their habit of saving in case of a sudden downturn.
The Samsung Economic Research Institute, an economic forecaster loosely affiliated with the Samsung group, Korea's largest conglomerate, reported a slight decrease in a survey of consumer confidence going into the third quarter.
"Despite a steady upturn in domestic business activities," the report said, "the mounting chance of a delay in the recovery of the U.S. economy is creating a negative impact on consumption sentiment." Nonetheless, the report said, "a bullish consumption pattern is to be sustained for the time being."
That ambivalent analysis reflects the puzzlement shared by many Koreans over clouds on the horizon that may or may not portend a storm.
Prices on Korea's stock index last week fell below the 700 level, in tandem with the decline in the American market, then edged above 700 before closing the week at 692.45, down 14 percent over the last month.
As Koreans wondered about the vagaries of the New York Stock Exchange, which rose by 5.2 percent last week, a finance ministry official sought to allay concerns by saying the decline in American share prices need not affect Korea's market.
Aside from slowing department stores, there were at least two other signs of potential trouble. One area was real estate prices, which have been shooting up in the last two or three years. While prices are still rising in some areas, they are declining in others as small companies and individuals conserve money.
The Korea Land Corporation, an agency that is trying to sell government-owned land, reported that it has been unable to sell about $2 billion in real estate amid slowing demand for new plants, shopping areas and business complexes.
Another reason for worry is that the price of semiconductors, which appeared earlier in the year to be on the way to recovery, are again on the decline. The bellwether 128-megabit dynamic random access memory chip now sells for $2 a chip, its lowest level of the year and 50 percent below the manufacturing price.
The fall in semiconductor prices means more trouble for Hynix Semiconductor, now in the hands of creditors, and also is holding down share prices in Samsung Electronics, which is cutting investment and focusing on other electronic products.
Amid such worries, Korean business groups are intensifying pressure against the government's determination to introduce the five-day week, down from five-and-a-half to six days. Warning that employers "will suffer a steep rise in labor costs," the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the impact would be a drastic reduction in growth. The five-day week "will be effective in lifting the overall quality of life" only if the per capita gross domestic product more than doubles "and laborers lessen their desire for money," the chamber said.
But a five-day week has a benefit to consumer spending. With many companies, including banks, already shutting down on Saturdays, some restaurants and tourism firms are anticipating more business.
"We're hoping that families will go on quick trips and eat out more often," Kim Han Suk, a restaurant owner, said. "In general, people will spend more money and be happier."

HEADLINE: Slow Recovery May Still Feel Like a Slump 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT with SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
The United States appears to have slipped into an economic funk that analysts say bears a strong resemblance to the weak recovery of the early 1990's.
 With few companies adding jobs and Americans' net worth having dropped more than 20 percent in the last two years, the coming months are likely to feel like a slump even if the economy is gradually improving. 
 As the country continues to work off the excesses of the 1990's boom, including deceptive corporate accounting and large amounts of debt, economists expect both businesses and consumers to increase their spending only modestly. The possibility of further corporate scandals or an oil disruption in the Middle East heightens the uncertainty.
"The economy started to look like it was in the beginnings of a normal recovery, but then it seemed to grind to a halt in July," said Ethan Harris, one of two chief economists at Lehman Brothers. "It's got to make you very nervous." 
Federal Reserve governors are scheduled to meet tomorrow in Washington, still struggling to lift growth amid criticism that they -- particularly Alan Greenspan, the chairman -- may have overestimated the strength of the long boom.
Most economists do not expect the Fed to cut interest rates from their exceptionally low levels this week -- or even this year unless new economic problems emerge. But the Fed may signal its intentions when it meets, and there is considerable debate about what it should do, possibly as insurance against a downturn. Economists at Morgan Stanley said Friday that they expected the Fed to reduce its benchmark interest rate, perhaps to 1.25 percent from 1.75 percent, to encourage new spending, and investors bid up stocks last week partly in hopes of a cut.
On the day that the Fed meets, President Bush will convene an economic summit in Waco, Tex., where policy makers, executives, economists and others will discuss strategies for improving growth. The summit will in some ways resemble a 1992 gathering that Bill Clinton held in Little Rock, Ark., during the last so-called jobless recovery, which helped him win the White House from President George H. W. Bush. 
The White House is now concerned that nervous voters could turn Republican incumbents out of office in this year's midterm election and that the economy threatens President Bush's high approval ratings.
Fed officials and Wall Street economists continue to say that the economy is improving, if unevenly, and most data support those claims. But both groups also retained their optimism in the middle of last year, saying the economy would avoid recession, and it is now clear that one had begun by then.
In recent weeks, about 20 percent of Americans have described current economic conditions as "poor," the highest level since early 1996, according to the Gallup Organization. About 50 percent say conditions are "only fair."
At the same time, consumers have slowed their spending, weakening the strongest part of the economy over the last year and a half. They are still spending heavily on cars and houses, which are relatively affordable because of low interest rates, but many have cut back on items not on sale.
"We're finding the customer to be very discriminating," said Tom Murray, the president of Calvin Klein. "My opinion is that we're just going to see jagged performance through the next couple of months, just really slow growth."
Retailers' sales rose 2.6 percent in July from a year ago, less than the 5.1 percent gain in June, according to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Best Buy, the electronics retailer, set off a new round of concern by announcing Thursday that its spring sales were much weaker than it had expected. Consumers seem to be less willing to make large purchases like a $1,500 flat-screen television, analysts said.
But many economists expect the country to escape a double-dip recession largely because consumers show little sign of severely cutting spending, even though their assets are far less valuable than two years ago. Americans' net worth has fallen to about $35.3 trillion, from $45.1 trillion in late 2000, according to Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. Rising home values have not been enough to offset stock market losses by the group's calculations, and consumer debt has risen.
Still, Americans' net worth has more than doubled over the last decade. Those long-term gains seem to have kept many people sanguine about the stock's market fall and willing to continue spending. 
At Starbucks, stores open at least a year, consumers kept sales growth steady at 7 percent in July, matching June. But growth has slowed from the 10 percent recorded in May. 
Orin C. Smith, the chief executive of Starbucks, said he was concerned about the economy and its effect on consumer spending. "Whether consumers will become wary of spending in a tight economy is top of mind for all businesses," he said.
With automakers again offering many no-interest and low-interest leases, vehicle sales surged 8.6 percent last month. People are "looking for bargains, and the auto sector was offering the bargains in July," said John M. Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
Meanwhile, mortgage applications reached a record high in the week ended Aug. 2, thanks largely to a recent decline in long-term interest rates that reflects the new economic pessimism. Mortgages are a key economic indicator because people who refinance their home loans often have more disposable income, and people who buy new homes tend to buy appliances and other items.
"The best bet is that consumer spending will continue to advance, perhaps at a slower pace for a while," said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist at Prudential Securities.
A drop in home prices, which have continued to rise over the last 18 months, would be one of the biggest threats to the modest recovery. Most economists do not expect home prices to fall significantly, citing low interest rates and the continued influx of immigrants.
With some people moving money out of stock and into real estate, though, some economists are growing concerned about the possibility of a housing bubble. Home prices have risen about 30 percent since 1995, after accounting for inflation, while rents have risen just 10 percent, according to government data.
This suggests that many people are buying real estate not for shelter but as a can't-miss investment, said Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal group in Washington. Real estate will eventually fall out of fashion, much as technology stocks did, bringing rents and purchase prices closer together, Mr. Baker predicted.
Businesses, after almost two years of deep cuts in investments in new equipment and factories, have begun to mimic consumers. They are cutting some types of spending (on new factories, for example), increasing others (on new machines and software) and remaining conservative until they are more confident in the economy's prospects.
Companies have not benefited from falling interest rates nearly as much as consumers thought. With once-respected companies like WorldCom having collapsed, bondholders have become wary of extending credit.
"The same issues about corporate governance and fraud are making it harder and harder to borrow in the corporate bond market," said Mr. Harris of Lehman Brothers. "Investors don't know what they're buying."
Facing high borrowing costs and uncertain sales growth, few companies have begun the kind of new projects that create jobs. Between April and July, companies added just 68,000 jobs to their payrolls, according to the Labor Department. 
The current pace of hiring closely tracks the pace during the tepid expansion of 1991 through 1994 but is far slower than the hiring that followed recessions in the 1960's, '70's and '80's, said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of Hoenig & Company, an investment firm. State governments have begun cutting their work forces in recent weeks to close budget deficits, while the federal government's response to the Sept. 11 attacks continues to create jobs.
This mixed bag will be on the minds of Fed governors when they meet tomorrow in the second-floor boardroom of their headquarters in Washington, faced with an economy that looks less healthy than when they gathered in June. Last year, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate for overnight loans among banks 11 times last year, leaving it at its lowest level in almost 40 years, and has kept it at 1.75 percent this year.
The reductions helped moderate last year's recession by making borrowing less costly. Still, a growing group of economists and executives have faulted Mr. Greenspan for not recognizing that the soaring stock market of the late 1990's was a bubble and for not trying to restrain it. Others say he has been too slow to recognize weakness over the last year and have criticized him in terms that would have seemed stunning a few years ago.
Scott G. McNealy, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, pretended to raise binoculars to his eyes in a recent interview and said, "What is Alan Greenspan seeing through those?
"Chauncey Gardiner -- I mean Alan Greenspan -- is not in touch with what the rest of us are seeing," Mr. McNealy added, referring to a character played by Peter Sellers in the 1979 movie "Being There" who was known for making odd pronouncements that people considered brilliant.
Even if the economy is weaker than many forecasters expected it to be, unemployment remains at 5.9 percent, far lower than it was at the end of earlier recessions. Barring a shock, like a bigger drop in stocks or a spike in oil prices, the jobless rate will probably rise gently this year, economists say, and the recession that began last year will be regarded as mild. The legacy of the new expansion is much less certain.

HEADLINE: Bush Team Is Divided Over Getting Tougher With Saudis 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Growing talk of the Bush administration's plans for war with Iraq has once again thrown into sharp relief Washington's delicate relationship with Saudi Arabia, a central ally in the Persian Gulf war that makes no secret of its opposition to any future attack on President Saddam Hussein.
 The twist is that some of the most vocal advocates of military action against Iraq are also among those pressing hardest in Bush administration circles for a tough new American posture toward the Saudis in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers in those attacks were Saudis. 
 Today the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, again declared that his kingdom did not want American forces to use Saudi soil for any military campaign against Iraq. 
He insisted that the United States should "give a diplomatic solution a chance before going to war," adding, "There is no proof there is a threat imminent from Iraq."
At the same time, in an interview on the ABC News program "This Week" and another today in The Washington Post, Prince Saud went out of his way to emphasize Saudi cooperation in the Bush administration's campaign against terrorism. 
He announced that 16 suspected Al Qaeda fighters who had fled Afghanistan and who were reported to be Saudis were handed over in June by Iran to Saudi Arabia, which is interrogating them and sharing information with the United States. "The innocent will be let go and the guilty ones will be incarcerated and go to trial," he said on the ABC broadcast.
There has been rising bipartisan criticism of Saudi Arabia in Congress. It was reported recently that a Rand Corporation analyst contended in a briefing to a Pentagon advisory group last month that the Saudis should be treated as an enemy. 
The briefer called Saudi Arabia a prime sponsor of terrorism and instability in the Middle East and said it should be given an ultimatum to stop support for terrorism or face seizure of oil fields and assets.
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld swiftly insisted that the briefing, presented to the Defense Policy Board and first reported by The Washington Post, did not reflect "dominant opinion" within the administration. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell telephoned Prince Saud to reassure him that the briefing did not represent President Bush's views.
But the diplomatic flurry could not conceal the growing impatience among some segments of influential opinion that the United States should take a much tougher line toward Saudi Arabia, despite its status as a longtime ally. In this view, Saudi Arabia should be faulted for its poor record on human rights and women's rights, its repressive institutions and its support and financing for anti-Western religious schools and militant Islamic movements.
The chairman of the Defense Policy Board is Richard Perle, who was a Pentagon official in the Reagan administration, remains close to many current Bush administration figures and has been one of the most aggressive advocates of overthrowing President Hussein. The briefing by the Rand analyst, Laurent Murawiec, contended that ousting Mr. Hussein would prompt desirable change in Saudi Arabia.
"Part of this is generated by people with a very strong ideological bent," said Edward S. Walker Jr., a former senior State Department official and ambassador in the Middle East. "Those people are going to be very outspoken, and they are part of a coalition that believes you're either with us or against us. But it makes it much harder for anybody in the region to help us."
American military strategists have devised contingency plans for staging combat operations in Iraq without Saudi support, but no one pretends that it would not be easier to have cooperation.
In a telephone interview from France, Mr. Perle said he saw no relation between the need for a new government in Iraq and the need for changes in Saudi Arabia. He added that it was hard to predict what effect Mr. Hussein's ouster would have on the Saudis.
"The argument for going after Saddam has to do with the danger that Saddam represents, not with a hope that it's going to affect Saudi Arabia," he said. 
He said that the policy board briefings were "often intended to stimulate discussions, and they're deliberately intended to be provocative," but that "we're not making policy." He said a vigorous debate about Saudi-American relations was desirable.
Mr. Perle is hardly alone in his view. Speaking today on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, complained, "We have sort of hot and cold support from the Saudis when it comes to this war on terrorism," and added, "They've not been a consistent ally of ours."
Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, on "Fox News Sunday," characterized Saudi Arabia's reluctance to support action against Iraq as self-preservation to blunt criticism from the religious extremists within Saudi Arabia.
He described United States-Saudi relations as "a marriage of convenience."
Walter Cutler, who twice served as ambassador to Saudi Arabia in the Reagan administration, said the "whole hesitancy on Iraq, not just in Saudi Arabia but in almost all Arab countries," was related in part to internal pressure on Arab governments from their own people, who are frustrated by what they see as American inattention to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Mr. Cutler said he did not believe that the harsh criticism of the Saudis expressed in the Pentagon briefing represented "a significant view" within the administration, but he said, "The way it comes across abroad is another matter, and it's simply going to exacerbate some of the negative views in that politicized Arab street."
An adviser to the Saudi royal family made a similar point about Saudi elites. He said an estimated $600 billion to $700 billion in Saudi money was invested outside the kingdom, a vast majority of it in the United States or in United States-related investments.
"People have an enormous amount of money in the United States, and they're getting scared," the adviser said.
Mr. Walker, the former State Department official, acknowledged that the Saudi-American relationship had long been complex but said: "We need each other. They do provide a valuable service to our forces. They have provided, over the years, almost on demand, an increase in oil production to keep prices at a reasonable level."
He added that his former colleagues in government, from the Treasury to the State Department, had told him that "we are also getting cooperation in the war on terrorism and tracking the financial flows that we weren't before Sept. 11."
In an interview last week with The Associated Press, Prince Saud said Saudi Arabia had not asked the United States to remove its thousands of troops from the Prince Sultan Air Base in the Saudi desert, from which American planes have patrolled Iraqi skies for a decade. "Nothing is happening in the present, and we don't consider that anything will change in the future," he said.

HEADLINE: A Role Unfilled 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Throughout the business scandals of this tempestuous summer, President Bush has angrily denounced corporate criminals and cheerily declared that the economy is heading in the right direction. But his words have often had the opposite effect than he intended, sometimes seeming to send the financial markets diving.
 "He opens his mouth, and the market goes down," said Stephen Moore, the president of the Club for Growth, a political action committee that supports conservative Republican candidates. "I'm not saying he's responsible for the market crash. But he hasn't inspired a rush for investors to get back in." 
 The problem, Republicans, economists and the president's supporters say, is that the weakness of the White House economic team has forced Mr. Bush to become his own economic spokesman. That is a role, they say, that a president should avoid. 
Mr. Bush, they add, is not at his best when talking about the economy. Sometimes he has made odd off-the-cuff remarks, such as suggesting that Americans might look for stock bargains when the Dow is down. Sometimes he has been seen as cheerleading in the face of bad economic news. At other times his threats to throw corporate criminals in jail have seemed to agitate rather than quiet investors.
"He obviously has not been very effective," said Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, recalling that President Bill Clinton had a forceful, calming presence in his treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin.
"People knew when they listened to Clinton that there was something behind him," Mr. Hagel said. "There was Bob Rubin, there was an economic team. I don't think the markets see anything behind this president's words."
In part to address that problem, the White House is creating a stage to showcase Mr. Bush as the commander of the economy. On Tuesday, more than 200 mostly Republican guests -- a number are major party donors -- are to attend an economic forum at Baylor University in Waco, Tex., about a half-hour's drive from the president's 1,600-acre ranch, where Mr. Bush is spending most of this month.
At Mr. Bush's side will be Vice President Dick Cheney, who until recently has been largely invisible to the public while the Securities and Exchange Commission investigates accounting practices at the Halliburton Company, the oil services giant where Mr. Cheney was chief executive.
Although the White House initially said that Mr. Cheney would not attend the conference, the vice president will now descend from his summer aerie in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming to the prairie of central Texas, adding what Republicans say is much-needed heft to the administration's economic voice. Mr. Cheney's presence, they say, is a clear sign of how worried the White House is about the effects of the economy on Mr. Bush's political future.
"The Halliburton thing is not helpful at this time," Mr. Hagel said. "But he was a chief executive of a respected company, so he does bring some real-world experience. And they essentially need all hands on deck right now."
Some Republicans nonetheless praise Mr. Bush for his efforts, and say there is often little a president can do to change the markets. "Wall Street is not an accurate reflection of the economy," said Representative Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. "It's a reflection of how investors feel about the economy. My guess is that by the end of the year, we'll see that the president was an effective spokesman for the economy."
Many of Mr. Bush's supporters trace his problems to Paul H. O'Neill, the quirky and much criticized treasury secretary, whose habit of popping off has not been reassuring to the markets. 
"There are a lot of people who would like to see him gone in the next half hour," one influential Republican businessman said. Many Republicans say it is essential that Mr. O'Neill be replaced after the November midterm elections, when Mr. Bush will begin to turn his attention to his re-election campaign in 2004.
Otherwise, they warn, Mr. Bush may face the same fate as his father, who was enormously popular after the Persian Gulf war but lost the 1992 election in large part because of voters' perceptions that he had lost control of the economy.
"Bush needs to reassign Paul O'Neill to some other job in the administration and get a more effective spokesman for economic policy," Mr. Moore said.
Many Republicans say that none of the leading economic officials in Mr. Bush's administration can adequately fill the role. Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, has alienated many in Congress. Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's chief economic adviser, is not thought to have the presence or political skills for the job. Donald L. Evans, the secretary of commerce, is personally close to the president, but business leaders say that he does not have the stature or the portfolio to be the economic voice of the administration.
So speaking out on the economy is left to Mr. Bush, with sometimes embarrassing results. After the president delivered a major address on July 9 on Wall Street that was meant to reassure the markets, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 178.81 points, and was down nearly 700 points by the end of the week. On July 22, a day when Mr. Bush forcefully defended Mr. O'Neill and current stock prices, saying "there is value in the market now," the Dow ended down 234.68, or 2.9 percent.
On July 30, the day Mr. Bush signed a major corporate antifraud bill in a grand White House ceremony, analysts said investors were reassured by the news -- but stocks still seesawed and the markets ended that day almost where they began.
Former Clinton administration officials say the markets' response to Mr. Bush's words shows that presidents should talk about the broad fundamentals of the economy, not the ups and downs of Wall Street. Mr. Clinton, for example, was always eager to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, but Mr. Rubin told him no, saying that if the market went down that day, the president would be blamed.
Other economists agree that presidents are generalists, not specialists, and that their role is to speak on a broad range of foreign and domestic policy. The intricacies of the market, they say, should be left to the treasury secretary. "I think very few presidents either can or should attempt to do this sort of thing themselves," said Benjamin M. Friedman, an economics professor at Harvard University. "They don't have the uniformity of focus that is required to make the message effective."
Sometimes Mr. Bush has tried to restore consumer confidence in the face of unwelcome statistics with an unusually sunny interpretation of the numbers, like on July 31, when he announced that "we're heading in the right direction" That was the day the Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product grew by 1.1 percent from April through June, down from 5 percent in the first three months of the year. 
"People won't be reassured by a pep rally," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "They will be assured by candid discussions and a frank assessment of the strengths and challenges the economy faces."
For that, the White House says it is offering the economic forum this week, which many Republicans acknowledge is as much about crucial public relations as collecting expertise. "It's a move in the right direction," Mr. Hagel said. "But I think the president knows he's going to have to do more to address these problems than putting on a show in Texas."

HEADLINE: Beyond the Waco Echo Chamber 

 BODY:
President Bush's vacation plans changed abruptly when he decided recently to summon more than half his cabinet to a convenient location for an economic conference. Well, Baylor University in the scorched prairie of Waco, Tex., a half-hour's drive from Mr. Bush's ranch, was at least convenient for the president. Now the question is whether tomorrow's forum, which is reportedly going to include Republican donors and exclude administration critics, will do anything to resolve the administration's failure to speak with one reassuring voice on the economy.
 The Waco forum is obviously a way to let Mr. Bush show that he is concerned about the economy. Few Americans could seriously doubt it. But in truth there is not much Mr. Bush or anyone can do to change the economic indicators as the November elections approach. And to give the president his due, he came into office warning of a recession, even though the tax cut he proposed to deal with it was a bad idea that looks worse the more he presses to extend it. The passage of legislation to promote trade was an important achievement, and Mr. Bush signed a solid bill to restore corporate responsibility after showing an early lack of enthusiasm. 
 But on economic policy, and especially fiscal policy, this administration has no convincing plan. What it has is an ideology -- and even that ideology lacks consistency. The commitment to free trade did not survive pressures from swing-state steelmakers for protection, and the dedication to fiscal conservatism was tossed overboard with the enactment of an obscenely expensive farm aid package. The impression left is that the White House's handling of the economy is driven by short-term political concerns. That image is not likely to be changed by the holding of a politically driven event like the Waco conference.
The Bush economic team has come under such heavy criticism these days that even many Republicans expect a reshuffling after the election. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Lawrence Lindsey, director of economic policy at the White House, and Mitchell Daniels, the budget director, are the ones most criticized, even by Republicans in Washington. Mr. O'Neill's crusty shoot-from-the-hip style is popular among some, but it doesn't necessarily make him the best choice for calming markets. Mr. Lindsey is supposed to manage economic policy, but he has done little beyond advocating tax cuts as the solution to everything.
But the biggest problem is that no one on the economic team seems to have the stature to work out a coherent policy and force the others -- particularly the political handlers -- to come on board. Mr. O'Neill was at least skeptical about tax cuts when he entered office, and he openly criticized the administration's expediency on trade. (Perhaps Mr. O'Neill could debate Karl Rove, the White House political director, at the conference tomorrow. That's one way to bring the crowds to Waco.) The Treasury secretary's supporters say he wanted faster action on corporate issues but was rebuffed. These reports have diminished his stature and cast doubt about how policy is made.
Mr. Daniels, director of the Office of Management and Budget, also has credibility problems. His forecasts have had to be revised constantly, and his lectures on spending restraint are undercut by Mr. Bush's signing the costliest farm bill in history. In political terms, this is the first Republican administration in a long while that will have a tough time beating up on Democrats over the budget, in part because it is Republicans who want to spend on the military and on homeland defenses and none of them want to think about rescinding the tax cut.
The president is not going to engage in any midcourse corrections until after the elections. But this gathering in Waco should mark the end of the administration's attempts to solve its problems by demonstrating that Mr. Bush cares. We know he cares. What we need is evidence that he knows what to do.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
An Opinionated Traveler Drawn to the Developing World

BYLINE:  By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:
THE WRITER AND THE WORLD
Essays
By V. S. Naipaul
Introduced and edited by Pankaj Mishra. 524 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
 "I travel to discover other states of mind," V. S. Naipaul writes in one of the essays in his haphazard and lumpy new collection, "The Writer and the World." "And if for this intellectual adventure I go to places where people live restricted lives, it is because my curiosity is still dictated in part by my colonial Trinidad background. I go to places which, however alien, connect in some way with what I already know." 
 Mr. Naipaul's best known writings deal with the third world: those "half-made societies" in Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Indian subcontinent, reeling from the twin legacies of colonial oppression and post-colonial turmoil and caught between the weight of tradition and the siren call of modernity, between ancient indigenous imperatives and shiny imported ideologies.
This volume of essays by the winner of last year's Nobel Prize in Literature is essentially a repackaging of his earlier work: its strongest entries appeared previously in volumes like "The Return of Eva Peron" (1980) and "Finding the Center" (1984), while its newer additions tend to be slighter and very dated pieces about unlikely subjects like the 1984 Republican Convention and Steinbeck country in California. Most of the pieces -- particularly those dealing with hot spots in Africa and Latin America where political and social change has been swift -- would have benefited enormously from postscripts, providing the reader with historical context and updated developments.
Mr. Naipaul is not an objective reporter but a highly opinionated traveler, and what this volume underscores, once again, are the recurrent, even obsessive themes in his work: his fascination with the developing world's simultaneous resentment and envy of the West; his bitter skepticism about the ability of former colonies to shed their habits of dependence, superstition and passivity; his impatience with both third world revolutionaries in thrall to borrowed ideologies and radical chic tourists with plane tickets to crisis zones and return tickets home. He writes, as he has in so many other books, about the dangers of trying to tailor people to imported theories and the rage created in places like Mobutu's Zaire by the aping of Western consumerism. He detects the substitution of drama and style for practical politics in places as varied as the Caribbean and the United States, and he laments the persistence of magical thinking -- and the willingness to submit to self-mythologizing dictators -- in Africa and Latin America.
Clearly many of his feelings about the countries he visits are rooted in his family background -- his grandfather, a Brahmin from Uttar Pradesh, India, came to Trinidad as an indentured worker -- and his fears, as he once put it, of "being swallowed up by the bush," by the "enemies of the civilization" he so prizes. He is at his most vitriolic, in this volume, in his early essays on India, a place, he writes, "for which one has a great tenderness, but from which at length one always wishes to separate oneself."
Though he would later adopt a more detached and sympathetic attitude toward his ancestral homeland in his 1990 book "India: A Million Mutinies Now," Mr. Naipaul bemoans "the Indian intellectual failure" in a 1967 essay and writes snidely of "a people grown barbarous, indifferent and self-wounding, who, out of a shallow perception of the world, have no sense of tragedy."
"The gap between India and the West is not only the increasing gap in wealth, technology and knowledge," he writes. "It is, more alarmingly, the increasing gap in sensibility and wisdom. The West is alert, many-featured and ever-changing; its writers and philosophers respond to complexity by continually seeking to alter and extend sensibility; no art or attitude stands still. India possesses only its unexamined past and its pathetic spirituality."
He is equally scathing and fatalistic about the islands of the Caribbean, and their inability, as he sees it, to surmount their past of slavery and colonial neglect. "They may get less innocent or less corrupt politicians; they will not get less helpless ones," he gloomily declares in a 1970 essay. "The island blacks will continue to be dependent on the books, films and goods of others; in this important way they will continue to be the half-made societies of a dependent people, the Third World's third world. They will forever consume; they will never create. They are without material sources; they will never develop the higher skills. Identity depends in the end on achievement; and achievement here cannot but be small."
In the most hypnotic essays in this volume, Mr. Naipaul's highly subjective views appear to emerge, organically, from the story he is telling. "Killings in Trinidad" -- which would provide material for his 1975 novel "Guerrillas" -- showcases Mr. Naipaul's skills as a storyteller while illustrating some of his most insistent themes. The essay tells the chilling story of a half-black Trinidadian named Michael Malik (or Michael X), who started out as a pimp and drug pusher, became the darling of white radicals in London and returned to Trinidad in 1971 as an avatar of Black Power; he would end up being hanged in 1975, after orchestrating the murders of two followers.
The meaning of the story, Mr. Naipaul suggests, is simple: "Malik's career proves how much of Black Power -- away from its United States source -- is jargon, how much a sentimental hoax. In a place like Trinidad, racial redemption is as irrelevant for the Negro as for everybody else. It obscures the problems of a small independent country with a lopsided economy, the problems of a fully 'consumer' society that is yet technologically untrained and without the intellectual means to comprehend the deficiency."
In "Argentina and the Ghost of Eva Peron," he is even more scornful of Argentina, as a country that can never transcend its colonial past: "Argentina is a land of plunder, a new land, virtually peopled in this century. It remains a land to be plundered; and its politics can be nothing but the politics of plunder." Such vehement and unforgiving statements point to the limitations that Mr. Naipaul's reportorial methods would reach in his extremely dark and judgmental 1981 book about his travels through the Islamic world ("Among the Believers").
Another, more nuanced approach can be found in "The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro." This essay, which happens to be one of the author's few pieces to evince an optimistic view of a third-world country, recounts Mr. Naipaul's travels through Ivory Coast in the early 1980's and his journey to the pharaonic site of its president's ancestral village. The piece is studded with keenly observed portraits of individual residents, seemingly chosen at random, and it radiates an awareness not only of the horrors and stupidities of history but also of its wonders and strangeness, an outlook that would infuse the author's more recent fiction and nonfiction with a new benevolence of outlook.

HEADLINE: Don't Blame Immigrants 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "Immigration Cut Into Income in New York, Census Finds" (front page, Aug. 6), you conclude that the decline in median income in New York City during the 1990's is the result of an increase in the city's immigrant population. 
 But an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute shows that if the immigrant share of the population had not grown, poverty would have been only slightly lower and median income slightly higher. 
Between 1994 and 2000, the period for which data are available, the increase in immigration was offset by the fact that immigrants' poverty rates fell much faster than those of natives.
The census results for New York are more likely the result of two economic problems that hurt all less-advantaged workers, regardless of their nativity: increased inequality and high unemployment.

HEADLINE: Dockside, the War on Terrorism May Hone Rivalry 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
The 790-foot container ship Norasia Sharjah sat dissected on Christopher Ong's computer screen, sliced into virtual sections. Inside each slice were colored boxes representing the nearly 3,500 containers on board and their destinations: Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Malta, Italy.
 For Mr. Ong, the vice president responsible for one of the four container terminals owned by Singapore's dominant port operator, the PSA Corporation, the sophisticated system is a way to help customers like Norasia Container Lines save time and money. But soon, the PSA system will join the front line of the United States war against terrorism. 
 In June, Singapore became the first country to sign on to a container security initiative by the United States Customs Service. Though many details are being worked out, one important feature of the initiative will be the stationing of United States customs officials in the world's largest ports, where they can help prevent terrorists from sneaking weapons of mass destruction into the 5.7 million containers that travel to United States seaports each year.
The Customs Service has been promoting the program as a competitive advantage for ports that take part, arguing that the containers that the service screens abroad will pass though customs more quickly once they reach the United States.
Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium and France have followed Singapore's lead, and several other countries are thought to be close to signing on, too.
But many port operators and shipping companies remain unconvinced. The plan will mean costly delays, they say, at a time when ports are competing intensely for cargo. Japan and Hong Kong, for instance, have both expressed reservations about the cost of the proposal and what they see as its intrusiveness. PSA, however, is willing to gamble. "If we're able to do this more efficiently than our competitors, we will have an advantage in terms of transit time," said Grace Fu, the deputy group president for finance at PSA.
PSA's fortunes took a turn for the worse last year, with traffic and profit both falling roughly 9 percent, partly because of the global economic slowdown. PSA also faces increasing competition from a newer port in neighboring Malaysia, the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, where lower costs lured away two of PSA's biggest customers, Maersk Sealand and Evergreen Marine.
Singapore has always been primarily a port city, and the port, the largest in the region, remains a metaphor for Singapore's struggle to cope with rising competition from China and other neighbors for investment and trade.
Known as the Port of Singapore Authority before it "corporatized" in 1997 (it remains state-owned), PSA is the world's largest container port operator. Some 15.6 million containers are handled each year, most of them just passing through on their way to 600 other ports in 123 countries. Shipping companies mainly use Singapore as a transshipment hub, consolidating cargoes here on their way to markets elsewhere. 
Singapore's location on one of the world's busiest shipping routes clinched its position as the biggest port in Southeast Asia. High-technology efficiency has helped keep Singapore on top. PSA computer systems link shipping lines, freight forwarders, exporters and customs officials. They calculate where best to berth incoming ships and how to load or unload them as quickly and efficiently as possible, crunching a job that used to take five people 12 hours into a three-hour procedure, Mr. Ong said.
At Mr. Ong's terminal, PSA has introduced what it says are the world's first auto-piloted cranes. Instead of assigning an operator to each crane, PSA can have a single operator at its computer system manage up to six cranes, directing them to fetch containers from a stockyard. Human operators control the cranes only when they are ready to put the containers on trucks for transfer to a ship. And humans still run the cranes that load and unload containers from ships.
Still, there is only so much that technical wizardry can do to combat lower-priced competition. PSA has had to break with longstanding practices to win back traffic, which picked up a bit in June and July.
Last month, PSA said it would begin offering discounts and would stop refusing to allow shipping companies to run their own terminals, a privilege they commonly enjoy at other ports, according to Sim Chey Hoon, a Merrill Lynch analyst here.
"That's what they really want," Ms. Sim said of the shippers. "It's a lot easier if you have your own terminal."
PSA has also begun looking beyond its home port, taking stakes in two ports in Belgium, four in China and six others elsewhere.
Growth overseas has largely offset whatever revenue PSA has lost to its Malaysian competitor. "In China the ports are doing tremendously well," said Tan Ee-Lin, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. Chinese port traffic is growing 30 percent a year.
Until the United States customs officials arrive here later this month, PSA and the shipping lines can only guess about many details of the United States security initiative. So far it appears that shippers will have to submit cargo manifests earlier than before and that the manifests will be used to flag suspicious containers to be X-rayed on arrival.
The shipping lines are "a little bit leery about how the requirements will affect the flow of containers," said Chak Kwok Wai, director of NYK Line, a subsidiary of Nippon Yusen of Japan and a big Singapore port customer.
Right now, PSA can readily determine where containers have come from, but not what is in them. That information will have to be obtained from the shipping lines, which get it from exporters, and then will have to be put into PSA's database. "Some shipments have good information; some don't," Mr. Chak said.
Analysts say that the security initiative will not affect most of the millions of containers passing through Singapore. Only a few hundred thousand a year are destined for the United States, and although the port can move hundreds of containers an hour, most containers spend up to four days sitting in a yard waiting for ships to arrive -- plenty of time to be screened. "We are not overly concerned," Ms. Fu said.

A Bright Side To US Airways Tale
There is a bright side to the US Airways filing in bankruptcy court, according to Hal Rosenbluth, the chief executive of Rosenbluth International, the third-largest global travel management company. 
 "I think it's great for everyone," said Mr. Rosenbluth, who is known as something of an iconoclast in the travel industry. 
 Mr. Rosenbluth explained himself. Besides the short-term relief for a floundering airline, and despite expected "minor interruptions" in some passenger service, the US Airways action brings into sharp focus the fundamental problem that has pushed the airline industry to the edge of a cliff, he said.
"The fare structure is broken," Mr. Rosenbluth said. The industry's travail will continue, he added, "until someone takes a leadership position and insists on a rational pricing structure."
How does that happen, even assuming one of the major airlines finally steps up to the plate and restructures fares? Merely simplifying hopelessly convoluted fare structures is not enough, suggested Mr. Rosenbluth, who has been crusading on this subject for over a year. Nor is it simply a matter of narrowing the current wide discrepancy between leisure and business fares by raising cheap leisure fares, though that would be a start, he said.
Rather, he suggested, fundamental reform will involve a radical change in the current behaviors both of airlines and of companies that negotiate discounts on standard business fares. 
For several years, he said, airlines desperate for cash and for market share have "haphazardly given discounts or matched others' discounts," while corporate travel departments have grabbed at increasingly enticing offers of negotiated discounts in exchange for guarantees of a certain amount of volume.
This has forced small businesses to reduce purchases of business fares or reduce travel altogether, he said. Meanwhile, order and discipline are collapsing in the overall corporate marketplace for business fares. 
In this wild fire-sale atmosphere, some companies have been "promising more than they can deliver" to get airline business-fare discounts, Mr. Rosenbluth said. And airlines -- desperate to hang onto any revenue whatever -- "have not been penalizing them" for failing to purchase as many tickets as they had promised to get the discounts, he added. 
At the same time, he continued, companies "who negotiate properly and honestly" on their airline discounts, are "subsidizing" the miscreants. The result is that "hundreds of millions of dollars have gone down the drain" instead of to the airlines, he said.
Late last year, Mr. Rosenbluth commissioned a study on the subject. The report -- "Who's Zooming Who?" -- is on the Rosenbluth Web site, www.rosenbluth.com. Click on "About Us," then "Press Releases" and then "2001."

U.S. Air Travel Continues to Languish
Domestic air travel continues to languish, according to data to be released this week by OAG, the international airline guide. According to published airline schedules for August, the number of domestic flights was down 7 percent, and international flights down 8 percent, OAG said. 
The actual situation is worse than those numbers make it appear because many airlines have been flying smaller-capacity planes since last year. In July, for example, US Airways reported that passenger traffic was off 17.6 percent. The other major airlines also carried far fewer passengers. United Airlines traffic was off 12.3 percent. It was down 9.7 percent at American Airlines, 8.6 percent at Continental Airlines, 8 percent at Northwest Airlines and 6.6 percent at Delta Air Lines. JOE SHARKEY

As a bus packed with longshoremen headed to a giant Korean ship at Berth 36, Wendell Womack lashed out at management's contract proposal, saying it would be terrible for longshoremen and for the people of Oakland. 
 The proposal, to install new technology to cut costs and speed cargo handling, would eliminate 400 longshoremen's jobs on the West Coast, management officials acknowledge. 
 Thousands of longshoremen are so angry that they are threatening to strike, a move that would paralyze ports from San Diego to Seattle and weaken the nation's shaky economy.
"They've said they'd protect the jobs of current workers, but what about the future?" asked Mr. Womack, who works about 20 days a year on the waterfront and hopes to qualify as a registered regular longshoreman. "They'd be cutting off hope." 
For many people in down-and-out neighborhoods here, the promise of an $80,000-a-year longshoreman's job is like the promise of a lottery ticket. Union officials say they try to give poor residents many of the new jobs.
But negotiators for the shipping lines say Mr. Womack and other longshoremen fail to understand that by cutting costs the management proposal would make the ports more competitive, meaning additional jobs at the docks. Negotiators will grapple over the proposal when they resume talks on Tuesday, after a three-week break.
"The talks are very slow," said Joseph Miniace, president of the employers' group, the Pacific Maritime Association. "There's very little progress."
Mr. Miniace said he worried that the 10,500 West Coast longshoremen would conduct a slowdown or walk out. The Bush administration, fearing that a job action would hurt the economy, has signaled it might order an 80-day cooling-off period. 
In his office in San Francisco, Mr. Miniace took out a chart to show that under his proposal jobs would dip by 400 over three years and then increase, surpassing current levels in 2007. He has promised lifetime job security for unionized clerks, even though new technologies might eliminate their jobs, which include typing in what merchandise each truck carries into the port.
"The clerk numbers are going to fall, but the numbers of longshoremen, the people who do the loading and unloading, are going to continue to grow," Mr. Miniace said. "Remember that cargo flows are projected to double and triple in the next 10 or 20 years."
Many longshoremen say they do not believe that. The two sides have not been able to reach an accord since July 1, when the old contract expired, largely because many longshoremen do not trust management. 
Considering the history of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, that is not surprising. Since the union was founded in 1932, helped by a legendary general strike that shut down San Francisco, it has often taken an us-against-them attitude toward management. 
Even though their pay makes the longshoremen the royalty of the nation's blue-collar workers, they often echo the oratory of the union founder, Harry Bridges, who was proud to be called a militant Marxist. For decades, J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, sought -- unsuccessfully -- to deport the Australian-born Mr. Bridges, accusing him of being a Communist, a description that Mr. Bridge steadfastly denied. 
"It's hard to believe their talk of more jobs," said Richard Mead, president of I.L.W.U. Local 10, which represents dock workers here. "We handle 10 times the amount of cargo that we did decades ago, but now we have one-twentieth of the people." 
The ports are handling more cargo with fewer workers because ships now carry cargo in big metal containers that are easy to load and unload with cranes instead of carrying cargo in loose batches that took far more workers to handle. In 1960, union and management reached a turning point with the Mechanization and Modernization Agreement. In that pact, the union let shipping lines use containers, and management promised job security and high wages and benefits.
Now, the companies say it is time for another technological leap. They want to use optical scanners, the Internet and satellite geopositioning to monitor shipments and speed trucks into ports.
"There are huge truck lines at the terminals," Mr. Miniace said, "and if we automate the gates, we can process trucks in 30 seconds, rather than three minutes."
Union officials say they do not oppose new technologies that increase efficiency. But they fear that management will use the technologies to transform union jobs into nonunion management positions and move union jobs off the piers, so nonunion workers do the work.
"Technology and union jurisdiction cannot be separated," a spokesman for the union, Steve Stallone, said. "Technology is being used to shrink the number of jobs in some areas. But our philosophy is the jobs that remain should be union jobs."
The union wants certain managers' jobs and nearly 100 jobs of vessel planners, who map cargo placement on ships, to be union positions. In its proposal, the union said it would accept new technologies, but only if it retained, or was given, many positions. 
Just as the union ridiculed the management proposal, some management officials did not take the union proposal seriously. 
"Their proposal was developed so it could not possibly be accepted," Mr. Miniace said. "On a net basis, their proposal actually adds employees to the work force."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In San Diego; 
Hot Economy and Mild Temperatures

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
Don't tell San Diego that the country recently suffered a recession.
 If any American metropolis has boomed during the rocky economy, it has been California's southernmost large city -- home to Sempra Energy, Qualcomm and IDEC pharmaceuticals -- with its diversified economy and its thriving technology, biotechnology and tourism industries. Employment is up, as is attendance at the San Diego Convention Center, which was recently expanded. 
 And you really can't talk about San Diego without mentioning the balmy climate, where temperatures hover in the mid-60's in the winter and the mid-70's in the summer.

HOTELS
Those who have an image to uphold should consider the LODGE AT TORREY PINES (858-453-4420, $450 to $900), which opened in La Jolla amidst a great deal of fanfare in April. Some executives book one of the Palisades suites, which span 1,100 square feet, for business powwows. Guests also have privileges at the adjacent Torrey Pines Golf Course.
Equally luxurious, but much more low key, the nearby HOTEL PARISI (858-454-1511, $325 to $485) features 20 ultraprivate rooms with high-end stereo systems and computer hookups.
For ease to the San Diego Convention Center, it's hard to beat the SAN DIEGO MARRIOTT HOTEL AND MARINA (619-234-1500, $260 to $285), which is connected to the center, as well as several restaurants and lounges. All rooms have high-speed Internet access.
The MANCHESTER GRAND HYATT SAN DIEGO, (619-232-1234) also near the convention center, is offering a special summer rate of $165 a night for a single room. In mid-September, rates will climb back up to $189.
If you're traveling northward and want to relax after a round of client meetings, you might check into the FOUR SEASONS RESORT AVIARA (760-603-6800, $505 to $615) in Carlsbad and order an avocado wrap at the spa.
The HOTEL DEL CORONADO (619-435-6611, $265 to $615), Coronado's historic hotel, is ideal for small meetings and dinners. Entertain guests in one of the hotel's new Cottages at North Beach, which offer large living rooms with fireplaces and French doors opening to decks that overlook the Pacific. A special cottage staff will prepare a candlelight, four-course dinner -- and draw you a customized bath when everyone's gone home.

DINING OUT
For a scenic lunch, try the PRADO (619-557-9441, $65 for two, including wine and tip) in Balboa Park, the largest urban park in the country. Dan Novak, a vice president at Cox Communications in San Diego, enjoys its eclectic menu, which changes frequently. After lunch, Mr. Novak likes to take out-of-towners on a stroll by the Old Globe Theater, a local landmark within walking distance of the restaurant.
If you've got some serious schmoozing to do, make a reservation at DONOVAN'S STEAK AND CHOP HOUSE (858-450-6666, about $100) in La Jolla's University Town Center. Once you've been there a few times, the waiters have your name, and table preferences, committed to memory. Even the restaurant's general manager, Carl Essert, who works the room each night, will treat you like an old pal. "I only go there about every other month, and the staff puts a little plaque with my name on it on the table, which impresses the heck out of clients," Mr. Novak said. Diners can choose from more than a dozen cuts of beef, or go for the lobster, which Mr. Novak calls "phenomenal."
The TURF SUPPER CLUB (619-234-6363, $80) in Golden Hill is a hip, off-the-beaten-path establishment where guests can sip martinis while cooking their own steaks at an indoor grill. "It's way cool," said Ron Donoho, executive editor of San Diego magazine. Once the meat is done to your liking, sit back and listen to piano music on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Open for dinner only.
Take sports fans to SEAU'S (619-291-7328, $45), a casual Mission Valley burger and sandwich joint owned by the San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau. You'll get a variety of inexpensive eats, and your own television screen at your table, tuned to whatever channel you like.

ENTERTAINMENT
Downtown's Gaslamp Quarter is the hottest spot in town for bar hoppers. 
For late-night planning over drinks, try the WESTGATE PIANO BAR (619-557-3650) in the Westgate Hotel. With bow-tie-clad waiters, top Scotch and Champagne, classical piano music and velvet furniture, "it's a really classy place," said Gregor Shanks, a senior account executive for Weyerhaeuser. The best part? "Hardly anybody knows about it, so it's quiet," Mr. Shanks said.
For something a little more upbeat in the Quarter, head to JIMMY LOVES (619-595-0123), which features live jazz six nights a week, and Top 40 cover bands on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.

ON YOUR OWN
Too busy to visit the SAN DIEGO ZOO (619-231-1515) during the day? Don't worry. It's even better at night, when you can take in "The Stilt Birds," a show running through Sept. 2 that features 10-foot prehistoric-looking puppets operated by elaborately costumed technicians. 
Also to be enjoyed at night is "Park at Dark" at the SAN DIEGO WILD ANIMAL PARK (619-718-3000). The evening show features the sounds of beating drums and soft flutes set against a backdrop of African savannas.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Seeing Long Trading Slump, Schwab Sets More Cutbacks 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The Charles Schwab Corporation said yesterday that it would shut one of its five customer call centers, eliminate 375 jobs and look for ways to save an additional $200 million a year as it braces for an extended slump in trading by individual investors.
 Executives at Schwab, based in San Francisco, said they saw little reason to hope that customers would regain enough confidence in financial markets to return in force. They said they would cut an undetermined number of additional jobs, in addition to about 7,500 eliminated in the last 18 months. 
 "As we thought long and hard about the current environment, we did not have conviction that things were going to rebound quickly," said Christopher Dodds, Schwab's chief financial officer. "Too much wealth has been lost, too much sentiment has been damaged for there to be a quick and painless recovery."
Mr. Dodds offered that assessment despite reporting that Schwab's business picked up in July. Last month, the average number of daily trades by the company's customers was more than 20 percent higher than in June or in July of last year. Customers also deposited $4.4 billion in new money in accounts at Schwab.
But more of that money stayed in cash and less went into stocks and mutual funds, Mr. Dodds said. Schwab's customers also sold more stocks and mutual funds than they bought in July. 
The scariest development, though, came last week. Mr. Dodds said customer trading activity had reverted in August to the depressed levels of May and June.
"Despite one good month, we're just not satisfied with current financial performance," Mr. Dodds said. "We felt some further actions were needed."
Those actions will include closing the company's call center in Austin, Tex., and laying off 300 people who work there. Opened in mid-2000, that center is Schwab's newest. It handles about 10 percent of the calls from customers seeking help or advice on investments.
Schwab will eliminate 75 jobs in its other call centers, in Denver; Indianapolis; Orlando, Fla.; and Phoenix, Mr. Dodds said. Then, over the next several weeks, Schwab's executives will identify other expenses to cut, in areas ranging from consultants and other professional services to advertising. After making those decisions, the company will decide how many more jobs to eliminate, he said.
Analysts said they expected that the number of jobs to be eliminated would exceed 1,000 and that the company's staff would fall below 18,000 people, from a peak of 26,300 in late 2000.
Shares of Charles Schwab fell 11 cents, to $8.46.
"There's growing concern among investors that the company is moving away from cutting fat into the meat," said Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "We think the slowdown in retail brokerage is not an aberration but a trend."
With investors scared out of the market, Mr. McVey and other analysts said, Schwab had no choice but to cut costs to deliver on its promise of better returns. Schwab has promised to raise its profit margin to 12 percent to 14 percent, but has been stuck at about 10 percent through July. 
"This is a realization that the market isn't going to come back any time soon for the retail investor," said Richard Repetto, an analyst with Putnam Lovell Securities.

HEADLINE: Colombia President Declares Limited State of Emergency 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
True to his campaign promise for aggressive action against leftist rebels, Colombia's new president, Alvaro Uribe, authorized emergency measures today that broaden the government's powers and allow for a quick expansion of the armed forces.
 The measures, invoked in a "state of domestic commotion" decree, give the government the right to create a new tax to pay for the military buildup. The government can now also restrict movement, make arrests without warrants and control television and radio airwaves, if deemed necessary. 
 The decree comes five days after rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia lobbed mortars into the center of this Andean capital during Mr. Uribe's inauguration, killing at least 19 civilians who were struck by errant missiles.
Mr. Uribe and his ministers met on Sunday to draft the decree, as permitted under the Constitution. The government said today that "insecurity in the government" was growing more critical every day.
"The state and the Colombian society should respond to recuperate the national security, now that the violent ones have become more aggressive and destructive," said Fernando Londono, the justice and interior minister. 
Some leading human rights groups expressed concern about the measures, noting that such decrees have led to rights abuses when invoked by various Colombian governments.
"By its very nature it gives new powers and authority to the military and police," said Eric Olson, Latin America specialist at Amnesty International in Washington. "And there's a long track record of lack of accountability and abuse by those authorities."
But there is strong support here for a tough response against the rebels, who have increased bombings in recent months, after Mr. Uribe's predecessor broke off peace talks. Mr. Uribe, a former provincial governor educated at Oxford and Harvard, won office in a landslide by pledging to bring order to this violence-ridden country.
Mr. Londono, in announcing the decree, said the government would "safeguard with obsessive vigilance the respect for human rights." 
 Gen. Luis Ernesto Gilibert, who was widely expected to be removed by Mr. Uribe as chief of the country's National Police, resigned Monday night, Reuters reported. 
The decree is not as strong as a state of siege, under which the government could impose curfews, penalize those who broke them and severely limit freedom of movement.
But it remained unclear what restrictions would be applied; Mr. Londono said the measures would be announced in a week or two. The decree lasts 90 days, but can be extended an additional 180 days.
The decree gives the president the authority to recruit quickly up to 6,000 soldiers for two elite, mobile brigades, as well as 10,000 new police officers and 100,000 civilian informers, who would receive a small remuneration to provide authorities with intelligence on the rebels. The government also wants to increase the number of special prosecutors and judges.
To pay for the military expansion, estimated to cost up to $800 million, the government would assess a 1.2 percent tax on anyone with assets exceeding $60,0000. During his campaign for president, Mr. Uribe stressed that the only way to improve Colombia's troubled economy was to expand the military's abilities against the rebels.
Although the State Department declined comment on the usefulness of the decree, many officials in the Bush administration are sure to welcome the measure.

Last Week's Rally Stalls as Investors Take Profits or Wait

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street stalled yesterday as investors took profits from last week's rally and considered the possibility that the Federal Reserve might not cut interest rates. Blue chips dropped slightly, while technology shares managed a small gain.
 Analysts said investors wanted to see what retail earnings and other economic data looked like and whether companies would meet a government deadline later this week for certifying financial statements. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 56.56 points, or 0.7 percent, at 8,688.89. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 4.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 903.80. The Nasdaq composite index was little changed, rising 0.72 points, to 1,306.84. 
Analysts noted that trading volume was light.
"There's just not much going on today," said Robert Streed, portfolio manager of Northern Select Equity Fund in Chicago. "People are just waiting to see what the Fed is going to do Tuesday, who does or doesn't sign their financial documents on the 14th and to see if the market can continue its uptrend."
Stocks rose steadily last week on a mix of bargain hunting after a huge sell-off and hopes that the Fed might cut interest rates again because of data suggesting that the economy was faltering. The Fed's Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet today, but most analysts played down the possibility of a reduction. 
US Airways' decision to file for bankruptcy protection over the weekend soured the session for airlines. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, fell $1.40, to $3.80, a decline of 26.9 percent, on concerns that the airline might be the next carrier forced into bankruptcy protection. US Airways shares did not trade.
Boeing, which makes airplanes, fell 50 cents, to $40.50.
Technology stocks, which posted sizable gains last week, struggled. Intel fell 36 cents, to $17.50, after Salomon Smith Barney reduced its estimates on the stock, citing soft demand. Applied Materials, which counts Intel as one of its biggest customers, slipped 28 cents, to $13.58.
Imclone rose 68 cents yesterday, to $8.02, after its founder and former chief executive, Samuel D. Waksal, pleaded not guilty to insider trading charges. Mr. Waksal also said he still thought that his company's cancer drug, Erbitux, had the potential to help thousands of patients.
Investors were also focused on retailers, many of whom are expected to report earnings today, including J. C. Penney and Wal-Mart Stores. Penney rose 12 cents, to $16.75, while Wal-Mart fell 79 cents, to $48.41. 
Investors are also expected to watch whether the companies required to certify their financial reports meet the Securities and Exchange Commission's deadline tomorrow. Among the companies certifying results yesterday were J. P. Morgan Chase and Kellogg, but that failed to lift their stock prices. J. P. Morgan Chase fell 89 cents, to $25.46, while Kellogg dropped 2 cents, to $34.70. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday as a decline in stocks bolstered demand for fixed-rate government securities.
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 4.21 percent, from 4.26 percent on Friday, while the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 13/32, to 101 9/32. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.07 percent from 5.11 percent; its price rose 22/32, to 104 18/32.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

Questions, Answers: A Look at the Dispute

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Q. Wasn't the union expected to set a strike date yesterday?
 A. Yes, but the union decided it could afford to give negotiators a few more days to try to reach a deal. 
 Q. If no agreement is forthcoming, when might the union take that step?
A. The executive board is scheduled to hold a conference call Friday, and that would be a likely time unless further progress is made.
Q. Have the players and the owners ever negotiated a new agreement without a work stoppage?
A. No. In the last three decades, the players have gone on strike five times and the owners have locked out the players three times.
Q. Why are the players considering a strike? Can't they keep negotiating through the rest of the season, the postseason and even the off-season?
A. The owners have pledged not to lock out the players or unilaterally implement new work rules through the end of the World Series, but not beyond. The players believe if they continue to play but don't have an agreement when the World Series ends, the clubs will declare an impasse in negotiations and implement a new labor system.
Q. Didn't the owners try to do that in 1994?
A. They did, but the National Labor Relations Board, at the union's urging, went to court, arguing that the clubs did not bargain in good faith and had not reached an impasse. The players returned to work when a federal judge granted the injunction the N.L.R.B. had sought and ordered the clubs to restore the rules that existed under the old agreement.
Q. What do the players want? 
A. As has been the case in the last few negotiations, the players have not asked for anything new of real significance. The players are trying to hold on to the substantial economic gains they have made since the advent of free agency in 1976.
Q. What do the owners want?
A. The owners want to share more of their local revenue to reduce the disparity between club payrolls (Yankees $137 million, Tampa Bay $33 million) and improve competitive balance. They also want to slow the escalation of player salaries.
Q. Why should the players have a say in how clubs share revenues?
A. With the wealthier clubs giving significant money to the less-wealthy clubs, salaries paid by the wealthier clubs could be affected. The owners recognize that revenue sharing is a mandatory subject for bargaining.
Q. What have the owners proposed as a revenue-sharing plan?
A. They initially wanted to share 50 percent of local revenue, less stadium rent, and allocate the money to recipients on an equal, or straight-pool, basis. They also wanted to have a $100 million discretionary fund so the commissioner could give additional money to certain clubs. 
Q. What have the players proposed?
A. The players offered to have the clubs share 22 1/2 percent of their local revenue but distribute it on a split-pool basis, that is, part of the fund would go to the teams with the lowest revenue and the rest would be divided equally. They also proposed a $40 million discretionary fund, though not necessarily under the control of the commissioner.
Q. Have positions changed since those initial proposals?
A. Neither side has talked publicly about what it has done, but the initial $70 million difference in the amount of revenue to be transferred among clubs has been whittled to something less than $50 million, and the clubs reduced the proposed discretionary fund to $85 million. 
Q. Are they close enough to make a deal on revenue sharing?
A. It's not a matter of being close enough. The players won't agree on revenue sharing without knowing where they stand on a luxury tax.
Q. What is the luxury tax?
A. The owners want to impose a tax on the highest payrolls as a way of inhibiting teams from spending so much on player salaries. They initially proposed a 50 percent tax on parts of payrolls exceeding $98 million but recently raised the threshold to $100 million and offered a reduced, phased-in tax rate on payrolls over $115 million.
Q. How do the players feel about the luxury tax?
A. They don't like it. They say the tax and the revenue-sharing contributions will leave the highest-spending teams with far less money to spend on players. A luxury tax did exist for part of the last agreement.
Q. Are there any other major issues separating the two sides?
A. The third issue the clubs have identified as vital is the amateur draft. Until now, the draft, held each June, has included high school and college players from the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Players from other countries, like the Dominican Republic, have been available to all clubs as free agents. The clubs want to extend the draft worldwide, covering those other players.
Q. Why do the owners want a worldwide draft?
A. Some clubs have been more aggressive than others in scouting players in Latin countries and in Asia, and officials want to put everyone on the same level. They also want to reduce the signing bonuses the best foreign players receive as free agents sought by several teams. When a player is drafted, he can negotiate and sign only with the team that drafts him.
Q. What is the players' position on a worldwide draft?
A. They have accepted the concept, but they have differences. One is the number of rounds in the draft. The players want 16, the clubs 38.
Q. What is happening with the clubs' desire to test players for steroids, other performance-enhancing drugs, supplements and so-called recreational drugs?
A. The union made a proposal on steroids testing that the clubs' negotiators liked, but the two sides disagree on some elements of testing. 
Q. If there is a strike, will it be a long one?
A. The only reason for the two sides to reach agreement in a matter of days if the players walk out would be if the owners were skeptical about the players' willingness to strike and had to see them do it before compromising on what they want.

HEADLINE: Preparing Petitions: It Irks the Lawyers, But Is It Lawyering? 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
Leo D. Wees is not a lawyer, but for $150 he used to help people in Boise, Idaho, fill out the forms to file for bankruptcy. Those who turned to Mr. Wees were by definition poor, but they considered his fee a bargain compared with what lawyers might have charged, and they were satisfied with his work.
 "He appears to be thorough and attentive to detail," Terry L. Myers, a bankruptcy judge, said of Mr. Wees, "and his work product shows it." 
 Judge Myers nonetheless fined Mr. Wees $1,000 for misleading customers into believing they were receiving legal advice and ordered him not to charge more than $60 for filling out routine bankruptcy forms. 
Judges and lawyers have always been wary of people who perform services often handled by lawyers, but a rapidly expanding cottage industry that helps people file papers in bankruptcy and divorce cases and other legal proceedings like preparing wills has drawn increasing attention from the bench and the bar.
In the last seven years, for example, Justice Department officials have filed almost 4,000 motions seeking to stop bankruptcy petition preparers or to reduce their fees.
Nevertheless, the current economic slowdown, combined with pending federal legislation that could make it more complicated and more expensive to file for bankruptcy, may lead more people to look for alternatives to lawyers.
Almost 1.5 million people filed for bankruptcy last year, and perhaps a quarter of them, or about 375,000, did not use lawyers.
Experts differ on whether the crackdown on petition preparers is a valuable consumer protection or a restraint of trade by a powerful monopoly.
Not surprisingly, the preparers -- who sell forms and typing services and are not allowed to give legal advice -- take the latter view.
"This is a fundamental turf war between bankruptcy lawyers and bankruptcy petition preparers," said Jason Searns, the general counsel of the biggest form-preparation company, We the People. "They're essentially trying to take us out of the business. This smacks of antitrust, monopoly and price-fixing."
Scholars say the crackdown arises from mixed motives.
"It's mostly a concern about competition, not a concern about quality," said David A. Skeel Jr., a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a history of bankruptcy law.
But federal officials say they are trying to protect the public.
Maureen A. Tighe, a Justice Department official in Los Angeles whose office has filed more than 2,000 actions against bankruptcy form preparers, said they were "a huge problem area in many parts of the country."
Some actions pursued by the office involved large sums of money and serious fraud, mainly involving foreclosures and eviction. But most concerned the scope of the preparers' work and how much they charged.
Ms. Tighe rejected the assertion that the government's actions protected a monopoly enjoyed by bankruptcy lawyers.
"We have no interest in protecting the bar," she said. "It's our job to protect the system."
Ms. Tighe said petition preparers were concentrated in the West, particularly in places with large immigrant populations. "It's a huge concern in California," she said.
We the People says it helped 20,000 people in 16 states file bankruptcies in the last year. The group's chairman, Ira Distenfield, said that in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the company is based, it handled a third of all divorces and more than half of all bankruptcy filings.
"We're kind of where H & R Block was 40 years ago," Mr. Searns said.
Paul J. Anfuso turned to We the People for help recently in filing his second bankruptcy. He had paid a lawyer $1,000 the first time, 10 years ago, when the bills he accumulated in supporting an extended family overwhelmed him. We the People charged him about $345.
The lawyer, Mr. Anfuso said, "probably did no more work than they did, for three times the cost."
"And," he said, "the lawyer told me I couldn't declare certain things that I later found out I could."
Mr. Anfuso, a nurse, filed for bankruptcy again when medical problems forced him to go on disability.
"I barely scraped up the money for them," he said, referring to the form-preparation company, which he called "very knowledgeable and very friendly."
"They didn't give you any legal advice," Mr. Anfuso said, "but they gave me all the resources I needed."
No one disputes that form preparers are cheaper than lawyers, who often charge $1,000 or more even for the simplest bankruptcy. Yet lawyers contend the form preparers charge too much for what they argue is, in essence, clerical work. They say that even a $200 fee implies that legal services are being provided.
"The goal is to make it unprofitable so they'll make me quit," said Mr. Wees, who says the judge's order limiting his fees has cost him $20,000 a year.
Deborah L. Rhode, a law professor at Stanford who is an expert in legal services, has criticized the legal system for not providing affordable services or allowing others to do so.
"In 'poor people's courts' that handle housing, bankruptcy, small claims and family matters, parties without lawyers are less the exception than the rule," Professor Rhode wrote in a law review article. "Almost all the scholarly experts and bar commissions that have studied the issue have recommended increased opportunities for nonlawyer assistance. Almost all the major rulings on the issue have ignored those recommendations."
There is evidence that paying for a lawyer may be a good investment. A report by a committee of the Los Angeles County Bar Association said, "Statistical and anecdotal data both indicate that unrepresented debtors' cases are dismissed at a greater rate than those cases of debtors who are represented by counsel."
It concluded, "A trained attorney is clearly always preferable."
If legislation to overhaul the bankruptcy system becomes law, bankruptcies will most likely become more expensive and less attractive to lawyers. Lawyers will, for instance, have to certify that they have investigated the accuracy of their clients' statements about their assets, debts, income and creditors, and lawyers will face penalties if the submissions turn out to be wrong.
Investigating such things costs money, which would drive legal fees higher. Some lawyers may decide that the consumer bankruptcy practice, which has never been particularly prestigious or lucrative, is not for them.
"People will have trouble finding a bankruptcy lawyer, or one they can afford," Professor Skeel said.
If enacted, the new federal law would not take effect for 180 days, giving debtors a window in which they may still file under the old system. The increase in filings that would probably take place in the short term and the greater complexity of the subsequent filings would further heighten tensions.
Last month, another bankruptcy judge in Boise, Jim D. Pappas, devoted a long decision to examining the assistance that Judith M. Scott, a We the People franchisee, gave to Kevin and Laura Doser. The Dosers' bankruptcy filing said they had $5,000 in assets and $67,000 in liabilities. They paid Ms. Scott $214.
Judge Pappas wrote, "Ms. Scott's work product seems very professional."
But he criticized Ms. Scott for providing her customers with a written overview of bankruptcy law prepared by a lawyer, saying that even referring a customer to a legal treatise amounted to the unauthorized practice of law.
He fined her $10 and ordered her to limit her fees in preparing bankruptcy petitions to $100.
Mr. Distenfield said that a 64-page opinion devoted to imposing a $10 fine showed a judicial attitude.
"It wasn't an opinion for the consumer but an opinion for his colleagues in the bankruptcy bar," Mr. Distenfield said. "The judge was saying: 'Don't worry. We're not going to slow these guys down. We're going to eradicate them.' "
All parties concerned agree that there is such a thing as the unauthorized practice of law and that it encompasses more than court appearances.
Steven Lubet, a law professor at Northwestern University who has advised We the People, said the difference between what form preparers and lawyers do was the difference between providing information and giving advice.
"People need to know that lawyers don't own the law," Professor Lubet said. "There's lots of room for nonlawyers to talk about the law."

HEADLINE: Preparing a Corps of Women For Corporate Responsibility 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill. 

 BODY:
Headhunters say it has been hard, ever since Enron, to find people willing to serve as corporate directors; no one wants to be shamed or sued for sleepwalking through the next meltdown.
 But hopeful directors-to-be, all of them eager to hone their corporate watchdog skills, recently packed an auditorium here at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University for a training program. The course, the first by Kellogg for women only, was overbooked, attracting executives from companies like Accenture, Household International, Sears, Microsoft and Merck. "It's fascinating when I hear people say they can't fill board positions," said Victoria H. Medvec, a Kellogg management professor and founder of the school's Center for Executive Women, which offers the director course. "I think there is a tremendous untapped pool." 
 Many of the participants said they had enrolled because they wanted to learn how to be nominated as directors. Others said they already had some feelers and needed to know how to separate the good opportunities from the disasters and dead ends. 
"It's hard to get onto a board," Ms. Medvec said, noting that these novices were not yet realistic candidates for Fortune 500 boards, "but it's really hard to get off."
Last summer, when Kellogg officials began planning a kind of boot camp for prospective directors, they did not foresee that a number of scandals might soon cast a spotlight on the boardroom. Concerned about the glacial pace at which women have entered corporate America's boardrooms, they wanted to offer seasoned businesswomen the final preparation and contacts to become board members, Ms. Medvec said. Only 11 percent of Fortune 1000 directors are women, according to Catalyst, a group that works to advance women in business.
In the months since the planning sessions, Sherron Watkins blew the whistle at Enron, Coleen Rowley disclosed botched counterterrorism work at the F.B.I., Cynthia Cooper made WorldCom confess to $3.8 billion worth of accounting fraud and a former European Commission chief accountant, Marta Andreasen, challenged the European Union's accounting system. 
No one at Kellogg's inaugural women directors' program was claiming that those examples suggested that women would make superior corporate watchdogs, but in the air was very much the sense that women may have something new and useful to offer in terms of corporate governance, now that they seem to stand a better chance of moving onto boards.
"It's hard to say this without having it sound like stereotyping," said Carol A. Wacker, a California management consultant who attended the course. "But there is a strong moral overtone in the questions the women are asking. Do women seek a higher plane?"
The participants wanted to know, for instance, where they were likeliest to find evidence of accounting fraud in corporate financial statements. They debated the right time to fire a failing chief executive. They asked how directors are compensated.
"I'm always embarrassed to talk about that," said Donald P. Jacobs, a Kellogg finance professor, whose presentation -- a corporate crisis simulation -- was interrupted by that question. Chief executives usually set directors' pay, he said, using comparative data from other corporations. 
"The problem is, everybody wants to be above average," he added. "It starts spiraling." Highly paid directors may then be too appreciative of the chief executive's largess to challenge him.
Other questions had to do with whether women are more risk averse than men (there was no consensus) and whether they are effective self-promoters (on that, there was agreement: women tend to sabotage themselves with excessive modesty). Some participants wondered whether, as new directors, they could use naivete to camouflage tough questions. (Perhaps, they were told, but not for very long.)
The women were also warned that the job had become more demanding. Boards used to meet, typically, four times a year, they were told, but now a six-meeting schedule is more common, and in the future there will probably be 10. Prospective directors without accounting backgrounds were advised to hire tutors. And no longer is it enough to read the "board book" of data that directors typically receive a week before each meeting.
"Just getting the board book and saying, 'O.K., we know everything,' is a thing of the past," Ms. Medvec said. 
A. Katrina Roche, who just stepped down as chief marketing officer of i2 Technologies, a Texas software company, said she wondered how many companies took advantage of federal disclosure regulations to bombard directors with more information than they could reasonably digest, burying unpleasant truths beneath an avalanche of data. 
She also expressed concern that as new directors, and as women, she and the others would have a hard time getting contrarian viewpoints across forcefully. She recalled one executive she worked with who claimed to be open-minded but barked back, "You got a better idea?" every time she questioned his plans. 
In cases like that, Ms. Medvec said, it is important to make sure the board has procedural rules for its meetings and sticks to them. She also recommended interviewing fellow directors privately, before the meetings, since private conversations can often elicit dissident opinions that do not come out in a group.
People tend to hear information that confirms their own ideas more clearly than they hear contrarian information, she said. 
"This is an individual tendency, but it gets magnified in groups," she said.
To make her point, Ms. Medvec taught from a case about an imaginary small business that owned a racecar. The car had a history of engine trouble, the company was losing money, a major sponsor was wavering on its commitment and an important race was coming up. The women broke into groups of three and were asked to evaluate data on the engine troubles to decide whether to enter the big race. Ms. Medvec played the role of mechanic, available to answer any questions. 
Most of the groups sketched decision trees -- graphic representations of probabilities -- and set about calculating probabilities. But the decision trees were not particularly useful because the figures were inconclusive. Cold weather appeared to be causing the engine trouble, but the data did not prove it. The women started debating the pros and cons of racing, going nowhere. After 20 minutes of this, Ms. Medvec reconvened and asked how each group had decided. The result was overwhelming; only a handful opted to race. 
"This is fascinating. I've never taught this case in a group of women before, and I've never seen this result," Ms. Medvec said. "I teach this case to thousands of executives, and I generally have 90 percent of the people racing."
Ms. Medvec then explained that the racecar data had been prepared to match the information available to Morton Thiokol and NASA officials on the day they made the fatal decision to launch the space shuttle Challenger in cold weather. That news gave the classroom's nonracing majority a few self-satisfying moments in which to identify with the Morton Thiokol scientists who had rightly warned against the launching. (The scientists were overruled; Morton Thiokol no longer exists.) 
But then Ms. Medvec pointed out that most of the women had made the right decision for the wrong reasons. Faced with inconclusive data, most had simply followed their instincts. Only a couple took Ms. Medvec up on her offer to provide more data, but those who did got a new set of numbers that settled clearly whether the engine failures were linked to temperature.
That tiny minority revealed one of the most important attributes of a director, now that investors want stringent boards, Ms. Medvec said: the ability to break ranks, to think of questions that do not occur to anyone else and have the self-confidence to ask them. 
"Having a diverse board is worthless unless you have ways to bring out that diversity," she said.

HEADLINE: AIRLINE SHOCK WAVES: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
U.S. May Be Recast as the Financier of Recovering Airlines

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
Until this week, the government board overseeing the bailout of the airline industry had acted like a bankruptcy court in miniature, requiring all applicants for financial aid to cut costs and wring major concessions from unions.
 Now, with the Chapter 11 filing of US Airways, which had applied for a $900 million loan guarantee to secure a $1 billion loan, the board takes on a new role as a potential financier of companies actually arising from bankruptcy. 
 In recent weeks, some aviation experts and bankruptcy consultants had privately urged the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, the government organization overseeing the bailout, at least to signal its approval of the bankruptcy filing in advance. They had noted that a Chapter 11 filing would make US Airways financially stronger and thus more capable of avoiding taxpayer losses. 
But a top official said today that the government did nothing to encourage the bankruptcy filing.
"The board did not play and would not play a role that would encourage a company to file for reorganization protection," Daniel Montgomery, the executive director of the board, said. "It is not the board's position to encourage a bankruptcy." However, he stressed that federal regulations explicitly permitted the board to provide financial assistance to companies arising from bankruptcy.
Still, the airline, the nation's sixth largest, was careful to notify the board beforehand that it would seek bankruptcy protection. And within hours of the carrier's bankruptcy filing on Sunday, the board issued a statement saying that its decision last month to grant conditional approval of the loan guarantee remained in effect. 
Mr. Montgomery said that the board would consider granting the loan guarantee as part of "exit financing" from the bankruptcy proceeding -- after the company presents a business plan to the court and its creditors, a process that will take many months. The board apparently decided not to take a formal position on bankruptcy because the Chapter 11 filing threatens to result in huge layoffs, as well as wipe out the investments of investors and some debt holders. The board has adopted a neutral approach toward bankruptcies.
But by offering the possibility of financial assistance after bankruptcy, the board could nonetheless be perceived as playing a vital role in the bankruptcy process that defines clear winners and losers. The potential winners include lenders like the Texas Pacific Group, which will be providing a new round of financing in exchange for a large interest in the company. The losers include the carrier's shareholders and its unions, which will now be forced to take another round of large cuts in pay and personnel.
While it is unusual for the government to play a significant role in most bankruptcy cases, experts said that it was well within the government's authority to play the role it will in this case -- agreeing to the plan that comes out of the bankruptcy proceeding -- because the board's main interest is in restoring the industry to financial health. Like the costly bailout of the savings and loan industry more than a decade ago, they say, when taxpayers are on the hook it is reasonable from a policy perspective to take necessary steps to minimize losses.
"If the board thinks that Chapter 11 or a particular kind of restructuring most adequately assures them that the loan will be repaid, then it is legitimate," said John Heimlich, director of economic and market research for the Air Transport Association, the airline industry's trade group. "This is a unique governmental body. No one debated that it was given broad discretion from the outset."
From the day it was created over the objections of the Bush administration, the stabilization board has struggled to identify and complete its delicate mission. It is supposed to help companies crippled by the decline in travel after the Sept. 11 attacks without giving aid to companies that have no chance of survival, that can find money elsewhere or that were struggling long before the attacks. But it has faced Congressional efforts to cut back its $10 billion program and intensive lobbying from some of the industry's healthier airlines that have sought to block loan guarantees to others and have argued that they could be hurt as their rivals are helped.
The board is headed by Edward M. Gramlich, a governor at the Federal Reserve, and is made up of Treasury Under Secretary Peter R. Fisher and Kirk Van Tine, general counsel of the Transportation Department. David M. Walker, the comptroller general, is a nonvoting member.
One previous applicant, America West, has successfully completed the application process, winning $380 million in loan guarantees for a $429 million loan. The board has denied applications from Vanguard Airlines and Frontier Flying Service.
Now, as a possible financier for carriers that have already gone through a formal Chapter 11 proceeding, officials say the Air Transportation Stabilization Board is hoping to better protect taxpayers from losses while it assists the industry. This lesson cannot be lost on United Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier, which is also considering seeking the shelter of a Federal bankruptcy court and has applied for a $1.8 billion guarantee for $2 billion in loans. But the effort of providing assistance after a bankruptcy filing may further discourage consolidation in an industry widely viewed as suffering from overcapacity. 
"Obviously, there is too much capacity in the industry," said Steven A. Morrison, an economics professor at Northeastern University who has written about the industry. "These bailouts may help to continue that and bring down other carriers or cause financial stress for otherwise healthy companies. So right now, we have each carrier cutting back 10 percent but maybe what you need is some carriers cutting back 100 percent."
Professor Morrison, while generally praising what he called the board's judicious decisions to grant some loan guarantees and deny others, questioned whether the government would be able to provide financing for a company with the same level of competence as the private sector.
"They just don't have the expertise," he said.

HEADLINE: LITTLE LEAGUE; 
Keeping the Pressure Off Harlem's Players

BYLINE:  By CHRIS BROUSSARD 

DATELINE: BRISTOL, Conn., Aug. 12 

 BODY:
Spencer White had a rough time Sunday night. He and his Harlem Little League teammates watched five rental movies, and three of them were horror flicks.
 "I'm scared of the dark," said White, a stocky 12-year-old. "And they've been trying to scare me with Freddy Krueger and Jason." 
 The laughter at White's expense is over, though. After all, the team does not want its starting catcher shaking in his spikes during the Mid-Atlantic Regional final Tuesday against Bethlehem, Pa.
"We picked five more movies today," said a smiling Alibay Barkley. "But we didn't pick any more scary ones."
The kids from Harlem have been quite a terror to their opponents in a run that has them one victory away from competing in the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa. They outscored their opponents by 105-26 on the way to winning the state title, and they have accumulated a 3-2 record in regional play. The league had never won so much as a district title in its previous 13 years of existence.
"I expect this to make our coaches kind of mad," White said, "but if we make it to Williamsport, I wouldn't really care if we won."
Actually, that's the type of thinking that Manager Morris McWilliams likes. McWilliams, who is managing the Harlem All-Stars for the fourth straight summer, says a change in coaching philosophy is one reason the team has had so much success.
"In the past, we have emphasized so much that 'We're in the tournament, we're in the tournament,' and the kids would come into the games so tight," said McWilliams, whose son, Julian, is the leadoff batter and second baseman. "This year, I made a conscious effort to pull away from that kind of approach and let them do what they normally do, and that's have fun. So it's been a laid-back approach and letting them do their thing and letting them play and really try to have as much fun as possible. And it's worked."
The 14 players have had a ball. Since winning the state championship with a perfect 10-0 record more than a week ago, they have stayed in the dormitories here at the A. Bartlett Giamatti Little League training complex. Besides baseball, their days have been filled with swimming, barbecueing, table tennis, basketball and those movies.
They have also gone to a water park, taken a tour of the nearby ESPN headquarters and become close with players from the opposing teams.
"The other day, I looked down into the stands along the third-base line, and there were the kids from Harlem and the kids from the Nottingham League in Hamilton Square, N.J., laughing and joking and passing things back and forth to one another," said Ron Saloman, the chief announcer for the Eastern Regional tournament. "It's great when that happens. It's great that Little League baseball gives kids that type of opportunity."
When a team advances this far, it also gives it the opportunity to play on television. The players from Harlem have watched countless replays of their state championship game, which was shown on the YES Network. The game Tuesday will be broadcast live on ESPN2.
"Being on TV," Javier Lopez said. "That's been the best part of all."
Lopez and Barkley are the ace pitchers of McWilliams's staff, and they are also tied with Jorge Lopez, Javier's twin brother, for the team lead in home runs with four in the all-star club's 15 games.
First-year participants in the Harlem league, Javier and Jorge are key reasons for the team's success. They give their 18-year-old brother, Omar, credit for their skill in the game. Their cousin Jeremy, a shortstop, is also on the team.
Six of the players (Barkley, White, McWilliams, Andrew Diaz, Fernando Frias and Dominque Brown-Jiles) have played together on Harlem's postseason all-star teams for four years, since they were 9 years old. Cody Booth, David Butler, Joshua Diaz (no relation to Andrew), Peter Kidd and Ralph Rodriguez round out the roster.
The team is a mix of African-American and Latino players.
"We're split right down the middle," Morris McWilliams said. "Seven of each."
Like most Little Leaguers, many of the Harlem players dream of playing in the major leagues. Barkley and Javier Lopez want to play for the Yankees, and in order to concentrate on baseball, they don't spend much time playing other sports.
"Basketball is real popular where I live," Barkley said. "But I don't like it."
Though Barkley claims to have been playing baseball since he was 3 years old, he says he does not come from a baseball family. The only relative he knows who played baseball is his grandfather, who played "down in the fields of South Carolina."
White plays running back and cornerback in football, which he calls his best sport. And while he hopes to be a professional athlete of some sort, he is not blinded by his dream or even the success he is currently enjoying.
"I want to be a math teacher," White said. "Either math or something to do with money, like economics. I would like to play in the pros, but I'm not setting my career on that."
He is, however, banking on a trip to Williamsport.

HEADLINE: What a Good Marriage Can't Do 

BYLINE:  By Frank Furstenberg; Frank Furstenberg is a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and author of the forthcoming "Destinies of the Disadvantaged: The Life Course of Teenage Mothers and Their Children."

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
President Bush and Congress appear headed for a battle over marriage. Before it left for recess, the Senate approved $100 million, a third less than the president had proposed, for programs that promote marriage. The issue is sure to be revisited in the fall, but unfortunately the terms of the debate are skewed: people don't need to be convinced of the value of marriage so much as they need support to make it work.
 Many social scientists are skeptical about the feasibility -- or even the necessity -- of a government campaign to rehabilitate the institution of marriage. The problems that Americans are having with marriage are hardly universal. Research shows that college graduates are just as likely to get and stay married as they were several decades ago. Opting out of marriage has increased only among those who did not graduate from college. 
 These findings are consistent with what I've learned from following several hundred teenage mothers and their children in Baltimore for the past 30 years. Over half of the mostly black and poor women in the study married the father of their child. But their efforts to build stable families turned out poorly: four out of five of these marriages dissolved over the next decade and a half. Women who married men who were not the fathers of their children fared even worse.
More to the point, those who married fared no better than those who did not in several areas: staying off welfare, returning to school and finding stable, well-paying employment in the decades after their first child was born. Their children were not significantly better off in the long run regardless of whether they married.
Of course, none of this is to say that marriage is not a wonderful institution. When it works, it brings great benefits to adults and their children. When it is mired in conflict and disaffection, however, or destabilized by economic uncertainty, it leads to problems quite similar to those experienced by remarried couples, unmarried couples and single parents. 
We don't need government programs to convince people like the mothers in the Baltimore study that marriage is good for them. The children of the teenage mothers in the Baltimore study were far more reluctant to marry at younger ages, though most say they do want to get married someday. Still, many of these women are wary of entering matrimony until they find a man who offers them some prospect of economic support and won't "act like another child," as one woman explained to me. These children have higher expectations of marriage than did their mothers. They watched their parents try and fail, and they don't want to repeat their mistakes.
What will it take for them to feel confident that they won't? Certainly, more than weekend workshops telling them that marriage will make them happier and healthier. They know that lack of commitment is not the reason most marriages don't work. Their parents were very committed, but they faced huge problems supporting their children.
If the Bush administration wants to help women like these, it should reconsider its proposal and get down to the hard work of creating the economic and social conditions that will support marriage for the less advantaged: child care subsidies, paid parental leaves, cheaper health insurance for low-income families and other programs to help support them.
It's true that money alone will not bring couples into marriage. Men and women must develop better skills to deal with the gender divide that has developed, especially in low-income families. Women simply won't put up with carrying more than their fair share at home when they also work all day. In this regard, the Bush proposal may have an impact. Family counseling and marriage workshops can help couples better understand each other and improve their chances for success. But most couples can't acquire these skills without a sustained and costly effort.
Most social scientists believe that counseling can be helpful and even necessary, but it is hardly sufficient. If the Bush administration truly wants to promote marriage, it should start by providing tangible financial assistance to families that need it.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Rallying the Faithful Against 'Economic Apartheid'

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
JONATHAN ROSEN is making you insanely curious about his age. He looks like a kid, but he's talking full throttle about life as a people-power organizer a decade ago, as well as about the forces that led him to create the New York Unemployment Project after Sept. 11.
 Mr. Rosen is the director of the project, which has been giving grief to Gov. George E. Pataki, shrieking with placards outside the governor's Manhattan campaign headquarters, demanding an extension of unemployment benefits until the economy recovers. So far, to no avail. 
 But this is just the beginning, Mr. Rosen rails, sipping a Diet Coke and vowing more sorties from his shock troops to improve the lot of the jobless.
"We live among so much poverty in this city, and everyone should be uncomfortable," he says, smacking a jean-clad leg (he does this a lot) as he perches on a bright purple swivel chair in the project's scruffy office near Canal Street. "It's economic apartheid and politicians should be uncomfortable, and so should regular people. Any policymaker of any party who doesn't support the unemployed we are going to target."
Mr. Rosen is tall, with cropped brown hair, long sideburns and an easy smile. On the phone a few days before, he sounded startled by a request to discuss him. Yet, here he is, chatting confidently as if the revolution were coming any day now.
As he talks this morning, he takes a turkey wrap sandwich from a backpack, gobbling it down and brushing aside crumbs from his mouth. He'll be working until 9 or 10 p.m., as he does most days. His mountain bike, which he rides in from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, leans in a corner.
So how old is this guy? Even his financial backers don't know for sure. Among them is the Rockefeller Foundation. The organization has a $300,000 budget, enough to pay for five staff members, including himself.
O.K. He's 23.
"I don't advertise it," he says, grinning mischievously.
Mr. Rosen, who is on leave from his second year at New York University Law School, runs a group of 100 active members, though 1,000 people have visited the office, he says. Even members didn't know his age until recently.
His cover was blown when members were debriefing after a press conference with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and a state assemblywoman from Queens, Catherine T. Nolan, jokingly asked when he would turn 24.
"My age was outed!" he says in mock outrage. "It was in front of everybody. I wanted to hide under a table."
He is used to this kind of ribbing.
Mr. Rosen has crusaded for social justice since he was a high school freshman in Cherry Hill, N.J. The son of a federal magistrate judge and a special education teacher, he says they have bedrock principles: always brush your teeth, always take a shower and never, ever cross a picket line.
At 13, Mr. Rosen was galvanizing schoolmates to help build housing in Camden under a community program begun by a radical Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Michael Doyle.
At 14, he was trying to shake loose a corrupt Democratic Party machine by electing a parent as an independent to the Camden school board. "Vota para Jose Delgado, hoy!" he yelps, recalling the campaign slogan. His candidate won by six votes.
The next year, Mr. Rosen ran a school board campaign to thwart his own school district from breaking the janitors' union. Three progressive candidates were elected after he helped start the state's first political action committee for people under 21 and raised $10,000.
At Rutgers University, he spent more time rallying students than studying political science and history. He was the founding director of the New Jersey Higher Education Alliance. Seeing that maintaining crumbling university buildings drove up tuition costs, his alliance pushed a capital spending program to ease pressure on the university's budget. The $550 million program was signed into law in 1999.
"We did it," he says, pumping his fist in the air.
YES, Mr. Rosen has other interests besides raising Cain. He beams, mentioning his new girlfriend, a legal assistant he met in the office building. He likes to read fiction. But he quickly returns the conversation to the project.
"We don't speak for unemployed people," he says. "Our job is to organize the unemployed themselves and build power for them." He leaps up to explain the scribbles on the bulletin boards about outreach plans and mass demonstration goals.
The project grew out of a conversation he had with friends last summer over how laid-off hotel and garment industry workers were headed into poverty, ignored in New York's economy.
"Politicians ignore them because they can," he says. "And it's a depressing experience. You're alone and you feel like it's your fault. It's one of the most disempowering experiences. Very few people want to rally around it."
After Sept. 11, though, unemployment became more visible. He drafted law school pals to canvass the twin towers job fairs for people incensed by their predicament.
Mr. Rosen scans through notes he jotted down after the group's organizing meeting last December. Survival, eviction, food and money to live were among the themes. A huge priority became the extension of unemployment benefits, though the group's focus has broadened to include other issues, like job training.
"We're going to be here for the long haul, because unemployment is going to be here for the long haul."

HEADLINE: The Cheney Factor 

 BODY:
As President Bush and his economic team interrupt their vacations today to gather in Texas for an economic conference, Vice President Dick Cheney may have trouble playing his customary role as elder statesman. The problem is not primarily Mr. Cheney's weak heart, though that has impeded him, or his disappearances to unidentified secure locations, which have been the subject of much mirth on late-night television shows. Mr. Cheney's big problem is that he's associated with a company, Halliburton, that is under investigation for possibly improper accounting practices. That makes him less than the ideal front man for an administration trying to restore confidence in a sputtering economy spooked by corporate malfeasance. 
 Mr. Cheney has rationed his public appearances of late, showing up mostly at lobbying sessions on Capitol Hill or Republican fund-raisers. When he takes questions from the public on Iraq or Halliburton, the troubled energy services company he once headed, Mr. Cheney demurs. He may be an insider asset to Mr. Bush, but outside his value is tipping from positive to negative. 
 On the economic issues to be discussed today, Mr. Cheney brings formidable experience and expertise. He served as President Gerald Ford's chief of staff, working closely with two other staffers who, like him, went to positions of greater prominence: Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Before the wave of corporate scandals, Mr. Cheney might have been the reassuring figure the markets are looking for in this administration. But he has been severely hampered in recent weeks by a reticence to talk about his own record at Halliburton. Last week at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, he blandly referred questions about the S.E.C. investigation to the company's Web site -- hardly the forthright discussion the public deserves.
Mr. Cheney says his service as vice president is the most rewarding experience of his professional life and he would be happy to run for a second term if Mr. Bush wishes. But Mr. Cheney does not serve Mr. Bush well by dodging questions about Halliburton, or repeatedly declining to identify the people who were consulted by his energy task force last year. At a moment when Americans are looking to the government to help remedy the nation's economic ills, Mr. Cheney looks more like part of the problem than the solution.

HEADLINE: Clueless In Crawford 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Today, in its Waco economic forum, the Bush administration will try to convince the country that everything is under control -- that the economy is mending, that "shady" business practices are no longer a problem. To that end a carefully chosen audience will listen to speeches by administration officials and selected models of corporate probity. Among the speakers announced last week was John T. Chambers, C.E.O. of Cisco Systems.
 They really don't get it, do they? One could hardly have picked a better example of what's wrong with the administration's whole approach. 
 Two years ago Cisco was the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion. Mr. Chambers was among the world's best-paid executives, receiving $157 million in 2000. Cisco was perceived as a company that combined new-economy glitz with old-fashioned solidity, that was on the cutting edge but made real products and earned real profits.
In short, people thought about Cisco the same way they thought about Enron.
That's not a strained comparison. Even when Cisco was riding high, an analysis in Barron's dubbed it the "New Economy Creative Accounting Exemplar." The company's specialty was using its own overvalued stock as currency -- paying its employees with stock options, acquiring other companies by issuing more stock. Thanks to loopholes in the accounting rules -- loopholes defended with intense lobbying -- these transactions allowed executives to progressively dilute the stake of their original shareholders, without ever declaring this dilution as a business cost. 
The resulting illusion of profitability sustained the stock price, making more questionable deals possible. Some analysts flatly called Cisco a pyramid scheme.
When Enron's financial house of cards collapsed, $80 billion of market value vanished. Cisco hasn't collapsed, but its market capitalization has fallen by more than $400 billion. Nobody from Cisco management -- ranked No. 13 in Fortune's "greedy bunch" -- has been arrested. But then neither has anyone from Enron. 
Some cynics attribute the continuing absence of Enron indictments to the Bush family's loyalty code. But the alternative explanation is both innocent and chilling: Enron executives may have deluded and defrauded their shareholders without actually breaking the law. What Cisco did was definitely legal. 
Since Enron collapsed, administration officials have insisted that no new laws are needed to reform corporate America, only enforcement of existing laws. The administration endorsed a bill imposing modest reforms in accounting only after doing everything it could to block it. And as soon as the bill was passed, the administration began issuing "guidance" to federal prosecutors that will undermine the law's intent on whistle-blower protection, document shredding and more. Officials clearly still think the old law was good enough.
But the Cisco story, like the absence of Enron indictments, demonstrates just how much self-enrichment corporate insiders can get away with while staying within the letter of the law. The handful of executives who have been arrested aren't masterminds -- on the contrary, given the legal ways other executives got rich while their stockholders lost billions, the perp-walkers should be featured on a special corporate edition of "America's Dumbest Criminals."
Now the administration is sounding the all clear -- we've passed a bill, we've arrested five people, it's all over. But the work of reconstructing corporate America has barely begun.
The next step, surely, is dealing with stock options. It's not just that companies overstate their profits by failing to count options as an expense. Huge grants of options also give executives an incentive to do whatever it takes to produce a short-term bump in the stock price -- if one year of illusory success can net you $157 million, who cares what happens later? 
Byron Wien of Morgan Stanley recently told a group of security analysts that "stock options malevolence" is at the root of corporate scandal, and that "anyone who says that stock options aren't an expense destroys his credibility on all other issues." Well, Mr. Chambers's company still refuses to count stock options as an expense. The administration has said that it opposes rules that would require Cisco to change its accounting, and the choice of Mr. Chambers as a speaker seems to be a reaffirmation of that position.
As I said, they just don't get it.

HEADLINE: Confluence of Events 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
The economy and the politics surrounding it are at critical junctures, and the next few days could say a lot about where both are heading.
 In an unusual confluence of policy, politics and business, President Bush, Alan Greenspan and the chief executives of the nation's largest corporations will all be in the spotlight this week, some more willingly than others, and the ways in which they address the weakening economy could have significant implications for workers, investors and the two political parties. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve will meet to debate whether the recovery has faltered so badly that further interest rate cuts might be necessary, if not immediately then later in the year. 
As the Fed deliberates behind closed doors, Mr. Bush will be the host of a carefully staged economic conference in Texas, part of his effort to insulate himself and his party from the economy's woes and distance himself from corporate malfeasance. Democrats intend to keep making Mr. Bush's economic management an issue, seeing a rare opportunity to dent his poll numbers and gain an advantage heading into the Congressional elections in November.
Then, by the end of the day Wednesday, the chief executives and chief financial officers of the 947 largest public corporations must file documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission attesting to the accuracy of their financial statements, a new requirement that could lead to more disclosures of aggressive accounting and cooked books.
Those three strands are likely to become interwoven with others, from the gyrating stock market to the financial strains on the airline industry and the economic crisis in much of South America -- never mind the looming possibility of war with Iraq, the re-emergence of federal budget deficits and rising household debt.
"I cannot recall going through a period with this much uncertainty," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo & Company. 
Most investor attention this week will be on the Fed. The central bank's assessment of the economic outlook and its corresponding stance on interest rates will no doubt have an immediate effect on the markets.
While some economists and investors say the Fed will cut rates, the consensus on Wall Street is that the central bank will not take any formal action on Tuesday. 
Instead, economists said, the Fed is likely to signal concern about the durability of the recovery in the statement it issues at the conclusion of the meeting, but will leave interest rates alone for now while making clear that it will consider rate cuts this fall should the economy and the stock market continue to stumble.
Wall Street is likely to be on edge anyway, as investors wait to see whether more companies restate their earnings before their top executives attest personally to their accuracy. A rash of earnings restatements could further diminish investor confidence. Should most chief executives sign off on their books without changes, it could help clear away lingering concern among investors that more bad surprises are buried in corporate financial statements.
With so much else going on, Mr. Bush's economic conference is at risk of being overshadowed. 
White House officials continued today to walk a line between acknowledging the economic unease and offering reassurances.
Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman, cited an array of upbeat indicators, including strong productivity growth, low inflation, rising wages and low interest rates. But he added that Mr. Bush would not be satisfied "until every American who wants a job can find a job."
The administration also made clear that it did not intend to use the conference to propose policy initiatives, but instead to continue selling more or less the same agenda Mr. Bush has held to since he began running for president in 1999.
In some ways, Mr. Bush may be constrained by the politics of corporate wrongdoing from offering some of the traditional Republican remedies for a bad economy and a nervous stock market, beyond those he laid out long ago. He has shown no interest in cutting capital gains tax rates for investors. He has not proposed any new corporate tax breaks. 
Far from talking about deregulating business, a traditional Republican agenda, he was forced to embrace one of the biggest pieces of new regulation in years, the corporate governance bill that emerged from Congress last month with broad bipartisan support.
"They dare not take anything out of the old Republican arsenal," said Marshall Wittmann, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group. "Bush has been a fairly adept political cross-dresser, yet this crisis has exposed his political Achilles' heel, which is his cozy relationship with corporate power."
Democrats are eager to exploit that vulnerability by keeping the economy and corporate wrongdoing front and center. They are also shedding their reticence about calling for rolling back or repealing those parts of Mr. Bush's 10-year tax cut that benefit only the wealthiest Americans.
"There is a growing sense that a tax cut for the top 2 percent, or a very narrow slice, will not provide the kind of economic stimulus we need and will certainly preclude us from dealing with an agenda that most people would buy into," said Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey.
Some analysts said that political battles over the economy were all but inevitable, but that they were pulling attention away from the most important goal for the economy: restoring confidence among consumers, investors and businesses.
"If the politicians start lobbing grenades at each other, that's going to hurt confidence, not help confidence," Mr. Sohn said. "It would be much better if they went home and took a vacation for the rest of August."

HEADLINE: AIRLINE SHOCK WAVES: MARKET PLACE; 
Texas Pacific Hopes to Revive Another Airline

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
The airline industry's rescue squad is at work again.
 The Texas Pacific Group, the private equity firm that took Continental Airlines and America West out of bankruptcy nearly a decade ago, is putting its money behind US Airways. Led by David Bonderman, a former lieutenant of the investor Robert Bass, the firm considers the airline industry deeply cyclical and aims to ride the good times and exit before another slump. 
 Credit Suisse First Boston and Bank of America, along with Texas Pacific, have put up a total of $500 million in financing to help keep the airline operating as it reorganizes under the protection of the bankruptcy court. Texas Pacific has also agreed to buy $200 million worth of stock in US Airways when -- and if -- it emerges from bankruptcy, giving it a 38 percent stake in the airline and 5 of the 13 seats on its board. 
Investors in Texas Pacific's funds have done well over the years, though the firm declines to provide its rate of return. Its investment in Oxford Health Plans in the early 1990's looked as if it was going under before the medical insurer's results and its stock sharply rebounded. The firm recently sold its remaining Oxford shares, doubling its money.
Another winner was Ducati Motor, the Italian motorcycle company.
The firm's $560 million investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, has been a loser so far. For its last fiscal year, J. Crew posted a loss of $11 million. Texas Pacific has lost money on ZiLog Inc., a semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker, which also filed for bankruptcy. 
Mr. Bonderman has a formula for ventures in the airline business. He becomes involved as part of a bankruptcy process at a time when the companies are renegotiating their debt, including the plane lease contracts, bringing the cost of the fleet often below that of most competitors. Negotiating with significantly weakened unions, he sharply cuts the salaries of pilots and other union members. As the economy picks up, the airline's profits rise. Then Texas Pacific begins to cash out.
Texas Pacific's partners followed that strategy when they invested $450 million in equity and debt in Continental in 1993. A decade later, the partners made 11 times their equity investment in Continental, which nearly filed for bankruptcy a second time soon after they became involved, causing the partners at Texas Pacific to replace management.
The partners invested $267 million in America West in 1994. That venture produced three times their equity investment of $55 million.
"Airline investing is a lot about cycles," said James G. Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific. "At the bottom of the cycle, you have a better opportunity to fix an airline.
"We like contrarian, complicated situations," he added.
With $8 billion under management, Texas Pacific also has investments in Ryanair, a low-cost carrier based in Dublin; the AerFi Group (formerly known as the GPA Group), an aircraft leasing company; and Hotwire, an online travel reservation Web site. In March, the firm announced the purchase of Gate Gourmet, the catering business of the Swissair Group.
The firm is not currently considering any other investments in the United States airline industry, a spokesman said yesterday. 
The stake in US Airways will be completed only after due diligence is successfully completed, and other investors could outbid Texas Pacific for the equity investment. 
For Texas Pacific, which says it looks for airlines with high costs and good management, it is a comfortable relationship. David N. Siegel, the chief executive of US Airways, was an executive at Continental when Texas Pacific's partners stepped in there, said Richard P. Schifter, a partner at Texas Pacific.
The reorganization of US Airways should prove relatively uncomplicated in light of recent bankruptcies like WorldCom and Enron, Mr. Schifter said. "This is much more clear cut."
The debt of US Airways consists mainly of aircraft lease financing, and creditors will receive whatever the market dictates those leases to be worth, Mr. Schifter said. At WorldCom, there are billions of dollars in unsecured debts and creditors will be forced to negotiate with one another over their claims.
Airline turnarounds can be a risky proposition, though. Carl C. Icahn, the New York financier acquired control in 1985 of Trans World Airlines and struggled for years to revive the airline. It ended up filing for bankruptcy three times -- once under Mr. Icahn's watch -- before being acquired by the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, as part of a reorganization last year.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 14, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column in Business Day yesterday, about the Texas Pacific Group, which is investing in US Airways, referred imprecisely to its goals. While it has endorsed concessions from unions in some earlier deals, Texas Pacific is not seeking concessions beyond those already being negotiated for US Airways.
The column also misstated Texas Pacific's investment in America West Airlines. It was $40 million, not $55 million. The column referred incorrectly to the status of the company's investment in AerFi Group; it has sold its stake.

HEADLINE: A Jail Becomes a Shelter, and Maybe a Mayor's Albatross 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did not create the current homelessness crisis. But his management of it may be one of the most crucial tests of his mayoralty so far.
 When it comes to the pressing social policy issues, Mr. Bloomberg has tried to position his administration as an extension of the Giuliani administration, swathed in a velvet glove. 
 He would remain tough on crime, and continue to push people to get off welfare, yet be generous with social services. He would not tolerate homeless people in the streets, but neither would he brook dangerous shelters or a lack of beds for people to sleep in.
On Sunday, the Bloomberg administration reopened an old jail in the Bronx as a temporary shelter for homeless families, who have been crowding the city's Emergency Assistance Unit in record numbers over the last year.
The move was sought by the commissioner for the Department of Homeless Services to stem the number of families sleeping on the floor of the unit, while she seeks a quick increase in the number of apartments in the city's housing projects.
"This is definitely a very important issue for him," said Edmund J. McMahon Jr., a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research and policy center. "So much of what he seems to be endeavoring to do is keep alive the issues of the quality of life, which improved for many New Yorkers over the last eight years. And he's sensitive to being perceived as being in any way the cause of the reversal of those improvements."
The situation is all the more difficult, Mr. McMahon said, because the increase in homelessness is driven in large part by "children who are perceived as not gaming the system but rather down on their luck, which is different from a man sleeping on the steps of a church."
Indeed, the specter of children sleeping on prison cots, just beyond a wall of razor wire and among strangers -- a week after a 16-year-old with a history of mental illness killed himself in a Harlem shelter -- underscores how few good solutions there are to the city's homeless problem. 
In sending homeless families to a barracks-style shelter in the jail, the mayor has adopted an approach that previous administrations thought was a vestige of the past.
Legislation passed in the early 1990's prohibited the city from using such shelters for families. And the approach quickly came under criticism yesterday. Steve Banks, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society and a frequent critic of the city's homeless policy, said, "Even in the darkest days of the last administration, when there were many draconian things that were proposed and some implemented, the idea of putting children in a prison was never, never an issue."
But Mr. Bloomberg saw no other options. His decision was driven largely by the untenable situation of scores of families sleeping on the floor of the Emergency Assistance Unit, which he visited on Sunday. Carmen Garcia, 37, an unemployed security guard who has slept on the floor for the past week with her four children and her husband, Richard Vazquez, 36, described a chaotic and miserable scene. "I never saw anything like it in my life: babies lying on the floor, even newborns," she said. "We filled out the papers. They told us to wait and we waited."
While in the 1980's homeless adults could be found sleeping over steaming manhole covers on every other block, families drive the city's current homelessness problem. On Sunday night alone, a record 8,458 families received shelter from the Department of Homeless Services.
Advocates for the homeless cite a variety of reasons for the rapid increase in homeless families, among them stagnant wages in some low-paying jobs and rising rental prices.
But one large factor appears to be an enormous slowdown in housing construction in recent years, a problem that stands to hinder an ambitious plan by the Bloomberg administration to move more people out of the shelter system and into permanent housing.
The city's housing production fell to about 83,000 units during the 1990's from 360,000 during the 1960's, said Joseph Weisbord, the staff director for Housing First!, an education group. In addition, the city's population has been increasing, and the vacancy rate is hovering just over 3 percent, the lowest level in decades.
The Bloomberg administration recently presented a plan to move more people out of the shelter system by offering more federal vouchers -- called Section 8 -- to help pay for housing, and said that it would assign 2,000 public housing apartments to homeless families over the next year, a large chunk of them in the next two months.
But with a lack of available inexpensive housing and a reluctance by landlords to accept the federal vouchers, it will take months, if not years, for the current plan to be successful. The need for a fast solution for scores of homeless families came in the form of the old jail.
The commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services, Linda I. Gibbs, was in danger of being found in contempt of court, at the behest of the Legal Aid Society, for permitting families to sleep in the Emergency Assistance Unit. Ms. Gibbs said yesterday that she expected other solutions -- like the former jail, which will be used for only a short time -- to surface under this administration. 
"I feel absolutely assured that commissioners will be working together in thoughtful ways that will not end with this venture," Ms. Gibbs said.
Mr. Bloomberg yesterday defended his decision to use the old jail, which he also visited over the weekend. He said of it, "There is no questions that it is infinitely better," and added, "Linda Gibbs, who is probably one of the best commissioners that I have, has been working day and night seven days a week in spite of personal attacks on her to do what is right for the people of this city."
Gail B. Nayowith, executive director of the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, and others said yesterday that the most crucial thing for the city to do now is to re-examine how families enter the system, to stop some of the administrative backup from the beginning of the process.
"When the choice is between putting the commissioner in jail and putting kids in jail," she said, "obviously these are really lousy choices."

HEADLINE: Handful of Corporate Raiders Transform Russia's Economy 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: KORYAZHMA, Russia, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Deep in the pine forest of the Russian north, a battle is being fought over the shape of a Russian economy increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few tycoons. 
 In an action giving new meaning to the concept of a hostile takeover, corporate raiders employed by one of Russia's most powerful businessmen have put a large pulp and paper mill -- quite literally -- under siege. A brigade of the tycoon's private security guards lies in wait, ready to take the mill, 575 miles northeast of Moscow. 
 The mill's current owner, a smaller company, has barricaded factory territory with buses, train cars and guards of its own. It refused to yield last week when court bailiffs drove up with orders to install a new chairman. 
The scene is more than just a fine piece of Russian corporate theater. These are the front lines of a phenomenon that has transformed the economy in the last three years. A handful of large business groups have been moving through systematically, buying up entire industries. 
Using their financial might and political connections, the groups have swallowed the coal industry, steel, car manufacturing, aluminum, and now timber. One result has been a concentration of Russia's wealth: just eight business groups control 85 percent of revenue from Russia's 64 biggest private companies, according to a recent report by Peter Boone and Denis Rodionov, economists at the Moscow-based subsidiary of UBS Warburg, a Swiss investment bank. 
As strange as it may seem in economic terms, this is progress. Unlike the oligarchs of the era of Boris N. Yeltsin, who had political influence but not the same kind of economic sway, these groups have begun reshaping the rusting hulk of the Soviet economy, in ruins after a decade of looting and neglect. They pay taxes and invest. Some are seeking to entwine their companies with the West.
Tycoons themselves often compare their experience to J. P. Morgan's organization of trusts in early 20th-century America, when financial plotters used aggressive takeover tactics and malleable state legislatures to form giant monopolies like U.S. Steel, and began obeying the rules only after they established control.
But serious questions remain about whether the tycoons -- who made their fortunes riding roughshod over Russia's weak legal system -- will be willing to give up the heavy-handed ways that propelled them to the top, and abide by equal rules for all.
"There is much manipulation in the courts and law enforcement," said Grigory A. Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko political party. "It is a kind of corporate, partly criminal system -- a legal marriage between business and power."
The standoff at the pulp and paper mill is emblematic of that marriage. It began this month, after Oleg V. Deripaska, at 34 one of Russia's biggest business tycoons, plucked away legal control of the mill in an elaborate legal maneuver -- a takeover tactic he had perfected in the last three years of piecing together a vast business empire.
This time, the victim, a Russian company called Ilim Pulp Enterprises, refused to concede defeat. 
The choreographed dance that is this takeover began in a Siberian region five time zones east of the paper mill, where a hitherto unknown individual with just 20 shares in the mill and a baffling corporate consciousness filed suit in a local court charging that Ilim Pulp had not complied with all the conditions of its 1994 privatization.
Before Ilim even knew about the court case (Mr. Deripaska's advisers said Ilim had been notified by mail), the Siberian court confiscated two-thirds of the mill's stock and returned it to the far-off St. Petersburg branch of the state property committee, which promptly sold the stock to Mr. Deripaska.
"At first, I thought it was a joke," said Frank Graves, a Canadian who was hired in April as the chief operating officer of Ilim Pulp. "But then I realized we had a serious problem. It's not that the bully wants to take our ball. He wants the whole bloody playground."
Mr. Deripaska, who owns several playgrounds already -- three-quarters of Russia's aluminum industry and a large slice of car manufacturing -- was expecting to get it. But Ilim fought back with methods Mr. Deripaska probably recognized: The mill managers enlisted Koryazhma's mayor, prosecutor and court bailiffs to defend it. Mr. Deripaska's cohorts accuse the managers of paying them off.
It is unlikely that any shots will be fired over the barricades at Koryazhma. Times have changed since the early turbulent years of Russian capitalism, when big business relied on violence to eliminate rivals. For instance, the aluminum industry, where Mr. Deripaska made his first fortune, was torn by contract killings in the mid-1990's as different groups fought for control. (Indeed, Mr. Deripaska, who is married to Boris N. Yeltsin's step-granddaughter, has been refused a visa to the United States, apparently because of his early unsavory connections.)
The real casualty is Russia's legal system, already deeply scarred from the bare-knuckled tactics of the last decade. President Vladimir V. Putin's reformers have been rewriting laws to strengthen it: just last week, a new Arbitrage Procedural Code took effect, prohibiting the use of civil suits in corporate disputes like Koryazhma. 
But for the changes to work, tycoons have to be willing to moderate their methods as they have adapted to new business reality, Mr. Yavlinsky said.
The new tycoons differ both from the state monoliths of Soviet times, when the state owned everything from oil companies to grocery stores, and the oligarchs of the Yeltsin era. Then, when the state began selling its crown jewels in the mid-1990's, a handful of bankers amassed fortunes in property.
But for all their bravado, their access to the halls of power and their control of the media, the oligarchs' economic influence then did not reach much further than oil and metals.
Several of the bankers were destroyed in the collapse of the ruble in 1998. Still others were banished two years later, when Mr. Putin was elected president, and their political connections to Mr. Yeltsin proved unpalatable. 
The handful that survived have now quietly extended their reach to the far ends of the economy. They were joined by several newcomers, like the gruff, lanky Mr. Deripaska, who at the tender age of 26 was already director of a large aluminum plant in Siberia.
A key question will be how Mr. Putin, who has been doing some consolidation of his own in politics and the media, chooses to coexist with the business groups.
The tycoons themselves say there has been tension. Their existence "makes politicians uncomfortable," said Mikhail M. Fridman, 38, chairman of the board of Alfa Group, whose holdings include oil, retail and a mobile phone company. "Business groups have many levers of influence. I don't think Mr. Putin likes this."
But others, like Mr. Yavlinsky, say the president's relationship with big business looks friendly.
"Mr. Putin is a representative of the business groups," he said.
As for Mr. Putin, he once promised to liquidate the oligarchs as a class. Yet many have gone on to build large empires in the economy. He banished them from government where they used to dictate policy under Mr. Yeltsin, but they continue to use their might to influence poorly paid bureaucrats and judges in Russia's provinces.
All this runs counter to Mr. Putin's pledge to crack down on corruption and modernize the Russian state. 
Economists like Mr. Boone argue that the legal system is less imperiled than it may seem because the tycoons, with immense empires to protect, in fact have more reason now than ever to want to play by the rules. 
In the American case a century ago, while judicial and political corruption were also rife, it was the lobbying of small businesses that eventually led to the breaking of the trusts and a more evenly applied rule of law, Ron Chernow, author of biographies of J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, said in an interview.
That same force in Russia is virtually nonexistent. Small businesses, in many countries an engine of economic growth, have barely emerged in Russia. Small companies have a harder time protecting themselves from predator bureaucrats and larger competitors, than do large wealthy business groups.
A recent study by the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a Moscow-based institute that polled 2,000 small business across Russia, found that companies stop growing once they reach a size of six or seven employees.
At that size, the "administrative pressure," or expensive, time-consuming encounters with Russia's sprawling bureaucracy, "becomes more severe," said Yekaterina Zhuravskaya, director of the study. That creates what she called a "glass ceiling."
Mr. Fridman, the Alfa Group chairman, put it more bluntly: "We have an advantage as a big group, and we use it. It's natural. But it's not so good for the economy."

 New Orleans in Bryant Park
Every spring the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival draws thousands of music lovers for its blend of homegrown styles and visiting stars. For those who missed it this year, the Trio cable network is sponsoring a free screening of its program of festival highlights tonight at Bryant Park. The one-hour film features India Arie, Counting Crows, Melissa Etheridge, Irma Thomas, Taj Mahal and Ellis Marsalis. It will be followed by a live performance by Ms. Arie, who was nominated for seven Grammy Awards this year for her aptly titled debut album, "Acoustic Soul." The network will broadcast 10 hours of extended coverage of the festival on Saturday and Sunday. Information: (212) 413-5547.

Form and Function
During the 1970's and 80's, a Conceptual architecture movement flourished as a generation of talented architects played with ideas for buildings that, because of a sluggish economy, were never built. Starting tomorrow, the AXA Gallery looks at this period with an exhibition of drawings by five architects who juggled the structural and the intellectual, creating "paper architecture" that was inspired by philosophy, linguistics, literary criticism and other theoretical pursuits. "Perfect Acts of Architecture," with some 140 drawings made from 1972 to 1987 by Peter Eisenman, Rem Koolhaas, Daniel Libeskind, Thom Mayne and Bernard Tschumi, runs through Oct. 19. The gallery is in the Equitable Tower at 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street. Information: (212) 554-4818.

Kudos at the MacDowell Colony
What do I. M. Pei, Chuck Jones, Eudora Welty and Joan Didion have in common? They all received the Edward MacDowell Medal, for one, and this Sunday the photographer Robert Frank will join their company as the award's 43rd recipient. Mr. Frank, who was born in Switzerland, is being honored for his work in documenting the tensions -- racial, economic and regional -- in postwar America, particularly in his 1958 book "The Americans." The medal will be given at the MacDowell Colony, the 400-acre artistic retreat in Peterborough, N.H., which was founded in 1907. During the day more than 30 artists' studios in the colony will be open to the public. The festivities begin at 12:15 p.m. Information: (603) 924-3886.

Art of Americas
Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Roberto Matta, Fernando Botero -- they are some of the greatest artists of the 20th century, and in their art they linked modernism to regional styles from Mexico, Cuba, Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America. This weekend an exhibition at the Nassau County Museum of Art, "The Latin Century: Beyond the Border," opens on Sunday with 100 works, among them Kahlo's 1933 fresco "Self Portrait 'Very Ugly,' " and runs through Nov. 3. The museum is in Roslyn Harbor, N.Y. Information: (516) 484-9337.

HEADLINE: Decision Due From Nasdaq On Dropping Japan Unit 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
The global downturn in equity markets is threatening to claim as its next victim Nasdaq's stock trading venture in Japan. Nasdaq is considering killing the venture because it has made little headway against a host of regulatory hurdles, persistent economic weakness and a deep aversion to change in the country's rigid financial system.
 The scrapping of so prominent a venture would be a blow to Nasdaq's ambitions for a global round-the-clock network of stock markets. And because the venture was originally intended to provide emerging businesses with access to the capital they had trouble obtaining from the rigid Japanese financial system, a dissolution of Nasdaq Japan would be a serious setback for entrepreneurs and start-up companies here. 
 Nasdaq said today that it would decide by the end of the month whether to abandon its 43 percent stake in the two-year-old venture, which operates as a part of the Osaka Securities Exchange. Last week, Nasdaq said it would write off $20.1 million in losses related to its investments in Japan because they were not expected to return a profit.
If Nasdaq, with its well-known brand and market-making technology, walks away from Japan -- a possibility that Japanese newspapers raised last week -- Nasdaq's main partner in the venture will also be badly hurt. The Softbank Corporation, which owns 43 percent, had hoped to use the exchange as a launching pad for the many Internet and technology companies in which it invested in the 1990's, listing them first in Japan and later overseas. 
Little has come of that idea so far, in part because of terrible timing. Nasdaq Japan began trading in July 2000, just as technology-related stocks began diving, leaving investors burned and leery of risky new issues. Only 98 stocks now trade on Nasdaq Japan's exchange, half the number hoped for, and the rate of new listings has fallen sharply. 
Nasdaq has also had trouble introducing the computer trading technology in Japan that it uses in the United States.
And it has accused officials of the Osaka Exchange and government regulators of dragging their feet in approving the systems.
"You got the feeling that regulators bent over so backward to protect investors that they got bogged down," said Robert Howe, president of the AIG Global Investment Corporation (Japan), which owns shares in two companies that trade on Nasdaq Japan. "It's a very conservative and traditional exchange."
Worse, outdated securities regulations created artificial shortages of shares in some companies and held trading volumes down. Under Japan's Commercial Code, companies are permitted to issue shares only in proportion to their hard assets, like factories and buildings. The rule, written with manufacturers in mind, hamstrung service providers, which might own little more than a few computers and filing cabinets. Such companies could issue only small numbers of shares, which then traded at huge prices in tiny volumes, sometimes only 10 shares a day. 
Those problems and the general slump in equity investing in Japan have combined to badly erode the exchange's daily volume, which is down 75 percent from its peak.
Still, Nasdaq Japan has drawn some marquee names, including Japanese arms of American companies like Starbucks, E*Trade and Morningstar, by offering the potential for global listings on other Nasdaq exchanges and the credibility with investors that its name and listing standards would convey.
Those advantages have receded, as Nasdaq's European operations have made little impact and efforts to set up exchanges elsewhere have met with scant success.
If Nasdaq does walk away from the venture, Softbank could try to sustain it on its own, but that is considered unlikely because of the financial damage Softbank has sustained in the stock slump; its own shares have plummeted 98 percent since early 2000.
More probably, the Osaka Stock Exchange may offer to list Nasdaq Japan companies on its main exchange, where listing requirements are similar; a spokeswoman for the Osaka exchange told Bloomberg News today that such a plan was being considered.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Markets Fall on Economic Fear 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil Aug. 13

 BODY:
Less than a week after Brazilian markets received a much-needed shot of confidence from a $30 billion International Monetary Fund loan package to the country, fears over Brazil's economic prospects dragged down stock and bond prices and the beleaguered real.
 The currency closed at 3.16, to the United States dollar, down 0.5 percent from Monday's level -- and off 8.6 percent since Thursday -- as word spread that Moody's Investors Service, the ratings agency, had downgraded Brazil's foreign-currency bonds and notes from B1 to B2, five levels below investment grade. The benchmark C-Bond closed at 51.46, wiping out the 13 percent gains made last week on the coattails of the phased I.M.F. package, announced on Wednesday. 
 The Sao Paulo stock market's benchmark index, which shot up 400 points last Thursday, to 10,315, closed yesterday at 9,444, a 279-point drop from Monday. 
Moving to calm investors, who have been scared for months by the possibility of a leftist victory in the Oct. 6 elections, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso hastily organized meetings with all four presidential candidates to win their public backing for the I.M.F. deal.
The finance minister, Pedro Malan, also tried to talk up the markets, saying he was confident Brazil would prove it was "bigger than this moment of turbulence" and would guarantee "a mature, serene political transition."
Explaining the downgrade, which puts Brazil on par with Lebanon or Nicaragua, Moody's cited concerns that Mr. Cardoso's successor, of whatever political hue, could find it difficult to control inflation, keep a lid on spending and promote sufficient economic growth to keep up payments on Brazil's hefty, and mostly domestic, debt.
A default by Brazil would probably send shock waves through emerging markets worldwide and could put at risk billions of dollars of United States and European investments made in Brazil, South America's largest economy, in the last decade. Latin America could find itself staring at a "lost decade" of economic lethargy and scant capital, repeating the experience of the 1980's.
Rodrigo Azevedo, chief economist at CSFB-Garantia in Sao Paulo, said that the markets were partly depressed by fears that the central bank might not be able to roll over $2.5 billion worth of dollar-linked securities due Thursday, but that the main worries were the continuing political uncertainty and a credit squeeze for Brazilian companies that is effectively strangling the economy.
"The I.M.F. package had a short-lived impact on market expectations," Mr. Azevedo said. "But longer term, it still gives the government more room for maneuver and should reduce the downside eventually."
"The political question will remain central until the elections," he said. "But if the central bank resolves the problem of lines of credit, it will take a good part of the pressure off the market."
The central bank president, Arminio Fraga, announced on Monday that he would be directing some of the bank's funds to finance exports "in the coming days."
The political question, however, could be a harder nut to crack.
It is still unclear exactly what sort of commitment Mr. Cardoso will get from the two candidates now ahead in the polls: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party and Ciro Gomes of the Popular Socialist Party. Both have stopped short of formally accepting the I.M.F. agreement and have been eager to blame the government for the crisis.
Only Jose Serra, the candidate of Mr. Cardoso's governing coalition, has publicly embraced the deal, but he is a distant third in the polls. The fourth candidate, Anthony Garotinho, has been critical of the deal but has not taken a formal stand.
Mr. Cardoso will need all his considerable skills as a political deal maker to convince Mr. Silva and Mr. Gomes that while they might think backing the I.M.F. deal is bad for their electoral chances, it would be much worse to start a new administration in the middle of a financial crisis without support from the fund.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- Danbury, Conn.; 
Suburban History for Sale, With Architectural Status

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
In 1982, during a period when many Fortune 500 companies were building their headquarters on suburban tracts, the Union Carbide Corporation opened a 1.2-million-square-foot building off Interstate 84 in Danbury, Conn. Designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo & Associates and set on 646 acres of pristine, undulating terrain populated by deer and wild turkey, it is still the largest office building in the state and an architecturally significant one, too, for its configuration and its off-the-ground construction.
 But the building never reaped the glory that early reviewers predicted. Now, it is at a major turning point, with the structure itself for sale and much of the surrounding site primed for extensive development. 
 For Union Carbide, troubles began not long after it moved into the building. In 1984 a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, leaked toxic gas, killing or injuring 6,500 people. The company eventually paid a settlement of $470 million. In 1986, it sold the Connecticut building and 100 acres to Sunbelt Management of Delray Beach, Fla., in a lease-back arrangement that ends in 2006.
As the Union Carbide staff shrank, excess space was sublet to tenants including Honeywell International, Morgan Stanley, Praxair and Boehringer Ingelheim. Last year, Union Carbide was acquired by Dow Chemical, and the building assumed the Dow name. Remaining Carbide workers, Dow employees and tenants occupy about half the office space, leaving 485,000 square feet available for annual rent in the low $20's a foot. No asking price has been disclosed for the sale of the building. 
Last month, the remaining 546 acres of Carbide's original site were sold for $27.5 million to investors led by Anthony Lucera, head of Contracting Advisors of Brookfield, a local developer. The sale, brokered by Century 21/Scalzo Commercial and Essey Properties, eliminates the possibility that a casino might be built on the property, an idea floated by the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation but vehemently opposed by residents of the Danbury region. 
Danbury's mayor, Mark Boughton, is pleased about plans for the land. "We have been working hard on economic development for the city," he said.
A public hearing is to be held on Aug. 27 on changing the property's zoning from light industrial to a planned neighborhood development zone. That designation would allow Mr. Lucera, the local developer, to apply for mixed development of offices; single-family, multifamily and low-income housing; a hotel-conference center; neighborhood shopping; and recreational components. 
"We will not apply for anything until the city's application for the zone change is approved," Mr. Lucera said.
At the same time, the city is negotiating with minor league baseball teams about occupying a stadium that might be built on 30 acres that Mr. Lucera is making available to the city. How the 30-acre site is developed, he said, will be decided after input from whatever ball club signs a deal with the city and how much the ball club participates financially in building a stadium. 
The city is not planning to pay for anything but feasibility studies for the 546-acre site, Mayor Boughton said. "A $14 million project to connect the property to the city sewer system would be paid for by federal funds and the developer," he said.
Because the real estate industry considers Danbury a secondary office market, some brokers say the building will be a hard sell. Ed Tonnessen, an executive vice president at Albert B. Ashforth, cited other concerns. "Some companies don't want to be a small fish in a very big pond," he said. "Some large tenants want their own signature on a building, and the need to be close to where the C.E.O. lives is not a need that Danbury satisfies."
The building's 16 four-story office "pods" are attached like the legs of a centipede on both sides of a long curving rectangle, which contains parking for 2,568 cars and a 222,000-square-foot core accommodating five restaurants; fitness, medical and conference rooms; and a shopping arcade. Access to the office segments is directly from employees' parking areas in appointed spaces opposite their pod entrances.
A spectacular feature of the $190 million construction cost was the elevation of the entire building on 5,000 columns 8 to 40 feet off the ground, avoiding the cost of moving countless tons of earth to accommodate a foundation on hilly topography.
Merrill Roth, executive managing director at Grubb & Ellis, the firm acting as agent for the building, is optimistic about leasing. "We have people looking for data centers, trading operations, headquarters facilities and adjunct operations for large corporations looking to decentralize out of New York City," he said. "Office space is exceptionally flexible. Pods of 36,000 square feet and 84,000 square feet can be combined in any number, and prime entrances can be created with their own identity. Sunbelt will fund most renovations for creditworthy tenants."
The process of finding a buyer is complicated, however, by a lawsuit that Union Carbide filed against the city two years ago. City appraisers put the building's value at $232 million, including the contract rent paid by Carbide to Sunbelt. Appraisers hired by Carbide value the building at $99 million without the rent.
Carbide accuses the city of discrimination because it has not included contract rent in evaluating any other property, said Marjorie Wilder, a lawyer for Carbide.
Daniel Casagrande, the city attorney, said: "The rent, at $44 million annually through 2006, is excessive compared with market rates. Consequently, our appraiser considered that a buyer would take into account the high rent he could earn." A trial is set for Nov. 14.

HEADLINE: A Second Chance for Brazil and the I.M.F. 

BYLINE:  By Joseph E. Stiglitz; Joseph Stiglitz, professor of economics at Columbia University, was chief economist of the World Bank from 1997 to 2000. He won the 2001 Nobel Prize in economics and is author of "Globalization and its Discontents."

 BODY:
The world is waiting to see how the market will judge Brazil and whether the International Monetary Fund's rescue package, announced over the weekend, will bring the country back from the brink. It would be foolish to try to predict the movements of a global market that has demonstrated a proclivity for excessive pessimism. Yet those who have looked closely at the numbers and the politics are almost unanimous: there is no reason for Brazil to collapse. The United States has every reason to hope that it doesn't.
 In recent years, Brazil has created a vibrant democracy with a strong economy. Differences of opinion exist, but on Brazil's key issues a broad consensus prevails, one that includes all the major contenders in the country's presidential election in October.
 There is agreement, for instance, on sound fiscal and monetary policies: no one wants to return to the hyperinflation of earlier decades. Brazil's monetary policy has been managed extraordinarily well by Arminio Fraga, president of the central bank, and the analytic resources of his staff match those of central banks in the highly developed countries. 
There is also agreement that, while markets are at the center of a successful economy, there is an important role for the state. For example, Brazil's government managed one of the most successful privatizations of telecommunications; it also pushed for stronger competition and regulatory policies. Unlike the United States, which responded to an electricity crisis by letting market forces (and companies like Enron) handle the matter, Brazil took strong action to handle its own electricity crisis at about the same time. As an American, I looked on with envy.
Brazil may be called an emerging market, but it has first-rate financial, educational and research institutions. In Sao Paulo, discussions about economics are as sophisticated as in New York. University seminars in Rio are as lively as those in Cambridge, Mass., or Cambridge, England. Brazil produces one of the finest airplanes in the world, so good that competitors in more industrial countries have tried to raise trade barriers against it.
Brazil has one major weakness: a high level of income inequality. Yet even here, and unlike in many other countries, the problem is recognized. There is consensus across partisan lines that income inequality has to be addressed. All agree education is the key, and the progress that has been made is impressive: 10 years ago, 20 percent of Brazil's school-age children were not attending classes; now only 3 percent don't attend. Similarly, landless farmers present a grave economic and social problem, but there is agreement among the left and right about the need for land reform. Already there is a reform program supported by the World Bank, and it will surely continue. Brazil has likewise faced the AIDS epidemic with resolve. What the government has already done puts it in the global forefront; it has gotten drug companies to allow Brazilian firms to manufacture the critical drugs and provide them to the suffering at relatively low prices.
In short, Brazil has carved out a path for itself that is not based on ideology or simplistic economics. Successfully charting its own course, Brazil has created a broad consensus behind a balanced and democratic market economy.
Critics of the new I.M.F. lending can point to the remarkable record of I.M.F. failures in recent years: Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, Russia, Brazil (1998) and Argentina. Why, they ask, should Brazil in 2002 be any different? There are plenty of reasons. Brazil today, unlike three and a half years ago, has a flexible exchange rate system with an undervalued currency. Argentina had a fixed rate and an overvalued currency. Investors knew it could not be sustained and demanded high interest to compensate: it was only a matter of time before the system cracked. Argentina was able to collect in taxes only 15 percent of gross domestic product; Brazil is able to collect 30 percent of G.D.P. Or consider Russia, which had what Jeffrey Sachs called "the world's worst central bankers." Initiatives by Brazil's central bank to increase openness are a model for central banks throughout the world. 
Moreover, unlike in most other I.M.F. packages -- which insisted on contractive monetary and fiscal policies that weakened the economy -- in this instance the I.M.F. insisted only on the continuation of existing policies, aiming at a primary budget surplus of 3.75 percent. It would have been even better if they had set a cyclically adjusted target, which would be more flexible and therefore have enhanced stability and confidence.
If the markets understand the state of affairs in Brazil, interest rates and exchange rates should adjust to reflect that understanding and, with these adjustments, Brazil should have no difficulty meeting its commitments. That being the case, it would be in the interests of all, no matter what their politics, to see the country's debt commitments fulfilled.
Much is at stake: It was widely thought that the failure of the Argentine rescue would be the final nail in the coffin of the big-bailout strategy. Evidently those who thought so were wrong. But a failure in Brazil would certainly cast further doubt on that strategy and further weaken the credibility of the I.M.F. The Financial Times may have put it only slightly too strongly when suggesting that the I.M.F. had "bet the house" on Brazil. Certainly a failure would give greater credence to the arguments of those, including George Soros and me, who believe there are fundamental flaws in the current global financial architecture. In any case, the continuing instability facing emerging markets around the world -- even those with seemingly sound economic policies -- should renew the resolve to understand why the global financial system is operating so poorly.
Within Latin America the effects of a failure in Brazil would be profound. Already there is disillusionment throughout the region with the I.M.F. and the so-called market-oriented reforms of the 80's. The question is repeatedly put: if the top students like Argentina and Brazil can fail, what awaits us? Anxieties are reinforced by the data. The growth of the early 90's appears to have been but a brief interlude between the lost decade of the 80's and the lost half decade of the late 90's, in which per capita incomes have declined. Growth for the decade of the 90's as a whole is only slightly greater than half that of the pre-reform period of the 50's, 60's, and 70's. Even when and where there has been growth, the fruits have disproportionately gone to the rich, with many at the bottom actually worse off. Throughout the region, there is a new sense of insecurity.
There is also a heightened sense of resentment at American hypocrisy: free-trade rhetoric combined with increased trade barriers. This question is related to that of I.M.F. policy, which is formed in large part by the United States. It is difficult to deal with a great power that is both schoolmaster and truant. At the very least, it encourages cynicism.
But it may be that the United States' recent experience with erecting steel tariffs indirectly shows a way forward. The Bush administration invoked emergency provisions within World Trade Organization rules to allow for temporary protection of some American steel from competitors abroad. Couldn't there be something similar for countries whose economies run into sudden trouble? If larger markets could open themselves temporarily, along the lines of an emergency bilateral free trade agreement, to a country experiencing great difficulties, the cost could be less than that of a traditional bailout and the impact possibly greater. 
In the Americas, certainly, something like emergency tariff reduction would be of enormous political and economic benefit to the whole region -- a good-neighbor policy for a new era. And it could help us move away from these battles over international lending and fiscal and monetary policy, battles that have become too frequent and far too costly, for the lender as well as the borrower.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Increase for a Second Month 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Retail sales rose for a second consecutive month in July, the Commerce Department reported today, citing zero-interest financing for cars and an increase in gasoline prices. Excluding cars and fuel, spending was unchanged. 
 Sales increased 1.2 percent, to $304.3 billion, after a 1.4 percent gain in June that was larger than previously estimated, the report said. But the July total may have masked declines in the sales of appliances, building materials, clothing, electronic goods and furniture. 
 "The July retail sales report does little to resolve the issue of whether consumers are going to continue to spend at a fast pace for the duration of this year," said Joseph LaVorgna, an economist with Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. "The boost in July auto sales appears to have pulled sales away from other items."
The consecutive monthly increases in spending were the first this year and the largest since November and December 1999. Consumer spending, which includes retail sales and spending on services, accounts for a majority of the economy.
Sales at car and parts dealerships rose 4.2 percent, matching the previous month's increase. The gains were the biggest since last October, when manufacturers offered incentives to draw buyers back after the attacks on Sept. 11. 
Excluding cars, retail sales over all rose 0.2 percent last month, compared with a 0.5 percent increase in June. 
Gasoline sales increased 2.7 percent. The average retail cost for all grades of gasoline rose to $1.44 a gallon from $1.42 a gallon in June, according to Energy Department data. 
Sales at clothing and accessory stores fell 1.3 percent after rising 2.5 percent in June. Department stores, which include discount retailers like Wal-Mart, sold 0.1 percent less merchandise. Sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 1 percent, and furniture sales fell 1.4 percent, the biggest drop since September. 
Sales of building materials fell 1.2 percent in July, while revenue at sporting goods, hobby, book and music outlets increased 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department said. 
Sales at food and beverage stores rose 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in June. Restaurant and bar sales were up 1 percent compared with 0.7 percent in June.

HEADLINE: Canadians Duel Over the Fate of a Fragile Beauty 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LAKE LOUISE VILLAGE, Alberta, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
It is the most famous picture postcard image of Canada's Rocky Mountain splendor: lovely Lake Louise shimmering under the giant Victoria glacier and surrounded by a dense forest of spruce and fir trees.
 Normally, the only interruption to the tranquillity is the occasional thunderous clap of ice breaking off the glacier, bringing cries of glee from tourists paddling canoes below. 
 But the emerald lake in Banff National Park has become a battleground between a large Canadian hotel chain and environmentalists who say they must make a stand here to save the country's 39 national parks from developers.
The issue at hand is a $45 million six-story addition to the giant Chateau Lake Louise hotel that has been the object of a series of lawsuits and environmental impact studies for nearly a decade. 
The project has been swept up in a long-running battle between those who argue that the development must stop in order to preserve the wildlife of Canada's national parks and those who say that the park system is meant to serve the growing number of people who have made it part of a tourism industry that is vital to the Canadian economy.
Banff is already the most heavily developed national park in North America, entertaining more than five million visitors a year.
Environmentalists say that the addition of 81 rooms in a hotel wing to be used for conferences and conventions will put added stress on a fragile lake region where grizzly bears, lynx and wolverines are already threatened by the presence of as many as 20,000 tourists a day. Proponents say another couple of hundred visitors will not make that much of a difference.
"The reason we are polarized is because there are environmental lobbies who suggest that our national parks are wildlife preserves," said David M. Bayne, the Chateau Lake Louise general manager. "But they are for people also and needs have to be balanced."
Noisy protests and a billboard campaign around the United States against the project have produced a major distraction for the Fairmont hotel chain, which has earned praise from environmental groups in the past for its recycling efforts.
"I like to say when this all started I had hair," smiled Mr. Bayne, the 55-year-old hotel general manager, who is thinning at the top.
Nevertheless, the chain has pledged to move ahead with construction. It has successfully battled the environmentalists in the courts so far, and workers cut down trees on the site last week in preparation for the start of construction. 
Now environmentalists and the local Siksika Indians are taking the hotel to court again, this time challenging its right to continue drawing water from the glacier lake in its backyard.
Edward E. Whittingham, a director of the Banff Environmental Action and Research Society, called the Banff project "highly symbolic" as a political barometer of how Canada's national parks are being treated.
"Banff, as our first national park and Canada's flagship park, often sets the tone for the entire park system," he said, adding that the Lake Louise project is another gash in what he calls "death by a thousand cuts." Recent environmental reports show that Canada's national park system is no longer a pristine preserve for the country's rich assortment of flora and fauna.
Several wildlife species, including the Atlantic lynx, the Atlantic salmon and the northern leopard frog, have disappeared from New Brunswick Province's Fundy National Park since it was established in the 1940's. Approximately 20 species of amphibians and reptiles have been lost over the last century in Ontario Province's Point Pelee National Park through overuse and pollution.
A major Canadian government study issued in 2000 concluded that only one of the nation's 39 national parks -- Vuntut, in the Arctic reaches of the northern Yukon -- is free of ecological damage.
Park loons have been found to have high mercury levels in their blood and feathers. Overvisitation in some parks has reduced the population of bullfrogs, silencing their chorus of droning around several lakes. Moose, once a common sight for vacationing motorists, have virtually disappeared from many park areas because of increased traffic, including the stretch along Banff's lower Bow Valley.
With three ski centers in the park expanding, with the town of Banff becoming a sprawling international shopping center and with lodges sprouting up around the park, the federal government recently set a cap on development over the Lake Louise area. Nevertheless, the community plan allows hotel beds to increase from 2,400 to 2,700 by 2011.
The most publicized symbol of this growth is the Chateau Lake Louise meeting center. Several environmental groups sued to oppose the hotel expansion, arguing that conventions on the lake would extend the tourist season to the fall and spring, critical seasons for wildlife trying to store food and breed.
The Federal Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the hotel chain last year, citing an environmental impact study commissioned by Parks Canada that concluded that any increased use of water and wildlife trails as well as increased human waste caused by the operation of the meeting center "can be mitigated and/or compensated for."
A report issued this week by the Environmental Investigation Agency, a Washington-based private group, found otherwise. It stated that the hotel extension will increase traffic and extend the tourist season, which "will harm already stressed ecosystems and threaten key species such as grizzly bears, wolverines and mountain goats."
The environmentalists have not given up hope of stopping the project.
Last week Joe Comartin, a member of the House of Commons and a leader of the opposition New Democratic Party, tried to make the hotel project a political issue by calling on the Liberal government to issue an interim order prohibiting construction until two challenges to the hotel's water permit are resolved.
One of the challenges is coming from the 5,500 members of the Siksika nation who have land claims downstream from Lake Louise. The Siksikas want to reverse the recent Parks Canada decision to renew the permit, arguing that their treaty rights were infringed since they were not consulted in a decision that they say will cause more pollution on their lands.
Joe Weasel Child, the Siksika land claims manager, said he does not care if his legal action cripples the hotel and forces it to close. "This is our land," he said. "And we are not waiting for the courts to decide either. We'll do what it takes. We have plans but I don't have the authority to disclose them."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Are Off Significantly in Absence of Move by the Fed

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled yesterday, with the three main gauges falling more than 2 percent, after Federal Reserve policy makers decided to leave their benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged.
 While the Fed's decision not to alter monetary policy was expected, "there were some market players who adhered to the view that the Fed would ease, and they were disappointed," said Ward McCarthy, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. 
 The initial reaction was muted after the Fed announced at 2:15 p.m. that it was leaving the federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks at 1.75 percent, a 40-year low, but stocks then began a steady decline that lasted the rest of the session. 
The move in the market may have been exaggerated by the relatively light trading, with volume on the New York Stock Exchange of about 1.3 billion shares, about 400 million below the daily average for June and July. 
Among the stocks leading the market lower were United Technologies, down 8.7 percent; Boeing, off 8.1 percent; and General Electric, down 4 percent. All three companies could be hurt by the airline industry's financial problems, which led US Airways to file for bankruptcy protection on Sunday and American Airlines to announce an overhaul yesterday that includes the elimination of 7,000 jobs.
Other declining stocks included Pfizer, down 3.3 percent; two banking giants, J. P. Morgan Chase, down 4.2 percent, and Citigroup, off 2.9 percent; Oracle, off 6.6 percent; and Intel, down 4.7 percent.
Six Flags, the amusement park owner, plunged 57.3 percent after announcing that 2002 earnings would be flat, instead of the 7 to 8 percent increase the company had forecast.
At the close, the Dow was down 206.50 points, or 2.4 percent, at 8,482.39, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 19.59 points, or 2.2 percent, to 884.21. The Nasdaq composite index was off 37.56 points, or 2.9 percent, at 1,269.28.
Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of the beginning of the bull market of the 1980's and 1990's. And despite the sell-off of the last two and half years in the stock market, investors in the Dow, not including dividends, have done quite well. The annual return in those 20 years is 12.7 percent. Since the Dow's peak in January 2000, it has declined at an annual rate of 11.8 percent.
Fed policy makers, who met while President Bush was conducting an economic forum in Waco, Tex., did hold out the prospect of a rate cut in the future by changing their view of the near-term economic outlook. Their statement after the meeting said that the immediate risk to the economy was one of further weakness. The Fed had been in a so-called neutral stance, which meant the next rate move could be up or down. The new stance means that the next rate move is likely to be a cut.
But the Fed action did not resolve one of the chief questions that investors face: Is the economic weakness that the Fed referred to a new trend or just a pause on the way to better growth in the last quarter?
The government reported yesterday that retail sales rose 1.2 percent in July, the second consecutive monthly increase. But without car sales, the increase was just 0.2 percent, which could signal that consumer spending will weaken if automakers do not continue to bolster sales with no-interest car loans.
The bond market rallied on the Fed news, in part because of the hint of a future rate cut and in part because stocks fell sharply. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 4.09 percent, from 4.21 percent on Monday. That is the lowest yield since the government began issuing 10-year notes in the 1970's. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 1 3/32, to 102 12/32. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 4.97 percent from 5.07 percent. Its price rose 1 19/32, to 106 5/32.
The drop in the yield on the 10-year note could help push mortgage rates to or near record lows. Such a decline could help give a lift to consumer spending by encouraging refinancing of home loans, a move that lowers monthly payments and provides homeowners with extra cash. Fed officials may be waiting to see how this decline in market interest rates effects the economy before deciding to cut rates again.
Mr. McCarthy of Stone & McCarthy said that he did not expect Fed policy makers to cut rates any further this year, unless there are signs that the economy is much weaker than it appears now.
Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said that he expected the Fed to lower the federal funds rate half a percentage point, to 1.25 percent, at its next scheduled meeting in September.
Mr. Hooper also said that the Fed statement did not hint at the possibility of a rate cut before that meeting.
For investors, these two divergent views on Wall Street add to the uncertainty of their outlook because analysts are not sure how much the economy might weaken or how quickly the Fed might act to counter that weakness.
The Fed may have added to this uncertainty by saying that the near-term risk to the economy is further weakness but also adding that "the current accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with the still robust underlying growth in productivity, should be sufficient to foster an improving business climate over time."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.870

HEADLINE: No Cut in Rates As Fed Lowers Its Assessment Of the Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve left interest rates steady today but downgraded its view of the economy and signaled that it would consider cutting rates if the recovery from last year's recession continued to lose steam.
 Abandoning its previous optimism that the economy would gradually bounce back, the Fed emphasized that the decline of the stock market and disclosures of corporate wrongdoing had prolonged a sharp deceleration that became apparent in the spring. 
 The Fed had suggested for several months that it expected its next move to be to raise rates from their current 40-year-low levels to keep the economy from overheating. But it adopted a policy stance today that is often a precursor to a rate cut, saying that the main risk now is that the economy will stall. 
In a sign, however, that it did not want investors, consumers and businesses to think that it would definitely cut rates -- and in a possible indication of uncertainty or disagreement within the Fed about how to proceed -- the central bank also noted that interest rates are already so low that they should eventually help get the economy going again.
The Fed "did the least it could do without looking stupid," said Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pimco, a bond trading firm.
The unanimous decision not to cut rates and to issue a more pessimistic assessment of the economy generated some disappointment on Wall Street. Stock prices fell after the Fed's announcement, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 8,482.39, down 206.50 for the day. The Nasdaq lost 37.56, to close at 1,269.28.
The economy showed signs early this year that it had left the recession behind, but the major indicators have faltered since then. The tumble in the stock market, the corporate scandals, declining consumer confidence and a reluctance among businesses to invest in new factories and equipment have all contributed to concern that the United States might relapse into recession.
The economy grew at a 5 percent annual rate in the first quarter but slowed to a 1.1 percent rate in the second quarter. Economists have been scaling back their growth projections for the rest of the year. The unemployment rate, currently 5.9 percent, appears to have stabilized after rising sharply last year, but it has shown no signs of declining.
With investors feeling pain, the two political parties maneuvering over who is to blame and the global economy fragile, the Fed has been under increasing pressure to come to the rescue.
But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has always been reluctant to be seen as responding directly to the stock market, and in any case it is not clear whether the recovery has just hit a bump or is truly in peril. As a result, the Fed's statement today tried to offer something for everyone: the prospect of lower rates should more bad news befall the economy, and a steady-as-she-goes policy should the current storm pass without causing major damage.
"The softening in the growth of aggregate demand that emerged this spring has been prolonged in large measure by weakness in financial markets and heightened uncertainty related to problems in corporate reporting and governance," said the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which sets policy.
"The current accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, should be sufficient to foster an improving business climate over time," the statement said.
Nonetheless, the committee said, "the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness."
To a certain extent, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues were simply acknowledging the obvious. But in doing so, they were setting out a path by which the Fed could end up driving official interest rates to a level far lower than anyone contemplated as the recession began in early 2001.
The central bank cut rates aggressively throughout last year. Its benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks has been at 1.75 percent, a 40-year low, since December. The overnight rate controlled by the Fed influences longer-term rates set in the marketplace, including those for mortgages, automobile loans and small-business loans -- rates that are all at low levels, helping keep many sectors of the economy robust.
In the futures markets, where investors try to discern the direction of interest rates, the betting today was that the central bank would cut the federal funds rate by at least a quarter of a percentage point before the end of the year. The Fed's next scheduled meeting is on Sept. 24 and will be followed by meetings in November and December.
Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services, said the Fed's decision to acknowledge the growing risks of economic weakness was "more than reasonable," but he said it did not mean that the Fed was now locked into cutting rates in September. The Fed, he said, "is unlikely to do anything extra without even more bad economic and financial news."
John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia Securities, said Mr. Greenspan would be watching closely for signs of a possible onset of a double-dip recession, especially a rise in new claims for unemployment insurance.
Maury Harris, chief United States economist for UBS Warburg, said that a "sufficiently weak string of data could still push the Fed over the edge." But he added that the economy retained considerable momentum, and he noted a government report today that retail sales rose by a healthy 1.2 percent in July.
"Consumers are responding to zero-rate financing incentives for autos," Mr. Harris said. "And they are eagerly signing on for new homes. Under these conditions, we anticipate growth of 2.5 percent this quarter and 3 percent next quarter."
Economists are divided about whether further rate cuts would help the economy now.
Those economists who say that the Fed should hold policy steady argue that a rate cut would not have much influence on the economy for a year, given that monetary policy works with a long lag.
In any case, they say, the economy's problems have much more to do with business, investor and consumer confidence than they do with interest rates; sectors of the economy, like housing, that are sensitive to interest rates are already doing well. A rate cut now, they say, would make the Fed appear panicky.
Those analysts who favor rate cuts point to signs of an emerging credit squeeze in the corporate bond market that is making it harder for some companies to obtain financing. They say a rate cut would have a positive psychological impact and would keep the Fed in front of what some analysts think is a growing threat of deflation -- a broad-based, hard-to-reverse decline in prices that can cripple an economy.

HEADLINE: Tobacco Industry Fought Drugs' Marketing 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH CHANG 

 BODY:
Tobacco companies in the 1980's and 1990's put pressure on drug companies to limit their marketing of nicotine gum and skin patches that help people quit smoking, according to a new study of tobacco industry documents.
 The study, published in today's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, describes how Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro, Virginia Slims and other cigarettes, exerted financial leverage over the pharmaceutical divisions of giant chemical companies by threatening to cut off purchases from the companies' agricultural divisions. 
 The drug companies then toned down their marketing strategies, the study says, focusing on smokers who had already decided to quit rather than making broader appeals based on the health benefits of quitting.
What might otherwise be considered merely hardball business tactics was unethical in this case because the tobacco companies knew the health risks of smoking, said Dr. Lisa Bero, a professor of clinical pharmacy and health policy at the University of California at San Francisco and the senior author of the study. 
"There was another product on the market designed to keep people from using their deadly product," Dr. Bero said. "They were attempting to keep people from using it."
Because of mergers and reorganizations in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, the makers of the quit-smoking products say their marketing is now free of tobacco industry influence. 
For its part, Philip Morris says the incidents described in the paper are ancient history. "Basically, the actions that are described in the study do not reflect the actions we are taking on issues like this today," said Brendan McCormick, a spokesman. "Certainly we acknowledge smoking causes serious disease in smokers and is addictive."
The nicotine gum and skin patches curb cravings, increasing the chances of kicking the habit.
Dr. Bero and her colleague Bhavna Shamasunder sifted through the trove of internal tobacco industry documents released in 1998 as part of the settlement of the states' lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
According to memorandums, when Merrell Dow, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical, introduced Nicorette nicotine gum in 1980, executives at Philip Morris wanted Dow to limit marketing to only people who needed to quit for health reasons. Dow canceled an antismoking newsletter to doctors after one issue. 
Philip Morris executives were not satisfied and on May 7, 1984, canceled purchases of Dow chemicals that help moisten tobacco, an $8-million-a-year account.
"Dow was informed that the recent spate of activity can only be interpreted as a conscious corporate decision that Nicorette is more important than the Philip Morris (and other tobacco) business," an internal Philip Morris memorandum said.
Philip Morris soon resumed purchases. According to notes of a meeting in October 1984, David Sharrock, president of Merrell Dow, assured Philip Morris executives that he was screening advertising and education materials to eliminate antitobacco statements.
Philip Morris also pressured Dow to discontinue support for an antismoking alliance of public health organizations.
The episode was first reported in 1998 and 1999 by The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, whose articles were based on many of the same documents studied by the medical researchers.
The new study expands on those earlier reports, showing that Philip Morris's tactics continued into the early 1990's, when the first nicotine skin patches were approved. After Ciba-Geigy introduced its patch, Habitrol, Philip Morris started pressuring Ciba-Geigy's agricultural division about what it saw as an antitobacco bias in the Habitrol advertising.
"Boom, this financial sanction comes, and boom, the advertising changes," Dr. Bero said. "They're very sequential."
The Ciba-Geigy divisions negotiated "ground rules" for the marketing of Habitrol that specify "no antismoking theme" and "we do not endorse positions which would take away the freedom of choice for smokers."
While the study focused on Philip Morris, other tobacco companies were also involved in pressuring the drug companies, Dr. Bero said. The Ciba-Geigy guidelines were widely distributed to other tobacco companies and even tobacco growers.
Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at the New York University School of Law, called Philip Morris's behavior understandable, given that it was trying to protect its market.
"A company that sees a supplier trying to take away its customers might quite reasonably choose not to deal with that supplier," Mr. Gillers said. "That's rational economic behavior. Why should we enrich you when you're trying to hurt us?"
But he said he was surprised how quickly Dow and Ciba-Geigy acceded to Philip Morris's demands. As they were not in the tobacco business, Dow and Ciba-Geigy "have an obligation to question the ethics of withdrawing a profitable product that can help smokers stop in order to appease tobacco," Mr. Gillers said, adding: "The word that occurs to me is 'cowardly.' Why didn't they stand up to Philip Morris?"
John Musser, a spokesman for Dow Chemical, said the actions were part of the usual give-and-take between large companies.
"That business was never affected by any changes in our accommodations to Philip Morris," Mr. Musser said. "That product thrived a lot of years before, during and after all that."
Dow sold its pharmaceutical business in 1995, and Nicorette is now marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, which does not have ties to the tobacco industry.
"We have absolutely no conflicts of interest," said Steve Burton, the company's vice president for smoking control. "Our commitment is unconditional."
Marketing still focuses on smokers who have already decided to quit, but that is because the products work best in those who are motivated, Mr. Burton said.
Worldwide sales of Nicorette and NicoDerm, GlaxoSmithKline's nicotine skin patch, totaled $513 million last year, he said.
Ciba-Geigy merged with Sandoz in 1996 to form Novartis. It has since spun off its agricultural divisions, and Novartis officials says they, too, are free out of outside pressures. Habitrol is no longer marketed directly, but sold under the private label of drugstore chains.
Dr. Bero said she did not know if tobacco companies continued to pressure drug companies.
"We can't go beyond the limits of our data," she said.

HEADLINE: Text of Fed Panel's Statement 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent. 
 The softening in the growth of aggregate demand that emerged this spring has been prolonged in large measure by weakness in financial markets and heightened uncertainty related to problems in corporate reporting and governance. 
The current accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, should be sufficient to foster an improving business climate over time. 
Nonetheless, the committee recognizes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness. 
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke, Susan S. Bies, Roger W. Ferguson Jr., Edward M. Gramlich, Jerry L. Jordan, Donald L. Kohn, Robert D. McTeer Jr., Mark W. Olson, Anthony M. Santomero and Gary H. Stern.

HEADLINE: European Union Urges Aspirants to Rebuff U.S. on World Court 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
The European Union this week warned the 13 nations hoping to join the organization that they should resist signing any agreement, as requested by Washington, that would protect Americans from the reach of the new International Criminal Court.
 That brought strong reactions from Washington today; a senior State Department official accused the European Union of using undue pressure to prevent countries from signing. 
 "We're not applying any pressure on countries to sign these agreements, and we don't think it is appropriate for the European Union to prevent other countries from signing them," John R. Bolton, under secretary for arms control and international security, said in an interview. 
A senior European Union official, Romano Prodi, advised the aspirants for membership -- including Poland, Hungary, Slovenia and Cyprus -- to wait until the union reached a common policy on the issue, a European Union spokesman said today. The first meetings to discuss the American request for bilateral side agreements will be held later this month and in early September, but indications from Europe do not present an optimistic picture for Washington.
The Bush administration vigorously opposes cooperation with the court, fearing Americans will be unfairly singled out. Under an agreement reached with the United Nations in the spring, personnel of United Nations missions, including American peacekeepers, are exempted from court jurisdiction for a year. The administration is campaigning to persuade most countries to sign agreements not to extradite Americans to the court. 
So far only Israel and Romania have signed. Today Switzerland said it would not sign, the first nation to formally reject an agreement. The Swiss foreign minister, Joseph Deiss, said his country refused to sign out of fear that "too extensive a use of exceptions may weaken the ability of the court to function effectively."
European Union nations and other close allies have said they refuse to be pushed into an immediate agreement. "We're not raising the profile on this issue; it is the United States," a European Union spokesman said here today, confirming that potential members had been approached. "We must study the legal implications."
The European warning to the candidate states was first reported today in The Washington Times.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell appealed today to foreign governments to agree to those waivers and played down complaints from countries about the United States warning that it would withhold military aid to nations that refused. "We are not bludgeoning or threatening any of our friends," he said.
International human rights experts said the Europeans were stalling. "This is a smart move by the E.U. because there is greater safety in numbers should they decide not to accede to American wishes," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch.
To Harold Hongju Koh, a law professor at Yale and an assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration, this diplomatic sparring has come at an inopportune time in the effort against terrorism. "The first priority should be maintaining a coalition," he said. "Instead, the administration is creating a huge political issue with our closest political allies over a small legal problem."
A senior administration official said he believed that the European allies would eventually give Americans the waivers they request. "The reaction in Congress if they don't agree will not be good," he said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Giving Golisano Some Quiet Aid and Comfort 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Tom Golisano says New York needs a conservative governor. He said today that the state must cut Medicaid spending, stand up to health care workers and "break the hold of the teachers' union."
 To which the Democrats say bravo. They may be appalled privately by Mr. Golisano's platform, but Democrats are rooting for him, and some are actively helping him. A handful of Democratic strategists have regularly offered political and legal guidance to the Golisano camp, campaign officials say, and kept some back channels of communication open to the campaigns of his Democratic opponents, Andrew M. Cuomo and H. Carl McCall. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki's campaign and the State Republican Party describe Mr. Golisano as nothing more than a stalking horse for the Democrats, especially Mr. Cuomo, arguing that Mr. Golisano is in the race only to hurt the governor.
That, clearly, is not the view of Mr. Golisano, a billionaire who points to the fact that he is spending millions of dollars of his own money each week on television advertising. "You can see that we're not interested in anybody's candidacy but our own," he said today. He dismissed the Democrats in the race as representing "politics as usual."
Nevertheless, many Democrats see Mr. Golisano's role just as the governor's team does. To them, aiding Mr. Golisano, who is running against Mr. Pataki in the Independence and Conservative Party primaries, is a sort of political bank shot that can only help the Democratic nominee. Mr. Golisano, they reason, is running as a fiscal conservative whose base of support is upstate, so he would mostly take votes away from the governor in November, and he has said he will spend $70 million, much of it on advertisements attacking Mr. Pataki.
"It's almost an article of faith among Democrats, and especially the Cuomo people, that Golisano is their ticket to victory," said Norman Adler, a political consultant who works for Republicans as well as Democrats and is not involved in the gubernatorial contest.
A strategist for one of the Democratic candidates said, "Tom Golisano winning the Independence primary is very important to us, no question, because we need him in the campaign through November."
Democrats say there is no grand conspiracy to aid Mr. Golisano, if only because he does not need their help, and in any case he is suspicious enough of them to want to do without their support. But Steve Pigeon, the Erie County Democratic chairman and a top Cuomo supporter, has been offering political guidance to Mr. Golisano, and Erick Mullen, chief spokesman for the Golisano campaign, is a former Cuomo aide. The lawyer defending Mr. Golisano's petitions to get on the ballot is Martin Connor, the Democratic minority leader in the State Senate.
Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College poll, said that if Mr. Golisano could win more than 10 percent of the vote, "I think you'll see him taking it much more out of Pataki's base than out of the Democrat's."
On the campaign trail today, Mr. McCall attacked Mr. Pataki for not collecting sales tax on cigarettes sold on Indian reservations, a step he said was costing the state $200 million a year. 
Indian tribes contend that as sovereign nations they do not have to pay such taxes, and violence has broken out when the state, under both Mr. Pataki and his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, have tried to enforce the law, prompting both governors to back down. Mr. McCall did not say how he would overcome the Indians' resistance.
A dispute between Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo over who is paying for whose campaign expenses intensified today, as each side called on the State Board of Elections to investigate the other.
Mr. Cuomo said the board should look into the fact that much of Mr. McCall's campaign workers are being paid by his campaign organization and that of his choice for lieutenant governor, Dennis Mehiel, an arrangement that saves Mr. McCall tens of thousands of dollars each month.
The McCall camp countered today with charges that the Cuomo campaign had paid for the nominating petitions of its choice for lieutenant governor, Charlie King, but failed to reflect that as a contribution to Mr. King's campaign.
The Board of Elections had no immediate comment on either claim.

HEADLINE: Whither College Lectures? Maybe Right Out the Door 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM H. HONAN; Richard Rothstein is on vacation.

 BODY:
ONE day in 1931, Hamilton Holt, president of Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., startled his colleagues at an academic conference when he declared that Yale and Columbia, which he had attended in his youth, "taught me virtually nothing."
 The reason, Mr. Holt explained, was that the lectures delivered by his teachers, as with those delivered by professors almost everywhere, were examples of "probably the worst scheme ever devised for imparting knowledge." 
 He then ridiculed the customary academic lecture as "that mysterious process by means of which the contents of the professor's notebooks are transferred by means of the fountain pen to the pages of the student's notebook without passing through the mind of either." 
In place of this ritualistic droning and doodling, Mr. Holt said, academe should practice what he called the conference system, an approach he modeled on the editorial meetings he had held as editor of The Independent, a liberal magazine of social and political thought. 
As Mr. Holt saw it, the conference-system classroom should include about a dozen students -- all of whom had read assigned materials and come prepared to discuss them -- and a faculty member. The principal task of the faculty member was to encourage students to speak up and test their ideas in freewheeling discussion and debate.
Mr. Holt theorized that learning takes place most profoundly when students are led to make personal discoveries, often with other students, rather than when inundated with facts and called upon to remember them in examinations.
Although Mr. Holt has not been widely recognized as an iconoclast -- too many others made similar claims for seminars, tutorials and other methods of instruction -- he is important in the history of higher education because he spoke and wrote with flair and, unlike many other educational theorists, held the reins of an institution where he could test his ideas. As a result, he influenced the experiments that took place in the 1930's at the University of Chicago, Antioch, Bennington, Cornell, Sarah Lawrence, Lehigh, Vanderbilt and elsewhere.
This burst of interest in reform pedagogy in the early years of the last century was hardly the first time such ideas were put into practice. The ancient Greeks, notably Socrates, believed in education by interrogating rather than by propounding. That idea faded in the Middle Ages, when teachers were expected to hand down the truth from on high, but interest in it was revived in the late 18th century, when the French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau argued that students learn by doing rather than by having their minds stuffed with abstract principles. 
Rousseau's ideas gradually took hold. By the late 19th century, the educational reformer John Dewey, who was deeply influenced by "Emile," Rousseau's classic work on education, was arguing that the "set lecture" was destined to be displaced by "readings, reports, discussions, etc., with the teacher guiding the study by questions, references, printed helps, etc." 
Today, such concepts are clearly growing in popularity. Judith Rodin, president of the University of Pennsylvania, spoke for a new generation of academic leaders when she said in an interview: "In the next 10 years, there will be much more flexibility in teaching modalities. The standard college lecture will be pretty much a thing of the past. The teacher of the future will be more of a mentor and less of a didactic lecturer."
Dr. Rodin talked of the computerization of intellectual life. In speeding up communication, and in making huge amounts of information accessible, technology has, to a degree, obviated the lecture, which after all came into being to impart knowledge. Now that knowledge is at one's fingertips, pedagogy has focused on how to use that knowledge.
To be sure, the mass lecture, sometimes derided as "hog calling," is still the dominant form of instruction at most major universities. Harvard routinely crams more than 500 students into "Social Analysis 10," where Prof. Martin Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan administration, holds forth. Lectures have long been considered the most effective form of instruction especially at the introductory level, where large amounts of information must be poured into young minds.
But that's changing. William Tierney, a professor of higher education at the University of Southern California, said pedagogical reform was sure to be "pretty dramatic" in the next few years. In the Internet age, he said, "no aspect of teaching will change more rapidly."

HEADLINE: American Airlines to Cut Jobs, Planes and Flights 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Acknowledging that the economics of its business are fundamentally flawed, American Airlines, the world's biggest airline, said yesterday that it would lay off 7,000 workers, retire inefficient jets, retool its hub schedules and cut back on flights going into the fall. 
 Coming two days after US Airways filed for bankruptcy protection in a last-ditch attempt to streamline itself, American's move is further evidence that big airlines are beginning to address the overcapacity that has left the industry with billions of dollars in losses over the last couple of years, analysts said. 
 American said its cutbacks would save it $1.1 billion a year. The announcement bolstered investor confidence, with the stock of American's parent company, the AMR Corporation, jumping 38 cents, to $8.74. But the stock is still down 61 percent since Jan. 1. Shares of other carriers were mixed yesterday. 
Most of the steps planned by American emulate efficiencies that other carriers -- from full-service rivals to no-frills airlines -- have undertaken. But many analysts said that American, bloated by a merger with Trans World Airlines last year that added planes, routes and workers just as travel dropped precipitously, needed to act if it hoped to move toward profitability.
"We grasped the need for fundamental change in the airline industry some time ago, and have undertaken both long-term structural change and measures responsive to current industry conditions," Donald J. Carty, the chief executive of American, said yesterday in a written statement. Several newspapers reported American's plans yesterday.
For passengers, the retooling is part of a larger overhaul at American that will generally make travel less comfortable, with longer waits between connecting flights and permanent cutbacks on amenities like hot food. American is betting that customers will not mind the more spartan conditions and that its full-service rivals will follow in its footsteps. But some industry experts say American could end up alienating business passengers accustomed to being pampered.
American's competitors said yesterday that they were watching the carrier's moves, but did not regard them as particularly trailblazing. For example, American's plan to reduce capacity in its November schedule by 9 percent from its July schedule mirrors similar strategies at United Airlines and Northwest Airlines, which expect to cut capacity by 9 percent and 13 percent, respectively, for the winter season.
Both of those airlines also said they had no plans to follow American's potentially innovative change in hub scheduling, which will spread flights throughout the day to improve productivity. That could give competitors an advantage in attracting customers because American would have slower connection times. 
Rival companies also said American's layoffs, which will cut 7 percent of the work force by March 2003, were a move to shed workers that it acquired during the T.W.A. merger or rehired too quickly after it eliminated 20,000 jobs following the Sept. 11 attacks.
Nevertheless, American needs to stanch its bleeding however it can, analysts said. AMR lost $495 million last quarter and $1.76 billion last year and is expected to lose close to that amount this year. The stock has been hovering at its lowest point in years.
"I view today's moves as very positive moves in the right direction," said Jim Corridore, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. "There is too much supply out there right now. It's reflected in the average pricing and in the profit-loss statement of these airlines."
American's unions were less sanguine about the changes. The pilots will lose 550 jobs, all of them from the St. Louis operations acquired from T.W.A., said Gregg Overman, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association. After Sept. 11, AMR put on furlough 800 pilots from American Airlines and several hundred from T.W.A. and later recalled 200 to the American operation.
The company expects to cut 2,500 flight attendants, said George Price, a spokesman for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants. It had put nearly 2,000 on furlough after Sept. 11 and recalled a fifth of them.
"It's a very dark day in aviation for us," Mr. Price said. "It's left a lot of employees pretty shell shocked."
American also said it would retire its entire fleet of 74 Fokker-100 jets between 2003 and 2005. The jets do not generate a lot of revenue because they have fewer than 90 seats, and they are costly to operate. Regional jets are more efficient for the same purposes.
The company is reconfiguring or redeploying several of its Boeing jet types to streamline operations. For example, it has two configurations on its 777's, one for trans-Atlantic flights and one for trans-Pacific routes. By next year, it will use only one type of 777.
Nine Boeing 767-300's acquired from T.W.A. will be retired by November. Models of that plane flying to Hawaii, Latin America and some European cities will be trimmed from three classes of seating to two, with first class being eliminated. That change follows reconfigurations that Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines have already done to their planes.
In fact, the whole idea of streamlining fleets and plane types is one that other airlines have already used to their advantage. Gordon M. Bethune, the chief executive of Continental, turned his carrier around partly by cutting the types of planes in that fleet down to five. No-frills airlines like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue maximize efficiency by flying only one type of jet.
Southwest also perfected another strategy now being adopted by American at two of its hubs: turning planes around quickly. At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, American's use of that technique will end up distributing flights more evenly throughout the day, instead of having up to 50 or 60 planes arriving within 20-minute periods.
That allowed passengers to make connections quickly, but it also created a lot of schedule lulls that decreased productivity, said Jeff Campbell, the chief financial officer at American.
The drawback is that some passengers will have to wait 15 to 20 minutes longer for their connections. Since April, American has been trying this experiment in Chicago, and it said the trial had not cost the airline market share, but had allowed it to save on the use of five planes and the equivalent of three gates. Mr. Campbell said this "rolling hub" system would eventually be used in St. Louis.
The danger is that if travelers are bothered by the longer connection times, they could switch to another carrier running the same route.
"With our hub system, we have high-frequency flights into the hubs and high utilization of the gates, and we think it benefits the consumer because there are shorter connecting times to get the flights," said Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United Airlines.
Michael Boyd, an airline consultant in Evergreen, Colo., said he did not think passengers would be too troubled by American's longer travel times, but said that the company's overall cost-cutting efforts amounted to "nickel-and-diming" the customer.
For example, he said, passengers might be turned off by having to pick up brown-bag lunches at the gate rather than having hot meals served to them.
"I think they're going in the right direction, but they're working on the wrong side of the equation," he said. "What have you done to get your passengers to want to get on your airline more?"
Still, many analysts said American's efforts were a positive step forward. And it is ahead of its biggest rival, United, in addressing issues of high cost.
Yesterday, shares of UAL, the parent company of United, plunged $1.06, or 28 percent, to $2.74, amid further fears that the airline might have to seek bankruptcy protection. Sam Buttrick, an analyst at UBS Warburg, downgraded the stock from a buy to a sell rating, writing in a note to investors that the risks of bankruptcy are "now too high for us given the company's reliance on government funding."
United is struggling to persuade the federal government to give it a $1.8 billion loan guarantee. Jack Creighton, the chief executive, said in a phone message to employees this week that the government wanted to see more participation from stakeholders in cost-cutting efforts. "We believe at this point that we have some work to do to make our application a success," he said.

HEADLINE: Energy Pricing Suspicious, Report Says 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Federal energy regulators, struggling to get to the bottom of the California energy crisis of 2000-01, said for the first time today that there was evidence that natural gas prices might have been manipulated, helping to drive up power prices. 
 They also said that they had found evidence of possible manipulation of electricity prices by Enron and two other companies, Avista and El Paso Electric, and began formal investigations to determine whether they broke federal electricity-trading rules. 
 The preliminary report prepared by the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission contrasts with the agency's approach at the outset of the California crisis two years ago, when it played down the possibility of manipulation. The report comes closer to endorsing the view of many California officials that the state's energy crisis resulted at least in part from manipulation of the market by energy companies like Enron.
If the commission endorses the findings, it could then increase the size of the refunds it might order energy companies to pay consumers in California for overcharging. That is because, if prices had been manipulated, many energy sellers could no longer use high natural gas costs as an excuse for charging high power prices. The difference could mean more than $1 billion in additional refunds, one official said. 
While Enron sought bankruptcy protection in December, many other large companies that sold power to California are still profitable, though some are struggling.
An administrative law judge at the commission is scheduled to begin a hearing soon to determine the refunds owed. 
The investigation by the energy commission has also found that the common method for reporting prices for natural gas and electricity trades -- surveys published by industry publications -- does not use statistically valid procedures and is subject to manipulation by traders who have an incentive to report false data to benefit their own trading positions.
Reaction in California was mixed tonight. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who helped instigate the investigation, said she was "encouraged that FERC finally is taking seriously its responsibility to protect consumers." She said she was particularly gratified by the finding that manipulation might have increased natural gas prices, which she said was among the major factors in the escalation of electricity costs during the energy crisis.
But Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat locked in a battle for re-election against Bill Simon Jr., a Republican, called the actions today a "whitewash, pure and simple." The commission "hasn't sanctioned anybody, it hasn't issued any refunds to us, it's done nothing to stop the manipulation which everyone agrees occurred here in California." Mr. Davis has sharply criticized what he called profiteering and overcharging by energy companies -- a stance critics have attacked as ignoring severe flaws in how the state created its deregulated electricity marketplace.
In fact, the report does assign some blame to the state, noting that shortages of electricity and underlying problems with the structure of the marketplace created an environment in which prices could be driven up. And while officials of the energy commission stressed that the inquiry was not complete, the report today did not name many of the largest companies that California officials have accused of driving up prices, including Reliant Energy, Dynegy and Duke Energy.
The report also said that the disclosure of memos outlining trading strategies that Enron used in California -- with colorful names like Death Star, Get Shorty and Fat Boy -- has "adversely affected" electricity markets far beyond the "dollar impact" of the strategies themselves.
"We've still got further ground to plow, but the agency is doing its job, and we look forward to getting to closure," said Patrick Wood III, the chairman of the energy commission, who was appointed last year. He emphasized that the commission was still investigating whether energy companies had withheld power to drive up prices or had manipulated prices to increase profits on financial derivatives whose value was tied to electricity or natural gas costs.
In the report, Enron came in for severe criticism from the commission, which said its strategies "involved deceit, including the provision of false information" in an attempt to manipulate prices. In addition, the report found that Enron's once-dominant Internet-based exchange, EnronOnline, "was potentially susceptible to manipulation."
The commission said that one strategy used in 2000 -- exporting power from California to evade price caps -- had worsened the shortage. An Enron spokesman, Eric Thode, said, "We're continuing to cooperate with the FERC's investigation," but declined further comment.
In the two years before filing for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, Enron made about $1.8 billion in profits trading electricity in California and other Western states, the report found based on Enron's raw data, with profits exceeding $20 million on many single days.
In announcing investigations of Avista, based in Spokane, Wash.; El Paso Electric in Texas; and several Enron subsidiaries, including Portland General Electric in Oregon, the commission said regulators could eventually revoke the traders' ability to sell power at market rates and force them to disgorge certain profits. El Paso Electric is not affiliated with the El Paso Corporation, the large Houston natural gas company.
One area the commission has focused on is whether the dealings of Enron with Portland were improper and collusive. Transcripts of phone conversations among Enron and Portland General employees include discussions questioning whether trades involving the two companies were legal, and one in which a Portland employee refers to an arrangement with Enron as a "scam," the commission said. Investigators are also studying what the commission said was Avista's admission that it routinely acted as a middleman for Enron and Portland on deals that the two companies were "forbidden to undertake directly" -- deals Avista's own traders had questions about. 
Also, the commission said it had "uncovered preliminary evidence that El Paso and Enron may have engaged in actions that adversely affected prices." Both companies, working with each other, may have violated other federal rules, the commission said, like gaining improper preferential access to El Paso's transmission lines to "engage in highly profitable sale/buyback transactions with Mexican entities."
Tonight, Avista said "its trading practices were ethical and legal" and that its employees "had no knowledge of the strategies Enron may have been pursuing." El Paso Electric said it would "answer all of FERC's questions candidly, openly, and completely."
The 103-page report is only the initial finding of the commission staff. Once the final report is completed, its conclusions are subject to the approval of the four-member commission. It is investigating the matter with the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The energy commission found that the system for reporting prices for gas and power trades -- surveys done by industry publications -- may have been manipulated by traders. In one case, a trader at one company engaged in repeated back-and-forth trades with Enron with no economic purpose other than to win a TV in a contest for the highest trade volume.
"We found a lot of strange behavior that affected natural gas prices," said Donald Gelinas, the commission's associate director for the office of markets, tariffs and rates, who is leading its investigation.
"Some appears to be pure price manipulation, some was wash trades, and some was just clicking a key to win a prize," he said.
The investigation of price reporting, he added, has found activity that "looks very suspicious and appears to increase volumes and prices, casting enough doubt on these indices to no longer recommend that the commission" use them for setting rates.
Mr. Gelinas, however, cautioned that the commission staff had not come to any final conclusions. "We've still got some more digging to do," he said.

HEADLINE: CHILD-ONLY CASES GROW IN WELFARE 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
A surprising change has overtaken the welfare rolls in New York City and the nation. In more than a third of welfare households, the only recipients of benefits are children.
 The growth of such "child only" welfare cases has crept up almost unnoticed on policy makers focused on using welfare-to-work strategies to shrink caseloads and combat poverty. And recent studies show high rates of hunger and hardship among the young recipients of such aid. 
 Officials have barely begun to address the different challenges posed by these cases, including the amount of the grants themselves, as little as $68 a month in some states. 
But the share of child-only cases, up from 10 percent nationally in 1988, is becoming too big to ignore. The number of such cases, too, has been edging up since 1998, to 782,000 cases and more than a million children nationwide in 2000, and to 58,137 children in 34,337 cases now in New York City, which recently transferred 12,000 to a new welfare center without work requirements.
One reason for the rise is that some of the same rules and practices that sharply reduced the regular welfare rolls are gradually expanding the pool of children eligible for child-only grants.
Some live with disabled parents who receive Supplemental Security Income for themselves, often after having been found unable to work for family aid. Some are children born in the United States to immigrant parents, either illegal or legal immigrants barred from welfare by strict new rules in the 1996 federal overhaul. In a few states, though not in New York, some live with parents who have exhausted welfare time limits or violated the rules for aid.
But most of the children -- those in 54 percent of cases nationwide -- live apart from their parents, reared by relatives who have no legal responsibility to support them. Often they are with a grandmother, like the four grandchildren whom Rosalia Castillo retrieved from foster care three years ago: Stephanie, now 8, who wants to be a teacher one minute and a starlet the next; Anthony, 10, who plans to be a police officer; Francisco, 11, a would-be inventor of video games; and Crystal, 12, an aspiring dress designer.
Ms. Castillo, a former housecleaner with arthritis who speaks little English, has lived in a public housing project on the Lower East Side for 22 years. She recently qualified for Supplemental Security Income for herself. The welfare grant that she collects on the children's behalf is less than a quarter of what the government paid foster-care agencies to care for them.
But in her small apartment, where the aroma of Dominican-style chicken and rice lingers long after the last grain has been eaten, the children have a home. "My mother, she was living in a shelter a long time," Crystal explained. "I'm happy that my grandmother is taking care of us for now."
Stephanie hugged an old baby blanket and whimpered her dissent. "I want to live with my mommy," she said.
A spokesman for the city's Human Resources Administration, David Neustadt, said the new center in Jamaica, Queens, was handling 12,000 child-only cases by fax and telephone. New applications for child-only aid must still be made at local welfare centers, he added.
The city still has little information about households where only the children receive welfare, said Mr. Neustadt, who expressed surprise when he discovered from city statistics how large a share of the welfare roll was taken up by child-only cases. Officials do not yet know how many children from the 12,000 cases, which were transferred to the center in March, live with relatives. But a recent detailed study of New Jersey's child-only caseload found that 63 percent involved family members other than parents. Half were older than 60, and many were in ill health.
A stark picture emerged from the New Jersey study, which the state paid Mathematica Policy Research to conduct. One in four grants went to a family headed by a disabled parent on Supplemental Security Income, and more than half of those families had trouble getting enough to eat last year, the study found. Three in 10 went hungry. That is double the rate of food shortage that is typical at their income level, the researchers said, suggesting that high medical costs or parental handicaps may have played a role.
Among immigrants, who accounted for one in 10 New Jersey cases, half the families had incomes below 50 percent of the federal poverty threshold, 84 percent had no health insurance, and many were in severely crowded households, though they had lived in the United States for nine years on average.
"Clearly the work-first approach is not relevant for them," Robert G. Wood, a Mathematica researcher, said of child-only welfare recipients. "They need to be thought of as a separate population with their own problems and needs."
Not everyone agrees. Though few participants in the welfare debate have drawn attention to child-only cases, some critics see them as the last bastion of unlimited aid, and describe many adults caring for such children as people exploiting the system to avoid work.
Those critics urge that all able-bodied caretakers of children receiving child-only benefits be required to work, and that illegal immigrants who seek aid for their children born in the United States be deported.
The leading welfare-related bills in Congress do not include such measures, but the view underscores a basic conflict between the work-first philosophy that shaped the welfare overhaul, and the idea of raising welfare grants, which have not changed in most states since the mid-1980's.
Goals like reducing out-of-wedlock births and making work pay more than welfare have led to a system that increasingly ties additional aid to adult earnings, through tax credits and work subsidies like child care, rather than to the costs of rearing children.
If relatives do not care for children, foster-care payments cost about $1,000 per child each month in New York, and at least $450 in New Jersey, Mr. Wood noted. Child-only grants, on the other hand, start at $68 a month in low-benefit states like Texas, $162 in New Jersey, and $352 in New York, and increase only modestly with each additional child.
Nationally, more than 60 percent of all families headed by nonparent relatives have low incomes. Nearly half of these had trouble buying enough food, and about 40 percent had trouble meeting housing costs, according to a recent study by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research center.
The number of child-only welfare cases peaked nationally at 978,000 in 1996 after rapid growth during the late 1980's and early 1990's. It dropped to 743,000 in 1998, as other welfare cases fell much more steeply, then began to climb again. Even in New York, where regular cases have continued to drop in tough economic times, child-only cases have been edging up every year since 1998, and are now nearly 37 percent of the caseload. The most recent national welfare figures, released to Congress in May, show child-only cases accounted for 35 percent of the caseload in 2000.
Rob Geen, one of the study's authors, estimates that a quarter of all the nation's welfare cases involve caretakers who are relatives and collect welfare benefits themselves or on behalf of the children. But he stresses that in the larger category of children living without their parents, three out of four households headed by relatives receive no public cash aid, though virtually all the children are eligible. Some relatives do not want welfare because of the stigma, he says; some are unaware that help is available; and some have been wrongly denied help.
Several states are experimenting with programs that pay relatives more than welfare, but less than foster care, if children would otherwise be in state custody. But some economists suggest that approach has its pitfalls, too. If meager grants already encourage hard-pressed parents to leave their children with relatives -- a contention that grandparent advocates vigorously dispute -- higher subsidies for relatives could compound the problem.
Moreover, such programs do not address the needs of welfare children living with disabled or immigrant parents, who experience greater financial hardship, studies find.
In New York, where these categories often overlap, welfare-to-work pressures can bring additional hardship to grandparents like Maria Lemons, 63, the diabetic widow of a truck driver, who reared two grandsons in Brooklyn on a child-only grant and is still caring for a 16-year-old granddaughter. She said the city stopped the children's aid for eight months in 1996, saying that she had missed a caseworker appointment.
"Borrowing money, being afraid we'd lose the roof over our heads," Ms. Lemons recalled of that period. "Struggling to pay the electric bill so the lights would stay on."
She added: "They wonder why children feel left out and despondent. They tell you, have a computer in the house. A lot of people can't afford the electricity for the computer, much less the computer."
City officials have acknowledged that mistakes do occur, while stressing that the rate of errors has declined and that recipients have the right to appeal a proposed cutoff. They said that because of confidentiality rules, they could not discuss specific cases.
But Ms. Lemons's account was echoed in the research of Denise Burnette, a professor of social work at Columbia University who followed up a sample of 59 elderly Latino grandparents rearing grandchildren in New York City. After 1996, she found, many had lost cash aid, food stamps and Medicaid because they had run afoul of administrative rules aimed at moving recipients into the work force. A third had been required to work for benefits, before being found to be too old or disabled.
Even infirm grandparents seem to have taken the city's work-first message to heart. Maria Ortiz, a 70-year-old grandmother with legal custody of her son's youngest child, Christian Siacca, now 4, tried for three years to support him on her Supplemental Security Income benefit of $460 a month. When asked if she had ever skipped meals so her grandson could eat, she wept.
The underlying problem, she said, is that Christian's 68-year-old grandfather has prostate cancer, and needs four more months of work to qualify for a Social Security pension. "I told them, my husband is willing to go polish shoes and sell oranges," she said. His last job, she added, was cleaning telephone booths in exchange for welfare.
"I live from S.S.I. and I was afraid I was going to get in trouble if I asked for a cash grant," she said in Spanish, holding Christian on her lap. "I went to the welfare office and asked if they could at least help with food stamps. Twice they rejected me."
Workers at the Educational Alliance, a 113-year-old settlement house that sees many such cases, knew that Mrs. Ortiz was entitled to food stamps and urged her to apply again. At the welfare office, which also handles food stamps, no one mentioned that Christian was also eligible for a child-only welfare grant, she said, but she was finally granted $112 a month in food stamps.
She buys more groceries now, she said. "Spaghetti, juices -- I spend it all on him."

HEADLINE: BUSH AND THE ECONOMY: SPENDING CUTBACKS; 
Citing Economy, Bush Won't Spend $5.1 Billion Approved for Security and Other Uses

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would not spend $5.1 billion approved by Congress last month for domestic security, the military and a variety of other initiatives, saying reduced spending would help stabilize the economy.
 "More money spent in Washington means less money in the hands of American families and entrepreneurs, less money in the hands of risk takers and job creators," Mr. Bush said as he wrapped up his economic forum in Texas. 
 Some Democrats attacked the president's decision, saying that in an effort to look decisive and confront Congress over spending, he was blocking money for projects that he had supported. New York lawmakers were critical, because the money withheld included $90 million for a health study of rescue and recovery workers at the World Trade Center site. 
"Withholding these funds is a cynical attempt to avert attention from the administration's failure to revive a stagnant economy," said Representative Nita M. Lowey, the New York Democrat who is on the Appropriations Committee.
Other Democrats said they were not going to be drawn into a fight over the spending. They said they read Mr. Bush's tough tone as a White House effort to portray the withholding as a struggle between him and Democrats, even though the appropriations had broad Republican support, as well.
"We are not going to engage him on this," one Democratic aide said, adding that the party wanted to keep the focus on the economy and corporate wrongdoing. "He wants to make it a fight over Democrats and money."
Besides the health study, Congressional experts said the $5.1 billion included $600 million for the National Guard and Reserves, $273 million for the Coast Guard, $165 million for the F.B.I., $25 million to equip military aircraft with radios to communicate with civilian jets and $50 million for equipment to ensure that emergency agencies can communicate, a problem on Sept. 11.
"Which of these priorities does the president think is wasteful spending?" asked Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Byrd accused the White House of putting politics before the "safety of the American people."
The money included $400 million for election changes, $200 million to fight AIDS overseas, $200 million for Israel, $50 million for Palestinian relief and $275 million for veterans' medical care.
Mr. Bush acknowledged that he had backed some of the initiatives like the money to deal with AIDS, Israel and the Palestinians, but said that he would return to Congress and seek specific approval for those priorities, which total $1 billion.
Congress approved $28.9 billion in domestic security, recovery and military spending last month, including the final installment of $20 billion in aid to New York. Mr. Bush signed the legislation on Aug. 2. 
To resolve a conflict between the administration and Congress over spending levels, lawmakers made a list of $5.1 billion in projects contingent on Mr. Bush's declaring them emergency spending in 30 days.
To maintain pressure, Congress said that Mr. Bush would have to accept all or none of the projects, that he could not pick and choose among ones he supported and those he did not.
"Those are the rules they placed upon my administration," Mr. Bush said today. "I understand their position. And today, they're going to learn mine. We'll spend none of it."
An invited audience at the forum applauded.
Congressional aides said the fight represented an escalation in the tensions between the White House and Congress over control of spending.
"They think Congress should not have any input at all into the spending decisions," a Democratic staff member said.

HEADLINE: BUSH AND THE ECONOMY: THE ECONOMISTS; 
Far From Waco, Uninvited Scholars Ponder the Way to Recovery

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Bush administration invited only three economists to its seminar on economic recovery yesterday. If the room had been filled with economists instead of chief executives, the discussion would have been framed this way: Can consumers and business people generate enough demand to revive the sluggish economy? Or must government play a greater role to avoid another recession?
 Those are the questions a dozen economists who were not invited to Waco said they would have tried to answer had they been at the conference. While their responses in interviews differed, most shared the view that the private sector, for all its frailty, still had enough momentum to carry the economy to full recovery with modest additional help from government. 
 Even that could be delayed, said the Nobel laureate Robert M. Solow, who served in the Kennedy administration, in an era when stepped-up government spending to support a weak economy was standard practice.
"I would recommend waiting until fall to see what happens," Mr. Solow said. If the Federal Reserve's sharp reduction in interest rates turns out to be insufficient, then he would accelerate the spending of already appropriated money, but, to avoid running up a budget deficit larger than necessary, would not appropriate more.
"We might have to take projects planned for 2003 or 2004 and move them up to this year," he said, referring to road construction, airport expansion, education and other job-creating outlays earmarked for the future.
While there was much talk in Waco of a "fragile economy," President Bush nevertheless declared his confidence in the economy's "long-term health," suggesting in effect that a healthy recovery would materialize pretty much from the optimism and spending of consumers and companies.
"I think one of the things you'll hear," Mr. Bush said, "is that even though times are kind of tough right now, that we're America."
For William Niskanen, the libertarian chairman of the Cato Institute, that is too vague. "There was no focus in Waco," he said. "The administration did not present a coherent proposal for comment."
Nonetheless Mr. Niskanen said consumer spending and business investment were already getting a sufficient lift from the Fed's sharp cuts in interest rates and the stepped-up federal spending since Sept. 11.
Many Wall Street economists are similarly sanguine; certainly James Glassman, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, is. On the government-spending side, he said, there has been sufficient stimulus from tax cuts, military spending, emergency relief, extended unemployment benefits, farm subsidies and the like.
"Obviously the economy is floundering," Mr. Glassman acknowledged, "but we have not yet spent half the government money that has been appropriated."
Even that would not be enough for Robert J. Shiller of Yale, who in the late 1990's warned more than any other economist that a bubble had developed in stock prices and that when it burst, the damage would weaken the economy. 
"I would probably cut interest rates again now," Mr. Shiller said yesterday. "I am worried that the economy will dip back into recession from the unwinding of the bubble mentality still under way."
Mr. Shiller made that comment shortly before the Federal Reserve's policy makers decided yesterday against another cut in short-term rates. The key rate they control, the one that influences the others, now stands at only 1.75 percent, down from 6 percent 18 months ago. 
While the Fed acknowledged in a statement that demand had softened, it also said that the stimulus from the current low rate, coupled with an efficiently functioning economy, should be enough "to foster an improving business climate over time."
For James K. Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas, that sort of talk from the policy makers and their chairman, Alan Greenspan, sounded almost as optimistic as Mr. Bush in Waco.
"Mr. Greenspan should have cut rates," Mr. Galbraith said, "and one reason he did not was that he did not want to undercut what they were saying in Waco." 
More than most economists, Mr. Galbraith believes that government must support the private sector, stepping up public spending when consumer demand flags and, with it, business investment. He doubts that the private sector on its own can save the country from another recession or prolonged stagnation.
At the very least, Mr. Galbraith would have the federal government subsidize state and local governments, even if that meant rising deficits. Cutbacks in spending at state and local levels are diluting the effect of government spending at the federal level.
Mr. Galbraith's pessimism that the economy can recover on its own is shared by John Makin, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. 
"Spend if you have to, but cutting taxes is better," Mr. Makin said. "Give everyone a tax cut, and let them spend it as they wish."

HEADLINE: Surfing The Economy 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush tried to fix the economy before lunch yesterday.
 He managed to last for 20 minutes each in four economic seminars at Baylor University. He dutifully scribbled some notes as participants talked, looking as happy as a high school kid in trig class, and bounded out of his chair when Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill told him he could be excused. 
 "Yes, well," a visibly relieved Mr. Bush said, jumping up after an exhausting 18 minutes in "Economic Recovery and Job Creation," "that's the life of the president. Always has to go." 
Or as the radical economist Groucho Marx once observed: "Hello, I must be going."
The seminars lasted only an hour and a half. But Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney divided the eight so as not to overly tax themselves.
By the final session, Mr. Bush was staring into space, finding the talk of stimulus unstimulating. As the president told one group: "I can assure that even though I won't be sitting through every single moment of the seminars -- nor will the vice president -- we will look at the summaries." The CliffsNotes presidency. 
Before wrapping up with chicken salad, key lime pie and "Stars and Stripes Forever," the president did some cheerleading.
"Even though times are kind of tough right now," Mr. Bush drawled, "we're America." As usual when the president talks up the economy, the Dow dived under the bed, dropping 206 points.
He thanked all the "good folks" for "putting on a great show." Like his dad, W. reads his stage directions. It was a "Message, I care" P.R. pageant, so why not just say so?
His father, accused of being out of touch on the economy, got in trouble for checking his watch twice during a debate with Bill Clinton. That's why W. didn't even wear a watch while debating Al Gore. But, perhaps because of his short attention span, the younger Bush always gives the impression of checking his watch.
Although it seemed that Mr. Bush wanted to go deeper into his job after 9/11, he's still riding the surface, treating photo-ops like real events and passing off fortune-cookie comments as policy pronouncements.
This president's speed-dial economic summit was an interesting contrast with the last president's preening cult-of-personality economic summit a decade ago.
Mr. Bush, as always, seemed to be trying to get through the morning without saying anything that would expose him as empty-headed. He has a pathological fear of talking.
Bill Clinton has a pathological fear of not talking. He held a talkathon in Little Rock before he started his presidency -- also for self-serving P.R. reasons.
While Mr. Clinton wanted to convey concern about the economy he inherited from Bush pere, he mostly wanted to show off his wonkishness. Putting on the glasses he had rarely worn during the campaign, the smartest kid in the class dominated the room for two long days without yawning once. (The vice president, dragged back from fishing in Wyoming to scurry around the Waco sessions with Mr. Bush, was caught on camera stifling yawns twice.)
While Mr. Clinton designed his summit to show that Democrats could be cozy with Big Business, Mr. Bush designed his summit to show that he is not too cozy with Big Business.
At one of his drop-bys yesterday, Mr. Bush admitted to longing to see a few corporate malefactors in handcuffs. And White House planners were careful to scatter token blue-collar folks among the customary blue-chip folks.
The Bush family used to sit outside the Clinton White House, stewing that Bill had besmirched the honor of the Oval Office that they held dear. Now the Clinton family sits outside the Bush White House, stewing that W. has besmirched the spectacular (but somewhat artificial) boom they held dear.
The Clintons would love to see President Bush, lately of Harken Energy, endure his own equivalent of Kenneth Starr.
The scandalous condition of American capitalism has even provided Hillary Clinton with the political opening she needed. By insisting that the average American's financial well-being was better in Clinton times than Bush times, she is breaking ground for her presidential campaign in 2008. If she can wait that long.

HEADLINE: Mixed Economic Messages 

 BODY:
President Bush's stage-managed economic forum in Texas yesterday was billed as a chance for average Americans to express their views on the economy. Much was made of the wisdom of ordinary people, as opposed to Washington. It was thus striking that the Federal Reserve Board seemed to capture much better the American anxiety about the economy right now. The Fed did not lower interest rates, but it did suggest that the economy was not gathering strength -- a change from recent pronouncements. Understandably, the markets, which fell again, seemed to be paying more attention to the Fed than to Texas. 
 All economic projections are uncertain, but the present period seems more uncertain than any in recent memory. No one knows whether the nation is on the verge of recovery or another downturn. It used to be considered orthodoxy that economic fundamentals and the gyrations of the stock markets operated independently. The Fed's statements underscored how much its members had come around to the view that the unsettled markets had taken an economic toll and could do more damage in the future. It was almost as if the Fed was saying that it had done what it could by cutting rates but that other forces, not least the bad behavior of business, had upset everything. 
 The markets were also the major focus of attention at Mr. Bush's rushed half-day of economic discussions in Waco. The president again warned economic evildoers that "we will hunt you down" in tones reminiscent of his approach to terrorists. But there were no new ideas about the fundamental problem of restoring investor faith after a shattering series of scandals and business collapses. Mr. Bush once again called for passage of terrorism insurance to get construction started and pension reforms to protect employees whose savings are tied up in their bankrupt companies. These are worthy initiatives, but they will not galvanize the economy.
The forum drew more than 200 workers, business people and others to Baylor University, a short hop from the president's Texas ranch. He did well in conveying his faith that the economy would get back on track -- better than he does at news conferences, or even in his Wall Street speech earlier this summer. But it was dismaying that after promising a forum of diverse views, the White House ended up with something so transparently scripted that the words of many of the speakers echoed Mr. Bush's own speeches.

HEADLINE: BUSH AND THE ECONOMY: SYMBOLISM; 
The Options Limited, Bush Turns to Imagery

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush offered the country a carefully chosen set of symbols today to press a point that always seemed to elude his father: that he is quite committed to fixing the economy.
 By staging his economic forum in a populist environment where oil entrepreneurs have weathered booms and busts ever since the first gusher came in at Spindletop in 1901, Mr. Bush presented himself not as an intimate of corporate America but as someone who relates to everyday workers and small-business executives. As he aggressively defended his policies, Mr. Bush's word of the day was "optimism." He was bathed in placards with uplifting messages like "helping workers." 
 Some economists suggested that the focus on imagery was Mr. Bush's only real option, given that there is little official Washington can do -- or is willing to do -- that is likely to spur any short-term relief.
For all their nervousness that the economy could trump the war and emerge as the dominant issue in the midterm elections, Mr. Bush and his political advisers have ruled out any dramatic new steps to address a looming budget deficit that will appear in place of the surplus that had been expected to grow throughout the decade.
Already, the Federal Reserve has squeezed interest rates to very low levels. There is nothing the president can do with his newly acquired authority to negotiate trade deals that will deliver any short-term prosperity.
For his part, Mr. Bush has been adamant in not reconsidering last year's tax cut legislation -- and that leaves him little leeway to increase federal spending to prime the economic pump. The exception will be defense spending, which will expand rapidly with the expected testing and deployment of a ballistic missile defense system and a possible military campaign against Iraq.
"The real culprit in fiscal discipline is last year's tax cut, and you can safely assume they won't reconsider that," said William G. Gale, who as a staff economist in the first Bush administration witnessed the political debacle of the first President Bush's rollback on his no-new-taxes pledge.
Mr. Bush is clearly mindful that his father was sometimes attacked by his critics for caring more about his golf game than the worries of average Americans. Though the current President Bush is off again on a lengthy vacation, he seemed to be seeking to give the appearance that he is deeply engaged in economic policy.
The president stood at a podium flanked in the diversity of black and white faces, union and management representatives. The tableau was arrayed against the Christian conservative backdrop of the Baylor University campus. The symbols all were intended to underscore Mr. Bush's unifying leadership and strong moral compass. 
"People here are the people who really make America work: the entrepreneurs and the visionaries, the carpenters, the union heads, the educators, grandmothers," Mr. Bush said, adding that he wanted "a report from what I call the front lines of the American economy."
The report that Mr. Bush heard today from the carefully picked group, was respectful and seemed far removed from the hard edged reality of the unemployment line, the agony of bankruptcy and the grind of economic retrenchment that is roiling through the American economy.
When Delia Garcia, who heads the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, spoke, her complaint was that "when there is turmoil" in the boardrooms of giant corporations "it trickles down." 
Though he was born to the Yankee traditions of the East, Mr. Bush often knows how to connect with the populist Southwest, where public testimony, prayer and a little swagger to show your confidence are as comfortable as a cardigan in Kennebunkport. 
Texas is a place where people instinctively understand a president, engaged in a war against terrorism, when he says, "Let's roll," because words are seldom as effective as a well-timed gesture or phrase, the same kind of phrase-making that sunk Mr. Bush's father with, "It's the economy, stupid."
Earlier this week, as preparations for the economic conference were underway, Mr. Bush told a reporter, "Most Americans don't sit in Martha's Vineyard, swilling white wine." The allusion was aimed at the elitism of his Democratic critics and the policy salons Bill Clinton organized at Martha's Vineyard.
"I am not one who joins the bandwagon of criticizing the president for having an event like this," said Gene Sperling, who was President Clinton's economic adviser. "But I think it seems hollow when this is a moment when the country could use as true economic summit with Democratic and Republican lawmakers on how to make tough choices."
"I think that the administration succeeded in getting a nice picture of the president focusing on the economy during his vacation, but if there is no followup, there are continuing spiraling deficits and conflicting economic messages, this type of thing won't matter in the long run," Mr. Sperling said.
Perhaps for this reason, Mr. Bush spent much of his time today in Waco, Tex., touching the chords of American concern with a sense of compassion and a resoluteness about taking action, even where he did not offer a prescription. Among those concerns is the frustration of investors and pensioners that many captains of industry, a number of them Bush friends and political patrons, have yet to be called to account for the collapse of ponzi schemes they erected inside major corporations.
The president spoke to the nation's chief executives in the same terms he has reserved for Osama bin Laden: "If you break the law, we will hunt you down, we will arrest you, and we will prosecute you." But Mr. Bush said that the good news for the economy is that the "vast majority of C.E.O.'s are good, honorable people" who "care deeply about their shareholders and their employees."
He promised that he would take the newly passed corporate responsibility law "and we will hold those to account who do not uphold the high standards Americans expect from those of us in positions of responsibility." Mr. Bush said "us," though the president is not covered by the law. But accountability is something that every president understands.

HEADLINE: BUSH AND THE ECONOMY: THE ECONOMIC FORUM; 
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IS POSITIVE, BUSH TELLS TEXAS FORUM

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER with EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WACO, Tex., Aug. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he was optimistic about the long-term health of the beleaguered American economy as he heard from a selection of 240 carefully chosen guests who praised his policies at an economic forum created to showcase his concerns.
 "I think one of the things you'll hear is that even though times are kind of tough right now, that we're America," Mr. Bush said at the three-hour forum at Baylor University, a short helicopter ride from his ranch, where the president is on what the White House calls a working vacation for most of the month. "We've got the hardest-working people in the world. We've got the best tax policy in the world. I mean, we got a lot going for us." 
 The president offered no new programs or ideas to repair the economy, although he did choose the literal center stage of the forum to announce that he would not release $5.1 billion in emergency spending requested by Congress to fight terrorism, saying he wanted to move toward a balanced budget as soon as possible. 
"We'll spend none of it," Mr. Bush said. 
The money represents a minuscule part of the government's $2.1 trillion annual budget, and administration officials said the action was a signal that the administration that has plunged back into deficits could crack down on spending.
Even as Mr. Bush expressed confidence in the economy and defended his policies, the Federal Reserve issued a more pessimistic assessment. It said the decline in the stock market's and disclosures of corporate wrongdoing had prolonged a sharp slowdown that might require it to cut interest rates further.
Stock prices fell after the announcement, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 206.43 to close at 8,482.46. Page C1. 
Mr. Bush heard no dissent and no debate at an event where the theme was that the economy was going through difficulty, but that things were headed in the right direction. The forum has been heavily criticized by the Democrats and a number of Republicans as a staged pep rally for the second Bush White House, which is ever mindful of the fate of Mr. Bush's father. Former President Bush was enormously popular after the Persian Gulf war but lost the 1992 election in large part because of voters' perceptions that he no longer had control of the economy.
Most of the eight participants who spoke at a closing session of the forum echoed support for the president's agenda, including tax cuts and the proposed energy bill and, in some cases, reflected his phrasing from recent speeches. Seven participants -- three blacks, two Hispanic speakers and two white women -- mirrored the political concerns of the White House in the presidential campaign of 2004, when Mr. Bush will reach out to minority groups and women in an effort to expand support.
"The thing we all agreed about was that those tax cuts should not be temporary," said Phyllis Hill Slater, owner of an engineering and architectural services company, Hill Slater Inc., in Floral Park, N.Y. "They should be permanent."
Ms. Slater, who is black, enthusiastically praised Mr. Bush, saying, "I'm so glad to see you're on track." 
Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, said after the forum that he was "not aware" that the White House had supplied the participants talking points, but "that's not to say there weren't any."
Other participants spoke up for favorite Republican concerns. One said the estate should be permanently repealed. Another who called for limits on medical malpractice suits, an issue that Mr. Bush campaigned for last week in Mississippi.
Some participants, coming from nearly 40 states and including executives, economists, students, union leaders, professors, owners of small businesses and a sprinkling of Democrats, did sound concerns to Mr. Bush.
"The bear market that we're suffering right now is probably one of the worst I have ever gone through, and that's not a comfortable place to be," Charles Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive of the Charles Schwab Corporation, said in a panel on small investors and retirement security. Mr. Schwab, whose company manages eight million individual accounts, totaling $800 billion in assets, also told the president that the confidence of American investors was "at a very fragile point."
While Mr. Schwab was at the forum, his company announced that it was eliminating nearly 400 jobs.
Simultaneously, American Airlines, the world's biggest airline, said it would lay off 7,000 workers.
Democrats immediately attacked the event as a public relations extravaganza put on by a White House seriously worried about how the economy will affect the president's political future. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who is the House minority leader, called it a "one-sided affirmation of a failed economic policy." 
Senator Tom Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat who is the Senate majority leader, said it was a "made for TV forum."
Some Republicans criticized it as well. William Beach, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research and advocacy group in Washington, said the main purpose of the gathering was to shore up shaky public confidence.
"These are frightened people," Mr. Beach said, "and I think that is the main reason for having this fairly meaningless conference." 
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, one of seven cabinet members on hand, said the participants had not been told what to say. 
"I didn't prompt anything -- nothing," Mr. O'Neill said.
When a reporter pointed out that the White House had invited the participants, Mr. O'Neill broke in and said: "You know, give me a break. Frank Raines was here." 
Mr. Raines, chief executive of Fannie Mae, was budget director under President Bill Clinton. 
Mr. O'Neill added that "as much as you want to say this was cooked up, this had high energy."
Mr. Bush, who opened his remarks by thanking Baylor University for "putting on a great show," spoke with more of a Texas drawl than usual. He delivered his nearly half-hour of remarks surrounded by large placards with slogans like "Helping Workers" and "Improving Education." 
He sat between Vice President Dick Cheney and the president of Baylor, Robert B. Sloan Jr., and pounded his hand on the table for emphasis at least once. Mr. Bush's manner was more casual and folksy than normal for such a high-profile speech, and he appeared to be consulting note cards, not a prepared text. 
Mr. Bush said rescinding the next phase of his tax cuts, as many Democrats have called for, would be an "unmitigated disaster." At another point, he used language that he normally reserves for terrorists -- that his administration will hunt them down -- in referring to corrupt corporate executives.
"I say as plainly as I can to c.e.o.'s," Mr. Bush said. "If you break the law, we will hunt you down. We will arrest you, and we'll prosecute you."
Mr. Cheney, who flew here on Monday night and left immediately after the forum for a fund-raiser in Montana, said very little publicly, leaving the president at center stage. 
"I find that these sessions are best if I don't make a long-winded set of comments when I come in," Mr. Cheney said at a panel on education and workers, one of eight simultaneous 90-minute sessions. 
He added, "I look forward to sitting quietly and listening." 
At the main session for all the participants, the vice president twice stifled yawns. Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush spent 20 minutes each at four panels.
The gathering was markedly different from one staged by Mr. Clinton in Little Rock, Ark., in the transition after the 1992 elections. That forum lasted 20 hours and stretched over two days, a period when Mr. Clinton became immersed in arcane dialogues about taxes, education programs and subsidies for agricultural exports. Mr. Clinton made it clear that taxes had to be raised and spending reduced. But his forum ended with few clues about whose taxes should be raised and which programs should be cut.
Many participants today expressed wonder and gratitude that they had been invited at all. Van Eure, who owns the Angus Barn restaurant in Raleigh, N.C., said her family would have had to sell its restaurant if it had not been able to tap insurance policies to pay inheritance taxes. Ms. Eure was seated between Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Bush at the panel on corporate accountability.
"I'm just honored to be sitting beside one of my heroes," she said as Mr. Bush took his seat. 
The president responded, "Who, O'Neill?"

Bush, at Economic Forum, Calls for a Balanced Budget
President Bush, speaking at a forum created to showcase his concerns for the economy, offered no new programs or ideas. But he did announce that he would not release $5 billion in emergency spending requested by Congress to fight terrorism, saying he wanted to move toward a balanced budget as soon as possible.
 The $5 billion is a small part of the government's $2.1 trillion annual budget. Administration officials described the action as a signal that it could cut spending. Page A1. 

The administration invited only three economists to its seminar. If more economists had attended, the discussion may have been framed this way: Can consumers and business people generate enough demand to revive the economy? Or must government play a greater role to avoid another recession? A18.

Interpublic to Restate Its Results
The Interpublic Group of Companies will restate its financial results back to 1997 because it improperly accounted for $68.5 million in expenses. Interpublic, which delayed its earnings report last week to give its audit committee time to review its accounting, attributed the restatement to intracompany transactions involving its European operations. C3.

Former Chief of AOL Unit Departs
David M. Colburn, the former chief of America Online's business affairs unit, has left the company, a company spokesman said. C3.

Industry Fought Quit-Smoking Drugs
A study in The Journal of the American Medical Association says tobacco companies put pressure on drug companies to limit the marketing of nicotine gum and skin patches that help people quit smoking. A17.

Markets Fall After Fed Decision
The main market gauges fell more than 2 percent after the Federal Reserve announced it was leaving its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged. The Dow closed down 206.50, at 8,482.39, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 19.59 points, to 884.21. The Nasdaq was off 37.56 points, to 1,269.28. C11.

The downturn in equity markets is threatening to claim Nasdaq's trading venture in Japan. Nasdaq says it has made little headway against a number of regulatory hurdles, persistent economic weakness and an aversion to change. World Business, Section W.

A Loss of Confidence in Brazil
Less than a week after Brazil received a much-needed shot of confidence from a $30 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, fears over its economic prospects dragged down bond prices and its currency. World Business, Section W.

UBS's Drop Is Less Than Forecast
The Swiss bank, UBS, reported net profit of $876 million for the quarter, a smaller drop than had been expected. But the chief executive, Peter Wuffli, left, said that earnings for the year would decline because of sour stock markets and slipping profits from investment banking. World Business, Section W.

Biotech Companies Face Fines
The Environmental Protection Agency is threatening to fine two biotechnology companies for not complying with their permits for field trials of genetically modified crops. C5.

Retail Sales Increased in July
Retail sales rose for the second consecutive month in July, lifted by zero-interest financing for cars and an increase in gasoline prices. But the increase of 1.2 percent masked declines in the sale of appliances, building materials, clothing, electronic goods and furniture. C11.

Timing and Luck on Boston Project
A 36-story office tower, nearing completion in Boston, represents the culmination of 15 years of false starts. But for John B. Hynes III, who was able to make the deal happen, it represents a remarkable stroke of timing. Commercial Real Estate. C4.

HEADLINE: Playing Hooky? Can't Fool a Database 

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
FOR years, the daily grind of a Boston Public Schools truant officer has been pretty much the same. Hit the streets, seek out wayward youths and check for their names on your trusty list of students. Trouble is, that list is a computer printout (usually out of date) of about 63,000 student names, making it thicker than several phone books. It is, to say the least, awkward. 
 "You need a dolly to carry it around," said Elliot Feldman, who oversees Boston's attendance officers, as they are called. "You need a microscope to read it." 
 And on a gusty fall day in New England, forget about flipping through it. 
"A lot of people say Chicago is the Windy City," Mr. Feldman said. "They're wrong."
In September, Mr. Feldman plans to say goodbye to the printouts. With the help of the mobile telecommunications giant Nextel and a software and Web services company named AirClic, Boston's attendance officers are experimenting with souped-up cellphones that supply them with up-to-the-minute information on any student in the street. 
An officer types a student's name into the phone, and soon the display fills up with vital statistics, including age, address, attendance record and (gulp) parents' phone numbers. It even shows bus routes and allergies. The program also supplies the student's schedule, so the officer can quickly see whether the class skipped was Spanish or gym. 
"We grab the information from the Boston Public Schools system and get it back to the truancy officer in real time," said Phillip Riese, chief executive of AirClic. "We're talking seconds."
If an uncooperative student gives a friend's name instead of his own, the truant officer can quiz him to check his identity. As a next step, AirClic plans to outfit the phones with scanners that can read the bar code on a school ID card and find a student's file even more quickly. 
The Java-enabled Nextel phones work with the AirClic platform to cull information from the school system's servers. Soon, Mr. Feldman says, truant officers may be able to use the program to "bop a kid" as well, meaning check with the Bureau of Probation to see whether a truant has any outstanding warrants and may belong in jail instead of class. 
AirClic, which is based in Blue Bell, Pa., is adapting the system for other school districts. It has an application that can track students as they get on and off of school buses, another one that teachers can use to order classroom supplies and a third that tracks textbook inventory. The software does everything short of checking to see whether the dog really did eat the homework.
Because the system uses consumer-grade telephones and adaptable software, it may be economically feasible even for cash-strapped school systems. Boston is currently experimenting with the phones at no charge, but the actual cost would be about $20 a month for each of the 35 phones in use. 
The cellphone system was well received by veteran Boston attendance officers, some of whom have depended on their bulky lists for 30 or 40 years.
"They love their phones," Mr. Feldman said. "Hopefully, the big book will be put away in September."

 Re "Proposals Could Expand Memorial Site" (news article, Aug. 11): 
 I recently went to Wall Street on business and found that we do not need to build a memorial for Sept. 11, because Wall Street already looks like a cemetery under repair. 
The once-bustling district was devoid of people and cars, streets were closed and security made you feel as if you were in a war zone.
Wake up, Governor Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg! A year has passed, and the money is available to revive the city. What are you waiting for? Clean, beautify and repave the streets of Lower Manhattan and resuscitate the financial district.
Rebuild the World Trade Center into a symbol of 21st-century technology and innovation, as well as our strength in the face of terrorism.
We are seeing the demise of the financial district. We need leadership now.

HEADLINE: Iran Will Force Many Afghan Refugees to Leave by Month's End 

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Iran has announced that it will require tens of thousands of refugees to return to Afghanistan as of Aug. 27, angering the United Nations refugee agency and human rights groups. 
 The government plans to expel those who have not taken part in a census of immigrants that began a year ago. 
 The government, faced with a huge influx of immigrants and finding them an economic burden, has already refused to register children of illegal immigrants at schools and has started fining employers who hire Afghans who do not have the proper documents. Those who have registered for the census are still expected to return home eventually. 
Close to 2.6 million Afghans took part in the immigrant census. But the Iranian government contends that there are at least another 250,000 who have refused to take part in the program and must leave the country at the end of the month. Most fled into Iran as a result of fighting and famine in Afghanistan, and the numbers increased during the American-led campaign to oust the Taliban last year. Last month, Iran set an Aug. 11 deadline for unregistered refugees to leave, and then extended it to Aug. 27. After that date, they are subject to arrest and deportation.
On Tuesday, Ahmad Hosseini, chief of the country's immigration agency, said that Iran considered the government in Afghanistan responsible for the immigrants. "The displaced Afghans are considered immigrants, not refugees, and so they should return to the home country," he said. 
Iran's decision has angered human rights groups as well as the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, whose office says it has a right to review the cases of those Iran wants to expel, based on an agreement it signed with Iran. The agreement was signed in Geneva in April by Iran and Afghanistan and by the refugee agency. It lays down the main legal and operational framework for the voluntary return of Afghan refugees in Iran. 
The refugee agency contends that there could be people entitled to remain as refugees among those forced to return and that Iran's plan violates its commitments as a member of the United Nations Refugee Convention. 
Physicians for Human Rights, based in Boston, also condemned Iran's move and said that not allowing Afghan children to go to school would be in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Iran has ratified. 
The refugee agency's spokesman in Kabul, Maki Shinohara, told The Associated Press that the pressures on the immigrants from Iran's government have already prompted a large influx of Afghans back into Afghanistan and that the agency had insufficient tents to shelter even those who have returned already.
Afghans have become a burden on Iran's stagnant economy, which has an official unemployment rate of 14 percent. Many of the construction and agricultural jobs are taken by Afghans, who work for lower wages and under hard conditions.
Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari said last week that the Afghan immigrants benefited from the huge subsidies the government provides to hold down the prices of basic goods, but without paying income tax as Iranian citizens do.
Officials have also complained that the United Nations refugee agency's existing repatriation program has failed in Iran because only 1,500 Afghans have been returning to Afghanistan each day as opposed to the 2,500 initially expected.

HEADLINE: Inter-Korea Talks Offer Signs Of Progress, and Frustration 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
In the highest-level meeting between North and South Korea in almost a year, the North agreed today to discuss economic cooperation with the South and to allow another round of reunions of families divided by the Korean War, but it balked at setting a date for key military talks that would allow construction of road and rail links across the highly militarized border.
 The talks, part of a round of diplomacy with the United States, Japan and South Korea, come after North Korea has faced pressure from all sides. Japan stopped its food aid this year. South Korea reduced its aid sharply. President Bush included North Korea in an "axis of evil." 
 With food shortages looming, today's steps seemed to show that other countries have new leverage over aid-dependent North Korea.
"North Korea seems to want to improve relations with South Korea, Japan and the United States to tide over economic difficulties," Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Tae Sik of South Korea told foreign reporters today. "It looks like they realized they can't get any financial aid from the international society as long as military tension persists on the Korean peninsula."
The reunions, to be held next month, would be the fifth meetings in two years. The economic talks are scheduled for later this month.
Agriculture Minister Kim Dong Tae of South Korea announced separately today that Seoul would increase the amount of rice it planned to provide the North on credit beyond the 300,000 tons it had already offered. South Korea increasingly ties its shipments of food aid to progress in the bilateral relationship. 
On the thorny issue of military approval for road and rail construction in the demilitarized zone between the two nations, differing versions of the final statements seemed to indicate that North Korean officials were not able to reach agreements before consulting with the country's powerful military. 
The version presented by South Korea said, "The two Koreas agreed to hold military talks as soon as possible and also agreed that each side needs to secure military steps shortly to help build railways and roads between the two Koreas." 
The North's simply said, "Both sides agreed to make a proposal to their military."
Reacting to the lack of a date for the military talks, Mr. Lee said, "We're not 100 percent satisfied with the outcome."
In the two years since the leaders of North and South Korea met in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, and promised to open road and rail links, the South has completed its railway and road to within a few yards of the edge of the border. Satellite photographs indicate that there has been virtually no construction work on the northern side.
"Promises were made but haven't been realized," Unification Minister Jeong Se Hyun of South Korea told North Korea's chief delegate, Kim Ryong Song, on Monday.
Military cooperation is needed because thousands of land mines dot the abandoned demilitarized zone. 
South Koreans have been eagerly awaiting the renewal of reunions. In the South, about 10 million people, or one-fifth of the population, are estimated to have relatives in North. But the four rounds of reunions in the last two years have involved less than 2,000 South Koreans. The South Korean government recently calculated that of the 117,576 South Koreans, largely elderly people, who have signed up for reunions in recent years, 12.4 percent have died.
The economic talks, scheduled to take place at the end of this month in Seoul, will discuss the cross-border transportation links as well as a long-stalled industrial park in the North Korean city of Kaesong which would be open to South Korean factories.
The economic talks take on extra significance because the North Koreans have just taken a few cautious steps toward the kind of market economies embraced by China and Russia. According to diplomats in Pyongyang, North Korea this month devalued its currency, raised some prices toward market levels and granted large pay raises.
Trying to cultivate its richest neighbor, North Korea will hold talks with Japan on Aug. 25 and 26 on re-establishing diplomatic ties. An editorial Monday in the Rodong Shinmun, a North Korean state newspaper, advocated normalization of relations between the two countries.
The United States has yet to fix a date or an agenda for expected talks with North Korea.
"Movement in the North-South dialogue has always been a prerequisite for any progress in the North Korea-United States relationship," Victor D. Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University, said today in a telephone interview.

PERSON: Herman Daniel Farrell III 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
From Political Theatrics to Theatrical Narratives

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
HIS summer sublet is steps away on West 44th Street. But as the playwright Herman Daniel Farrell III, namesake of the New York State Democratic chairman, Herman D. Farrell Jr., surges up the steps of the New Dramatists club, he's a little late and a lot out of breath. He wears his cherubic 6-month-old daughter like a shoulder accessory; his mother, on baby-sitter duty because his wife is busy directing a rehearsal of his new play, pushes the stroller. His excuse for being tardy is so corny it must be true: it wasn't the oven-intensity Midtown heat that slowed him, but a celebrity sighting. 
 They had passed Al Pacino on the sidewalk, hence Mr. Farrell's inadvertent hyperventilation. Al Pacino! Imagine the casting possibilities! Somehow he gets over it, hands the baby to his mother, and produces the keys to the club, locked and vacant on summer Fridays, a perfect place to talk shop, or rewrite dialogue. Sadly, no dialogue flowed between Mr. Pacino and the playwright. With Mr. Farrell smack dab in the middle of writing a cycle of presidential-theme plays -- his Clinton-centric "Portrait of a President" is onstage at the New York International Fringe Festival and his off-kilter takes on G. W. Bush and George Washington are incubating -- it was tempting to envision Mr. Pacino in that plum Father of Our Country role. But kismet did not strike. 
 So Mr. Farrell, 41, bull-necked and graying of goatee, switches gears and gives a tour of New Dramatists, the playwright's haven that took him in on the strength of "Bedfellows," his 1994 ode to dad and inner-city politics. The club is in a reconstituted church, where Mr. Farrell writes beneath a stained-glass window of Jesus, occasionally bunks in the unlovely William Inge Suite, and test-drives new plays in workshop productions three times a year. He met his wife, Nancy Jones, when she stage-managed a "Bedfellows" workshop here; the same stage was host to their wedding reception.
New Dramatists is a godsend, but he still decries the corporate structure of "the institutional American theater."
"It shouldn't be economic forces driving the art," he says. "It should be art driving the economic forces. Sorry, I'm on my soapbox."
For the last month he's been holed up here working on rewrites for "Portrait of a President," which concludes a five-performance run at the Theater for the New City on Aug. 25. Four weeks of rehearsals for five shows? "That's the Fringe," says Mr. Farrell, unperturbed. It's the exposure that counts. Plus it gets him a breather from Midway, Ky., where he lives with Ms. Jones, a theater professor.
His play, set at the White House in the waning days of the Clinton administration, explores the iconic role American presidents inhabit in the national psyche. Four artists are summoned to the White House, ostensibly in the running to paint Bill Clinton's official portrait. In the course of competing and commiserating, they not only dissect his flaws but reveal their own.
"Within the play there are multiple narratives and a multiplicity of truths," says Mr. Farrell, who realized at law school that he wanted to comment on politicians rather than be one. "This is the postmodernist thing I'm so jazzed about, that we've come to accept the complexities of the human soul; it's the idea of both/and rather than either/or."
Simply put, the idea for "Portrait of a President" came to Mr. Farrell, a liberal Democrat whose disappointment in Mr. Clinton gave him party loyalty nightmares, after he tagged along with his father to a White House dinner in 2000. He agonized over what to say to Mr. Clinton, and whether to shake his hand, on the reception line. The scene is replicated in the play, where Mr. Clinton's sorrow counteracts the censure the character means to convey.
Presidential handshakes are touchstones for Mr. Farrell: he was 15 when he shook Jimmy Carter's hand at Mama Leone's restaurant and promptly announced to his father, a Manhattan assemblyman, that he intended to become president. Inaugurations, even that of George W. Bush, move him to tears. "I'm really not pleased that Bush is president, but I buy into the pomp." Still, he gets back at Mr. Bush in his next play, "43rd." 
He grew up in Washington Heights in a mixed-race home (his father is African-American, his mother Irish) but moved to Riverdale with his mother after his parents split up when he was 5. Racism became an issue: Mr. Farrell is light-skinned and often presumed white. The day the leader of his Boy Scout troop made a welfare joke he decided to heed his father's advice: "It taught me the lesson that the right thing to do is to out myself, that silence is passing." He was one of the writers of "Boycott," an HBO movie based on the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott, and racism is the focus of a coming cycle of plays.
Mr. Farrell attended Vassar, then dropped out of Fordham Law School after seven weeks, consumed by the need to write a play about Eugene O'Neill. In 1985, he was deputy campaign manager for his father's failed mayoral run, which provided fodder for "Bedfellows," the play that got him into Columbia University's M.F.A. program after he received a law degree from New York University in 1989. 
He was having coffee with a law school classmate, John F. Kennedy Jr., when talk of running for elected office came up: "He asked me if I thought of following in my father's footsteps, and I told him I thought I wanted to write plays. And he said, 'Well, we've got time.' "

HEADLINE: New Designs for a New Downtown 

 BODY:
The people in charge of rebuilding Lower Manhattan have decided, literally, to go back to the drawing board. One month after six preliminary plans for a new World Trade Center site were unveiled to almost universal scorn, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation announced yesterday that it would extend the design competition three months and invite architects from around the world to submit plans. The corporation said it was seeking excitement, creativity and energy -- three qualities that were conspicuously missing from the original designs. 
 Those designs were heavily burdened by a requirement imposed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, that any plan must replace all the office, hotel and retail square footage lost in the Sept. 11 attack. The new design teams -- which will be asked to include some of the more popular features of the original plans -- are expected to be given greater flexibility, allowing them to accommodate not only a spectacular memorial and significant commercial space but also the residential and cultural components that everyone agrees are essential to a vibrant neighborhood. 
 It did not go unnoticed that the Port Authority, which was closely identified with the six original plans, played no role in yesterday's announcement. And while officials tried to play down any dissension, it seemed clear that the development corporation had taken the initiative in the design process and that this was not entirely welcomed by the Port Authority or by Beyer Blinder Belle, the firm that put together the initial plans.
There is no room here for institutional jealousies. Rebuilding downtown is a huge and noble project, with plenty of work -- and credit -- to go around. The Port Authority, for instance, is now searching for ways to rejigger its contractual obligation to the World Trade Center's primary leaseholder, Larry Silverstein, that allows him to replace the original square footage. One possibility is a swap that would allow Mr. Silverstein to rebuild elsewhere in the city, thus freeing space at the trade center site for other purposes. That by itself would be a major contribution, giving the designers the room to create the downtown New Yorkers deserve.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Journal; 
Love and Money Bring Woe to a Rising Politician

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
When Antony Leung became this Chinese territory's financial secretary and third-ranking official last year, many looked at his 28 years as a banker at Citicorp and Chase Manhattan and predicted that he would prove a bland technocrat, like nearly every other top Hong Kong official.
 They were wrong. 
 In the last few weeks his love life, economic views and financial management have left gossip columnists and conservative economists sputtering, civil servants demonstrating in the streets, investors calling for his resignation and many would-be brides disappointed.
Mr. Leung's charisma, connections and now a new celebrity wife may still make him a strong contender to become the territory's next chief executive in 2007 when the current leader, Tung Chee-hwa, must step down. 
But for now Mr. Leung, 50, is struggling for political survival.
He recently appointed a two-member panel of inquiry to investigate a collapse of penny stock prices here. The collapse, on July 26, occurred after the local stock exchange briefly circulated a proposal to stop trading in some of the cheapest stocks. Mr. Leung declared that if the panel found fault with anything he had done, he would resign.
Coming a day after he announced his marriage to China's most famous athlete, Fu Mingxia, a four-time Olympic gold medal winner less than half his age, Mr. Leung's decision to take a prominent role on the stock market issue has put him on the front pages of tabloids and financial newspapers alike.
The marriage and stock scandal have captivated local residents of all ages. They have also prompted some to question whether Mr. Leung should have been spending less time on romantic courting and more on Hong Kong's economic troubles, which include record unemployment of 5.8 percent.
"He's a charming guy, I must say, and I hope that this is not the result of being too concentrated on his relationship," said Chu Mei-fong, 28, a secretary.
Tall, lean, dapper and rich, Mr. Leung was declared one of Hong Kong's most eligible bachelors when gossip columnists noticed soon after he took office that his earlier marriage, which produced no children, had ended in divorce four years ago.
Mr. Leung began to be portrayed as one of this money-conscious territory's heartthrobs, despite being the territory's equivalent of an American treasury secretary. When rumors began circulating last December that he was secretly dating Ms. Fu, tabloids began hunting for photos of them together.
He and Ms. Fu have been remarkably successful so far in protecting their privacy -- the local paparazzi had no luck until a week ago. On Aug. 11, Mr. Leung, with Ms. Fu, accidentally drove his Porsche over the foot of a photographer. 
Nor has Ms. Fu granted any interviews, even though she is a household name here and in much of China, not just because of her sports stardom but because of her many celebrity endorsements of Sprite and other products.
When Mr. Leung announced on July 30 that the couple had been secretly married two weeks earlier in Honolulu, some local newspapers compensated for the lack of photographs by pasting Ms. Fu's face above a wedding dress for their front-page illustrations.
Since then, the local news outlets have been buzzing with questions over whether Ms. Fu will be moved to the top of the long list of mainland Chinese spouses waiting for visas to move to Hong Kong. Mr. Leung insists that she will not receive special treatment.
Born and raised in Hong Kong, Mr. Leung is the son of a cook in a barbecued pork shop. He attended a government-subsidized Anglican high school on a scholarship and spent the last two school years sleeping every night on a cot in the school cafeteria because there was scant space to sleep or study at home as the third of nine children.
Ms. Fu, who turns 24 this week, is the daughter of laborers in Wuhan, in central China. At the age of 10 she left home to live and train at a state-run diving school 600 miles away in Beijing, only seeing her parents twice a year. Her first gold medal came in platform diving at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 at age 13.
Mr. Leung has won the ire of some local business executives and foreign economists by publicly abandoning Hong Kong's nearly laissez-faire economic policy, outlining a vision of the government as a "proactive market enabler."
He says the government should invest more in education and, in a few cases, "take appropriate measures to secure projects beneficial to our economy as a whole when the private sector is not ready to invest in them." 
Conservative American economists have been aghast at apostasy in one of their favorite cities. "I don't care how you rationalize it -- it's a different way to talk about markets," said Jerry O'Driscoll, the director of the Center for International Trade and Economics at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. "If you have the view that markets work, I don't know what the enabling is for."
He has also stirred controversy by trying to reduce the budget deficit through pay cuts of up to 4 percent for Hong Kong's civil servants.
His plan prompted a march last month by 30,000 demonstrators, the largest protest here since the killings of protesters near Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989.
While Mr. Leung's marriage may have provided a short public distraction from his political troubles, his new wife's status as a mainland Chinese citizen has also brought a new kind of scrutiny on Mr. Leung.
A political figure here who has discussed Mr. Leung's relationship with senior officials in Beijing, and who insisted on anonymity, said some of China's leaders were dismayed by Mr. Leung's romancing of a much younger woman who had spent nearly half of her life cloistered in a state-run athletic training school.
It may not have helped Mr. Leung that several Communist Party dignitaries are said to have unsuccessfully paid court to Ms. Fu in recent years.
In an interview in his office, Mr. Leung has said he received no advice or suggestions from Beijing regarding either his economic policies or his relationship with Ms. Fu.
"I think they do respect my private life," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 21, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday tracing the political rise of Antony Leung, Hong Kong's financial secretary, misstated the territory's unemployment rate, cited by critics as a matter from which he has been distracted by his marriage to China's most famous athlete, a woman half his age. The rate is 7.8 percent, not 5.8.

Messages in Concrete: The Aesthetics of Safety

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
CENTRAL SYNAGOGUE did more than simply rebuild its fire-ravaged sanctuary last year. With meticulous care, the congregation reanimated the profuse Moorish Revival splendor of its landmark home in Midtown, conjuring once again the fearless pride expressed architecturally when the synagogue opened in 1872: this is a place of Jewish worship and we are part of the fabric of New York.
 Then, this summer, it wrapped its building in a belt of spalling, rust-stained concrete along the Lexington Avenue and 55th Street sidewalks; a barricade almost three feet high whose message is: this may be a target and we have to isolate ourselves. 
 "It's heartbreaking," said Peter J. Rubinstein, the senior rabbi. "We're living in a heartbreaking world." 
The installation followed a warning in June from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that terrorists could use fuel tanker trucks against synagogues or Jewish schools. Two months earlier, just such an attack on an ancient synagogue in Tunisia killed more than 20 people.
"I think I can say universally -- even among those who believe that such structural barriers are necessary -- that there's a discomfort with both the look and feel of their presence," Rabbi Rubinstein said. "We'll do what we need to make it more aesthetic, certainly for the High Holy Days. More than that, we're looking long term toward a brutally new world."
"On the one hand," he said, "you want to project the psychology of protection and safety, to transmit to those who would do you harm that we're on guard against you, at the same time as you project an aesthetic, pleasing sensibility to those who would not do you harm. That's the dilemma we're facing and that will be facing others."
Many others.
Since Sept. 11, bollards, planters, fences and Jersey barriers (as the slope-sided concrete barricades around the synagogue are called) have become almost as much a part of the streetscape as newsstands and hot-dog carts, with little debate about their role in diminishing the public sphere.
Jersey barriers, developed in the late 1940's by the New Jersey State Highway Department, may be effective deterrents. But they signal on another level that we are in a state of siege. This is deeply unsettling in a city where fluid movement is the cultural and economic lifeblood.
Clearly, street-level security will be an important concern of planners at the World Trade Center site. For instance, how would a memorial be set apart from the streets around it? Corralled behind barricades that implicitly acknowledge that a terrorist attack could happen again at this very spot?
Officials at Lincoln Center felt they had no choice after Sept. 11 but to stretch a line of Jersey barriers across the front of the main plaza, softened ever so slightly by seasonal plantings -- cabbages in autumn, evergreens and berries in winter, petunias now -- along the top of the concrete blocks.
"Openness is part of our history," said Vincent Talamo, director of security for Lincoln Center. "We're trying to provide a safe environment for our clientele while keeping as much as possible of the artistic openness that's a central component of what we do." As many as 20,000 people might gather at the center.
The planned reconstruction of Lincoln Center will allow security "that's not so aesthetically displeasing," Mr. Talamo said. But it also means the barriers will remain for at least a while, since there would be no point in installing a new system that would have to be ripped out.
AROUND existing landmarks, there is little opportunity to incorporate barriers unobtrusively and almost no incentive to remove them once installed. After all, what institution wants to be thought of as risking public safety? Or to pay a penalty if an insurer believes that security is inadequate?
"Understandably, the quickest and cheapest means of protection are likely to go up when heightened security first arises," wrote Nancy Somerville, executive vice president of the American Society of Landscape Architects. "But the propensity of many such measures to become permanent fixtures should concern all of us."
"Hastily erected security measures signal the nation and the international community that we are afraid and care little for our national symbols and traditional values of accessible government and freedom of movement," she wrote, explaining the impetus for the new Security Design Coalition with the American Planning Association, the American Institute of Architects and others.
Next month, the coalition will sponsor a three-day symposium in Manhattan, taking up such questions as whether the deterrent effect of overt security measures outweighs the fear they may instill in the public. (Information may be found online at www.designingforsecurity.org.)
"This is a learning curve for the whole United States," said William B. Kuhl, the trustee for the New York chapter of the landscape architects association.
There is little time for the lesson. The transformation is already well under way.

Shares Rally, But Wall St. Shows No Sign Of Direction

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A day after registering their disappointment over the Federal Reserve's decision not to cut interest rates, investors sent stocks sharply higher late yesterday.
 In part, they were relieved that few big companies restated earnings as the deadline passed for executives of many big companies to certify their financial statements. Page C3. 
 Bargain hunters also stepped in to buy the shares beaten down a day before. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4 percent, finishing at its highest level since the market sank to five-year lows in July. The Nasdaq composite index surged 5 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3 percent.
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve's decision not to reduce its short-term interest rate benchmark, now at 1.75 percent, led to a sharp sell-off at the end of the day.
As investors fled stocks, they turned to bonds. The bond market rally continued early yesterday, sending the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note briefly below 4 percent, the lowest yield since 1963 for a note with 10 years to maturity. 
But by the end of the day, the bond market gave up its gains. The yield on the 10-year note was at 4.12 percent, up from 4.09 percent, a record low, on Tuesday. Just two months ago, the yield was 4.80 percent.
Because the note is an important element in setting mortgage rates, home-loan rates appear headed to their lowest levels in decades and could unlock billions of dollars in additional consumer spending from homeowners who refinance.
"The upshot of the current situation is that mortgage rates are now more favorable to consumers than they have been since 1965," said Phil Colling, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
In the stock market, investors seemed to take comfort from the Fed's signal that it might cut rates further if conditions worsen. The decline on Tuesday was fueled not only by the lack of an immediate rate cut, but also by investors' taking profits from the previous week's rally, the strongest since September.
To a large degree, the ups and downs of the last two days show many investors are playing the daily swings, buying and selling quickly to take advantage of volatility. Their trading decisions are not really driven by a longer-term view about the economy and what the Fed might do.
"A long-term view in this market is what is going to happen tomorrow," said Bob Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Asset Management. "There is no confidence in financial statements; there is no confidence in corporate governance. Right now, investors are afraid of the next crisis, so they cash out when they can."
Some of that uncertainty was assuaged yesterday as the deadline passed uneventfully for the senior management of hundreds of companies to certify the accuracy of their companies' financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The stock of Aon, the big insurance broker, got a boost after its executives said they were certifying financial statements. Less than a week ago, it disclosed that there was a federal inquiry into its accounting, but it resolved the issue yesterday by agreeing to restate earnings for the final quarter of last year.
Aon stock jumped 22 percent.
At the close, the Dow was up 260.92, or 3.1 percent, at 8,743.31, just below its post-July high of 8,745.45. The S.& P. 500 climbed 35.41 points, or 4 percent, to 919.62, eclipsing the recent high of 911.62. The Nasdaq index surged 65.02, or 5.1 percent, to 1,334.30, just short of its recent high of 1,344.19.
Oracle and Intel were among the stocks that led the sell-off on Tuesday but rose sharply yesterday. Oracle surged 10.6 percent yesterday after a 6.6 percent decline the day before, and Intel rose 9.5 percent yesterday after a 4.7 percent stumble.
General Electric fell 4 percent on Tuesday as companies dependent on airline business dropped sharply, and rose 3.1 percent yesterday. But other airline-sensitive companies, including Boeing and United Technologies, fell again yesterday.
Merck rose 2.8 percent yesterday after falling 3 percent on Tuesday, and Walt Disney climbed 5.3 percent after declining 3.2 percent Tuesday.
The fast pace of mortgage refinancing is reflected in the Mortgage Bankers Association's index of mortgage applications. It hit a new high in the week ended Aug. 2, with almost 70 percent of the applications for refinancing. The average contract interest rate for a 30-year mortgage fell to 6.13 percent, a new low, in the week ended Aug. 9.
"We are in a pretty big refinancing wave," said Yubo Wang, senior mortgage strategist at Morgan Stanley.
If the yield on the 10-year note moves down to and stays about 4 percent or below, the interest rate on the average Freddie Mac 30-year mortgage should fall to 6 percent, said Robert Van Order, chief international economist at the mortgage agency. This would be the lowest since Freddie Mac began keeping data in 1970.
Rates this low would make about 80 percent of outstanding mortgages eligible for refinancing, Mr. Wang said.
That refinancing, he estimated, could pump as much as $69 billion by the end of this year into the hands of homeowners who borrow new money when they refinance. Refinancing to lower monthly payments could bring total savings of $2.5 billion to $5 billion over a year, he said.
The importance of this refinancing cannot be underestimated at a time when the economy appears weak enough for the Federal Reserve to indicate, as it did on Tuesday, that it is ready to cut its short-term interest rate benchmark below the current 40-year low of 1.75 percent.
Over the last year and a half, the refinancing wave has bolstered consumer spending and the economy. Last year was a record for refinancings, and this year could be another.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
Paying the Price in Losses Overseas For Replicating U.S. Online Service

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
At the same time that America Online's domestic service is faltering, the strains in its nine overseas operations are becoming more apparent, too.
 As in the United States, AOL overseas is confronting a weak advertising market, slowing growth in subscribers and trouble competing with phone companies for high-speed service. In addition, it faces high telecommunication costs in some markets, economic turmoil in others and the disadvantage of being a late entrant in most. 
 AOL Time Warner has attracted 8.6 million subscribers outside of the United States by trying to replicate its cheerful formula for family-friendly Internet. But it has done so by incurring huge losses in largely trying to copy its blitzkrieg marketing style, with frequent television advertising, bountiful dissemination of software disks, and in some cases generous subsidies to make pricing plans attractive. 
This year, AOL expects the losses to come down sharply, as it scales back marketing costs. And it is close to turning a profit in Britain and maybe France. But Germany, its largest overseas market, with 2.6 million members, is still hobbled by high telecommunications costs.
And its Latin American unit, which is publicly traded, is in grave shape. Its shares now trade for 44 cents, giving it a market value of $30 million and prompting Nasdaq to start delisting proceedings.
Indeed, analysts wonder that as AOL's new management, Don Logan and Jonathan Miller, look to streamline operations, they may well focus on its international units, especially AOL Latin America.
"This is not a business," said Grant Smith, a Latin American analyst at the Yankee Group, a telecommunications research firm. "We don't think they will exist in 2004."
Indeed, AOL executives make no promises they will pony up more cash early next year, when AOL Latin America runs through the $160 million lifeline it extended in March.
"We are committed to the long-term success of AOL Latin America," said Michael Lynton, the president of AOL International. "As to funding, we will cross that bridge when we come to it."
Moreover, Mr. Lynton said that AOL had indefinitely shelved plans to enter other countries, like Italy and Spain. It is too late to enter some of the most technologically active markets in Asia like South Korea, he said. AOL's Japanese affiliate has fewer than 750,000 subscribers.
AOL had tried to minimize its risk by forming joint ventures with local partners, who would subsidize most of the start-up costs. AOL would provide technology, marketing support and content rather than cash.
This has created stable, self-sustaining operations in a few countries, like Canada and Australia. But in Latin America, AOL has had to finance much of its affiliates' losses. And after AOL agreed to buy Time Warner in 2000, it restructured its European operations, forcing it eventually to buy out its partners, paying $6.75 billion in cash to Bertelsmann and $750 million in preferred stock to Vivendi Universal. It is hardly clear that even if AOL Europe does become profitable it will produce a return to justify such a big cash outlay and the indignities of the debt AOL Time Warner incurred to pay it.
Last year, AOL Europe, which includes operations in Britain, Germany and France, lost $629 million (based on earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization) on $905 million in revenue. AOL Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, had a net loss of $307 million but had revenue of only $66 million. The company does not disclose results for its Canadian and Asian affiliates.
So much of the fate of AOL overseas stems from its decision to replicate its domestic offering around the world. It felt that its proprietary software and content created a product differentiation, although that required translating its service into seven languages.
More troublesome, the company strongly believed that the best offering was a flat monthly fee that included local telephone service. When AOL introduced its flat-rate plan in the United States, for instance, use shot up sharply, making customers more loyal and creating far more opportunities for online advertising. 
But at first, this was almost impossible overseas, because in most countries Internet users had to pay per-minute charges to their phone companies to dial in to the service, as they do for all local calls.
Indeed, these per-minute charges proved so lucrative to the phone companies that many started splitting them with Internet providers to encourage Internet use. This gave rise to the so-called free Internet services, which had no monthly fee though customers still paid the per-minute phone charges.
In Britain, some 500 free Internet service providers were started by newspapers, retailers and others. When the Dixon's electronics store introduced its Freeserve service in 1998, AOL's fledging British service stopped adding subscribers. 
AOL finally joined the party with a free Internet service using the Netscape brand. But it stuck to its guns on its main AOL brand, offering a variety of packages that bundled a set number of online hours for a fixed price. Eventually, many of the free providers simply closed and even Freeserve, which was bought by the Wanadoo Internet affiliate of France Telecom, began promoting subscription plans. AOL even closed the Netscape service this year.
More important, after a year of pleading by AOL, British regulators forced British Telecommunications at the end of 2000 to offer flat-rate connections on a wholesale basis to AOL, allowing it to offer an unlimited service of $:14.99 ($23) a month, since raised to $:15.99. Even though that rate is three times what the average Freeserve customer pays in a month, AOL has been growing since it introduced the plan, attracting nearly two million members.
"Flat rate is what customers are looking for," Mr. Lynton said. "When you offer it, you get a big surge in subscriber growth."
Indeed, the fruits of a similar lobbying effort in France will emerge on Monday when AOL introduces an unlimited-service plan that costs 24.99 euros ($24.49) a month to its 1.2 million members. In Germany, however, Deutche Telecom is appealing a government ruling that would force it to sell unlimited service to AOL.
Even as AOL moves to profitability in a few countries in Europe with its traditional dial-up service, it may face similar challenges all over again offering high-speed service, mostly using a phone technology known as digital subscriber line, or D.S.L.
European phone companies are setting the wholesale price of their high-speed service so high, said Michael Steib, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, that AOL and other Internet companies can barely make a profit.
In Latin America, things have gone badly for AOL from the start. AOL Latin America was formed in 1998 as a joint venture with the well-connected Cisneros Group of Venezuela. Banco Itau of Brazil joined the venture in 2000.
An effort to raise money through an initial public offering in 2000 was troubled as the stock price was cut from $15 to $8, and AOL and Cisneros were forced to buy a third of the shares of the offering.
The service has run phenomenal losses, as its marketing expenses were three times its revenue. What's more, AOL has found it difficult to be paid, especially in Brazil, because people generally prefer paying bills by cash rather than by credit card, as AOL prefers. 
Indeed, Mr. Smith of the Yankee Group estimates that more than 60 percent of AOL's 1.3 million Latin American subscribers are on free trials or otherwise not paying their bills. (AOL says Yankee overestimates the number of free subscriptions, but it will not give numbers of its own.) 
"AOL is a new entrant and very late to the game," Mr. Smith said. "They haven't been getting the right sort of customer, and they have a higher cost structure than their competitors."
The Latin American local phone companies have an even greater advantage than those in Europe in offering their own Internet service. Not only do they control the networks, but they also have existing billing relationships with customers, who typically pay cash in bank branches and storefront locations. 
Making things worse, of course, has been the economic turmoil in Argentina and Brazil, which led to sharp currency devaluations. AOL raised its prices faster than its local competitors. In 2001, AOL and its partners invested another $150 million. But when that money ran out, Cisneros and Itau decided not to invest again. Last month Itau wrote off $82 million, its entire 12 percent stake. 
So in March, AOL Time Warner advanced a $160 million credit line to the Latin unit. But that money will run out next year.
Charles Herington, chief executive of AOL Latin America, says AOL Latin America's losses have been heading down each quarter. It is concentrating its marketing on attracting better customers. And it is developing new payment methods.
Mr. Lynton said that while AOL's service in Brazil and Argentina faced significant challenges, its offering in Mexico appeared on track to be a strong No. 2 to the Prodigy service of Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex.
Competitors say that AOL is facing a quandary. It is retreating to the market segments, and perhaps countries, in which it has the greatest advantages. But in many ways the Internet business is most profitable, as AOL has found in the United States, for those with the broadest reach.
"They have cherry-picked the most attractive markets," said Renato Soru, the chief executive of Tiscali, the Italian Internet service provider. "To make money you need a very large scale, and there is no one country that will give the large number of customers that you need."

HEADLINE: The Rising Cost of Health Care 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your Aug. 11 front-page article about the factors that have contributed to the explosion of spending for health care didn't mention the impact of end-of-life medical care. Too often, extremely ill and dying patients are subjected to multiple interventions and prolonged stays in the intensive-care unit without a realistic chance of long-term survival. 
More than one-quarter of Medicare dollars are spent in the last year of life. 
 Until we are better able to confront end-of-life issues as a society and shed our belief that life must be prolonged at all cost, we will continue to have difficulty controlling health care inflation. With more technology, procedures and medications, and with an aging and more ill population, the problem will only be compounded.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "No Cut in Rates as Fed Lowers Its Assessment of the Economy" (Business Day, Aug. 14): 
 If lower interest rates aren't passed on to consumers, nothing the Federal Reserve does will affect the economy. 
Lower interest rates have increased the profits of the credit card companies but have done nothing to help consumers, the engine of economic growth. Credit card debt approaches $500 billion. 
Instead of passing on lower interest rates, the banks have raised credit card interest rates (now 15 to 28 percent) and raised fees for late payment and overlimit balances. 
Unless the windfall is shared, consumers will slow their credit card spending, the recovery will falter, and the Federal Reserve will be helpless to prevent the decline of consumer spending.

HEADLINE: Putting Garbage To Good Use 

BYLINE:  By Steven Cohen; Steven Cohen directs the graduate program in earth systems, science policy and management at the School of International and Public Affairs and the Earth Institute, both at Columbia University.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's recent proposal to develop garbage-transfer stations to compact refuse and send it away by barge is a step in the right direction. The stations, to be placed in waterfront locations throughout the city, would replace a system that uses thousands of polluting, diesel-fueled trucks daily to haul garbage through the city's streets to landfill sites in other states.
 Now the city should find, indeed create, better destinations for the 11,000 tons of household refuse that New Yorkers produce every day. In doing so, New York could help itself and several cities and towns along the Hudson River that need to revive their economies. 
 Currently, the city contracts with private vendors to ship its waste and dispose of it in out-of-state landfills. But the private waste-management business is composed of a small number of large companies and is thus not very competitive. This has contributed to astronomical garbage disposal costs. The Sanitation Department's operating costs reached $1 billion last year.
A better approach would be for the city to build its own sites in some of the depressed localities that dot the Hudson's shores. Under such a plan, sponsored together with the state, New York City could build high-temperature incinerators that generate electricity, known as waste-to-energy plants, in industrial sections of these towns. In exchange, the city could offer free or reduced-cost garbage disposal for participating towns and perhaps low-priced electricity (generated by the incinerators) to businesses that put offices or factories in these localities.
If needed, additional incentives, like help with building new public schools or recreational areas, could be offered under such a state-sponsored program.
This approach has already been used for a clean-water project within New York City. About 15 years ago, the city and state worked with the West Harlem community to build a sewage treatment plant in that neighborhood. As an incentive, the state (with city and federal help) built the 28-acre Riverbank State Park on top of the plant, complete with a soccer field, indoor and outdoor swimming pools and an ice skating rink.
Indeed, when it comes to garbage, neighborhoods in New York City might also want the kind of economic or social benefits the Bloomberg administration and the state could offer to upstate localities participating in a waste-to-energy program.
All methods of garbage disposal produce some environmental pollution. But waste-to-energy incinerators, especially when they are built to be as environmentally protective as possible, produce less pollution than diesel-fueled trucks and landfills do.
Waste-to-energy plants also reduce by 90 percent the volume of refuse that must be placed in landfills, all of which eventually release pollution into the surrounding environment.
New York City needs to own its entire garbage disposal system to ensure that costs are predictable and as low as possible. Parts of the operation could still be contracted out to private firms via competitive bidding. But the city must be in charge from the beginning of the process to the end. Otherwise costs will continue to grow.
To be sure, upstate incineration plants are not the whole solution to New York City's garbage crisis. The city must also reduce waste and do a better job of recycling. It can start by raising the deposit on bottles from a nickel to 50 cents or a dollar so that fewer bottles are simply discarded for convenience. And deposits should be required on all bottles and containers, not just those holding carbonated beverages.
The city should also reinstate its recently halted recycling of glass and plastic. It took many years to get New York City households into the recycling habit. We have tossed out years of effort for short-run budget savings, when in the long run waste reduction through recycling can save dollars. If there is no market for recycled glass and plastic, why not build our own recycling plants and create our own market?
The Bloomberg administration's waste-transfer proposal is a creative step toward solving New York City's garbage crisis. Now let's finish the job just as creatively.

HEADLINE: The Democrats and the War 

BYLINE:  By Ted Widmer; Ted Widmer, director of the C.V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience at Washington College, was director of speechwriting at the National Security Council from 1997 to 2000.

DATELINE: CHESTERTOWN, Md. 

 BODY:
The subtext to the current debate over America's foreign policy is history -- in particular, the Democratic Party's history of international engagement. Republicans are dismissive of it; Democrats have forgotten it. Neither approach serves the country.
 The most recent example was the reaction to Senator John Kerry's speech last month about United States foreign policy, in which he criticized the Bush administration's conduct of the war in Afghanistan and its looming but still sketchy plans for an invasion of Iraq. Reaction from the White House was unsurprisingly partisan: "The closer it gets to the election," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, "the more the Democrats will be tugged to the left and the more divisive they'll become." Many Democrats, meanwhile, were unenthusiastic. One strategist said Democrats should focus on national issues and not talk about foreign policy at all. 
 These responses suggest that Mr. Kerry is on to something. First there is the curious Republican notion that it is somehow "divisive" to seek a better-defined foreign policy. Then there is the strange Democratic reluctance to engage in a serious discussion about one of the most important issues now facing the country.
Thus both parties are ignoring the constitutional responsibility of the Senate and the long history of Democratic internationalism. A genuine bipartisan debate, reviving this history, will go a long way toward sharpening our policy and enlisting the support of all Americans.
Fifty years ago, the Republican Party was unambiguously the party of isolation. In 1952, Americans elected a Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and a Republican majority in the Senate. After decades of Roosevelt and Truman, America-firsters were ecstatic -- and soon after the inaugural, the Republicans nearly succeeded in crippling the president's ability to conduct foreign policy.
The Bricker amendment, introduced by Senator John Bricker, Republican of Ohio, would have severely curtailed the executive's ability to negotiate treaties and engage American troops, making him accountable not only to Congress, but also to 48 state governments. It was Senate Democrats, as Robert Caro shows in his latest book, who blocked this amendment.
Throughout the 20th century, Democrats led America's great international efforts -- including both World Wars, the thwarted attempt to join the League of Nations and the more successful struggles in the late 1940's to create the United Nations and NATO. Those policies were improved when great Republican voices, like Arthur Vandenberg's, helped to shape them. And those policies were threatened when knee-jerk resistance came from the isolationists, usually in Republican precincts in the upper West and Midwest. Some honestly believed that any attempt to send American boys overseas was immoral. Others, like Joe McCarthy, criticized what they saw as "Democratic" foreign policy -- the Marshall Plan, containment, anything said by Dean Acheson -- to advance their own darker designs.
McCarthy's accusations were ludicrous. But there may be some truth to the idea that Democrats are generally more eager to join American interests to the rest of the world. Democrats are not always right, to put it mildly. But they generally get the idea that America is stronger leading others than standing alone.
This activist legacy should be a source of pride for Democrats in Congress. Yet surprisingly few include foreign policy in their portfolio. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has been notably reticent about foreign policy since his patriotism was questioned in February after he criticized the Bush administration's war on terrorism. Leading Democratic senators, for their part, have not offered him much support.
Part of the problem is the subtle perception, fed by Republican strategists, that Democrats lack the credentials to conduct foreign policy and oversee defense matters. It is difficult to know when Republicans began to make this argument -- or when Democrats began to believe it.
Certainly there was no trace of the idea a generation ago; from 1960 to 1984, every Democratic presidential candidate except Jimmy Carter was a current or former senator with strong foreign-policy credentials. Perhaps the travails of our hostages in Iran had something to do with it, and the fact that their release coincided so neatly with President Ronald Reagan's inauguration. Some damage was surely self-inflicted; Michael Dukakis's ill-advised ride in a tank did little to reassure voters of his defense expertise.
Another part of the explanation is demographic, not political. Ten years ago, Democrats sensed a growing ennui with foreign policy -- an accurate perception that helped win Bill Clinton the White House. The 2000 campaign focused less on foreign policy than any campaign in memory.
Now foreign policy is a growth area again. Democrats -- particularly presidential contenders -- have much to gain by shaping their posture to a set of issues around the world that demand real leadership. Not just because these issues are vitally important, but because many of our most enlightened policies are traceable to the Clinton administration. Clearly, the Republicans are quick learners. More than a few of the policies denounced by the Bush campaign have been quietly embraced by the Bush administration, to its credit: economic bailouts, so-called nation-building and strategic cooperation with Russia and China.
But more needs to be done. Any attempt to build peace in the Middle East will have as its starting point the Clinton proposals. In North Korea, the Balkans and Northern Ireland, we need to avoid the tragedy of backsliding after years of hard work. An urgent case like Iraq warrants a full and open conversation between political leaders of all persuasions.
Partisanship may explain the nervous response to Mr. Kerry's critique. But it is wrong to stigmatize a senator -- especially one from the party of Fulbright, Mansfield and Muskie -- as "divisive" merely because he demonstrates a healthy curiosity about the future of our foreign policy. Not only is this accusation historically inaccurate but, to use one of McCarthy's favorite words, it is also un-American.

HEADLINE: The Anger of Arab Youth 

 BODY:
Throughout the Arab world, millions of young people resent America and the West. They cite specific grievances, including American support for Israel, the Bush administration's threats to attack Iraq and Washington's support for repressive Arab dictatorships. But their rage has much deeper roots. To a large degree it is the result of the sharply felt contrast between the past glories of Arab civilization and its current dismal prospects. 
 These young people are painfully aware that their societies are falling behind the rest of the world economically and technologically, limiting their own future prospects. The America young Arabs protest against is often an image built on caricature and contradiction. Some see the United States as thoroughly corrupted by materialism and immorality. Others blame Washington for not doing more to bring prosperity and democracy to the Arab world. 
 Yet these are perceptions America cannot afford to ignore. The Arab League's 22 countries are home to some 280 million people, more than one-third of them under 15. Beneath their soil lies well over half the world's known oil. Political stability in most Arab countries rests on hereditary ruling families or repressive one-man dictatorships. If Washington fails to develop effective new initiatives aimed at Arab society at large, America will face threats from this region for years to come. 
As a first step, Washington needs to become a more convincing and consistent advocate of democracy in the Arab world. It also has to do a better job explaining its policies on Iraq and Israel, a point the Bush administration has become more attentive to since Sept. 11. 
Earlier this year President Bush asked the State Department to look for ways to expand economic and educational opportunity and political rights in the Arab Middle East. Education is highly valued in the Arab world, but budgets are starved and teaching is heavily weighted toward traditional subjects that poorly prepare graduates for today's jobs or for the kind of critical thinking that would lead to internal reform. At the primary level, Washington should support efforts to expand access to educational opportunities to girls as well as boys, and to modernize curriculums. At the high school and college level, a publicly funded American foundation could help with everything from construction and teacher training to expanded American studies programs. 
Washington needs to offer stronger financial and diplomatic support to independent organizations working to promote electoral democracy. America should take up the cause of these groups when governments try to shut them down. 
The Bush administration must commit substantial resources to these long-term efforts to promote education, democracy and a more informed understanding of America. Without a sustained campaign to reach the next Arab generation, Washington is likely to face hostility and distrust in the Mideast for many years to come.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Looking at the Books, The Government Way

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Today was the deadline for hundreds of corporate chief executives to certify that they have not cooked their books, so Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who styles himself a crusader for fiscal responsibility in government, challenged the Bush administration to do what it is demanding of the private sector: sign an oath that its numbers are for real.
 Mr. Hollings, who contends that the government hides its debt no less egregiously than Enron did, asked Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, to swear personally to the accuracy of the government's financial reports. 
 Of course, the government is not a corporation, and Mr. Hollings's request, which the White House largely ignored, was a classic political stunt. 
But it got at a real issue that has transcended administrations and parties and grown in complexity with the government. By any standard, Washington does not do a good job of keeping its own books. Mr. Daniels issued a report card this year on government performance that gave poor grades for financial management to every major cabinet department, and his own agency to boot.
"This is a serious subject," Mr. Daniels said. "No one could attest to the accuracy of the government's books."
It is also clear that hardly anyone, from President Bush on down, has a firm grasp of the government's finances -- and that taxpayers, perhaps now more than ever, find this failing to be somewhere between annoying and infuriating. 
Consider this exchange on Tuesday at the president's economic summit in Texas between June Lennon, an accountant from Greenville, S.C., and Mr. Bush.
Government, Ms. Lennon told Mr. Bush at a session on corporate responsibility, should lead by example.
"Some of these reports we hear of agencies who lose track of equipment and agencies who can't balance their books are not much better than the corporations who do the same or balance them wrongly," she said. It would be wonderful, she added, if the government could show that it "wants to be responsible and accountable, too."
Mr. Bush replied that the government's accounting system was pretty hard to explain. "I've been there for nearly 18 months trying to figure it out," he said to laughter.
The government does present a detailed accounting of its financial condition. For the last five years, the Treasury Department has prepared what amounts to an annual report, complete with a statement from "management" -- the executive branch -- and an auditor's opinion prepared by the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress.
The most recent report, covering 2001, was signed by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. It concluded that the government ran a deficit of $515 billion, using the accounting rules that are supposed to govern corporations. 
By the accounting techniques normally used by Washington, the government posted a surplus last year of $127 billion. The difference stemmed largely from competing methods of accounting for health and pension costs.
Administration officials said the report showed progress in putting the government on a businesslike footing. But the General Accounting Office said there were still so many weaknesses in the government's financial systems that it could not certify the report -- the equivalent of a company's accounting firm declining to sign off on its client's books.
The government's finances continue to be opaque, complex and driven by politics in a way that private-sector bookkeeping generally is not. 
Congress, by all accounts, does not help matters. 
Just in the last few years, it has proposed or passed all kinds of gimmicks. Among them were shifting tax payments from one fiscal year to another to make the nation's fiscal condition look better and declaring one of the government's most predictable functions, the once-every-10-year census, to be an emergency that needed to be paid for out of a special pot of money.
Mr. Hollings and Mr. Daniels agreed that one of the biggest problems was the way the government failed to account for its promises to pay future Social Security and Medicare benefits, payments for which it has not set any cash aside.
But as companies scrambled today to reassure investors that their numbers could be trusted, the differences between corporate and government standards were a tempting political target.
"Corporate C.E.O.'s were willing to face the truth and tell the public if their books were honest or cooked," Mr. Hollings said. "Just one day after the administration's much-hyped 'Economic Forum,' Mr. Daniels failed to provide the honest economic leadership that this country obviously needs right now."
Mr. Daniels said he would have a reply to Mr. Hollings ready in a day or two.

HEADLINE: Bush Takes His Optimism on Economy to Iowa State Fair 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush today took his message of cheer about the gloomy American economy to the fertile political grounds of the Iowa State Fair, where he spoke between appearances by two of his potential 2004 Democratic competitors, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
 The sprawling Iowa fair, a must stop for politicians, was still too small for all three men at once, and their arrivals were timed so that they could avoid one another. Mr. Gephardt left shortly before the president's entourage pulled onto the grounds this afternoon, while Mr. Lieberman came in the evening, when the crowded walkways were clear of Mr. Bush. 
 "We get a lot of that here," said Scott Hunter, 36, a Des Moines immigration lawyer who watched Mr. Bush speak against a backdrop created by the White House that showed gleaming red and green tractors and bales of hay.
The president used his time in a crucial electoral state, where the fields are bursting with corn and soybeans, to promote a bill he signed last week, called trade promotion authority, which he said would improve the lives of Iowa farmers. "What we're good at is growing food and hogs and cattle," Mr. Bush said to a crowd that included flush-faced children, a Miss Iowa State Fair in a tiara and the farmers the White House needs to win in the 2004 election. "And it's my job and the job of this administration, now that I've got trade promotion authority, to do everything we can to knock down the barriers so you can be selling your products all over the world."
The bill allows the president to negotiate trade agreements with foreign countries without intervention by Congress, and Mr. Bush said today that the nation's trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, and Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman would make trade deals a top priority. "My man, Zoellick, who is a trade guy, and Ann Veneman, are going to work hand in hand to make sure agriculture is the cornerstone of good international trade policy, and it needs to be," Mr. Bush said.
The president also told the crowd that he had held an "economic summit" on Tuesday at Baylor University in Waco, Tex., but he spent little time talking about an event that was derided by Democrats, some Republicans and much of the news media as a stage-managed public relations stunt to showcase the president's concerns about the economy.
"We may have hit a bump in the road," Mr. Bush said. "That road is going to smooth out, and people are going to find the economic security they want here in America."
Mr. Lieberman said that Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, because of their own business dealings, should not be "lecturing" Americans about the responsibilities of corporate executives to keep their books clean. Mr. Lieberman was referring to questions about Mr. Bush's stock dealings at Harken Energy, an oil company on whose board the president once served, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into accounting practices at the Halliburton Company, the oil services giant where Mr. Cheney was chief executive.
"They are kind of lecturing the rest of America on the ethics of corporate America," Mr. Lieberman said, adding that "they ought to be lecturing each other."
Showing that the Democrats will continue to use the nation's corporate scandals as a weapon against the White House, Mr. Lieberman said that "the president and vice president themselves have been involved in stories about Halliburton and Harken Energy that still have not been adequately explained to the American people."
Mr. Gephardt spoke at a news conference and criticized the Bush administration for its efforts to shift part of Social Security into private investment accounts. "We all know there are risks in the stock market," Mr. Gephardt said. "We don't want risks in Social Security because we want it to be there."
Mr. Bush began his day at his 1,600-acre ranch near Crawford, Tex., then flew to Milwaukee, where he promoted his economic agenda and raised $600,000 for Gov. Scott McCallum of Wisconsin, who polls have shown as running even with or behind likely opponents. Then Mr. Bush traveled to the fair and Des Moines and appeared this evening at another fund-raiser, this one for Doug Gross, the Republican candidate for governor against the incumbent, Tom Vilsack.
Mr. Bush happily recognized Mr. Vilsack in the afternoon crowd at the fair, then raised $1.3 million for Mr. Gross this evening.
Mr. Bush is to visit Mount Rushmore in South Dakota on Thursday, then return to his ranch that evening.

HEADLINE: Musharraf Assails Islamic Militants, but Stands Firm on Kashmir 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
In a nationwide address to observe Pakistan's independence day, President Pervez Musharraf lashed out today at Islamic militants, calling last week's attacks on a Christian school and hospital "shameful" and "despicable."
 "Where is the tolerance, the magnaminity, the chivalry and the large-heartedness that characterized true Muslims?" asked General Musharraf, who vowed to "break the back" of the groups. "We were never so cowardly as to hide, and then to try kill women and children." 
 At the same time, the general vowed that Pakistan would not back away from its demand for a United Nations-monitored referendum to allow the people of the contested Himalayan territory of Kashmir to choose whether to join Pakistan or India or become independent. 
India, which controls roughly half of Kashmir, adamantly opposes a referendum and has accused Pakistan of supporting Islamic insurgents fighting against Indian rule in the mostly Muslim region. The two nuclear-armed rivals nearly went to war last spring over the long-running dispute. 
"The struggle for self-determination of our Kashmiri brothers is a sacred trust with us, which can never be compromised," General Musharraf said. He went on to issue a not-so-veiled threat against India, saying the Pakistani armed forces were ready "not only to defend every inch of the borderline, but to carry the fight across the border." 
General Musharraf delivered his speech as Pakistan celebrated the 55th anniversary of its independence from Britain, a day before India celebrates its own. 
Western diplomats noted that the general spoke mostly in English, and said he apparently was aiming his harsh statement about militants at the United States. The general, who seized power in a coup in 1999, is one of Washington's most important allies in its campaign against terrorism. 
Many Pakistanis and Westerners here fear that continued attacks could drive away foreign investment and further weaken Pakistan's anemic economy. General Musharraf did his best to play down the importance of the militants today, saying "an insignificant minority has held the entire nation hostage to their misconceived views of Islam." 
But diplomats said the general's statements, while sharp, did not mark a decisive shift in policy. "It doesn't do anything to reduce tensions with India," one Western diplomat said, "and I'm not sure it was a step forward on terrorism." 
General Musharraf dismissed elections that India plans to hold in the portion of Kashmir it controls in September as an attempt to legitimize its "illegal occupation" of the area. Indian officials, who charge that Pakistan has been sending Islamic militants into Kashmir to disrupt the elections, denounced his remarks as examples of Pakistani belligerence. 
"We have taken note of his intention to disrupt peaceful elections in Kashmir, and to continue his hostile postures towards India," an Indian government spokeswoman, Nirupama Rao, said in a statement. 
American and European diplomats are urging separatist groups in Kashmir to take part in the election, which they say could be an important first step in resolving the dispute. 
But most Kashmiri separatists have vowed to boycott the vote, saying no election can be free while hundreds of thousands of Indian troops are deployed in the area.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Seeks Doubling of Recycling Fines 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
As a moratorium on issuing tickets for violating the city's new recycling rules comes to a close, the Bloomberg administration has been quietly urging a reluctant City Council to double the fines the city can impose.
 The increase was originally included in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed budget back in April, but it was not passed with the rest of the fiscal package. The measure would raise the first fine for, say, mixing paper with glass, to $50 from $25. The fines for repeated violations, currently from $50 to $500, would double as well, officials said. Officials in the mayor's office estimate that the increase would bring in $1.7 million to the city's depleted coffers. 
 As a cost-saving measure, the city suspended the collection of recyclable plastic for one year and glass for two years, while a task force studies ways to make the program more economical. Bloomberg administration officials say they believe they also had an agreement with the other side of City Hall -- though the Council does not concur -- to increase the fines, and want the Council to move ahead. Legislative aides to the mayor have been raising the issue frequently with Council staff members, Council officials said, nagging them to hold hearings and pass the fine increase.
But Council officials, who had opposed the suspension of some of the program in the first place, say that they do not wish to pursue raising fines right now, because the city has just changed the rules and has not sufficiently educated New Yorkers about their new responsibilities. 
"There's still a great deal of confusion out there, and it seems that they've been a little slow in getting notices out there," said Forrest Taylor, the Council's chief of staff. "People have to get used to a new way of dealing with things, and that takes time."
Michael E. McMahon, chairman of the Council's Sanitation and Solid Waste Management Committee, called the proposed increases "nothing more than a hidden tax," and said he would block any attempt to raise the penalties until the recycling program was back to normal.
"We've done the suspension, which nobody understands, and we're planning to do a lifting of half of the suspension in 11 months," Mr. McMahon said, adding that the city had not presented a television advertising campaign or a sufficiently broad-based education program. "You can't change the rules, not publish the change and then tax the people for not adhering to the rules." 
Vito A. Turso, a Sanitation Department spokesman, said that the department had always planned to re-evaluate enforcement as the grace period came to a close, at the end of this month, and decide whether to begin issuing tickets or to extend the moratorium. Judging by the number of e-mail messages and views on the department's Web site, he said, "word of the recycling change has certainly gotten out to the public."

HEADLINE: For W.T.O.'s Next Chief, A Long List of Headaches 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Supachai Panitchpakdi, a soft-spoken Thai economist, has been a passionate chess player since he took up the game as a teenager. Starting next month, he will give those tactical skills a good workout when he becomes director general of the World Trade Organization, a fractious lot of countries all pledged to the same end -- global free trade -- but always divided over how to achieve it.
 The divisions have been particularly apparent in recent months as the elation that followed the start of the Doha trade round in Qatar last year has waned, a victim of disputes between the European Union and Washington over farm subsidies and steel tariffs, and a potentially costly fight over tax breaks for American corporations. 
 Mr. Supachai will be the organization's first leader from the developing world, and is seen as a champion of poorer countries. But he will have to deal with their lingering discontent over what they see as unfair treatment in global trade. 
Already, interim deadlines in the trade round's timeline to open access to the world's markets have slipped in Geneva, where the day-to-day negotiations take place, and the January 2005 completion date is looking increasingly unlikely.
He will have to herd this disparate lot toward that deadline without antagonizing either the big trading powers or the smaller developing nations, who make up the bulk of the organization's 144 members.
So far, while watching from the sidelines after being appointed three years ago in an unusual compromise, he has had to draw on some of the humility and patience he learned during a brief period two decades ago as a Buddhist monk.
Mr. Supachai, who has held various government posts in Thailand, including deputy premier and trade minister, offered to mediate the big traders' steel dispute. The response: no, thank you.
"He doesn't occupy the position of leadership," Anthony Gooch, until recently the European Commission's trade spokesman, said at a news briefing in June. "His views will be valued and considered when he does occupy that position."
Mr. Supachai, a well-regarded economist who has written books on globalization, shrugged off the rebuff. "I was just trying to say we should explore options," he said in a recent interview.
He has had plenty of time to cultivate his patience, along with his extensive collection of bonsai trees, while waiting in the wings to take over the director general's job. After a hotly disputed race for the top spot at the World Trade Organization, a compromise was struck in 1999 that split the term, giving the first stint to Mr. Supachai's rival, Mike Moore of New Zealand.
At the time, Mr. Supachai, who had been the front-runner until Mr. Moore entered the race, took the unusual step of publicly complaining, saying that his chances had been poisoned by accusations that he twisted arms and promised favors to get the job. The contest turned because some European and developing countries believed that the United States was railroading its choice of Mr. Moore.
That was the first of several frank remarks for which Mr. Supachai, 56, has been reproached as someone who "shoots from the lip." The impression was reinforced the next year when he tangled with Pascal Lamy, the European Union trade commissioner, over how broad the Doha trade round should be. Mr. Supachai preferred a more narrowly focused round. More sweeping trade rounds are harder to conclude, but they give more maneuvering room to industrial powers.
In recent months, he again ruffled superpower feathers by espousing a code of conduct for multinationals to follow in trade negotiations -- an unwelcome suggestion on both sides of the Atlantic.
"He has to be careful and not be too outspoken," one European trade envoy said. "Otherwise, the greater danger is that the big powers could start to ignore him completely."
Yet, now that he is taking the reins, Mr. Supachai will be global trade's most visible cheerleader, appearing around the world to push the benefits of open markets. He will also be trade's chief conciliator, encouraging countries to take on entrenched domestic interests. And while he can cajole or nudge, he has no formal authority in this member-driven organization to shove the countries into agreement.
"What he can do is create an environment where positions can be harmonized," said Nepal's envoy, Shambu Ram Simkhada, who is leading his country's effort to join the W.T.O. 
Mr. Supachai's formal, low-key manner contrasts markedly with the breezy, chummy style of his immediate predecessor. Mr. Moore prides himself on grabby one-liners to make trade relevant to average people; Mr. Supachai is seen as a sort of egghead, more preoccupied with the theory of trade than with its actual practice.
"He's an individual who's very reflective, where Mike was very instinctive" said Sergio Marchi, Canada's ambassador to the W.T.O. "But that doesn't mean he's going to be a pushover."
In fact, Mr. Marchi said, Mr. Supachai's willingness to "throw out solutions" impresses him as "better than having a director general who sticks his finger in the air, and waits to see how the breeze is blowing."
Mr. Supachai says he takes criticism in stride, although prefers it to be "well intentioned and constructive." But either way, he said, it will not deflect him from pursuing his vision of a wider marketplace where trade ties the world together.
Mr. Supachai is taking over as the organization is trying to steer a steady course after a stormy period that included in December 1999 when anti-globalization protesters disrupted the W.T.O. summit in Seattle, a debacle that grabbed headlines around the globe.
Less than three years later, the accord at Doha, hailed as a turning point for the W.T.O., has been undermined by resurgent protectionist sentiments.
Mr. Supachai says he can get the talks on track. He has overcome challenges before, he said, pointing to the 10 years he spent in the Netherlands getting his Ph.D. in economics. Before he could even start classes at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, he had to spend more than a year learning Dutch.
"I was a guinea pig at the time," said Mr. Supachai, the first Thai to study there.
When he returned to Bangkok, he worked for Thailand's central bank. There, he met his wife, Sasai, who quit her job to help run his political campaigns. "She's a very good, and tough, campaigner, better than me," he laughed. Mr. Supachai vaulted from representing a district on Bangkok's outskirts to being the finance minister -- and boss of the central bank -- by the time he was 40.
He headed Thailand's delegation at the end of the Uruguay round of trade talks, which took seven years to conclude.
Wrapping up the current round in three years, Mr. Supachai said, means that "we can't stop working at any time." He has made no secret that he believes that success depends on some concessions to developing countries, especially in crucial areas like apparel.
But despite his zeal for free trade, Mr. Supachai admits it is only "one means to improve people's lives."
"There is a limit," he said. "We can't cure all social ills."

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
What Awaits A Dream Car When Dreams Change?

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
IN the small subset of automobiles that can properly be called American sports cars, the undisputed king is the Corvette. The original two-seater Thunderbird, which had a good run but wasn't made after 1957, was not really a sports car; today's successor isn't either. The Dodge Viper, a challenger since 1991, has not reached Corvette-level appeal or sales. The AC Cobra, now a beloved collectors' car, flashed in and flamed out in the 60's. The Corvette endures -- 32,000 made every year, 32,000 sold every year. Those who love the Corvette love it fanatically.
 To Martin A. Drutz, a Miami accountant who has owned a dozen Corvettes and has an office full of Corvette memorabilia, it is the sine qua non: "To me, there is no other car." 
 The Corvette touched America's yearning for excitement and glamour as perhaps no other car ever did. Martin Milner and George Maharis sped to adventure in a Corvette on "Route 66." A Corvette entered James Bond's life in "A View to a Kill." William Shatner, still the youthful Captain Kirk, proudly posed in his, and Alan Shepard, who really did fly in space, was just one of several astronauts who drove them. The Corvette spoke of power, speed and Marilyn Monroe look-alikes, usually in the passenger seat. 
As a boy growing up in the 50's and 60's, Mr. Drutz, now 54, spent hours gluing model Corvettes together. Like millions of other boys and young men (85 percent of Corvette owners are male, according to Chevrolet), he dreamed of the day when he would own one, and like many others, he made his dream come true. But it might be hard to find a boy with that dream today.
This year the Corvette turns 50, and many of its fans have reached that milestone before it. According to Chevrolet, 49 percent of new Corvette buyers are over 50, and 76 percent are over 40. Only 7 percent are 30 and under.
George Kerbeck, an owner of Kerbeck Chevrolet in Atlantic City, one of the largest Corvette dealers in the country, said most of his customers were between 48 and 52.
Other Corvette sellers cater to a similar market. "A guy came in here yesterday saying, 'I got my kids in college, all my expenses are over and done with, now I want my Corvette,' " Bob Baker of Corvette Mike New England in Plymouth, Mass., said Wednesday.
Price is a factor, of course. ("What kid has 50 grand?" as Mr. Baker put it.) But David Glaze, vice president and creative director at Genex, an Internet consulting company in Los Angeles, said people in their 20's and 30's who have money to spend and like what he calls "racer cars" want smaller, sleeker cars, not automobiles they associate with, say, Robert Novak, the 71-year-old political commentator who is repeatedly teased on CNN's "Crossfire" about his new black Corvette.
"A Corvette?" said Jennifer Thompson, 30, an art director in New York. "Aren't they for guys in gold chains who are trying to recapture their youth?" 
Mr. Glaze said Chevrolet would have to work hard to reignite interest in the brand with young people. Based on his research as a designer of automobile Web sites (Corvette's 50th anniversary site is among them), he said that the racer cars that appeal to the youth market are "little star-fighter things, the small Audis, the Acura Integra and the Honda Si."
Jamie McDonald, a 32-year-old producer at Fox News in New York, called the Corvette passe. He aspires to own a Porsche 911 -- "That's a car," he said reverently.
Generations X and Y may not think so, but the Corvette is very much a car. It has a top speed of 170 miles an hour, and it's reasonably comfortable and practical. Its V-8 engine achieves a remarkable combination of performance and fuel economy -- this is a racer car that gets nearly 30 miles a gallon on the highway. And its low-slung shape is unmistakable.
"I've driven other sports cars -- Porsche 911's and Panteras, for instance -- and they're all fun in their unique way," said Kevin Wanner, 40, a manager at America Online in South Orange, N.J., who takes his 1996 LT4 to amateur competitions. "But the Corvette seems to have limitless power, great adhesion and is very forgiving." 
Arnie Tanowitz, 50, the chief executive of the Rutan Polyethylene Supply and Bag Manufacturing Company in Mahwah, N.J., expresses his enthusiasm for his Corvette more lyrically. "Have you ever listened to a throaty V-8 with a dual exhaust up Route 9W, over the Bear Mountain Bridge and up Route 9 with some great music and the roof off?" he said. "Do you know the difference between driving a car and being driven by a car?"
General Motors has produced more than 1.4 million Corvettes since its chief stylist, Harley Earl, decided in 1951 to design a new American sports car. In January 1953, the prototype went on display at the Motorama show at the Waldorf-Astoria, and production began that June in Flint, Mich. From the beginning, the Corvette catered to a highly selective, wealthy audience, and production was deliberately limited. "When you overbuild," said Bob Tripolsky, the communications manager at Chevrolet, there is a "likelihood of reducing the mystique of the cars."
When the Corvette first rolled into showrooms, Americans were bursting with postwar pride. As the Corvette reaches its 50th anniversary -- the 2003 model is already in some showrooms -- many Americans are once again full of patriotic resolve. More than anyone might have expected a year ago, a celebration of the Corvette, an icon of American design and engineering and a hardy competitor in a field dominated by foreign models, has turned out to be in step with the times.
Besides being quintessentially American, the Corvette has the democratic quality of being more broadly affordable than most sports cars. The Porsche 911 costs $70,000 to $120,000; the Ferrari 575M Maranello is close to $250,000. The most expensive new Corvette today is the Z06, at just over $51,000; the cheapest is the coupe, at $42,350. 
Corvette is celebrating its 50th year with a range of promotions. The most notable is planned for June in Nashville, featuring caravans, displays, concerts, exhibitions, engineering talks and thousands of Corvettes. 
In any year, there is no shortage of outlets for the Corvette-obsessed: Corvette clubs, Corvette competitions and meets, and Corvette magazines. This year's Corvette Celebration at the National Corvette Museum, in Bowling Green, Ky., on Labor Day will be the eighth annual such event. Corvette owners can also indulge themselves with myriad collectibles -- model cars, decanters, knives, lighters, plates and, of course, multiple Corvettes, new and old. (A good 1957 model now goes for $50,000; it cost $3,000 new.)
Executives at General Motors speak bravely of attracting a wider market. Rick Baldick, the director of marketing for Corvette in Detroit, said the company was targeting younger buyers. Marketing for the 2003 Corvette will include ads in magazines like Golf, Men's Journal and MBA Jungle aimed at the "dreamer" category -- the youngish man aspiring to own an exciting car.
Whether younger buyers discover the Corvette or not, Chevrolet doesn't foresee any imminent decline in Corvette sales. Mr. Tripolsky, the Chevrolet spokesman, says he is confident that Corvettes will be produced for a very long time. And certainly its baby boomer fans have time to buy many more.
Jay Leno, 52, the host of "The Tonight Show," owns two Corvettes, a 1999 and a 2002. He also has 80 other cars, mostly antiques, and 80 motorcycles; he keeps them in a warehouse, but he actually drives his Corvettes.
Mr. Leno explained the special quality of the Corvette -- what he calls "an attainable lure" -- by comparing it to the actress Sandra Bullock. "She's a beautiful movie star," he said in a telephone interview from his office in Los Angeles, "and she seems like a regular girl." That, he said, is what the Corvette is like. It "just does everything right -- it can be glamorous or a car you can park at the market."
But if he can see taking one of his Corvettes to the grocery store, he would never dream of driving them to Hollywood parties. "You'd have to be an idiot to leave them with a valet," he said. "I take my banged-up '91 Syclone truck."

HEADLINE: Stock Slide Adds to Fear On Liquidity Of Vivendi 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Investors dumped Vivendi Universal stock for a second consecutive day today, apparently unconvinced by the announcement on Wednesday that management would try to ease a severe cash squeeze by shedding assets in a $9.8 billion sell-off.
 The shares, after losing 25 percent of their value on Wednesday, fell 11 percent more today in European trading. In New York, Vivendi's American depository receipts lost 86 cents, or 7.4 percent, closing at $10.80. 
 Sarah Percy-Dove, a bond analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, said there was "very serious concern" over Vivendi's liquidity. 
On Wednesday, the new chief executive of the company, Jean-Rene Fourtou, announced plans to sell assets, including the publisher Houghton Mifflin and perhaps Vivendi's stake in the American satellite television company EchoStar Communications. The proceeds would help offset a dwindling cash flow and obtain the liquidity needed to service $18.6 billion of debt, most of it amassed in a two-year acquisition spree by Mr. Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier.
In a note to investors today, Michael Picken of Credit Suisse First Boston estimated that Vivendi's short-term liquidity requirements through next March would total 5.6 billion euros, or $5.4 billion. Mr. Fourtou said on Wednesday that he hoped to raise $9.8 billion over the next two years, with roughly half of that amount to be raised in the next nine months.
Mr. Picken said that to meet short-term needs, he expected Vivendi to reach an agreement with a group of banks for a credit line of 3 billion euros by the end of August. He estimated that such a cash injection would suffice until the end of the year.
Mr. Picken also said that none of the planned disposals, including that of Houghton Mifflin, reflected actual deals yet. "We consider it to be a buyer's market," he added, suggesting that Vivendi would fetch far less in most cases than it paid for its assets.
Ms. Percy-Dove of Merrill Lynch said that she and other analysts were disappointed with the proposals announced Wednesday. She called them "at best, amateurish; at worst, blind ignorance."
"Management do not yet have sufficient grasp of the extent of their problem," she said.
Stewart Applebaum, director of corporate affairs at the Random House division of Bertelsmann, said that Random House would be interested in Houghton Mifflin's trade book unit, if the group is sold piecemeal, but he added, "It's going to be a tough market."
On Wednesday, Mr. Fourtou gave no hint that he intended to put on the block, at least for now, the Universal music, film and television production businesses in the United States that Mr. Messier acquired in his quest to turn Vivendi into an American-style media conglomerate.
Barry Sosnick, a media analyst at Fahnestock & Company in New York, agreed with that decision. 
"One of the troubles is that when large conglomerates go through hard times, the knee-jerk reaction is to cut out businesses where there is no synergy," Mr. Sosnick said.
Universal's music and video businesses offer a "tremendous upside" as the economic slowdown compels consumers to seek out cheaper forms of entertainment, he said, and should bolster Vivendi's anemic cash flow. "When there's a drop in income, consumers move back toward lower-cost forms of entertainment," he said. "And that's what Universal has."
Other experts said they doubted that the process of unwinding the media empire assembled by Mr. Messier would stop at the plans announced on Wednesday.
"I feel they're definitely becoming a French company again," said Richard Lorber of Lorber Media, a New York consultant, adding that he thought Mr. Fourtou would eventually spin off the Universal holdings. "Management clearly lacks the ability to create synergies with their French businesses," he said.
Mr. Picken of Credit Suisse said he thought Vivendi would hang onto the core American media assets, including Universal, "creating a traditional conglomerate structure in the medium term." That means, however, that investors will apply a "significant conglomerate discount" to Vivendi shares, he said, as much as 40 percent.

HEADLINE: Measuring Downtown's Future 

BYLINE:  By Denise Scott Brown; Denise Scott Brown is an architect and urban planner and a principal at Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
In the 1950's, every city planning commission had its "vision for the year 2020." The frontispieces of urban plans across America showed towers, beautiful and ethereal, rising from the city. Ten years later, these images were sarcastically called "perfect vision" plans. The reality they became -- the urban renewal projects of the 50's and 60's -- forcefully discredited the old Cities of the Future. Now, as we consider the future of the World Trade Center site, we are confronted, once again, with perfect-vision plans. One irony is that they are intended to replace what was itself one of the last urban renewal projects of the 1960's.
 And there is criticism again today. If the idea behind the recent unveiling of a set of perfect-vision drawings was to shift the debate to design -- and, in the process, get tacit acceptance of the type and amount of space to be built -- it hasn't worked. New Yorkers would not buy the basic premise. 
 So why have municipal agencies gone on to invite us to create yet more visions? Answers for the city will not lie in such perfect visions, or even in countervisions. Another type of vision is in order: a social vision that can direct the move to form and design. We need to step back, if briefly, to evolve a conception of the meaning of New York today -- to consider what it is and what it should be. 
New York is a giant, a multilayered conjunction of activities, set within larger patterns of the region, nation and world and related to them on many scales. This site downtown is a subset of the whole, tied to all around it in ways only partly fathomable. What will make it all work again after an unimaginable disruption? What connections are needed to bring back its vitality? Can we expect the same patterns as before? How might they be altered?
Before Sept. 11, activities in Lower Manhattan were changing, perhaps rapidly. Analysis of trends just before the destruction should be part of the stepping back and thinking. But given the giant discontinuity, who knows what trends will last, even in the near future? The figures behind the published plans are merely hopes. We should certainly build on hope -- but hope on what scale?
We can take some guidance from our own first steps after the destruction. New patterns appeared on the site as soon as emergency services were set up. A heart-rending one was photocopied sheets pinned along routes where people walked: Have you seen my father, brother, wife? The location of these unwitting memorials can teach us something about how cities really work; it illustrates the classic relation that exists in cities between patterns of activities and paths of circulation. This "city physics," compared with grand urban visions, is short-term and human-scale. It is how things should be done and ought to discipline the replanning of the site, ensuring that its reconstructed streets and transit facilities become the basis for locating and sizing new activities.
Canny developers understand city physics and take it into account. They study markets to decide on the amount and type of space that can be absorbed in specific locations at a given time. Too ambitious an implementation of long-term plans can spell disaster for a developer. So the individual developer, absent pressure or support from government, is likely to estimate the size of each increment conservatively. This gives the project a foothold in reality.
It gives better prospects for the city, too. Plans that locate retail uses where people pass, envisage new office buildings only when the rents can be afforded and tie these to the larger patterns of the neighborhood -- such plans, more than the published visions, will have a chance of developing cities of character, agreeability, utility, immediacy and vitality.
Developers' plans cannot, however, entirely avoid the unpredictability and discontinuity that the attacks introduced into our city's life. Trends that were violently disrupted cannot merely be projected, and planners do not have the power of prophecy. With unusually strong limits on the ability to forecast, I believe the first phase of implementation should be cautious. One tower? Two? Local retail only? This first increment could then serve as a gauge for further demand.
No matter how cautious the first step, its design will call for a long-range view of what Lower Manhattan can and should be. If creative services and information technology firms are to be prominent here in the future, we should consider what types of urban environment they require and induce. Companies in these industries, like those of the garment industry up the street, tend to form links among themselves, as if on a production line. This is especially true of advertising, media and software development companies, where creativity is at a premium. Up-and-coming enterprises require the lower rents that existing older buildings offer, whereas established organizations may lease space in the planned towers. Growing companies require opportunities to expand within the neighborhood. People in these firms tend to live near their work and patronize the restaurants, galleries and cultural activities that should be a visible and exciting attraction in the area.
Given these patterns, rebuilding the site will call for developing a strong relationship between old and new and establishing vitality at street level where urbanites congregate. Start-up firms may play a role like that of artists in the city. They find the good places to work and live; when they move in, others follow.
Residential plans for the revived neighborhood should respond to the pluralism of New York. While little new housing may be constructed on the site, some low-rent office space will become available for residential conversion as growing businesses move into new spaces. That's another natural progression. The need for moderate-income housing, however, will remain.
Streets and transit facilities, especially those underground, must be returned to the site quickly. A consequence of phased rebuilding may be that on-site space is left unbuilt for a while and that underground transportation facilities, constructed now, will need to be designed to allow for a variety of ways of building over them. The decision to maintain the footprint of the World Trade Center buildings as public space is justified, I feel, by the weight of the loss. Public buildings and spaces on the site will need to serve national, city and local needs and should be attuned to change in the area. Manhattan has a long tradition of building commercial buildings, housing and public institutions. It builds skyscrapers better than anyone else. It has a spectacular history of large public parks and important institutional buildings. But there is also a tradition of modest public buildings and parks. A small church or synagogue, set within a row of town houses or surrounded by office buildings, holds its own with dignity. Small city parks provide benches, a canopy of trees, seclusion from traffic and shady respite for locals. Despite the scale of proposed rebuilding, these small institutions and spaces should serve as our best models for the refurbished public sector.
Tragedy will always overhang the site. For me, recognizing the events of Sept. 11 would entail endeavoring to assure that private-sector buildings, whatever their size, are modest in their design and expression. The major symbols should be in the public sector. Those of the destroyed World Trade Center have seared minds and spirits worldwide; some of these remains belong on their site. They will bring gravitas and inspire contemplation. The photocopied sheets, too, should be here. Perhaps they could be reproduced in permanent materials and placed in the sequence in which they were first arranged, along a walk through the spaces of the buildings' footprints. This would be a processional, without bombast.

HEADLINE: Fed Officials Were Confident Economy Was Improving in June 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were confident seven weeks ago that the economy was on the path to recovery, according to minutes of their discussions on June 25 and 26. 
 While investors and consumers "had been shaken by revelations of accounting irregularities," the minutes said, "the economy had continued to expand and the prospects for accelerating aggregate demand remained positive." 
 In the minutes, some central bankers said they had expected the recovery to be further along by late June. "The timing and strength of an upturn in the expansion," the minutes said, "remained subject to considerable uncertainty." 
Policy makers changed their assessment on Tuesday and announced that they saw a threat to the economy from weakening growth. In June, the central bank had left its benchmark bank-lending rate unchanged at a 41-year low of 1.75 percent and retained its view that risks to the economy were balanced between weakness and higher inflation. 
Some members of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee said in June that they "had expected to see firmer indications of a strengthening recovery" by midyear. Still, according to the minutes, they anticipated that "in the absence of major further adverse shocks to confidence" the economy would soon return to a growth rate of 3 percent to 3.5 percent. 
"Members cited the accommodative stance of both fiscal and monetary policy and the continuation of impressive growth in productivity that should buttress household incomes and spending and encourage a pickup in business investment," the minutes said. 
Corporate spending on new equipment was viewed as a "key to sustained solid growth" and doubts about when it might rebound were a "major source of uncertainty about the pace of the expansion in coming quarters," the minutes said. 
Although the panel voted unanimously this week to leave interest rates unchanged and to shift its statement on the balance of risks, some central bankers suggested in June that the current policy stance "was too accommodative" to be consistent with the Fed's aim of making sure inflation does not accelerate. 
Still, most said keeping the federal funds rate at a four-decade low was "desirable to counter the lingering effects of financial and other shocks to the economy that were continuing to exert a depressing impact on output and resource use." 
The report also noted that inflation was "still edging down" with expectations about its future performance "low and stable."

HEADLINE: Reports on Manufacturing Suggest Sluggish Growth 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Manufacturing slowed in July, the Federal Reserve reported today, as factory production nudged up 0.1 percent, compared with a 0.6 percent increase in June.
 In addition, the Labor Department reported today that more Americans filed new applications for jobless benefits last week. 
 In the factory production report, output rose 0.2 percent in July for the entire industrial sector, which includes factories, mines and utilities, compared with an increase of 0.7 percent in June. The rise in factory production reflected a 4.2 percent increase in output of cars, trucks and parts. Excluding them, factory output would have fallen 0.3 percent in July, the Fed said. 
At mines, production fell 1.2 percent in July, while output at gas and electric utilities rose 2.3 percent as hot weather pushed up demand. 
Even though production slowed for the entire sector in July, the 0.2 percent increase was the seventh consecutive month that output rose. 
In a separate regional survey, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported today that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region fell sharply in August. The bank's general economic index dropped to minus 3.1 in August, its first negative reading since December, from 6.6 in July. A reading below zero indicates a contraction.
The Labor Department said in the jobless report that new claims for unemployment insurance rose last week by a seasonally adjusted 6,000, to 388,000, a level associated with a sluggish job market.
The reports "suggest that the economic train is still moving, but on the slower freight track," said Tim O'Neill, chief economist at the Bank of Montreal.
He and other analysts said the recovery was hitting a temporary rough patch related to the accounting scandals that have shaken Americans' confidence in companies, the roller coaster stock market and a stagnant jobs market. 
Faced with economic uncertainties, companies have been reluctant to hire back laid-off workers and make big capital spending commitments, keys to reviving the economy. 
The number of unemployed Americans continuing to draw jobless benefits rose to 3.58 million for the work week ended Aug. 3, the most recent period for which the information is available.
The unemployment rate remained at 5.9 percent in July as companies added just 6,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: Estee Lauder Posts Loss for the Quarter 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Estee Lauder Companies, a leading cosmetics company, posted a quarterly loss after restructuring charges yesterday, and said earnings in the current quarter would fall below analysts' estimates because of higher spending on advertising and promotions.
 But the company, which has been hurt by sluggish consumer spending in the United States and Japan, said it expected earnings for the year to meet analysts' estimates, and its stock rose 3 percent. 
 Estee Lauder, which sells the Clinique and Aramis brands, posted a loss of $25.4 million, or 13 cents a share, for the quarter, contrasted with a profit of $14.6 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding restructuring charges, the company said, profit fell to $51.5 million, or 19 cents a share, from $60.7 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said in June that it expected earnings of 18 cents a share before one-time items.
Sales in the period, which ended June 30 and was the fourth quarter of Estee Lauder's fiscal year, rose 8 percent, to $1.13 billion.
Estee Lauder took a fourth-quarter restructuring charge of $76.9 million after taxes to cut supply-chain and distribution costs and trim its Internet business expenses.
In the last year, Estee Lauder's sales have fallen because of the soft economy and a slump in business at duty-free shops and other travel-related sites after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. 
The company said it expected to see soft but improving economic trends in the current quarter, and it forecast an increase of 2 percent to 3 percent in sales, excluding foreign currency changes.

HEADLINE: A Celebration to Remember Liberation Unites Koreans for a Day 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Barely six weeks after North and South Korea fought a gun battle at sea, the largest delegation of North Korean civilians in memory joined South Koreans here today to celebrate the anniversary of the end of World War II and the end of Japanese colonial rule.
 Chanting "Korea is one" at a joint National Liberation Day art performance, 116 North Koreans waved blue and white "unification" flags featuring a united Korean peninsula. 
 The celebration is the kickoff to a series of North-South civilian exchanges, many of them sporting events, as both countries seek to rebuild relations on the peninsula. 
The activities include a "friendly" North-South soccer match, the first in almost a decade. In mid-September, inter-Korean exchanges of tae kwon do teams are to begin, with a South Korean martial arts group traveling to North Korea.
At the end of September, 600 North Korean athletes, journalists and fans are to travel to Pusan, South Korea, for the Asian Games.
Ever since the end of the Korean War, in 1953, North Korea has shunned international sports events in the South.
North Korea's participation in these competitions seems intended to win a restoration of food aid from South Korea and repair relations damaged by the naval conflict.
In the battle on June 29 off the west coast, South Korea's navy lost five sailors and North Korea is thought to have lost 13 men.
The joint events are not without their complications. South Korea bans the use of North Korean symbols, the flag and the national anthem for propaganda purposes, posing a problem at sporting events.
This week, with anti-Communist demonstrators burning a North Korean flag outside the site of inter-Korean talks here, it was clear that any mishandling of the flag issue could have political consequences.
Judging by newspaper editorials this week on the flag issue, it appears the government will restrict the flying of North Korea's flag to ceremonial areas of stadiums and to athletes' villages, but will try to prevent fans from waving it in the stands.
Meanwhile, about 1,000 leftists demonstrated outside the main American military base in Seoul today. Separately, an equal number of conservatives, many of them Army veterans, demonstrated for increased vigilance about North Korea, which maintains an army with a million troops north of the border, only 35 miles from here. --------------------

Koizumi Avoids War Shrine
 TOKYO, Aug. 15 (AP) -- In a gesture to Japan's neighbors, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi did not visit a controversial war shrine today on the 57th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.
But as Mr. Koizumi expressed regrets about Japan's aggression, conservative lawmakers still paid their respects at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. Nearly 2.5 million war dead, including executed war criminals, are worshiped at the shrine as deities. Mr. Koizumi prompted outrage, particularly in China and South Korea, when he visited days before the anniversary last year. This year, he observed a moment of silence and laid flowers at a nearby cemetery. 
"During the war, our country inflicted great damage and pain to the people of many countries, especially in Asia," Mr. Koizumi said. "As the representative of this nation's people, I again reflect deeply and express humble condolences to those who lost their lives."

HEADLINE: Computer Sciences Seeks Leaves 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Aug. 15 

 BODY:
The Computer Sciences Corporation, the computer-services company, said today that it would ask its 66,000 workers to volunteer to take at least six months' leave with 20 percent pay. 
 A spokesman for Computer Sciences, Frank Pollare, said the program would allow workers to receive some income and the company to "reduce costs for that time." Mr. 
Pollare said he could not forecast possible savings or say how many workers would take the extended leave. 
 Computer Sciences and two larger rivals, I.B.M. and Electronic Data Systems, have had falling or slowing sales as customers have cut information-technology budgets in response to a lagging global economy. Computer Sciences shares have fallen 25 percent this year. 
According to an e-mail message to workers in Australia, full-time employees will get approval from their managers to take six to nine months of leave with an 80 percent pay cut to help the company "control costs and improve operating efficiencies."
Computer Sciences said that it had bolstered profit as workers became more productive and that the company cut 2,000 jobs last year. 
On July 31, the company said first-quarter profit rose 66 percent, to $79 million, through cost cuts and an accounting change. Sales rose 1.9 percent, which was lower than expected. 
The company has about 37,000 workers in the United States, 21,000 in Europe and 8,000 in Asia. All of them will be offered extended leave if laws in the workers' nations of employment allow it, Mr. Pollare said. 
It is "too early to speculate" whether the company will force workers to take the leave if too few workers volunteer, he said.

HEADLINE: Mind the Gap 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
How much has Japan's economy shrunk since its bubble burst? It's a trick question; Japan's economy hasn't shrunk. It had only two down years over the past decade, and on average it grew 1 percent per year. 
 Yet Japan's is a genuinely depressed economy. Because growth has been so slow, an ever-increasing gap has opened up between what the economy could produce and what it actually produces. This "output gap" translates into rising unemployment and accelerating deflation. Slow growth can be almost as big a problem as actual output decline. 
 Now the non-trick question: What would a similar analysis say about the United States?
The U.S. economy's "potential output" -- what it could produce at full employment -- has lately been growing at about 3.5 percent per year, thanks to the productivity surge that began in the mid-1990's. But according to the revised figures released a couple of weeks ago, actual growth has fallen short of potential for seven of the last eight quarters. 
The conventional view is that we had a brief, shallow recession last year, and that recovery has begun. But the output gap tells a different story: Two years ago we went into an economic funk, and it's not over. In a way the whole double-dip controversy is a red herring; the real question is when G.D.P. will start growing fast enough to narrow the output gap. And so far there's no sign of that happening. 
There's no mystery about the causes of our funk: the bubble years left us with too much capacity, too much debt and a backlog of business scandal. We shouldn't have expected a quick and easy recovery, and we're not getting one.
Some readers have already guessed where I'm going with this. The U.S. stock bubble in the second half of the 1990's was just as big as Japan's bubble in the second half of the 1980's. Will our two-year funk turn into a five-year or ten-year funk, the way Japan's did?
A loud chorus is already shouting "We're not Japan!" Half the time, depending on what I had for breakfast (rice and pickles?), I'm part of that chorus. But let me share some disquieting thoughts.
Back when I first got professionally obsessed with Japan's problems, around four years ago, I made myself a mental checklist of reasons that Japan's decade of stagnation could not happen to the United States. It went like this: 
1. The Fed has plenty of room to cut interest rates, which should be enough to deal with any eventuality. 
2. The U.S. long-term budget position is very strong, so there's plenty of room for fiscal stimulus in the unlikely event interest rate cuts aren't enough. 
3. We don't have to worry about an Asian-style loss of confidence in our business sector, because we have excellent corporate governance. 
4. We may have a stock bubble, but we don't have a real estate bubble.
I've now had to strike the first three items off my list, and I'm getting worried about the fourth.
More and more people are using the B-word about the housing market. A recent analysis by Dean Baker, of the Center for Economic Policy Research, makes a particularly compelling case for a housing bubble. House prices have run well ahead of rents, suggesting that people are now buying houses for speculation rather than merely for shelter. And the explanations one hears for those high prices sound more and more like the rationalizations one heard for Nasdaq 5,000.
If we do have a housing bubble, and it bursts, we'll be looking a lot too Japanese for comfort.
A recent Federal Reserve analysis of Japan's experience declares that the key mistake Japan made in the early 1990's was "not that policy makers did not predict the oncoming deflationary slump -- after all, neither did most forecasters -- but that they did not take out sufficient insurance against downside risks through a precautionary further loosening of monetary policy." That's Fedspeak for "if you think deflation is even a possibility, throw money at the economy now and don't worry about overdoing it."
And yet the Fed chose not to cut rates on Tuesday. Why?
Last year some economists began privately referring to the Fed chairman as "Greenspan-san." The joke faded out as optimism about recovery became conventional wisdom. But maybe it's not a bad nickname after all.

HEADLINE: Mississippi Floods Drain Life From River Towns 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: KASKASKIA, Ill., Aug. 14 

 BODY:
The only sound in this flat green settlement on the Mississippi River is the whisper of leaves. Just off the Grande Rue, at a shrine beside the abandoned rectory of the gothic brick Immaculate Conception Church, visitors press a green button on a wall to look inside. An automated door swings open to reveal a view of the Liberty Bell of the West. No one is in there.
 No one seems left in Kaskaskia, the first capital of the state of Illinois, from 1818 to 1820. The bell, 11 years older than the one in Philadelphia and almost as large, was King Louis XV's gift to French settlers here. More than 2,000 people lived here once. But the Census Bureau found only 9 in 2000, down from 32 in 1990. Flood upon flood, most recently the Great Flood of 1993, have left Kaskaskia an island with more egrets than people. 
 Kaskaskia may be the extreme. It is one of a crop of near-ghost towns spreading along the nation's great arterial waterway, as other towns are expiring in the West and the Great Plains. Their economies and populations stagnant and falling, dozens of towns along the 1,000-mile stretch of the central Mississippi from Wisconsin to northern Arkansas, are stuck like stopped clocks. 
Various factors have conspired in the towns' travails: tired local leadership, vanishing farm families who brought corn to riverbank grain elevators, declines of lumbering and commercial fishing, barge operations that closed or decamped to Minneapolis, St. Louis and Memphis, surging competition from railroads and trucks. 
But for a number of languishing Mississippi towns it is the Great Flood of 1993 and, as important, its aftermath that have drained life away. The floods, which caused $10 billion in damage, were devastating enough. But the effort to reconstruct the towns, paradoxically, has played a role as well. Federal and state governments resettled 20,000 houses away from the river throughout the flood zone, and while it made sense to prevent people from rebuilding on land that was prone to flooding, the decision also exposed a harsh reality: The towns had lost their reason to exist, making attempts to reconstitute them virtually impossible.
People dispersed, and vital community routines, like breakfast at the cafe in town, stopped because many institutions shut down rather than relocate. It was not an unexpected consequence of the rebuilding, but it was an unfortunate one, said James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under President Bill Clinton and the architect of the rebuilding effort along the Mississippi.
"It's a good thing to keep people from going through the pain and anguish of a flood again," Mr. Witt said. "But it's tough, too, when you relocate a town and you lose that heart of a community. As time grows, they will get the community back, I hope."
But chances of economic recovery are slim, said Thomas F. Pogue, an economics professor at the University of Iowa. "The government may have been trying to move the towns and have it continue as it was," Mr. Pogue said. "But that's not economically viable. What is being lost is the sense of community and history. That can't be replicated."
That seems to be the case in downtown Winfield, Mo., 50 miles north of St. Louis. The town lies on the flood plain, three miles west of the riverbank. Already shrunken by mechanized farming, Winfield was inundated by the flood nine years ago.
"It came and stayed three months," said Mearle Lindsey, 57, a crane operator in St. Louis and one of Winfield's 723 residents. 
Over coffee at Bill and Leisa's Hometown Cafe on Main Street, Barbara Coons, a city alderwoman, said: "There no people in Winfield any more since the flood. It's going to be a ghost town."
To discourage building on flood plains, Congress and the Federal Emergency Management Agency steered many residents to high ground a half mile from downtown. The agency offered to buy houses and shops that were more than 50 percent damaged, less any insurance payment the owners received; state and federal agencies helped pay to develop sites above the path of floods, with roads and water systems as well as schools and town halls. 
Still, many businesses tried to hold on. Across from Bill and Leisa's is Main Street's largest structure, the shuttered Rick's Hardware. To serve a shrinking downtown community, the store had expanded into appliances, lumber and groceries. But the third generation owner closed it and moved a couple of years ago. 
"He went into the traveling salesman business, selling for someone else," Mr. Lindsey said.
Winfield's next vacancy might be Dixon's Quick Stop, a convenience store down the street from Rick's. Dixon's has been getting by, said Caroline Kight, manager and daughter of the owner. "My grandpa started this in the 1930's," she said. "My dad has had it for 30-some years."
But her father is reaching retirement age, so two years ago he put the store up for sale. No one has made an offer. "If no one comes by the end of September," Ms. Kight said, "it will be sold at auction."
Seventy-five miles down the river from Winfield, the town of Valmeyer, Ill., has met a similar fate. The flood washed out the school, three churches, the bank, the grocery store, two service stations and two taverns. 
"We lost our town," said Edward Kempen, 62, who retired recently from a Chrysler plant in Fenton, Mo., where he was a painter. His wife, Brenda, 56, said, "It was real eerie at first."
The Kempens live in what townspeople call Old Valmeyer, which now consists of a dozen or so houses, down from 300 or so before the flood. Along with a few other people, they refused government aid to move and ignored town officials who told them they would no longer have town water and sewerage. They drilled a well and put in a septic tank and used insurance money and savings to rebuild their house.
The government wanted them to move to New Valmeyer, a mile away, on the bluffs overlooking the river. There is a civic building, a school, a post office, a bank, three churches and row upon row of small vinyl-sheathed houses.
Some Old Valmeyer residents moved to the new subdivision, but many left the area entirely. Younger families from elsewhere, attracted by the school, have moved in, but they shop and play somewhere else. About 600 people live there.
In the meantime, the businesses that remained in Old Valmeyer have shut down or moved. The community's cohesion, and any sense of a place with a history, went out with the flood.
"I hardly know anybody going down the road," said Bernice Meadors, who moved her tavern, the Corner Pub, from the old town to the new town after the flood. "I thought the people would come back. But those people who live up here, they don't come from here. The heart is gone."
For a few river towns, like Mark Twain's tattered Hannibal, Mo., or the Mediterranean-like beach in Prescott, Wis., the answer is tourism and recreation. Most, however, offer visitors little more than a boat ramp, a park, a casino or a curiosity, like the tomb in Oquawka, Ill., for Norma Jean, a circus elephant struck by lightning in a visit there. 
Not everyone is unhappy that there are fewer people around. Tim Picou, a 41-year-old highway worker, was the only person in Kaskaskia one recent sunny afternoon. Though Mr. Picou lost his house in the flood, he decided, against the advice of the Federal emergency agency and local officials, to stay in town, and now lives with his family in one of Kaskaskia's half dozen occupied houses. He is getting by, he said. The mail is delivered, the garbage is picked up and the church, built to hold about 200 worshipers, still has services.
"It doesn't matter where you live," Mr. Picou said, flicking away a grasshopper that had landed next to him on the stoop of his house. "You make do with what you can."

HEADLINE: Cots Can't Solve a Homeless Crisis 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With homeless families sleeping in a jail, New York City can't afford to wait for the federal government to act (news analysis, Aug. 13). 
 Community-based housing groups are leaders in local efforts to meet housing needs and have created and preserved tens of thousands of affordable apartments. 
Yet the programs that are most effective were targeted for elimination or downsizing in the last city budget. 
 Worse, federal community development block grant funds were shifted from housing to other uses. To end homelessness we must expand the supply of affordable housing, which can only happen if the mayor makes housing a top budget priority.

HEADLINE: Cots Can't Solve a Homeless Crisis 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As a young girl, my family and I spent a homeless spring and summer in a series of motels. It was a time of deep shame and confusion for my siblings and me. 
This is a trauma that I assure you reverberates through generations (front page, Aug. 15). 
 Even in my family, which has recovered economically, the scars can be witnessed in the child-rearing practices and chronic illness of some of us.
I am astonished that the Bloomberg administration would use a former jail building as a temporary shelter for families with children older than 6. How will these boys and girls maintain any sense of their families' goodness when they are placed in a facility meant for criminals? The long-term costs will be paid by every other system in the city -- and of course by the children themselves.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Unemployment Rate Drops 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez)

 BODY:
 Fewer people than usual were looking for jobs in July, which led to a drop in the unemployment rate in New York City, according to data released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor. The drop is due to the way unemployment is measured. 
Excluded from the measure are people who are not working but not actively looking for work. The smaller number of job seekers led to a drop in the unemployment rate to 7.7 percent from 8 percent in June, after adjustment for seasonal factors. Typically, there is a surge in unemployment in July as young people out of school seek work, but bad economic news may have discouraged some potential job seekers, said James P. Brown, an analyst with the Labor Department. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

HEADLINE: Low-Cost Airlines Push Forward As TheirLarger Rivals Cut Back 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
As full-service airlines cut flights in coming months, they will create the kind of opportunity that in the past has allowed low-cost carriers to steal passengers.
 Economic downturns allow no-frills airlines to flex their cost advantages, and analysts say some of those carriers could scoop up abandoned slots at airports, not to mention add flights to poorly served routes. 
 AirTran Airways, already a strong rival to US Airways and Delta Air Lines on the East Coast, is poised for such a move, analysts say. It is growing quickly, with plans to increase capacity by 20 percent from last year. In the first and second quarters, it raised its capacity -- measured in a unit called available seat miles -- by 12.8 percent and 23.2 percent. 
"We're looking for those cities that are underserved and overcharged," said Tad Hutcheson, director of marketing at AirTran. "As the other airlines are looking to scale back and cut back in capacity, we're doing just the opposite."
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, AirTran has already added service to 7 cities and 24 routes. It has taken delivery of 9 Boeing 717's this year, with 11 more to come by December. The airline managed a profit of $5.1 million last quarter, though that was down 61 percent from a year earlier.
Four of the country's largest full-service airlines said this week that they would reduce capacity in the next several months. American and United, which is a unit of the UAL Corporation, both said they would reduce their November schedules by 9 percent, compared with July's schedules, and Northwest announced a 13 percent cut. It is unclear how much those moves are a reflection of the usual transition to autumn, which is historically slower, and how much are a result of the economic slowdown and the decline in travel after Sept. 11.
US Airways said it would cut flights and reroute some to different hubs as it operated under bankruptcy protection. It said it intended to maintain service to almost all its cities, but announced yesterday that it was dropping regional flights to Saginaw, Mich., starting Sept. 7.
"Historically, the low-cost airlines have certainly taken an economic downturn to increase market share," said Susan Donofrio, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. "This was the strategy that Southwest did in the early 1990's."
AirTran also used that tactic last fall, when the major carriers were still icing their bruises from the Sept. 11 attacks. It went into Baltimore-Washington International Airport in December and grabbed five gates that US Airways had used for its recently failed low-cost operation, called MetroJet. It now runs 25 flights a day from the airport.
"They cut down quite a bit," Mr. Hutcheson said of US Airways. "We found clearly that that was an opportunity for us, and we took advantage of it."
The nation's two most profitable airlines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, said the planned cuts by the full-service carriers would have no immediate effect on their operations. It is too soon to tell which routes will be affected, and that limits the moves that rivals can plan. Ed Stewart, a spokesman for Southwest, said, "Long-term planning in the airline business is just two days."
In 1991, Southwest snatched up gates at Midway Airport in Chicago that were abandoned by Midway Airlines when it filed for bankruptcy protection. Southwest had been running 44 flights a day from Chicago, and eventually surpassed its initial goal of 100 daily departures.
JetBlue's expansion plans for the rest of the year are limited by the fact that it is taking delivery of only seven more Airbus jets, said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a spokesman. Most of those will be based in Long Beach, Calif., with a few in Florida. JetBlue increased its second-quarter capacity by 101 percent over the period last year, and it is growing about 15 aircraft a year.
"We're plane-constrained, and we recognize it," Mr. Edmondson-Jones said. "Each plane that we take, there are way more options for it than what we can do. We mull over all the options and ask which one can we make the most money at."
Routes run by the full-service carriers might not meet the criteria set by the low-cost airlines. All of them said they looked for markets where there was a clear demand for low fares. AirTran and JetBlue operate out of a mix of central and secondary airports, but Southwest traditionally goes after slots only in secondary airports like Midway.
In one case, JetBlue started flying a route partly because rivals had cut back. The airline had intended to start running a route from Washington to the West Coast last October, but held back because of the Sept. 11 attacks. Then in November, when it saw that full-service carriers were cutting back on service to Florida, it decided instead to add flights between Washington and Florida, Mr. Edmondson-Jones said.
"The low-cost carriers are clearly in a cost position to take advantage of the situation," said Steven A. Morrison, a professor of economics at Northeastern University who studies the airline industry. "Although such carriers are hurting, they're hurting less than their network brethren."
Despite their need to cut costs, the full-service airlines will not necessarily sit by and watch the low-cost carriers steal their passengers. When JetBlue moved into Long Beach, American Airlines began haggling with the city to expand its slots beyond four. It received an additional four slots, which it can hold until January, and it began advertising cheap flights between New York and Long Beach.
"We know that the low-cost competitors are out there, and in these times perhaps they do have an advantage in certain marketplaces," said Marty Heires, a spokesman for American. "But we are not about to relinquish market share. We have shown in the past that we can respond."
American's largest rival, United, is fighting bigger battles. Many Wall Street firms downgraded its stock and credit ratings yesterday after it said on Wednesday that it might file for bankruptcy protection, though the stock ended the day up 25 cents, at $2.70. Executives began putting together a restructuring plan to present to its unions, and the carrier sent an e-mail message to members of its frequent-flier program saying that it will honor their miles on "a safe and reliable airline."

HEADLINE: After the Bubble: Are Low Rates Enough? 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
"While bubbles that burst are scarcely benign, the consequences need not be catastrophic for the economy. The bursting of the Japanese bubble a decade ago did not lead immediately to sharp contractions in output or a significant rise in unemployment. Arguably, it was the subsequent failure to address the damage to the financial system in a timely manner that caused Japan's current economic problems. Likewise, while the stock market crash of 1929 was destabilizing, most analysts attribute the Great Depression to ensuing failures of policy." Alan Greenspan, June 1999
 NO economic policy maker has become a star in the way that Alan Greenspan has. The coming year may seal that reputation, or severely damage it. 
 By next summer, we should have a good fix on whether the Federal Reserve was right to ignore the stock market bubble in 1999. Mr. Greenspan could have used his bully pulpit to warn of overinvestment in certain areas of the economy, notably telecommunications. He could have raised margin requirements to make it more expensive to gamble on stock prices.
Instead, he punted, with the assurance that there would be plenty of time to act after the bubble burst. "To spot a bubble in advance requires a judgment that hundreds of thousands of informed investors have it all wrong," he told a Congressional hearing.
The way he saw it, there had been no need for the Depression to follow the 1929 crash, or for Japan to enter its long slump after its bubble burst in 1990. Central banks just had to be willing to act quickly after the bubble did burst. He noted that all worked out well when the Fed eased rates after the 1987 crash.
By this spring, it looked as if Mr. Greenspan had been right. The 2001 recession was among the mildest on record, even with the shock of Sept. 11 superimposed on an economy that was already in decline. Consumers treated layoff announcements as being of little import to them, and lower interest rates kept housing booming.
Then came the Wall Street summer swoon, and with it the realization that the industry most affected by the bubble -- telecommunications -- showed no signs of recovery. WorldCom is not just the latest example of corporate fraud; it is a company that made investments predicated on bubble demand, and then covered up the damage from those investments.
Mr. Greenspan likes to give hints before he changes rates, an inclination that may have prevented a rate cut this week. But if the statistics continue to look bad -- and yesterday's report by the Philadelphia Fed on manufacturing in that region was worse than anyone expected -- then look for a half-point cut next month.
During the great bubble, many feared the effect of stock market losses when the bubble burst. But there was less discussion of the economic effects of what William Dudley, the Goldman, Sachs economist, calls the "tremendous misallocation of capital," and that is what we now confront. Interest rates are low, but credit is tight for companies that need to borrow. Lower rates can stimulate housing, which does not need much help, but cannot prompt capital investment, where demand does not exist.
At best, consumers will keep spending and a sluggish recovery will continue, with a recovering stock market providing reassurance. But there are signs of international weakness and of growing protectionism that can only hurt global output. Mr. Greenspan could use a little help from fiscal policy. Why not make additional tax cuts this year while repealing cuts scheduled for later years?
Mr. Greenspan was correct in concluding that central banks did a poor job after earlier bubbles burst. Now we will see if he was right to assume that post-bubble easing is sufficient this time.

HEADLINE: U.S., Protesting Rights Leader's Sentence, Halts New Aid to Egypt 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
President Bush has warned President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt that the United States will not deliver any new aid to Egypt in protest against the prosecution of a leading human rights activist, the White House said today.
 Mr. Bush's action would curtail only an increase in military and economic aid being sought by Egypt. It would not affect the nearly $2 billion in annual aid that Washington provides to Cairo under the Camp David accords, White House officials said. 
 The move nevertheless highlighted an unusual standoff between the administration and an Arab nation of great strategic importance in American efforts to promote Middle East peace and in any eventual confrontation with Iraq. The administration's stance drew praise from international rights groups and an angry response from Egypt.
In a letter to Mr. Mubarak on Wednesday, Mr. Bush voiced distress over the treatment of the activist, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a sociologist and government critic sentenced last month to seven years in prison for activities that included registering people to vote and supporting the rights of Egyptian minorities.
"President Bush has expressed his concern to President Mubarak," Sean McCormack, a White House spokesman, said today. He declined to provide details of the letter.
"Egypt is a close friend and an important ally," Mr. McCormack said. "The United States will meet its Camp David aid commitments." But, he added, "at this time, we are not contemplating any additional funds beyond that commitment."
Egypt had sought an additional $130 million this year after Congress approved an increase of $200 million for Israel in aid to fight terrorism. Traditionally, the United States has increased aid to Egypt by two-thirds the amount of new funds for Israel. The two nations are the top two recipients of American assistance.
The White House action may be largely symbolic in the near term because Mr. Bush has said that in an effort to curb spending, he will not sign the $5.1 billion package that included the new aid for Israel. 
American diplomats met today with Egyptian officials in Cairo and Washington to reiterate their concerns about Mr. Ibrahim's case, officials said. The letter to Mr. Mubarak -- even though the decision not to approve the larger spending bill had already been made -- demonstrates that the administration was intent on making a point to Cairo.
Even so, Egypt's foreign minister, Ahmed Maher, said the American protest would not influence his country's judicial process. "Egypt does not accept pressure and will not bow to pressure, and everyone knows that," he told reporters.
Hesham El Nakib, a spokesman for the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, denied American allegations that Mr. Ibrahim had been tried for political beliefs and activities that threatened the government.
Mr. Ibrahim, he said, "has been working in Egypt for over 20 years, freely, with no interference, and sometimes he has been critical of the government," adding, "At no point has he been persecuted."
But rights advocates say Mr. Ibrahim, who holds joint Egyptian and American citizenship and is in delicate health, is a target because he has tried to promote democracy in an autocratic country. 
Mr. Bush's action "is especially welcome because aid has never before been tied to the promotion of human rights in the Arab world," said Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director of Human Rights Watch.

HEADLINE: Dell Profits Are Up 11% For Quarter 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
The Dell Computer Corporation, continuing its elbows-out assault on the rest of the computer market, announced yesterday that its second-quarter profits had improved and product shipments had increased at a time when other computer makers are suffering.
 The company, which is the second-largest maker of personal computers, said that it would be making a big push into the markets for computer printers and hand-held devices, and also raised its revenue projections for this quarter. 
 "Clearly, we're winning and gaining market share," Michael S. Dell, the company's chairman and chief executive, said during a conference call. 
The company, which is based in Round Rock, Tex., said its product shipments rose 18 percent worldwide in the quarter that ended Aug. 2, while overall industry volumes declined 4 percent. Sales of powerful servers and workstations increased 20 percent, the company said. 
Second-quarter revenue was $8.5 billion, up 11 percent from the quarter last year. Net income was $501 million, or 19 cents a share, meeting the expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. In the quarter a year ago, Dell reported a loss of 4 cents a share, mainly because of a $742 million charge against earnings for cost-cutting measures like closing factories and cutting jobs. Without the charge, income would have been 16 cents a share in that quarter. Shares of Dell closed at $27.14, down 1 cent, and rose slightly in after-hours trading to $27.63. Mr. Dell said that the computer industry sales could rise in the third quarter, with an eventual snap-back as businesses that have put off computer purchases finally gain the courage to upgrade their aging machines. Mr. Dell predicted that his company would be the biggest winner of the sales surge to come. 
When spending returns after a slump, he said, "I don't think it returns in the same way as before," because companies differentiate themselves through factors like costs and low prices. "The recovery will not lift all boats, equally," he said. "You're seeing Dell clearly differentiate itself here, and that will continue." 
He did not venture a prediction about the larger technology market or the overall economy, saying, "I'm not going to try to compete with economic forecasters."
The company said that whether industry shipments were flat or were slightly higher in the third quarter, the company expected to increase its own sales volumes by 5 percent over the second quarter, with revenue of $8.9 billion. That would be a record for Dell, and constitute an increase of 19 percent from the quarter in the previous year, with earnings per share of 20 to 21 cents.
One industry analyst said that by moving aggressively on so many different fronts was providing Dell with opportunities that competitors did not have. "There are multiple engines of growth, such as the enterprise, storage, servers, services -- as well as geographic opportunities in China, Germany and Japan," said Andrew J. Neff of Bear, Stearns. "From a structural standpoint, it gives Dell opportunities for growth, and a greater probability of hitting that than someone who has only one or two opportunities."
Mr. Dell warned against reading too much into the company's planned move into the market for hand-held devices, saying that it was a relatively small market compared with the enormous and lucrative market for business computing. "The real opportunity is in the enterprise," he said.
The company already sells printers, but recently Hewlett-Packard, its chief PC competitor, said it would no longer supply printers to Dell. Dell, in turn, has said it is seeking partners to manufacture printers. During yesterday's conference call with reporters, Mr. Dell said that printers were a potentially rich market to tap, especially with recurring profits to be made from selling ink cartridges. 
He declined to say when those initiatives would be formally announced, however. "I think you'll be hearing from us later -- it's not the time right now," he said. "Stay tuned."

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Raises for Congress Seem Less Certain 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
There is only one thing members of Congress hate more than voting on giving themselves a raise: voting on giving themselves a raise in an election year when a shaky economy is shrinking the retirement funds of many constituents.
 While the annual cost-of-living increase for representatives and senators next year once appeared to be gliding through, opponents of the raises now say the economic and corporate climate has emboldened them to try to derail the automatic increase of about $5,000 when Congress returns next month. 
 "The idea of an automatic pay raise for members of Congress that they don't have to vote on smells a little like some of the corporate monkey business and games in the corporate world," said Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, who is already something of a Senate outcast for his insistence on changing campaign finance laws. "It is really like a form of cooking the books." 
Leaders of nine conservative, libertarian and liberal interest groups joined Ralph Nader on Wednesday in sending a letter to all senators urging them to reject any increase in their current salary, $150,000.
"There is no shortage of highly qualified candidates willing to run for Congress at the current salary," the letter said. "If senators wish to earn more, they may do so in the private sector."
Votes on pay increases are among the most cringe-inducing decisions faced by any politician. After years of political anguish and public anger over raises, Congress in 1989 constructed an elaborate mechanism to avoid future votes on raising members' pay. An ethics package adopted that year gave lawmakers in both chambers a raise to $125,100, from $89,500, by 1991. Future increases were tied to the Employment Cost Index.
"It was meticulously calculated to grease the skids and make it as easy as possible with little controversy," said Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional Accountability Project, founded by Mr. Nader, and one of the signers of this week's letter protesting the raises. Mr. Ruskin said public opinion surveys had consistently shown that increasing their own pay "may be the single most unpopular thing that members of Congress do."
The sensitivity to the 1989 raise ran so deep that the leaders of both national political parties issued a written pledge to refrain from using the vote as fodder for campaign attack advertisements.
"As the leaders of the political committees, we are well aware of the political dangers that members of Congress might face if this issue were to be misused in the campaigns of 1990," said the letter signed by Ron Brown and Lee Atwater, then the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively.
Mr. Feingold and his allies face a struggle in rescinding the raise. He will have to successfully offer an amendment to block the increase, probably to the Treasury Department's spending bill, something he he has failed in the past to accomplish. It would then have to be accepted in negotiations with the House.
The House last month quickly rebuffed a similar effort by Representative Jim Matheson, Democrat of Utah. After the vote, the majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, chafed at any suggestion that lawmakers should not get their salary adjustment, considering that members of Congress gave up outside speaking fees in exchange for the annual increase. 
"I personally gave up $22,000 a year in outside earnings to have that nominal cost-of-living adjustment," Mr. Armey told reporters.
The raise would apply to more than just members of Congress. Hundreds of judges and senior government executives -- among a total of about 3,300 people -- would get an identical percentage increase, estimated to be 3.3 percent this year.
Senate aides predicted that the effort to thwart the increase would fail, though one conceded it could pick up momentum if opponents of the raise can link it to corporate accountability issues and the economy.
"It is sort of becoming a traditional thing for Senator Feingold to do and a traditional thing for the Senate to reject it," one Senate aide said.
Opponents were able to block raises five times after the automatic increases were adopted in 1989, but the adjustments have become routine in recent years and were accepted the past three years with scant notice.
In their letter, the critics said that members of Congress made almost four times the median income of typical male workers and that this was "an especially improper time for yet another Congressional pay grab."
Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, said, "For them to think they can get away with a raise the way they did in 2001 would be a mistake." 
Mr. Feingold said he believed his cause "is even more compelling this year because we should exercise restraint."
"This is clearly a year when members of Congress should not be getting a pay raise," he said.
He said that he expected to anger his colleagues by trying to force them into a vote and that the resentment over this issue was more pronounced than the hostility over campaign finance changes. That was about campaign accounts, this is about bank accounts. 
"This is one where I pick up some real anger," he said. "It is not a fun moment, but it has to done."

HEADLINE: A New Downtown: More Ideas Wanted 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New Designs for a New Downtown" (editorial, Aug. 15) said that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's new design competition was "not entirely welcomed" by our firm, Beyer Blinder Belle. In fact, we responded to news of the initiative by saying, "We strongly support inviting the best architects and planners from around the world to contribute to the planning study." 
 We ask only that the public understand what "planning" means: the relationships among terrain, infrastructure, building mass, building use and open space. The six initial proposals were not architectural designs per se, but rather studies of these basic issues. Their value lay in prompting a lively discussion. 
 The Port Authority and development corporation are on the proper path, toward a memorial and a redeveloped site that will reflect the enormity of Sept. 11, but still allow for a rebirth of the Lower Manhattan economy.
Taking seriously the views of the public and bringing in additional architects and planners will increase the range of options and lead to the goal we all seek: a dignified, striking memorial and a rebuilding plan worthy of our great city.

Nasdaq Decides to Quit Its Joint Trading Venture in Japan

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Plagued by the slump in stocks here and by a host of regulatory and market frustrations, Nasdaq said today that it would pull out of Nasdaq Japan, its joint venture stock market here, on Oct. 15.
 The American parent, which owns 43 percent of Nasdaq Japan, said earlier this month that it had written off its entire $20 million investment in the venture. Softbank, the Japanese technology conglomerate, also owns 43 percent; it said the breakup of the venture would have minimal effects on its balance sheet. The remaining 14 percent is owned by 13 brokerage houses, including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers. 
 The breakup of Nasdaq Japan leaves the country with two markets for smaller-company stocks -- the Jasdaq over-the-counter trading system, operated by the Japan Securities Dealers Association, and Mothers, operated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The 98 companies whose shares now trade on Nasdaq Japan can retain listings on the Osaka Securities Exchange, which provided the operational base for Nasdaq Japan, or apply for listings elsewhere.
Nasdaq Japan began operating in June 2000 as a home for young, high-growth companies, and was seen as a crucial link in Nasdaq's ambition for a 24-hour global equity market. But it opened its doors just as investors' taste for risky stocks was evaporating. It lost 2.8 billion yen ($24 million) last year, mainly because of the dearth of initial public offerings. Since April, trading volume has fallen by half, and only four listings have been added.
"A review of our strategic options going forward led us to the conclusion that due to economic and market conditions, this was the only option remaining," said Richard G. Ketchum, the president of Nasdaq and a director of Nasdaq Japan.
The venture also had trouble persuading the Osaka exchange to adopt Nasdaq's computerized market-making systems and to introduce investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds.
Some prominent companies, including local subsidiaries of E*Trade and Starbucks, listed their shares on Nasdaq Japan, but many others went to its rivals. Nasdaq Japan reportedly held talks with Jasdaq about a combination, but they went nowhere.
"Nasdaq came in at the top of the bubble and paid a price for it," said Fiachra MacCana, an equity strategist at West LB Securities in Tokyo. "Nasdaq never had the credibility and longevity to put down deep roots, so the fact that it is no longer functioning should not hurt that much."

The Man Who Wrote the Book on Spies

BYLINE:  By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
When James Bond flies into Istanbul in "From Russia With Love" to collect a Russian encryption machine along with an alluring Soviet defector, he is reading Eric Ambler's 1939 spy novel, "A Coffin for Dimitrios." It is an inside joke for Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, since Ambler's book also involved skulduggery in Istanbul. The joke even takes on an edge when Bond later returns to the novel but can't keep his eyes open.
 Bond, though, may not have gotten his license to kill without Ambler's influence. And though Bond became an absurdly glorified figure, the spy according to Ambler has far more relevance to contemporary debates about espionage. 
 Until recently, for example, the United States has been on a campaign to eliminate Bondlike swashbuckling from its cloak-and-dagger activities. Embarrassed over grotesque excesses and catastrophic failures, the country yearned for a kind of "clean" espionage. No action would be taken that might seem too seamy and no source used that might cause embarrassment. Espionage would take on the trappings of law enforcement. But since last September, it has become more urgent to worry about intelligence's failures than about its excesses. Effectiveness can now seem more urgent than transparency. Intelligence has been spooked. 
But espionage, with its lies and deceit, is no easy undertaking in an open society. And here, Ambler might be called in for a consultation. Born in 1909, he was trained as an engineer, worked as an advertising copywriter and at one time aspired to be a playwright. He thrust his hapless heroes -- teachers, engineers and writers -- into a world of political intrigue. During the years before the Second World War, Ambler helped create the image of the modern spy. He was hailed by Graham Greene as "our greatest thriller writer"; films have been made from his books (most famously "Topkapi"); he also wrote screenplays to movies like "The Guns of Navarone" and was nominated for an Oscar for "The Cruel Sea." 
Yet by his death, in 1998, Ambler was eclipsed and his works out of print. Now, on the spy-novel right, Robert Ludlum and Tom Clancy celebrate the superhuman agent and his equipment. On the spy-novel left, John le Carre evokes a world riddled with moral ambiguity. As for Ambler's 1930's universe, with its train compartments and border crossings, Comintern agents and Fascist sympathizers, that is the terrain of Alan Furst. 
Now, though, Vintage Books is bringing Ambler back. Four early novels are available -- "Background to Danger" "A Coffin for Dimitrios," "Epitaph for a Spy," and "Cause for Alarm." In December will come "Journey to Fear" and "Judgment on Deltchev." At least four others will follow. 
These are novels of education. The protagonist typically thinks of himself as a highly subtle reader of personality and motive -- and then gets everything wrong. In Ambler's classic "Dimitrios," Charles Latimer, a political economist who has left academic life to write murder mysteries, ends up knowing little about either political economy or murder. That confusion extends to moral issues as well. In "Cause for Alarm," a British engineer works for a munitions firm in Fascist Italy, blind to ethical complications until he is lured into an even more lurid series of compromises. 
The pioneering British spy thrillers like John Buchan's "Thirty-Nine Steps" (1915) and Erskine Childers's "Riddle of the Sands" (1903) treated espionage as war fought by other means. With Ambler, war might be seen as espionage fought by other means. Everything in Ambler's world is a reflection of secret forces. The master spy peers under the superstructure and reads the essences of things. The education of the Ambler hero is an induction into that netherworld.
But the contrast between Ambler's strategic and literary subtleties and his Crayola outline of the netherworld could not be more jarring. In "Background to Danger" assassinations are planned in the board room of the megacorporation Pan-Eurasian Petroleum. The villain in "Dimitrios" sits on the board of the Eurasian Credit Trust, a bank with tentacles grasping all over prewar Europe. 
Ambler once said that during the 1930's he was a "very far left wing socialist" and "ready for the barricades." The hero of two novels is actually a Soviet agent who refers to the "so-called democracies France and England" and argues that the regnant authorities had become "the Stock Exchange Yearbook and Hitler's 'Mein Kampf.' " So while novelistically the books try to evoke ambiguity and explore the dangers of misinterpretation, ideologically a rigid and distorted grid is imposed. For Ambler, the essential battles of 1930's Europe are between fascistic capitalism and Soviet socialism.
Ambler's celebration of the Soviet agent, of course, has had little shelf life. Another rigid grid later developed for the espionage novels of the cold war. But many aspects of Ambler's early vision persist. Corporate evil is a recurrent theme in spy fiction and film and so, too, is a sense of systemic corruption. Many of Mr. le Carre's books suggest, for example, that when you penetrate to the essences, nothing is fully revealed. Espionage doesn't disclose the truth, it perpetrates illusion; the battles it fights are often unnecessary, the results of delusion. 
But in Ambler's later novels, these ideas are overturned in intriguing ways. Ambler's 1951 "Judgment on Deltchev" (available in an audio version from Blackstone Audiobooks) reveals just how drastically the world had changed for Ambler during the Second World War. In a fictional Eastern European country, the once-allied anti-Fascist fighters and Communist ideologues are split apart, leading to a Stalinist show trial of one of the country's beloved leaders. 
Ambler's novel could have been a portrait of bleak tyranny and trumped-up charges -- the kind of story his protagonist, a British playwright commissioned to observe the trial, believes he will write. But the playwright soon finds that matters are more complicated -- that there are degrees of guilt and tyranny. Distinctions matter: the West is not like the East. There are battles that must be fought, but all other choices are inherently flawed. Every decision requires compromise and sacrifice. Something similar is revealed in "State of Siege" (1956) in its account of an Islamic coup in a Far Eastern country. 
Ambler, in other words, began to wrestle with the shadow-world of realpolitik. In one of his best works, "Doctor Frigo" (1974), with its climactic coup in a "coffee republic" in Central America, the bourgeois protagonist can barely make sense of the betrayals, the poverty, the manipulations, the corruption. "As a keeper of secrets I have been a failure," he confesses, "and as a man of action ineffectual." But there is no doubt that if change ever takes place, it will be up to the keepers of secrets and the men of action. 
These postwar books carve out their own space in the world of espionage fiction, and it is not a comfortable one. The essence of things is that there are uncertainties and fallibilities and venalities, shades of gray and even black. But there is no way to avoid choosing, and every choice matters. 
It may be that this is where things stand in contemporary life, with a guarantee of complications and traumas yet to come. The spy must come back into the cold.

 CORRECTION:
The picture caption with the Connections column in Arts & Ideas on Saturday, about the novelist Eric Ambler, misstated the subject of the film "Topkapi" and the Ambler novel "The Light of Day," on which it was based. They were about thieves, not spies.
The Connections column in Arts & Ideas on Aug. 17 about the novelist Eric Ambler included a film credit for him erroneously. The screenplay for "The Guns of Navarone," based on the novel of the same name by Alistair MacLean, was written by Carl Foreman, not by Ambler.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Mixed, but Dow and S.&P. Maintain 4-Week Run

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday but the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index still managed to finish higher for the fourth consecutive week.
 That four-week run is the first for the S.& P. 500 index since May 2001 and the first for the Dow since March. While the week's gain for the Dow was only 0.4 percent, the S.& P. 500 was up 2.2 percent. The runs for both gauges may give investors more hope that the bottom of the market, which hit a five-year low in July, might have been reached. 
 "My sense is that people are feeling a little bit better," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, a money management firm in Overland Park, Kan. But, he added, "I think we're up four weeks in a row mostly because the previous four weeks were so horrendous."
Only the Nasdaq composite index managed to climb higher yesterday, rising 1.2 percent. Both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 were down a fraction of a percentage point. The mixed performance came in the face of some disappointing news: consumer confidence fell in August and housing starts slipped last month. The bond market also sold off sharply, pushing interest rates higher.
There was some positive news on inflation, however, with the Consumer Price Index for July up only 0.1 percent.
At the close, the Dow was down 40.08 points, or 0.5 percent, at 8,778.06, while the S.& P. 500 index had fallen 1.48 points, or 0.2 percent, to 928.77. The Nasdaq rose 16 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,361.01.
The Nasdaq climbed 4.2 percent in the week. It was up 4.7 percent the previous week but had declined 14.7 percent in the five weeks before that. Applied Materials, Nextel Communications and Oracle led the Nasdaq yesterday.
In the bond market, prices fell as yields, which move in the opposite direction from price, rose. The downbeat news on housing and consumer confidence, combined with the upbeat inflation data, would normally be positive for bonds. But the market has had a huge rally since the beginning of June. And on Wednesday, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note plunged briefly below 4 percent, the lowest yield on a note with 10 years to maturity since 1963.
So with stocks appearing to have found a bottom, investors began to wonder how much farther the bond rally could go. The selling that resulted pushed the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note up to 4.33 percent yesterday, from 4.18 percent on Thursday, as the price fell 1 4/32, to 100 13/32. It was the first time since the beginning of July that the yield on the 10-year note was up for the week. The yield was 4.26 percent a week ago.
Even if the 10-year Treasury yield does not fall much more, it has pushed mortgage interest rates to or near record lows. That decline has helped support consumer spending by encouraging mortgage refinancing, which lowers monthly payments and can provide homeowners with extra cash. Federal Reserve officials may be waiting to see how this interest rate decline affects the economy before deciding to cut rates again.
The initial reading of consumer confidence for August fell to a nine-month low of 87.9, according to the University of Michigan. That was down from 88.1 in July and below the Wall Street consensus forecast of 89.
Housing starts fell for the second consecutive month, with a decline in July of 2.7 percent, to an annual rate of 1.649 million.
But some investors may see a positive in some of this bad news. If the economy continues to be weak -- but does not fall into a steep decline -- investors could see another short-term interest rate cut from the Fed without the negative effect that a sharp decline in economic growth would have on corporate earnings.
At an annual rate, consumer prices are up 2.5 percent through the first seven months of the year, compared with an increase of 1.6 percent for all of 2001. Much of the difference, however, is in energy prices, which are up 14.5 percent at an annual rate so far this year after falling 13 percent last year.
The restrained rise in inflation would make it easier for Fed policy makers to cut interest rates because they would not have to worry much about the inflation fallout.
Mr. Herrmann of Waddell & Reed says he thinks the Fed will cut interest rates. But he does not think the stock market is ready to move decisively higher, in part because top corporate executives have not begun to talk enough about a turnaround. "I don't see the spark that gives us some upside," he said.
